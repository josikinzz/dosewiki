## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as gamma amino acids and derivatives. These are amino acids having a (-NH2) group attached to the gamma carbon atom.

### Background

Pregabalin is structurally similar to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) - an inhibitory neurotransmitter.
13
It may be used to manage neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, and fibromyalgia among other conditions.
20
Although as per the FDA Label the mechanism of action has not been definitively characterized, there is evidence that pregabalin exerts its effects by binding to the α2δ subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels.
20
,
22
Pregabalin is marketed by Pfizer under the trade name Lyrica and Lyrica Cr (extended release).
21
,
22
It may have dependence liability if misused but the risk appears to be highest in patients with current or past substance use disorders.
4

### Indication

Pregabalin is indicated for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury, and as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older.
22

### Pharmacodynamics

Although the structure of pregabalin is similar to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), it does not bind to GABA receptors.
6
,
20
Instead, it binds the alpha2-delta subunit of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system.
6
,
20
Pregabalin does not modulate dopamine receptors, serotonin receptors, opiate receptors, sodium channels or cyclooxygenase activity.
20

### Mechanism of Action

Voltage-dependent calcium channel subunit alpha-2/delta-1
Modulator

### Absorption

After oral dosing administered in the fasted state, pregabalin absorption is rapid, and extensive.
8
Pregabalin oral bioavailability is reported to be ≥90% regardless of the dose.
8
Cmax is attained within 1.5 hours after single or multiple doses, and steady state is attained within 24-48 hours with repeated administration.
8
,
22
Both Cmax and AUC appear to be dose proportional.
8
Food decreases the rate of pregabalin absorption and as a result, lowers the Cmax by an estimated 25-30% and increases the Tmax to approximately 3 hours.
22
However, the effect of food does not appear to impact the total absorption of pregabalin in a way that is clinically relevant. As a result, pregabalin can be administered with or without food.
22

### Metabolism

Less than 2% of pregabalin is metabolized and it is excreted virtually unchanged in the urine.

### Half-life

The elimination half life of pregabalin is 6.3 hours.
22

### Toxicity

In a systematic review that included 38 randomized controlled trials, there were 20 identified adverse effects that were significantly associated with pregabalin, most of which involve the central nervous system and cognition.  The identified adverse effects include vertigo, dizziness, balance disorder, incoordination, ataxia, blurred vision, diplopia, amblyopia, somnolence, confusional state, tremor, disturbance in attention, abnormal thinking, asthenia, fatigue, euphoria, edema, peripheral edema, dry mouth, and constipation
14
.
The most common symptoms of pregabalin toxicity (dose range includes 800 mg/day and single doses up to 11,500 mg) include somnolence, confusion, restlessness, agitation, depression, affective disorder and seizures.
23
Since there is no antidote for pregabalin overdose, patients should receive general supportive care. If appropriate, gastric lavage or emesis may help eliminate unabsorbed pregabalin (healthcare providers should take standard precautions to maintain the airway).
23
Pregabalin pharmacokinetic properties suggest that extra-corporeal elimination methods including haemodialysis, may be useful in situations of severe toxicity.
19
However, there are cases where patients have presented with very high serum levels of pregabalin and have been successfully managed with supportive care alone.
19

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The therapeutic efficacy of 1,2-Benzodiazepine can be increased when used in combination with Pregabalin.
Abacavir
Pregabalin may decrease the excretion rate of Abacavir which could result in a higher serum level.
Acarbose
The risk or severity of hypoglycemia can be increased when Pregabalin is combined with Acarbose.
Acebutolol
Pregabalin may increase the bradycardic activities of Acebutolol.
Aceclofenac
Aceclofenac may decrease the excretion rate of Pregabalin which could result in a higher serum level.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol. Alcohol may increase CNS effects.
Take with or without food. Food alters drug absorption, but not to a clinically significant extent.

### Mechanism of action

Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, studies involving structurally related drugs suggest that presynaptic binding of pregabalin to voltage-gated calcium channels is key to the antiseizure and antinociceptive effects observed in animal models.
22
By binding presynaptically to the alpha2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system, pregabalin modulates the release of several excitatory neurotransmitters including glutamate, substance-P, norepinephrine, and calcitonin gene related peptide.
6
In addition, pregabalin prevents the alpha2-delta subunit from being trafficked from the dorsal root ganglia to the spinal dorsal horn, which may also contribute to the mechanism of action.
15
Although pregabalin is a structural derivative of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), it does not bind directly to GABA or benzodiazepine receptors.

### Volume of distribution

After oral administration of pregabalin, the reported apparent volume of distribution is roughly 0.5 L/kg.
22
Although pregabalin is not very lipophilic, it is able to cross the blood brain barrier(BBB).
16
System L transporters facilitate the transport of large amino acids across the BBB and it has been confirmed that pregabalin is a substrate.
22
,
16
This information suggests that system L transporters are responsible for pregabalin uptake into the BBB.
16
In rat models, pregabalin has been shown to cross the placenta.
22

### Protein binding

Pregabalin is not plasma protein bound.
8
,
22

### Route of elimination

Pregabalin is almost exclusively eliminated in the urine.
17
,
18
Further, based on preclinical studies, pregabalin does not appear to undergo racemization to the R enantiomer in the body.
11

### Clearance

In young healthy subjects the mean renal clearance is estimated to be 67.0 to 80.9 mL mL/min.
22
Given pregabalin's lack of plasma protein binding, this clearance rate suggests that renal tubular reabsorption is involved.

### General Function

The heterodimer with SLC3A2 functions as a sodium-independent, high-affinity transporter that mediates uptake of large neutral amino acids such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, histidine, methionine, tryptophan, valine, isoleucine and alanine (PubMed:10049700, PubMed:10574970, PubMed:11557028, PubMed:11564694, PubMed:12117417, PubMed:12225859, PubMed:15769744, PubMed:18262359, PubMed:25998567, PubMed:30867591, PubMed:9751058). The heterodimer with SLC3A2 mediates the uptake of L-DOPA (By similarity). Functions as an amino acid exchanger (PubMed:11557028, PubMed:12117417, PubMed:12225859, PubMed:30867591). May play a role in the transport of L-DOPA across the blood-brain barrier (By similarity). May act as the major transporter of tyrosine in fibroblasts (Probable). May mediate blood-to-retina L-leucine transport across the inner blood-retinal barrier (By similarity). Can mediate the transport of thyroid hormones diiodothyronine (T2), triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) across the cell membrane (PubMed:11564694). When associated with LAPTM4B, the heterodimer formed by SLC3A2 and SLC7A5 is recruited to lysosomes to promote leucine uptake into these organelles, and thereby mediates mTORC1 activation (PubMed:25998567). Involved in the uptake of toxic methylmercury (MeHg) when administered as the L-cysteine or D,L-homocysteine complexes (PubMed:12117417). Involved in the cellular activity of small molecular weight nitrosothiols, via the stereoselective transport of L-nitrosocysteine (L-CNSO) across the membrane (PubMed:15769744)

## Subjective Experience

First synthesized in 1990, pregabalin appeared on the market as a prescription drug
under the brand name lyrica in 2005. It is used to treat a variety of ailments,
including anxiety and pain.

Descriptions of its psychoactive effects vary somewhat. Whilst it is commonly
classified as an anxiolytic, a sedative and a relaxant, I have sometimes seen
references to hypnotic properties, and occasionally I have encountered suggestions
that it can induce euphoria. Despite the US government currently regarding it as
having a low potential for abuse (Schedule V), it is clear that this is a serious
recreational drug.

Regarding dosage, my initial inclination was to go for 450mg, but I subsequently
found too many forum posts stating that sub-300mg doses were more than
sufficient. [e.g. “150mg gives me a nice little high while 300mg gets me crazy high”
~Silenced, Bluelight.org]. I found these hard to ignore.

Given that pregabalin was developed as a successor to gabapentin my expectations
today are not great. I tested the latter a few weeks ago, and found it to be generally
relaxing and calming but without anything in the way of uplift. I am also feeling a
little washed-out and tired, which won't help matters.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I swallow a single 300mg capsule with a glass of water [2.00pm]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 Anxiolytic effects have emerged in the form of a comfort bubble, and a
heady sense of well being. As I am not “crazy high” I pop another 300mg, to
hopefully intensify proceedings.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:30 This is undeniably a nice benzo-like vibe, with a touch of inebriation. I
feel warm and contented, with the headspace flowing here and there under a
gentle dreamy sedation.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:00 At this point I am heavily inebriated and groggy. The dreamy
headspace now carries a hint of nausea and some dizziness, to the extent that I
lie on my bed for 15 minutes. This is rapidly becoming very uncomfortable and
is definitely not pleasant. I soon hit the bed for a second time.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+ 4:30 The second recovery nap turned into a deep two hour sleep. I awoke
feeling horrible: dizzy, groggy, and unable to function properly. I staggered to
the bathroom, and then downstairs, trying to avoid contact with anyone.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I place my head on my arms, lean forward and rest on the desk. I occasionally
manage to lift myself up and struggle to type some words. Incredibly I am
barely able to function. This is an awful experience and I wonder how much
longer it will last. My fingers are trembling and I feel dreadful.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
To be in a public place in this state would be a nightmare. I would have to
slump somewhere, appearing as a severely intoxicated drunk.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I totally underestimated this drug. I am basically zombified and largely
mistuned to what is going on around me, which appears to be distant. My
hands are numb and I am, essentially, stupefied, with head spinning.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
My efforts to browse the Internet for more information on pregabalin fail
miserably: I am simply not capable. The excessive inebriation is way past the
point of serious discomfort. Yes, I desperately want this to stop.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+5:30 Somehow I have just about managed to eat a pizza, which I ate almost
mechanically to avoid making too much of a mess. This was a real challenge,
but I got through it courtesy of the motivating thought that a bit of food might
bring the unwanted-high down faster.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
There is no doubt that any effort to hide my intoxicated state in a social
scenario would still fail badly.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+6:00 I finally feel slightly less out of it, and I can just about type these notes
without recovery breaks. It is far from easy, but I am able to sit up in my chair
again without hunching forwards. Gradually I am integrating back into the
normality around me.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+7:00 I am very much coming down; thank goodness. The dizzy inebriation
can now be forced into the background with relative ease. I am quite stable
again as I walk around, although I still feel generally woozy and not fully
tuned back in to my surroundings, which have an unreal edge to them.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+7:30 I note that time seems to have passed rather quickly. This has been an
extremely long ride in terms of the continued psychoactivity of this drug, but
it doesn’t seem like it. It has now evolved into a mild queasiness about the
head and some disorientation, both physical and mental.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Throughout this, anxieties and worries have been generally absent. I might
add though that there was a degree of anxiety at the peak in terms of the
experience itself: this was worry about when I would recover and if I was
actually okay. Yes, it was that intense.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The inebriated headiness is now mild but is constantly present, and at times it
can still be sickly and nauseous. I believe that I could now pass as sober again
in a complex social situation, but I would have to concentrate to do so.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+8:00 The intensity continues to wind down, albeit very slowly. I am
astonished that it hit so hard and I feel a significant degree of relief.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+8:30 At 10:30pm I am closing in on my usual bedtime. I expect a difficult
night’s sleep, not on the basis of the current effects of the drug, but because I
slept for over two hours from 4pm.
\`\`\`

Despite several wake-ups with a dry mouth, the night’s sleep wasn’t too bad. The next
morning, however, I was still not fully with it and although I wasn’t ill, I was not
particularly well. I felt like I had a hangover but without the headache, and I was
occasionally slightly dizzy and a tad nauseous. A sea-sickness-like feeling lingered for
most of the day.

This one was a shock. I clearly took far too much and paid a price in terms of a strong
intoxication which at times was extremely uncomfortable. I found myself struggling
for some hours, hoping that the ride would wind down and end. Clearly a dose of
300mg or less would have been more than adequate.

Although this was a bad experience, it was an instructive one, from which the lessons
are self-evident. If you use this drug be very careful with the dose, and of course don’t
make a habit of it. It can bite, and not in a pleasant way.

PREGABALIN ADDENDUM
Subsequent to this experience I took the trouble to further investigate the track
record of this drug. What I found was alarming. Despite having only appeared
relatively recently, the rate of fatality associated with its use was on a steep upward
trajectory.

The following graph illustrates the number of cases in which pregabalin was
mentioned on death certificates in England & Wales for the period to the end of 2017:

[Source: Office for National Statistics ( ONS), UK]

The message could hardly be more obvious, and it re-enforces my words above. This
is a serious drug and should not be underestimated.

**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or other [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Pregabalin** (also known as **3-isobutyl GABA** and by the trade-name **Lyrica** ) is a [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) substance of the [gabapentinoid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoid) class. Pregabalin is a common prescription drug, which is typically used to treat neuropathic pain, [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [restless leg syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Restless_leg_syndrome) , and as an adjunct drug in the treatment of [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) .

Pregabalin has a pharmacological profile comparable to that of [gabapentin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentin) as they both share similar mechanisms of action and induce similar subjective effects. The advantages pregabalin has over gabapentin include greater bioavailability and potency, as well as a wider variety of accepted medical applications for pregabalin not seen with gabapentin, such as its successful use in the treatment of anxiety, in which the use of gabapentin was not successful, excluding some more severe cases.

## Chemistry

Pregabalin is a structural analog of [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) (gamma-aminobutyric acid), with an isobutyl group substituted on the beta carbon of the aminobutyric chain. Pregabalin is similar in structure to other [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoid) , such as [gabapentin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentin) and [phenibut](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenibut) . Pregabalin contains a carboxylated chain of hexane called hexanoic acid. This carbon chain is substituted with an amine group through a methyl bridge in (S) conformation at R 3 and a methyl group at R 5 .

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacological action of pregabalin is mediated by binding to the α2δ-1 site of voltage-gated calcium channels. This site has also been referred to as the gabapentin receptor, as it is the target of the related substance [gabapentin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentin) (also developed by Pfizer). Advantages to pregabalin over gabapentin include higher bioavailability and potency.

Although pregabalin is a chemical derivative of [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) , it displays no activity at any GABA receptors, including GABA A , GABA B and the [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) site. Pregabalin, despite its GABA backbone, does not appear to alter GABA levels in the brain, so its pharmacological activity is presumed to be unrelated to GABA. Instead, it is its binding to the α2δ-1 site of voltage-gated calcium channels which appears to be the source of its subjective effects. By binding to this site, pregabalin reduces the release of several excitatory neurotransmitters, including [glutamate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Glutamate) , [substance P](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substance_P) , [acetylcholine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acetylcholine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) .

Reduction in the release of glutamate and acetylcholine might be the cause of dissociative / deliriant like effects in high doses. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

One study has also shown that pregabalin promotes deep sleep, thus enhancing sleep quality. This may be substantial because reductions in slow-wave sleep have been associated with anxiety and fibromyalgia. Also, an independent action of the gabapentin site on the neurogenesis of excitatory synapses has been discovered. The endogenous neurochemical thrombospondin also binds to this site and is important for the generation of new excitatory synapses. Gabapentin and pregabalin, having a high affinity for this site, block this action and result in lower levels of excitatory synapses in animal models.

As pregabalin treats conditions and [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) associated with overexcitability of the brain (anxiety, epilepsy, neuropathic pain), its modulation results in the [sedating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedating) (or [calming](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) ) effects of pregabalin on the nervous system. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

### Pharmacokinetics

Pregabalin is rapidly absorbed when administered on an empty stomach, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 1 to 1.5 hours. Pregabalin oral bioavailability is estimated to be greater than or equal to 90%. The rate of pregabalin absorption is decreased when given with food, resulting in delay of approximately 3 hours to reach peak plasma concentrations, with peak levels themselves, decreased by about 25 to 30%. Administration with food, however, has no clinically significant effect on the extent of absorption.

Pregabalin undergoes negligible metabolism in humans. In experiments using nuclear medicine techniques, it was revealed that approximately 98% of the radioactivity recovered in the urine was unchanged pregabalin. The primary metabolite is N-methyl pregabalin.

Pregabalin is eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal excretion as unchanged substance. The elimination half life is 6.3 hours.

## Subjective effects

Each individual can have a very different reaction to pregabalin, thus it is essential to start at lower doses to ensure that it does not have any severe adverse effects such as peripheral edema or muscle pain. ***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** & **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - Pregabalin produces mild sedation and improves sleep onset latency modestly. Several studies have shown pregabalin improves sleep quality of those who take it for various indications. It is unknown if this effect is carried over to those who take it recreationally. However, it is not an overly sedating substance when taken in the daytime.
- **[Appetite enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_enhancement)** - This effect is not particularly prominent, but is reported to occur in some people. It can have a synergistic effect when combined with [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) .
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)** - Pregabalin is effective against certain types of chronic pain, particularly neuropathic pain, but not against acute pain.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The general "body high" of pregabalin can be described as a sharp, pleasurable tingling sensation which is location specific to the hands, feet, and head.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - This component, while prominent in the experience, is generally not as strong as the cognitive euphoria that can be induced. The sensation itself can be described as feelings of physical comfort, warmth and bliss.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - Although the user’s body may feel numb, the sense of touch can be heightened at the same time.
- **[Muscle twitching](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_twitching)** - Somewhat paradoxically, since pregabalin is used as an adjunct treatment for epilepsy, pregabalin, especially in higher doses, can produce muscle spasms. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Anecdotally, seizures have been reported in overdose. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)** - While pregabalin may cause respiratory depression, this effect is not as strong as those with [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) and [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) .
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)** - While the muscle relaxation experienced on pregabalin is not as powerful as that of [diazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diazepam) or other [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , it is still prominent.
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)** - This effect is fairly prevalent at higher doses.
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)** - At very high doses, some users report feeling lighter.
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** *or* **[Decreased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_libido)**
- **[Orgasm depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orgasm_depression)** - Some may experience a delayed but stronger orgasm even if they experience an increase in libido.
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)** - This effect is commonly reported by users.
- **[Frequent urination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frequent_urination)**
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)** - At higher doses this effect resembles that of [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) and [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) . Users report stumbling and bumping in to walls.
- **[Tactile suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression)** - This effect can result in the whole body feeling numb, particularly one’s face. At the same time the user’s sense of touch can be enhanced.
- **[Seizure suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure_suppression)** - Pregabalin is effective at reducing certain types of seizures such as focal seizures and partial seizures.
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)** ### Visual effects
 
- - **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)** - At high dosages, pregabalin can induce slightly blurred vision.
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)** - This effect can be seen at high doses and is generally quite mild. It generally does not extend past level 2.
- **[Depth perception distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depth_perception_distortions)** - This effect is quite mild and only appears at very high doses.
- **[Object alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Object_alteration)** - Although this effect is rare, it can still occur spontaneously, typically with heavy doses.
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)**
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)** and * **[Frame rate suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frame_rate_suppression)** at high / very high doses. These 2 effects together can make your vision feel more 'slow'.
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)** - This effect is quite mild and inconsistently appears at high doses.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
While pregabalin isn't commonly thought off as a hallucinogenic drug, it still can cause dissociative and even psychotic like effects at higher doses. Sleep deprivation and genetics might play a role into the hallucinatory states of Pregabalin. Pregabalin's hallucinatory states are (but not limited to) :
 
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** - At high dosages, one may experience dream-like states and [hypnagogia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnagogia) .
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** - This effect is rare and only occurs on heavy doses and/or when the user is sleep deprived. This effect can be delirious / psychotic in nature. It can include : [Object activation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Object_activation) , [Shadow people](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Shadow_people) and [Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations) . It may include even non existent people and animals from a distance, but once the user comes closer they may disappear. ### Disconnective effects
 
- - **[Visual disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection)** - This effect is generally quite mild and appears inconsistently at high doses. It results in feeling as if one's sense of vision is distant or vague and being viewed through a screen or window. However, pregabalin is rarely reported to cause [holes, spaces and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Holes,_spaces_and_voids) or [hallucinatory structures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Structures) . ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of pregabalin can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. Pregabalin's headspace is comparable to a more clear-headed [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) intoxication, although it can take a more [dissociative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) turn at high dosages. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)**
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - Pregabalin presents distinct [entactogen/empathogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) effects. In contrast to [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) (which merely increase sociability through [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) ), at high dosages pregabalin directly increases the urge to communicate with others with feelings of empathy, love, closeness and connection being well-defined. These effects, although weaker than that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , are still prominent.
- **[Ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Suggestibility enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Suggestibility_enhancement)**
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)** - Compared to [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , pregabalin is only mildly amnesiac if not combined with other depressants. With chronic usage or high dosages, one should expect more "tip of the tongue" moments and impaired short-term memory (e.g., walking into a room and forgetting what you were supposed to do there). Total blackouts do not seem to occur except in combination with other substances.
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - Many users who take pregabalin describe a moderate to even intense euphoria, even at lower doses. Many users describe it as similar to [opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) induced euphoria. The sensation itself can be described as powerful and overwhelming feelings of emotional bliss, contentment, and happiness.

## Medical uses

Pregabalin is used in a medical setting, usually prescribed in capsules, to treat epilepsy, neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and generalized anxiety disorder. Its use for epilepsy is as an add-on therapy for partial seizures with or without secondary generalization in adults. Some off-label uses of pregabalin include restless leg syndrome, prevention of migraines, social anxiety disorder, and alcohol withdrawal.

### Seizure Prevention

Pregabalin is useful when added to other treatments, when those other treatments are not controlling partial epilepsy. Its use alone is less effective than some other seizure medications. It is unclear how it compares to gabapentin for this use. Pregabalin has also been shown to be effective against alcohol withdrawal induced seizures .

### Neuropathic pain

The European Federation of Neurological Societies recommends pregabalin as a first line agent for the treatment of pain associated with diabetic neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, and central neuropathic pain. A minority obtain substantial benefit, and a larger number obtain moderate benefit. Other first line agents, including gabapentin and tricyclic antidepressants, are given equal weight as first line agents, and unlike pregabalin, are available as less expensive generics.

### Anxiety disorders

The World Federation of Biological Psychiatry recommends pregabalin as one of several first line agents for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, but recommends other agents such as SSRIs as first line treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. It appears to have anxiolytic effects similar to benzodiazepines with less risk of dependence.

The effects of pregabalin appear after 1 week of use and is similar in effectiveness to lorazepam, alprazolam, and venlafaxine, but pregabalin has demonstrated superiority by producing more consistent therapeutic effects for psychosomatic anxiety symptoms. Long-term trials have shown continued effectiveness without the development of tolerance, and, in addition, unlike benzodiazepines, it has a beneficial effect on sleep and sleep architecture, characterized by the enhancement of slow-wave sleep. It produces less severe cognitive and psychomotor impairment compared to those drugs and may be preferred over the benzodiazepines for these reasons.

### Substance disorders

#### Opioids

Anecdotal reports exist of successful discontinuation of opioid use by supplementing with pregabalin.

#### Tobacco

One placebo-controlled four-day trial (n=24 completed) investigated the effects of pregabalin on smoking cessation in non-treatment-seeking smokers. This study did not find any statistically significant effect on smoking behavior, although pregabalin reduced some withdrawal symptoms: anxiety, irritability, and frustration. Pregabalin also reduced the measure of subjective "liking" after smoking a cigarette.

#### Alcohol

A meta-review of five studies concerning the use of pregabalin in treating alcoholism or alcohol withdrawal found positive results for relapse prevention in sober patients at dosages of 150-450 mg/day, but conflicting results for the treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal. Two of the studies concerned the only maintenance of abstinence. Both showed positive results. In one of them (n=59), pregabalin compared favorably to naltrexone on the measure of days abstinent from any amount of alcohol.

#### Benzodiazepines

One open-label pilot study of 15 individuals with high-dose [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) dependence reported that all subjects have successfully discontinued benzodiazepines within 14 weeks, while taking supplemental doses of 225-900mg pregabalin/day. The patients also showed reduced anxiety levels and better cognitive functioning. Pregabalin was well tolerated.

## Toxicity and harm potential

Pregabalin likely has a low toxicity relative to dose. However, it is potentially [lethal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) when mixed with [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) like [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) .

### Seizure Risk

Pregabalin has been shown to induce and or increase the risk of seizures at recreational dosages. There is little evidence showing there is a concern at medical dosages (600mg and under). This risk may be increased when mixed with other drugs that lower seizure threshold. Caution is recommended when using doses of higher than 600mg. Reducing various susceptibility factors may also be beneficial in lowering this risk. Susceptibility factors may include things such as low sodium, lack of sleep, and intensive physical activity.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Lethal dosage

The [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) for rodents has been established to be greater than 5000mg/kg. Rat IV LD50 was also determined to be greater than 300mg/kg.

In terms of humans, there exists a case report of a man who ingested 8,400mg pregabalin and eventually fell into a coma but was managed with supportive care alone until he regained consciousness. For comparison, the maximum recommended a therapeutic dose of pregabalin is 600mg/day. Pfizer's official package insert for Lyrica states that the highest accidental ingestion of pregabalin during clinical trials was 8 g, with no significant consequences.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Pregabalin was initially thought to be non-addictive with a low abuse potential and little tolerance development. However, recreational use of the substance has caused a re-evaluation of this assessment. The euphoric effects of the substance and the development of tolerance can lead to the use of dosages far above the therapeutic range, which suggests both the potential for recreational use and addiction.

Tolerance will develop to the depressant effects within several months of continuous use. After cessation, the tolerance returns to baseline in 7 - 14 days. Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms are likely to occur after ceasing usage abruptly following a few months or longer of steady dosing and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction.

The withdrawal effects of abrupt cessation of chronic use include anxiety, insomnia, sweating, muscle spasms, gastrointestinal problems, hot and cold flashes, nausea, and a flu-like feeling.

### Interactions

One report of a patient entering serotonin syndrome following perioperative Oxycodone and pregabalin exists. However, several studies have failed to find any serotonergic effect whatsoever from pregabalin. One paper states, "Although pregabalin is a structural analog of GABA, it has no clinically significant effects at GABA-A or GABA-B receptors, and it is not converted metabolically into GABA or a GABA agonist. Pregabalin is not a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and does not act as a glutamate receptor antagonist." A more recent study writes that "Pregabalin has no involvement with serotonin and dopamine receptors and does not inhibit dopamine, serotonin, or noradrenaline reuptake." Pregabalin's main mechanism of action is binding and blocking sub receptor on Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels, leading to a downstream reduction of overactive neurons.

If pregabalin has [serotonergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) effects, it could interact negatively with other serotonergic substances, including SSRIs, MDMA, various analgesics, and possibly other recreational and medical substances. Given the total lack of evidence for any serotonergic activity in multiple studies, it seems possible that the one reported adverse event was a freak accident, caused by unknown factors.

## Legal status

Pregabalin is regulated as a prescription drug in most countries.

- **Germany:** Pregabalin is a prescription medicine, according to Anlage 1 AMVV.
- **Norway:** Pregabalin is in prescription schedule B alongside most benzodiazepines and painkillers. It was rescheduled to schedule B from the less restrictive schedule C because of reported recreational use, tolerance development and addiction.
- **Sweden:** Pregabalin is a prescription drug. classified as a controlled substance, as a schedule V drug, since 24 july 2018
- **Switzerland:** Pregabalin is listed as a "Abgabekategorie B" pharmaceutical, which requires a prescription. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Turkey** : Pregabalin is a 'green prescription' only substance and illegal when sold or possessed without a prescription. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **United Kingdom:** The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 makes it illegal to possess the drug without a prescription and, for such purposes, it is classified as a Class C drug.
- **United States:** Pregabalin is in Schedule V, indicating "low potential for abuse." For comparison, benzodiazepines are in Schedule IV.

Pregabalin (Lyrica) is a medication in the gabapentinoid class. It has anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and analgesic properties. As such, it’s used for epilepsy, neuropathic pain, anxiety, and other conditions.

Despite being a GABA derivative, it doesn’t appear to be operating through a GABA-related mechanism.

The substance is also used recreationally due to its euphoric, anxiolytic, and pro-social effects.

---

Pregabalin = Lyrica; (S)-3-isobutyl-GABA

PubChem: 5486971

Molecular formula: C8H17NO2

Molecular weight: 159.229 g/mol

IUPAC: (3S)-3-(aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid

---

## Dose

#### Medical

Range: 150 – 600 mg/d

Typically it’s started at ~150 mg/d (split into multiple doses) and that dose increases weekly until an ideal response is achieved.

#### Non-medical

Light: 150 – 300 mg

Common: 300 – 600 mg

Strong: 600 – 900 mg

While some people report using over 1 gram, it’s not a great idea. We know less about its safety at that dose and the severity of negatives is known to increase.

---

## Timeline

#### Oral

Total: 6 – 10 hours (though some effects can persist for another 5 hours)

Onset: 30 – 60 minutes

Even though the onset should be under an hour, a lot of people in recreational settings report a delay. The effects could take 1.5 – 2.5 hours to really become apparent.

## Effects

#### Medical

It’s primarily used for neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, seizures, and anxiety. Though it does have other applications.

Some of the reasons for its widespread use are its fast onset of efficacy, low drug-drug interaction potential, and its relatively high safety level.

Along with helping people’s core condition (e.g. neuropathic pain), it can improve secondary insomnia and anxiety.

There have been criticisms of its widespread use, however. Part of the critique comes from those who are worried about its abuse potential.

**Seizures**

Pregabalin is mainly used as an adjunct therapy for partial seizures, meaning it’s given to people who aren’t receiving adequate benefit from their existing medications.

Studies have found it can reduce the frequency of partial seizures, particularly at 300 – 600 mg/d. According to (Kalviainen, 2008), it may aggravate myoclonus and myoclonic seizures, so it should be avoided in those populations.

Compared to other adjunct treatments, it might be superior to gabapentin and is similar in efficacy to levetiracetam.

As a monotherapy, it may be inferior to lamotrigine and topiramate.

Reviews

(Zhou, 2012) – Reviewing its use as a monotherapy

- Only two short-term studies available with 753 total participants, one comparing it to lamotrigine and one to gabapentin. 
- Both dealt with partial seizures: one for newly diagnosed partial seizures (vs lamotrigine) and one for refractory partial epilepsy in hospitalized patients (vs gabapentin.)
- Pregabalin was found to be inferior to lamotrigine in terms of efficacy, as measured by time to withdrawal due to inadequate seizure control following dose stabilization.
- No significant differences in terms of safety-related outcomes; similar tolerability across medications.
- Pregabalin appeared to be superior to gabapentin.
- The clinical disadvantage of pregabalin vs. lamotrigine was higher in Asia than in North America, so ethnic differences should be investigated.

(Pulman, 2014) – Cochrane review of its efficacy as an adjunct partial epilepsy treatment

- Six industry-sponsored studies with 2009 participants were available.
- Dose: Ranging from 50 mg/d to 600 mg/d
- Primary outcomes 
- 50% or greater seizure reduction was significantly more likely with pregabalin vs. placebo.
- And there appeared to be a dose-response, with the odds of response doubling from 300 mg/d to 600 mg/d
- Significantly associated with seizure freedom.
- Adverse: Ataxia, dizziness, drowsiness, and weight gain.
- Evidence had a low/unclear risk of bias due to potential publication bias.
- Quality of evidence was moderate.

Studies

(Zaccara, 2014) – Comparing pregabalin to levetiracetam as an adjunct treatment

- Across 71 centers in Western and Eastern Europe, South and Central America, and Asia.
- Design: Randomized, double-blind, flexible-dose, two-arm, parallel-group, noninferiority 
- 6-week baseline screening phase
- 4-week dose-escalation phase
- 12-week maintenance phase
- Patients entered the trial with stable doses of 1 or 2 other medications 
- They had a minimum of 4 partial seizures during the 6-week baseline phase and no 28-day period without seizures.
- Results 
- 509 randomized: pregabalin (254) and levetiracetam (255) 
- Of these, completion of maintenance phase was 81.9% for pregabalin and 82.4% for levetiracetam
- Most common other medications: carbazepine, valproic acid, topiramate, oxcarbazepine
 
- Median dose: 450 mg/d for pregabalin and 2000 mg/d for levetiracetam
- Primary endpoint of 50%+ reduction in 28-day seizure rate from baseline to end of maintenance phase 
- 59.1% for pregabalin and 58.8% for levetiracetam
- Pregabalin wasn’t inferior to levetiracetam
- Secondary endpoint of seizure-free for the final 28 days of the maintenance phase 
- Lower in pregabalin group (19.9%) than levetiracetam (27.6%); non-significant difference
- Post hoc analysis of seizure-free for duration of maintenance phase 
- Lower in pregabalin group (8.4%) than levetiracetam (16.2%); significant difference
- Safety 
- Most common adverse effect was drowsiness: 31.1% with pregabalin vs. 28.6% with levetiracetam
- Dizziness more common in pregabalin: 22% vs. 15.3%
- Weight gain more common in pregabalin: 9.4% vs. 2.0%
- Nausea more common in levetiracetam: 1.2% for pregabalin and 5.9% for levetiracetam
- Discontinuations were more common in the dose escalation period with pregabalin and more common during maintenance with levetiracetam. 
- Could be from early drowsiness/dizziness occurring with pregabalin, while slower onset mood changes could be a problem with levetiracetam.
- COI: YES; sponsored by Pfizer

Animal research

- Maximal electroshock test in rats: ED50 of 1.8 mg/kg (oral) 
- Estimated Cmax of 1.6 ug/mL, which is within the therapeutic range seen in humans.
- It’s been shown to be effective against partial seizures & generalized tonic-clonic seizures. 
- But not against absence seizures.
- Maximal electroshock studies in mice: Prevented tonic extensor seizures
- Prevents generalized tonic-clonic seizures induced by sound in DBA/2 mice.
- Prevents threshold clonic seizures induced by chemical convulsants like pentylenetetrazol.

**Neuropathic pain**

Pregabalin is effective for certain kinds of neuropathic pain, including postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, and central neuropathic pain. A lack of impact was found on HIV-associated neuropathy.

The most reliable benefits are seen with 200 – 600 mg/d.

Compared to gabapentin, there’s at least a trend towards superior responses with pregabalin.

Reviews

(D’Arcy, 2017)

- Meta-analysis of 25 pregabalin studies; found 18 were positive based on their primary endpoint. 
- The overall NNT for all trials was 7.7.
- The meta-analysis gave the drug a GRADE rating of “strong” and proposed it as a first-line therapy for neuropathic pain.
- Pain relief tends to be dose-dependent, with 600 mg/d offering more than 300 mg/d.
- Literature supports pregabalin improving sleep secondary to the primary endpoint, but it’s not approved for insomnia specifically.
- Onset 
- Typically there are benefits within 1 week, but those who achieve a 30 or 50% reduction in pain do so within 3-4 weeks, though that could be partly due to the starting weekly dose being just 150 mg/d.
- COI: Sponsored by Pfizer

(Wiffen, 2016) – Cochrane review of its use in neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia

- Currently, evidence exists in support of pregabalin being helpful in diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, central neuropathic pain, and fibromyalgia.
- Only a minority of people achieved acceptably good pain relief with pregabalin, but it can be helpful.

**Fibromyalgia**

It appears effective at improving pain and sleep in fibromyalgia, with a potentially less reliable or significant impact on fatigue. (Crofford, 2005) report it could improve sleep and pain.

Reviews

(Lyseng-Williamson, 2008)

- Efficacy 
- Generally associated with significant pain improvements, particularly at 450 and 600 mg/day, but it can also be effective at 300 mg/day.
- Some trials have found it’s significantly better at a higher, but not lower dose. And some results have shown 450 mg/d is effective, but not 300 mg/d or 600 mg/d.
- When improvement is seen, it’s typically sustained for months and even longer.
- Changes in pain scores are correlated with improvements in sleep quality and, to a lesser extent, with improved fatigue. 
- There’s little correlation with mood, anxiety, and/or depressive symptoms.
- Secondary endpoints 
- Associated with improvements in sleep at 300, 450, and 600 mg. 
- Though it also comes with significantly greater drowsiness.
- Tolerability 
- Over 5% of patients experience (with a rate at least 2-fold that in placebo): dizziness, drowsiness, weight gain, blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, peripheral edema, euphoria, increased appetite, attention disruption, and balance disorder. 
- Based on three multicenter trials of 8, 13, and 14 weeks in US, the top rates were: 
- Dizziness: 38% vs. 9%
- Drowsiness: 20% vs. 4%
- Weight gain: 11% vs. 2%
- Blurred vision: 8% vs 1%
- Adverse events led to discontinuation of treatment in 19% of pregabalin patients and 10% of placebo across multiple US short-term trials.
- Adverse events are more common with higher doses and are sometimes only transient.
- Dizziness and drowsiness lead to ~6% and 3% discontinuation, respectively, compared with under 1% in placebo.
- Weight gain 
- 11% vs 2% for having a greater than 7% increase in weight.
- Sometimes associated with elevated creatine kinase levels, decreased platelet count, and prolonged PR intervals.
- Has been connected to angioedema and hypersensitivity, which should lead to discontinuation.
- COI: None

**Generalized anxiety disorder**

Research has found it’s more effective than placebo, but it’s not yet clear if it should be a first-line treatment. When it works, it has a relatively fast onset of efficacy and a similar level of impact on psychic and somatic symptoms.

Some studies have found benzodiazepines aren’t really superior to a higher dose of pregabalin and that it also comes close to SSRIs/SNRIs. While other research has found a pretty small clinical effect on certain scales.

It’s approved in Europe, but not the US, for this condition.

There are some patients who benefit from pregabalin while being resistent to other treatments.

Reviews

(Wensel, 2012)

- 8 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies
- 6/8 were short-term (4 – 8 weeks)
- 5/8 also had active control: lorazepam, alprazolam, or venlafaxine.
- Dose: Ranged from 150 mg/d to 600 mg/d
- Results 
- Pregabalin patients experienced significantly higher HAM-A declines 
- Mean range of 9.24 – 14.7 for pregabalin vs. 6.82 to 11.7 with placebo.
- Significant benefits could arrive within a week.
- Response was generally comparable to the active comparators.
- 3/8 trials showed non-significant benefits for somatic symptoms, while psychic subscale was non-significant in just 1 trial (with 150 mg/d)
- Clinical response (50% decline from baseline) was achieved less often 
- 47% – 61% rate with pregabalin vs. 34% – 44% with placebo.
- At times, this was significant, other times it was non-significant.
- No clear dose-dependency 
- E.g. One non-significant trial with 600 mg/d yielded a 59% response with pregabalin vs. 44% with placebo
- But another significant trial with 600 mg/d yielded 53% with pregabalin vs. 34% with placebo.
- Adverse 
- Mainly drowsiness, dizziness, and dry mouth. — Could be better tolerated by some than SSRIs/SNRIs.
- Long-term efficacy evaluated in 1 study 
- Up to 6 months evaluated
- 624 initial participants receiving 450 mg/d for 8 weeks
- Patients entered double blind 24-week phase if they had a clinical HAM-A response at or below 11
- 168 patients than received 450 mg/d still, while 170 received placebo
- Pregabalin significantly delayed the onset of relapse vs. placebo
- At 6 months: 
- 42% pregabalin relapsed vs. 65% with placebo.
- Pregabalin patients had a HAM-A of 7.2 vs. 11.8 with placebo.
- Small, but significant difference also seen with CGI-Severity scale.
- COI: None

(Baldwin, 2013)

- 6 fixed dose studies of 4-6 weeks; 2 flexible dose 8-week studies incl. one in elderly patients; single 6-month fixed dose relapse prevention study
- Based on the available data, there is evidence supporting pregabalin’s ability to acutely treat GAD and prevent relapse. 
- Though an analysis of controlled trials found an overall mean effect size of 0.39, which is small.
- Some data also supported its use vs. placebo in reducing anxiety in patients prior to undergoing dental or orthopedic procedures, generally with an onset of effect within a few hours.
- Post-hoc analysis indicates that response to pregabalin within 2 weeks is associated with a 5.3-fold odds ratio of responding to treatment; while just one quarter of patients with no onset by the second week will have a response by study endpoint.
- Generally no evidence for dose-response so far, with the exception being that 150 mg may not be as effective as 200 to 600 mg.
- Associated with significant reduction in sleep disturbance with 300 to 600 mg/d.
- It may also reduce depressive symptoms in those with comorbid depression.
- Most adverse effects have an onset of under 1 week; they decline generally within 3 weeks
- COI: None

(Montgomery, 2006)

- Efficacy 
- Onset 
- The greatest reason for continued benzodiazepine use for GAD appears to be its favorable onset period (~1 week) vs SSRIs/SNRIs. 
- With pregabalin, the onset is also around 1 week.
- Pregabalin (300, 450, and 600 mg) offers similar improvements by Week 1 to alprazolam.
- Offers greater improvement than venlafaxine at Week 1
- Psychic and somatic improvements 
- Offers significant and basically equivalent efficacy for psychic and somatic symptoms.
- Significant improvement in HAM-A anxious mood/worry and HAM-A tension, with the majority of patients showing 50%+ reduction in severity of both symptoms at 4-6 weeks.
- Subgroups 
- Elderly 
- Appears just as effective up to 8 weeks.
- Illness severity 
- 300-600 mg appears effective in both moderate and severe groups without a dose-response effect.
- In fact, 150 mg was effective in severe patients but not moderate.
- Concomitant subsyndromic depression 
- HAM-D scores improved significantly at 150-600 mg, though 300+ mg is most reliably effective at reducing moderate depressive symptoms.
- Insomnia 
- Improves sleep scores.
- VS other medications 
- Reduces psychic GAD symptoms similarly to SSRIs/SNRIs and greater than benzodiazepines.
- Reduces somatic GAD symptoms greater than SSRIs/SNRIs.
- Safety 
- Lab/ECG/other 
- Doesn’t appear to be associated with clinically significant HR, BP, respiration, or ECG changes.
- Just a nonsignificant PR interval increase of 3-6 ms at 300 to 600 mg/d.
- Peripheral edema seen in around 1.9%, but only severe in around 0.1% and not associated with impaired hepatic or renal function, or weight, BP, HR, or ECG changes.
- Withdrawal 
- In rats, discontinuing supratherapeutic doses only led to mild behavioral withdrawal signs.
- In humans, a long-term GAD trial of 32 weeks showed that rapid discontinuation led to minimal-to-no withdrawal signs (PWC only increased 3 points.) 
- Whereas withdrawal symptoms are clear with benzodiazepines with rapid discontinuation (PWC increase of 24 points)
- COI: YES; consultant for companies

**Postoperative pain**

Variable effects of pregabalin have been seen on postoperative pain. It might be able to reduce opioid use and pain, but more research is needed. Even when it does offer some level of change, it might not be clinically significant.

Given it can raise the chance of some side effects (e.g. sedation), it may or may not be useful. Certain populations, like the elderly, may be better off avoiding it.

Some reports suggest it can reduce the risk of nausea and vomiting.

Positive reports exist for its administration prior to tonsillectomy, nasal surgery, and lumbar spinal surgery.

Reviews

(Zhang, 2011)

- 11 randomized, controlled clinical trials with 899 patients (521 receiving pregabalin)
- Data didn’t reliably shown a significant decline in pain scores, though it did seem to reduce opioid use. 
- No significant difference in pain scores at 2 hours or 24 hours.
- Some studies showed a significant analgesic effect, but not an overall strong one.
- It reduces postoperative vomiting, though it came with a higher rate of visual disturbance.
- COI: None

Studies

(Bekawi, 2014) – Positive results

- 90 people across three groups undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy 
- Pregabalin 
- 150 mg – 2 hours before surgery & 12 hours after operations & twice daily for 2 days.
- Gabapentin 
- 1200 mg – 2 hours before surgery & 12 hours after operation & 400 mg three times daily for 2 days
- Control
- Results 
- VAS pain scores 
- Not significantly different between groups. All had a significant decline in VAS scores over time.

- Satisfaction 
- Overall patient satisfaction with pain management was significantly higher in the pregabalin vs. gabapentin or control groups.
- COI: None

#### Chronic postoperative pain

There’s even less evidence in favor of it being able to reduce chronic postoperative pain, yet there’s been some interest in using it for that reason. Some unpublished data from Pfizer was negative for that indication.

One investigation found pregabalin wasn’t effective, while ketamine was.

**Pain**

No real evidence exists that supports pregabalin as a go-to medication for acute pain. Other pain-related uses may exist.

Reviews

(Gurusamy, 2016) – Cochrane review of its use in pancreatic pain from chronic pancreatitis

- Only one study, funded by Pfizer, was available.
- 64 total participants: 34 with pregabalin and 30 with placebo
- Low risk of bias; quality of evidence was low to moderate
- Found pregabalin offered a reduction in pain scores and opioid use vs. placebo.
- Though there were also more adverse events.

**Social anxiety**

Like with GAD, 150 mg doesn’t appear very effective, but 300 – 600 mg/d might be effective.

Studies

(Pande, 2004)

- Double-blind, placebo-controlled at 6 US centers
- 47 with pregabalin 600 mg/d, 42 with pregabalin 150 mg/d, and 46 with placebo
- Results 
- 600 mg/d led to Significantly greater baseline to endpoint LSAS total reduction vs. placebo 
- 150 mg/d wasn’t significant
- Response began at 1 week for LSAS and lasted throughout study.
- At 600 mg/d, patients reported significantly less fear, avoidance, social fear, and social avoidance.
- Higher rate of response with pregabalin.
- Also HAM-A benefits, but the change wasn’t significant.
- Most common negatives: headache, dizziness, and drowsiness.
- 8 had one or more sexual adverse effects 
- With pregabalin: decreased libido, anorgasmia, impotence, and delayed ejaculation.
- Weight gain 
- 600 mg/kg: Mean of 1.7 kg
- 150 mg/kg: Mean of 0.6 kg
- Placebo: Mean of 0.1 kg loss
- COI: Yes; supported by Parke-Davis

**Insomnia**

It often has a positive impact on sleep across conditions.

Both healthy and treatment populations have reported improved sleep from the substance.

It can increase slow-wave sleep, improve sleep maintenance, reduce Stage 1 sleep, and potentially improve sleep onset. Though it does reduce REM.

Reviews

(Roth, 2013)

- Investigated the impact of pregabalin on sleep in partial epilepsy, neuropathic pain, restless leg syndrome, and fibromyalgia.
- Results 
- It consistently improved patient-reported sleep quality in a dose-related manner, with the main exception being with mixed reports for partial seizures.
- Benefits were usually sustained.
- Could improve wake time after sleep onset, the number of awakenings, and time spent in slow-wave sleep. 
- It also decreased Stage 1 sleep.
- Decreased latency to sleep onset can be seen, but the greatest impact of pregabalin is on sleep maintenance.
- It therefore improves maintenance and the “depth” of sleep. 
- Supported by patient reports and PSG readings.
- Benefit could come from direct pro-sleep effect and from reducing the symptoms of the primary condition.
- COI: Yes. Funding from companies & employees of Pfizer.

**PTSD**

Very little research exists other than a little bit of evidence in favor of its use as an adjunct therapy.

Studies

(Pae, 2009) – Open-label trial for accident-related PTSD

- 9 participants with chronic PTSD
- Other therapy was continued without dose change.
- Dosing 
- Began at 75 mg/d and flexibly titrated upwards or downward
- Maximal target dose of 450 mg/d
- Results 
- Results 
- Did have some encouraging results.
- Week 2 
- No statistical improvement on SPRINT, PGI-S, VAS-pain, MADRS, or SDS.
- Week 4 
- Statistically significant reductions in SPRINT, PGI-S, VAS-pain, MADRS, and SDS.
- Week 6 
- Statistically significant reductions in SPRINT, PGI-S, VAS-pain, MADRS, and SDS
- 5/9 patients had a greater than 50% decline on PGI-S
- 6/9 patients had a greater than 50% decline on VAS-pain 
- Though not that level of effect for other measures.
- Tolerability 
- Well-tolerated, negatives declined within 2 weeks, and no severe adverse effects.
- COI: Yes.

**Other anxiety**

Studies

(Nutt, 2009) – Showing an impact from a single dose on dental procedure anxiety

- 89 participants: 27 in pregabalin (150 mg), 31 in alprazolam (0.5 mg), and 31 in placebo.
- Subjects in pregabalin group had a more chronic history of dental anxiety, though overall severity of dental anxiety (by history) was similar between groups. 
- Baseline VAS-Anxiety scores were higher in the pregabalin group compared with alprazolam.
- Results 
- VAS-anxiety 
- Pregabalin led to a reduction in anxiety, though not significant vs. placebo.
- Whereas alprazolam led to significant VAS-anxiety decline from 2.5 hours postdose to 4 hours postdose.
- TOAS 
- Pregabalin led to greater improvement in anxiety vs. placebo, showing trend towards significance at 2.5 h, and then achieving significance from 3 h to 4 h.
- Alprazolam led to significantly higher TOAS scores vs. placebo at all assessment points from 2 h to 4 h.
- TOAS (proportion of responders) 
- At 2 hours, the proportion showing response was significantly higher with alprazolam vs. placebo, but not significantly higher with pregabalin.
- Pregabalin led to significantly higher VAS-Sedation scores from 2.5 h to 4h vs placebo.
- Interpretation 
- Results show some anxiolytic action from a single dose, though it’s less significant than with alprazolam. 
- And alprazolam may offer a faster onset.
- COI: Yes; funding by Pfizer.

**Drug dependence and/or addiction**

Research and anecdotal reports suggest pregabalin can reduce the withdrawal symptoms and craving associated with certain drug dependencies. It’s specifically been evaluated for opioid, alcohol, and benzodiazepine dependence.

In informal settings, a lot of opioid users find it’s helpful at alleviating withdrawal symptoms.

Reviews

(Oulis, 2012) – Use for alcohol and benzodiazepine dependence

- Overall, we need more research. But current findings suggest 150-600 mg/d might be a safe option for treating dependence to alcohol and benzodiazepines.
- Alcohol 
- Some preclinical animal studies have found it can reduce operant conditioning with alcohol and reduce alcohol drinking.
- It also reduced behavioral and seizure symptoms during alcohol withdrawal in animals.
- Human studies 
- Four pieces of research from an Italian group found preliminary evidence that it may help in the treatment of alcohol dependence by reducing craving and reducing withdrawal symptoms.
- However, other studies, including a double-blind placebo-controlled one in 41 in-patients found it didn’t outperform placebo in terms of anti-withdrawal effects.
- Benzodiazepine 
- Similar situation to alcohol; there have been results showing statistically significant benefits of pregabalin in reducing somatic and psychic anxiety, severity of withdrawal symptoms, and patient and clinician-rated assessments of global improvement.
- But more research is needed.
- COI: None

(Freynhagen, 2016) – Reviewing role in multiple drug dependencies

- Opioid withdrawal symptoms 
- Case report evidence 
- (Scanlon, 2014) reported successful detox in opioid-dependent individual after 6 days of pregabalin 300 mg.

- (Kammerer, 2012) reported successful use of pregabalin in someone who failed replacement therapy with buprenorphine for heroin dependence. 
- Heroin intake and withdrawal symptoms were ameliorated with pregabalin for 2-3 days at 300 mg/d.
- (Kontoangelos, 2013) reported on a patient using codeine and fentanyl for pain. 
- Pregabalin began at 75 mg/d and increased over 2 weeks to 300 mg/d while withdrawing from codeine and fentanyl.
- Pain symptoms progressively improved during this time and there were no opioid withdrawal symptoms
- Preclinical 
- (Hasanein, 2014) Rats made opioid dependent show dose-dependent reduction of naloxone-induced withdrawal symptoms in the presence of pregabalin.
- Benzodiazepines and zolpidem 
- Uncontrolled, observational 
- (Bobes, 2012) pregabalin at a mean of 315 mg/d by Week 12 was found to significantly reduce benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. 
- Anxiety symptoms improved 69% and tolerability rated at 80-90%.
- Pharmacoepidemiological study 
- (Bramness, 2010) Pregabalin use monitored in patients with psychiatric disorders, epilepsy, neuropathic pain, or a non-specified condition. 
- 14.7 – 27.9% stopped using benzodiazepines after starting pregabalin.
- 48% of those with psychiatric conditions reduced benzodiazepine consumption
- Zolpidem prospective open-label trial 
- (Cho, 2014) 40 patients with mean hypnotic use duration of 2.6 years; 75% using zolpidem

**Other**

It could have some efficacy in OCD, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia.

Restless legs syndrome

It was found to offer a similar reduction to a dopamine agonist in the International Restless Leg Syndrome score. But it had a lower improvement on the Periodic Limb Movement Index.

#### Negatives in medical settings

Drowsiness and dizziness are the most common negatives. Both tend to decline over time and are dose-dependent. Other CNS depressants can exacerbate those negatives.

Of all the reasons for discontinuation, drowsiness is one of the most common.

Pregabalin has a similar adverse effect profile to gabapentin, with these being the most common negatives from both: dizziness, drowsiness, ataxia, peripheral edema, dry mouth, fatigue, and blurred vision.

**Weight gain**

A minority of patients will experience a problematic level of weight gain. One review found about 1-in-6 people had a greater than 7% increase in weight after 2 to 12 months of treatment.

**VS other drugs**

Compared to lamotrigine, it’s associated with a higher rate of drowsiness and weight gain.

Compared to gabapentin, there’s no difference for dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, nausea, or ataxia.

**Cognitive and psychomotor**

It doesn’t typically impair daytime functioning, but self-reported concentration and attention difficulties sometimes show up

With up to 450 mg/d, there’s no clear detrimental effect on reaction time, vigilance, or serial memory scanning. Though it may have a small, transient impact on CNS arousal, divided attention, and sedation.

There’s less impact overall than what’s seen with benzodiazepines.

**Reviews**

(Zaccara, 2011)

- 38 studies examined – only double-blind, RCTs
- 11,918 subjects total – 8,235 receiving pregabalin 
- Across neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, epilepsy, GAD, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder.
- Some had flexible dosing, others were fixed.
- Duration of 4-14 weeks.
- Results 
- Some of the adverse effects strongly associated with pregabalin were balance disorder, euphoria, incoordination, ataxia, and edema.
- Very rare severe responses included edema w/ reduced platelet count and hypervolemia, and a separate one with subacute myocardial infarction.
- Dose-response 
- Presenting by 150 mg/d: Dizziness, ataxia, drowsiness, edema, dry mouth
- 300 mg/d: Vertigo, incoordination, blurred vision, ambylopia, confusional state, disturbed attention, thinking abnormal, euphoria, asthenia, peripheral edema, constipation
- 450 mg/d: Balance disorder and fatigue
- 600 mg/d: Diplopia and tremor
- Overall, 20 AEs were significantly associated with pregabalin treatment. 
- 16/20 were cognition/coordination issues
- COI: Yes; speaker or consultant fees.

#### Non-medical

**Positives**

- Euphoria
- Mood lift
- Sedation
- Analgesia
- Muscle relaxation
- Anxiolysis
- Light to moderate entactogen effects (pro-social, greater empathy, greater appreciation)
- Light to moderate dissociation
- Physical euphoria (Pleasant sensations. Feelings of warmth and/or energy. Altered tactile perception.)
- Increased self-confidence
- Calmness

**Negatives**

- Dizziness
- Drowsiness
- Amnesia – [Typically just minor and not prominent at common doses. Actual anterograde amnesia, like is possible with ethanol and benzodiazepines, isn’t a notable effect.]
- Impaired motor control
- Cognitive impairment
- Nausea
- Muscle twitches – [Unclear occurrence. Not really reported in medical settings.]

Even patients using medical doses sometimes report recreational effects like euphoria, slight dissociation, anxiolysis, and mental stimulation. But the full recreational effects are dose-dependent, with common to strong amounts providing the most reliable activity.

It’s clearly a CNS depressant, but that’s not the full story. Many users report a mental stimulation effect, including increased motivation and a desire to work on things. That effect isn’t accompanied by normal stimulant-like physical stimulation. Some people get more done when on the drug.

Unless a very large dose is used, it doesn’t tend to cause overwhelming sedation.

Due to its fairly significant recreational potential, people compare it more to ethanol and GHB than to benzodiazepines.

The dissociative effects aren’t as significant as with real dissociatives. Higher doses are more likely to result in that kind of activity. It can contribute to daydreaming and anxiolysis.

Switching from medical to non-medical use is most common in those with a history of drug addiction.

People also like the drug because it tends to lack negative after effects, instead offering a positive afterglow, albeit with some impaired motor control and sedation.

**Polydrug**

It can potentiate the positives and negatives of opioids, ethanol, and benzodiazepines.

Some people have combined it with psychedelics and MDMA due to the potential for lower anxiety and mood improvement. This is similar to how some people use phenibut.

**Studies**

(Schifano, 2011) – Examining online recreational reports to figure out effects.

- Data from Jan 2008 to Aug 2010
- It was often described positively with effects like: 
- Similar to alcohol/GHB/benzodiazepine and some euphoria.
- Slight entactogen properties (perhaps more on GHB than benzo side).
- DXM-like dissociation
- Reduced withdrawal symptoms from opioids and reduced cravings
- Some described it like an opioid with DXM-like dissociation, and generally said it was better than gabapentin.
- Often people reported using much more than recommended: At least over 600 mg and even over 5 grams.
- Dose-dependent effects 
- 600 mg – Disorientation, slurred speech, double/blurred vision, disinhibition, talkativeness, anxiolysis, and perhaps visual alterations/hallucinations.
- 900 mg – Strong drunkenness feel, difficulty walking, altered color perception, some minor euphoria.
- 1200 mg – Drowsiness, more euphoria, some entactogenic effects.
- 1500 to 5000 mg – Very heavy uncontrollable drowsiness, hallucinations, greater euphoria, quite dissociative, disinhibition, and some potential FOR anxiety.
- Some people dislike anything over 900 mg at once due to strong sedation.

(Schjerning, 2016) – Examining the potential abuse of pregabalin among those with prescriptions in the Netherlands.

- Looking at all Danish users of pregabalin from 2004 to 2013. 
- 80,868 total patients
- Of those, 4090 (9.6%) received over 600 mg/d for 6 months, and 2765 (6.5%) for over 12 months.
- In total, just 276 (0.65%) got over 1200 mg/d for 6 months, and 137 (0.33%) for over 12 months.
- Prescriptions for antipsychotic drugs and benzodiazepines were associated with increased risk of using pregabalin at above-licensed doses.
- This data led to a Lorenz-1 value of 6.1%, which doesn’t indicate very high abuse potential (e.g. little/no abuse drugs like statins are under 5%, while benzos/opioids are typically over 10%)
- At least at a population level (not specifically among those with a history of opioid use), the trend towards abuse doesn’t seem massive.
- COI: YES; research grants and speaking fees.

**Case reports**

(Carrus, 2012) – Two cases of people using it recreationally after receiving a prescription.

## Chemistry & Pharmacology

#### Chemistry

Pregabalin is a member of the gabapentinoid class and a derivative of GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Another top drug in this category is gabapentin.

It’s also known as 3-isobutyl-GABA, specifically the S isomer of that substance.

Compared to GABA, its 3-position substitution allows for high affinity binding at the alpha-2-delta subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels. The same substitution allows for drug transport via LAT (system L), an amino acid transport system. And it gets rid of GABA-A and GABA-B activity.

3-isobutyl-GABA was found to be more potent than other 3-alkyl-GABA substances due to it being a substrate for LAT. This property is hypothetically from a similarity to l-leucine, which is carried into the brain via LAT. L-leucine is 2-isobutyl-glycine.

#### Pharmacology

Despite being a GABA derivative, it lacks GABA-related effects. It’s inactive at GABA-A and GABA-B. It also doesn’t operate through the benzodiazepine site.

Its pharmacology is similar to gabapentin’s, though it’s more potent and has a superior bioavailability.

GABA-B

It didn’t mimic or alter GABA responses with GABA-B receptors in rat hippocampus or recombinant GABA-B receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes.

Preclinical and clinical studies have shown the activity of pregabalin doesn’t match that of GABA-B agonists. Overall, GABA-B receptors don’t play a role in the mechanism of action.

Inactivity with GABA metabolism and transport

Although it may alter glutamate decarboxylase activity, in vitro results indicate this happens with supratherapetic (millimolar) concentrations. This suggests it’s not an important clinical factor.

(Feng, 2001) – Using rat brain microdialysis, the maximum pregabalin concentration after anticonvulsant doses was found to be 10-50 uM. That’s much lower than the dose connected to enzyme-related activity.

(Errante, 2003) – Neither pregabalin nor gabapentin altered GABA concentrations in rat brain tissues.

(Su, 2005) – Didn’t inhibit GABA transport in vitro, unlike tiagabine (a GABA uptake inhibitor).

A potential impact on GABA transport over time

(Whitworth, 2001)

- Possibly increasing distribution of GABA transporter protein to plasma membrane from intracellular space in cultured neurons with prolonged administration of pregabalin. This would lead to enhancement of GABA uptake.

**Primary target: Alpha-2-delta subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels**

While we’re still figuring out the manner by which alpha-2-delta Ca channel inhibition is important, it appears to be the primary target for pregabalin. Along with acutely inhibiting that subunit, it could potentially reduce alpha-2-delta expression over time.

One possible route of effects is through the reduced release of excitatory neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, substance P, and possibly norepinephrine. This would come from reduced influx of calcium at presynaptic neuronal sites.

Its ability to reduce the release of norepinephrine isn’t clear. If it does, it might be secondary to reduced glutamate release. And it may actually increase noradrenergic spinal activity (which would be connected to modulating nociception.)

Along with the aforementioned transmitters, pregabalin could reduce CGRP release, reduce acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, and reduce spinal inhibitory glycine.

Another route involves blocking the action of thrombospondin, a pro-synaptogenic signal operating through alpha-2-delta. That could inhibit excitatory synapse formation.

Distribution

There’s a heterogeneous distribution of the alpha-2-delta subunit throughout the body and the brain. It has a high density in skeletal muscle and the brain, with a low density in the heart, lung, spleen, pancreas, and liver.

Despite binding in non-neuronal tissues like skeletal muscle, pregabalin doesn’t alter muscle contractions from direction stimulation of muscle fibers in vitro (Joshi, 2006). It’s been found to typically lack any notable impact on cardiovascular activity, although some atypical cardiac responses are possible (see: Safety section).

Within the brain, the density is greater in the posterior grey column and in the forebrain, particularly in the superficial layers of the neocortex.

Alpha-2-Delta

Both pregabalin and gabapentin bind specifically to displace labelled gabapentin. Pregabalin has a Ki of 32 nM at recombinant human alpha-2-delta Type 1 proteins (Piechan, 2004).

In mammals, there are at least four related subtypes of the alpha-2-delta protein, each coded by a different gene. Only Types 1 and 2 bind pregabalin with a high affinity.

Binding is similar between alpha-2-delta Type 1 and Type 2 proteins, demonstrating it’s not subtype selective. This makes sense since Types 1 and 2 can be grouped together based on amino acid sequence, while Types 3 and 4 have some differences.

When you use mutations or partial deletions of recombinant alpha-2-delta Type 2 protein, there’s a greatly diminish binding affinity.

In animal models, including the DBA-2 audiogenic seizure model, alpha-2-delta binding is required for efficacy.

Calcium currents

There have been conflicting results regarding its ability to actually reduce neuronal calcium currents. Some studies show a reduction, others don’t.

The difference may come from the expression of the relevant subunits during normal vs. hyperalgesic states. It appears over-expression of the alpha-2-delta subunit could appear when pain is present. Over-expression could also potentially play a role in seizures and even anxiety.

Role for pre-existing disease state

Perhaps there’s a connection between pregabalin’s variable effects in disease/normal states and the NF-kB pathway and inflammation. In vitro studies have found pregabalin can reduce the NF-kB activation caused by substance P.

It’s possible pregabalin is countering activity from NF-kB, which would typically be upregulated in some of the relevant conditions.

Studies

(Lempel, 2016) – Decreases excitability of dentate gyrus and also accelerates the maturation of adult-born granule cells.

- Background 
- Evidence supports two potential pathways in which a2-delta calcium channel binding modulates neuronal function.
- Reduction of VDCC currents, either by direct inhibition of VDCC or by reducing surface expression of VDCC.
- Antagonism of interaction by a2-delta and astrocyte-secreted factor thrombospondin, a pro-synaptogenic signal. 
- Therefore, it could be exerting an anti-synaptogenic effect that may block abnormal synaptic arrangements following pathological situations. 
- Neuropathic pain has indeed been connected to upregulation of a2-delta, thrombospondins, and dorsal horn synaptogenesis.
- Studied using mice.
- Results 
- Chronic pregabalin led to reduced intrinsic excitability of dentate gyrus granule cells (DGGCs), though only significant for GFP+ neurons.
- Also an increase in spontaneous synaptic transmission.
- So, there are two opposing network activity effects.
- But, the number of Arc positive cells in the dentate gyrus was found to be reduced, suggesting chronic treatment leads to overall reduction in dentate gyrus network activity.
- Evidence for acceleration of maturation of adult-born DGGCs, which fits with earlier evidence (Valente, 2012) showing pregabalin increased differentiation of neural progenitors into neurons.

#### Pharmacokinetics

Tmax: 1 – 1.5 hours

Cmax: 9.46 ug/mL from a single 300 mg dose

AUC: 66.3 ug x h/mL from a single 300 mg dose

Steady state: Obtained in 24 – 48 hours

Half-life: 6.3 hours

Pregabalin has nearly complete (~90%) oral absorption with linear kinetics. Studies with healthy volunteers have shown predictable kinetics from 75 to 900 mg with low variability.

Only negligible metabolism exists and the drug is eliminated via the renal system. Over 90% of radiolabelled pregabalin (100 mg) was found to be excreted as unchanged drug, with just 0.9% becoming its major metabolite (N-methylated pregabalin).

Because it doesn’t interact with hepatic enzymes, pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs are largely avoided. This is especially good in populations, like elderly people and epileptics, who may be on multiple medications.

LAT

Like gabapentin, it appears to cross membrane barriers of the gut and BBB via the large amino acid transport system (LAT). That system also transports leucine, isoleucine, and valine.

Pregabalin has been shown to rapidly penetrate the BBB in mice, rats, and monkeys.

However, it appears to also use additional transport systems that allow for more complete non-saturable drug absorption along the small intestine and colon.

In vitro studies suggest pregabalin and gabapentin differ in their uptake by the LAT system in Caco-2 cells. The maximum rate of absorption for pregabalin is about 3-fold higher.

**Other factors**

Food

No interaction in terms of total drug exposure, though it delays the rate of absorption.

With standard and high-fat meals, the Cmax drops by 25 – 31% and the Tmax is pushed back about an hour.

Renal status

AUC and half-life increase with decreasing renal function, so the dose must be adjusted.

Impaired renal function has been associated with an increased risk of adverse effects.

Race

Based on results from patients with pain or epilepsy, there are no racial differences (among Caucasians, blacks, and Hispanics) for the relationship between daily dose and pregabalin exposure.

Gender

When adjusted for gender-related creatinine clearance differences, there’s no difference.

**Drug-drug interactions**

No major drug-drug pharmacokinetic interactions have been identified.

None exist with valproate, phenytoin, lamotrigine, topiramate, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, lorazepam, oxycodone, ethanol, oral contraceptives, or various anticonvulsants.

Gabapentin

Coadministration can reduce pregabalin’s Cmax by 18%. But gabapentin’s pharmacokinetics aren’t affected by pregabalin administration.

**Studies**

(Buvanedran, 2010) – Seeing if it can reach animal analgesic levels acutely in humans

- 9 patients primarily undergoing total knee replacement 
- Mean age: 66.6 years
- Mean weight: 90.1 kg
- Given 300 mg pregabalin 1 hour pre-surgery
- PK plasma 
- Tmax: 2 hours (2 – 6 hour range) though the sampling only began at 2 hours, so it could be earlier
- Cmax: 6.47 ug/mL
- Half-life: 8.51 hours
- PK CSF 
- Tmax: 8 hours (6 – 24 hour range)
- Cmax: 0.41 ug/mL
- Half-life: 21.52 hours
- Interpretation 
- CSF drug concentration lags behind plasma significantly.
- Even within 2 hours, the CSF concentration (0.115 ug/mL) is high enough to fit with the antiseizure dose in rats, which was found to be 0.05 ug/mL after a 6 mg/kg dose.
- By 6 hours after the dose, the human CSF level is high enough (0.359 ug/mL) to reduce CNS hypersensitivity based on data from rats, since that dose involves a rodent concentration of 0.334 ug/mL.
- It appears the max pharmacological effect at the spinal level may be achieved around 8 hours after administration.

## History

#### 1988

Richard Silverman of Northwestern University asked Dr. Ryszard Andruszkiewicz, a visiting scholar from the Technical University of Gdansk, to synthesize a series of 3-alkyl-GABA and 3-alkyl-glutamate analogs. He then wanted to investigate their inhibition of GABA aminotransferase and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD).

Dr. Andruszkiewicz synthesized fourteen 3-alkyl-GABA analogs (incl. four stereoisomers), 4-methyl-GABA, and seven 3-alkyl-glutamate analogs.

An unexpected finding was that none inhibited GAD. Instead, they activated it. This would lead to an increased rate of glutamate -> GABA, a new mechanism of action.

Silverman immediately responded by having them tested for anticonvulsant activity.

#### 1989

An invention disclosure was submitted to the Northwestern University Technology Transfer Program. Companies were contacted about utilizing these new drugs and their unique mechanism of action.

Only two responded positively: Upjohn and Parke-Davis.

Upjohn decided to exclusively test the “best” compound from the series, while Parke-Davis evaluated all of them.

Because of its decision, Upjohn was left testing the R-isomer of 3-methyl-GABA. When tested on mice, it only had weak anticonvulsant properties, so they discontinued their research into the series.

#### 1990

Parke-Davis called Silverman to invite him to a seminar to discuss the drugs further.

It turned out all of the compounds could reduce tonic extensor seizures in mice at 100 mg/kg, but 3-isobutyl-GABA only required 14.4 mg/kg.

The S-isomer of 3-isobutyl-GABA, which would become “pregabalin,” had turned out to be the best anticonvulsant in the series and one of the best Parke-Davis had ever tested.

A license agreement was signed between Warner-Lambert (parent of Parke-Davis) and Northwestern University. A patent was applied for.

#### 1991

Warner-Lambert and Northwestern signed a patent option agreement.

#### 1992

Animal pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies were carried out, followed by two years of toxicology testing at Parke-Davis.

New syntheses were also developed to obtain larger quantities of (S)-3-isobutyl-GABA.

#### 1995

By the end of 1995, an investigational new drug (IND) was filed with the FDA, opening the way for human testing.

Phase 1 clinical trials then took place over a 2.5-year period.

#### 1996

Until (Gee, 1996) we didn’t really understand how gabapentin or pregabalin were functioning. This study found gabapentin was operating as an alpha-2-delta ligand and the same was then confirmed for pregabalin.

Proteins were solubilized from pig brain membranes and the researchers searched for the fraction that retained labelled gabapentin/pregabalin binding. Once a single protein peak was isolated, it was found to be identical to that previously reported for the alpha-2-delta Type 1 subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels.

Initially this discovery was surprising. Previously known anticonvulsant sites included voltage-gated sodium channels, GABA-A receptors, GABA degradative enzymes, and GABA uptake transporters.

Meanwhile, calcium channel blockers discovered before the gabapentinoid class didn’t have useful anticonvulsant properties.

The dihydropyridine Ca channel blockers didn’t have significant anticonvulsant activity.

A peptide toxin (agatoxin IVA) selective for blocking P/Q type neuronal Ca channels had potent anticonvulsant activity when injected directly into the brain of DBA/2 audiogenic mice. But it lacked systemic benefits since it would cause death via respiratory collapse due to blocking neuromuscular transmission.

Another toxin selective for N-type Ca channels, ziconotide or omega-Conotoxin MVIIA, had only minor anticonvulsant actions in DBA/2 mice. And they’d cause severe sympathic block systemically.

Given all of this, voltage-dependent Ca channels weren’t considered a go-to spot for anticonvulsant activity in the 1990s.

#### 2000

Pfizer purchased Warner-Lambert, giving it the exclusive rights to continue developing pregabalin.

#### 1999 – 2003

Parke-Davis/Pfizer completed over 100 Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials with 10,000 patients suffering from epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and generalized anxiety disorder.

#### 2002

Although you would have expected Upjohn to have greatly regretted its decision to only test one member of the series, it was also ultimately acquired by Pfizer.

So, even if Upjohn had been the one pursuing a blockbuster drug, Pfizer could have been the one to end up marketing pregabalin.

#### October 2003

Pfizer filed for a new drug application (NDA) in the US.

#### 2004

It was approved in the EU, initially for neuropathic pain and then as an adjunct therapy for partial seizures.

Pregabalin, under the name Lyrica, entered the European market in September 2004.

#### 2004 – 2005

The FDA approved it December 2004, enabling pregabalin (Lyrica) to enter the US market in September 2005. At the time, it was the first medication approved for both diabetic peripheral neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia.

It was also placed in Schedule 5. Two core reasons were given for the scheduling:

- The number of individuals reporting euphoria was higher with pregabalin vs. placebo.
- A study involving sedative/hypnotic drug users who were given diazepam (30 mg) or pregabalin (450 mg) showed they could yield similar subjective ratings of “good drug effect,” “high,” and “liking.”

Pregabalin avoided Schedule 4 because it didn’t substitute for benzodiazepines in benzodiazepine-dependent animals and because the positive psychological effects tend to decline with continued use.

#### 2000s

Northwestern initially received a royalty of 6% of net sales from pregabalin and a portion of that was shared with Silverman and Andruszkiewicz.

#### 2006

During its first full year of sales, pregabalin obtained “blockbuster drug” status with \$1.2 billion in global sales.

#### 2006

European regulators approved it as a treatment for generalized anxiety disorder.

#### 2007

The FDA approved it for the treatment of fibromyalgia.

#### 2004 – 2013

(Schjerning, 2016) Based on data from Danish nationwide health registries, there was a rise in pregabalin use in Denmark of 7-fold.

#### 2007 – 2013

Northwestern sold the rights to around half of its pregabalin royalties in 2007. It received \$700 million from that deal.

Because the money was invested in the endowment and more money came in, the amount grew to around \$1.4 billion, making it a large contributor to Northwestern’s endowment.

In 2013, it sold an additional portion of its rights to HealthCare Royalty Partners and the Canada Pension Plan for \$290 million.

#### 2010

Pfizer pulled their new drug application for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in the US due to a lack of agreement with the FDA. It was, at the time, considering what’s needed to pursue approval for that condition.

#### 2015

Pfizer generated \$4.8 billion from the drug.

---

## Legal Status

#### US (as of April 2017)

Schedule 5

#### Other countries

Typically it’s a prescription-only substance instead of a controlled drug, though this has different effects in different countries. Often access is restricted, but penalties might not exist for personal possession.

United Kingdom: Schedule 2; Class C

Canada: Prescription-only drug.

Australia: Schedule 4 prescription-only.

Germany: Prescription-only.

## Safety

#### Acute overdose

CNS depressant effects are the most significant elements of an overdose, along with dizziness. When taking more than a gram, you’re likely to experience significant sedation and impaired motor control. Coma is a possibility with certain doses. Cardiac issues are another hypothetical risk.

There’s unclear evidence regarding the potential for respiratory depression. Even in cases with multiple gram overdoses, cardiac and respiratory stability has been present, but the risk shouldn’t be ruled out.

Even very significant overdoses, as long as it’s not combined with other drugs, are unlikely to result in a fatal response. An 8 gram overdose was reported during clinical trials without death or serious adverse effects. Another 8+ gram non-fatal overdose is also described below.

However, there’s still some potential for an acute overdose to be deadly, especially in those with a preexisting cardiovascular issue or impaired renal function.

#### Adverse effects (medical settings)

Most of the adverse effects in medical settings are mild and CNS-related. At doses up to 600 mg/d, the negatives are usually tolerable and the drug has a high safety level.

However, there are rare atypical responses. Among those are some hematological reactions, including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia.

Allergic reactions are also possible, with hypersensitivity skin rashes occurring rarely.

Other rare responses are cardiovascular issues and hepatotoxicity, with the former appearing to be somewhat more common than the latter.

**Cardiovascular issues and heart failure**

There might be a higher rate of cardiovascular issues among pregabalin patients vs. gabapentin patients. There’s a growing number of cases suggestive of a real link.

The difference between pregabalin and gabapentin may have to do with differences in Ca channel antagonism.

It’s been suggested that some of the edema seen with pregabalin could be heart failure-related.

L-type Ca channel blockers can lead to vasodilation of mesenteric resistance arteries. This uncompensated arteriolar vasodilation can lead to intracapillary hydrostatic pressure increase, thereby exuding fluid into the interstitium, causing peripheral edema. A similar situation may rarely occur with pregabalin, but more evidence is needed.

More caution in prescribing and use should exist when someone has a history of renal and/or cardiovascular disease.

Cases

(Page, 2008) – 3 cases suggestive of negative effects in those with heart failure

- Case 1 
- 74-year-old female with nonischemic cardiomyopathy and class 3 heart failure; ejection fraction of 55%
- Stable for 3 months with medications
- Initially received pregabalin 150 mg/d for a pinched nerve
- Over following 3 days: shortness of breath, confusion, and weight gain
- Day 7 of pregabalin: unresponsive and unconscious at home
- Arrived at ED 
- Obtunded, dyspneic, hypotensive, and increased serum creatinine, lower extremity edema.
- Given intubation, IV furosemide, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, and dopamine.
- Pregabalin stopped and symptoms improved.
- Case 2 
- 48-year-old male with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and class 2 heart failure; ejection fraction of 45%
- Stable for 14 months with medications
- Pregabalin 150 mg/d given for chronic neuropathic pain
- 3 days later: fatigue, shortness of breath, peripheral edema, 2.2 kg of weight gain
- Within 1 month of stopping pregabalin: resolution of additional heart failure symptoms and weight gain
- Case 3 
- 61-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy and class 2 heart failure; ejection fraction of 45%
- Stable for 6 months with medication

- Symptoms suggestive of volume overload with a 6 kg weight gain.
- ECG showed worsening left ventricular function and severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
- Pregabalin stopped
- Gabapentin replaced it and no worsening of status was seen.

**Hepatotoxicity**

Some cases exist, but they’re very uncommon. It may be more problematic when there’s preexisting liver injury. So far there’s no good evidence for a dose-dependency.

(Sendra, 2011)

- 59-year-old initially presented to hospital with persistent fever for 3 days 
- He had a history of allogenic transplant 11 months prior.
- Lab data initially showed increased leukocytes, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase 
- And slightly elevated AST and ALT.
- After 6 days of fever with no clinical focus, oral levofloxacin 500 mg was started.
- Patient described neuropathic pain in one foot; received 25 mg pregabalin twice daily
- Four days after starting levofloxacin, the patient had no fever and had clear clinical improvement 
- Antibiotic therapy was continued for another 5 days.
- 14 days after starting pregabalin 
- Reported left ankle edema
- Significant rise in liver enzymes 
- AST – 907
- ALT – 1582
- GGT – 510
- Also higher total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, creatinine, and others.
- Pregabalin was stopped given it was the only fully new medication.
- Decline in liver enzyme levels seen at 2 days post-pregabalin and continued decline by 7 days.
- By a 4-month follow-up 
- Completely normal liver function test results.
- Interpretation 
- Likely an idiosyncratic reaction to pregabalin with potential underlying liver injury as another factor.

(Dogan, 2011)

- 28-year-old female
- Presented with a 3 – 4 day history of jaundice.
- Four months before presentation, was prescribed pregabalin 300 mg/d.
- AST and ALT levels at presentation were 26x above the upper limit and total bilirubin was 16.3 mg/dl.
- Pregabalin stopped after admission because of elevated liver function tests.
- Two months later, all tests were normal.
- Pregabalin was considered the cause, though there were two other instances leading to higher liver enzyme levels 
- Both were courses of IV glucocorticoid pulse. Although the first is known to have increased levels, they were normal again by the second course, so it’s hard to view it as non-pregabalin related.

#### Suicidality

In 2008, the FDA issued a warning that antiepileptics, including pregabalin, may raise the risk of suicide. Although this warning has been criticized and there’s still not a ton of data, it’s worth keeping in mind. The risk of suicidal ideation may be somewhat increased as a result of the substance.

#### Physical dependence & tolerance

Tolerance and withdrawal aren’t major issues with the drug at medical doses. Though a short-term taper is still recommended for patients.

In other settings where the dosing is higher, withdrawal can be quite unpleasant. It can include nausea, insomnia, headache, sweating, diarrhea, anxiety, and a sick flu-like feeling. This kind of withdrawal is easiest to avoid simply by using common doses and not taking it often.

Tolerance is said to build pretty fast in recreational settings. Within a few uses, the effects will decline. This leads to some people eventually taking well over 1 gram per day. That’s when the risk of withdrawal is much higher.

#### Fatality reviews

(Lottner-Nau, 2013) – Reviewing postmortem toxicology from 2010 to 2012 in Germany

- 4200 autopsies and 982 toxicological analyses performed
- Pregabalin detected in 4.4% (n=43)
- Median concentration in whole blood was 5.18 mg/L (range of 0.04 to 23.8 mg/L)
- One or more drugs was found in every case 
- Most popular: opioids, benzodiazepines, alcohol, and antidepressants.
- For opioids, the top ones were: fentanyl, methadone, morphine, codeine.

#### Problematic responses

(Lee, 2011) – Two cases of negative neurological symptoms in chronic kidney disease patients

- Case 1

  "wikipedia": `# Pregabalin
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregabalin*

Pregabalin, sold under the brand name Lyrica among others, is an anticonvulsant, analgesic, and anxiolytic amino acid medication used to treat epilepsy, neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, restless legs syndrome, opioid withdrawal, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and shingles. Pregabalin also has antiallodynic properties. Its use in epilepsy is as an add-on therapy for partial seizures.  When used before surgery, it reduces pain but results in greater sedation and visual disturbances. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects can include headache, dizziness, sleepiness, euphoria, confusion, trouble with memory, poor coordination, dry mouth, problems with vision, and weight gain. Serious side effects may include angioedema, kidney damage, and seizures. 
As with all other drugs approved by the FDA for treating epilepsy, the pregabalin labeling warns of an increased suicide risk when combined with other drugs. When pregabalin is taken at high doses over a long period of time, addiction may occur, but if taken at usual doses the risk is low. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is of unclear safety.
It is a gabapentinoid medication which is a class of drugs within the derivatives of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA analogues), an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Although pregabalin is inactive at GABA receptors and GABA synapses, it acts by binding specifically to the α2δ-1 protein that was first described as an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels.
Pregabalin was approved for medical use in the United States in 2004.  In the US, pregabalin is a Schedule V controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, which means that the drug has low abuse potential compared to substances in Schedules I-IV, however, there is still a potential for misuse. It is available as a generic medication. In 2023, it was the 78th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions.

## Medical uses

### Seizures

For drug-resistant focal epilepsy, pregabalin is useful as an add-on therapy to other treatments. Its use alone is less effective than some other seizure medications. It is unclear how it compares to gabapentin for this use.

### Neuropathic pain

The European Federation of Neurological Societies recommends pregabalin as a first-line agent for the treatment of pain associated with diabetic neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, and central neuropathic pain. A minority obtain substantial benefit, and a larger number obtain moderate benefit. It is given equal weight as gabapentin and tricyclic antidepressants as a first-line agent, however, the latter are less expensive as of 2010. Pregabalin is as effective at relieving pain as duloxetine and amitriptyline. Combination treatment of pregabalin and amitriptyline or duloxetine offers additional pain relief for people whose pain is not adequately controlled with one medication and is safe.
Studies have shown that higher doses of pregabalin are associated with greater efficacy.
Pregabalin's use in cancer-associated neuropathic pain is controversial, though such use is common. It has been examined for the prevention of post-surgical chronic pain, but its utility for this purpose is controversial.
Pregabalin is generally not regarded as efficacious in the treatment of acute pain. In trials examining the utility of pregabalin for the treatment of acute post-surgical pain, no effect on overall pain levels was observed, but people did require less morphine and had fewer opioid-related side effects. Several possible mechanisms for pain improvement have been discussed.

### Anxiety disorders

Pregabalin is effective for treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. It is also effective for the short- and long-term treatment of social anxiety disorder and in reducing preoperative anxiety. However, there is concern regarding pregabalin's off-label use due to the lack of strong scientific evidence for its efficacy in multiple conditions and its proven side effects.
The World Federation of Biological Psychiatry recommends pregabalin as one of several first line agents for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, but recommends other agents such as those of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class as first line treatment for obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). For PTSD, pregabalin as complementary treatment seems to be effective.

#### Generalized anxiety disorder

Pregabalin has anxiolytic effects similar to benzodiazepines with less risk of dependence. The effects of pregabalin appear within one week of use, and are similar in effectiveness to lorazepam, alprazolam, and bromazepam, but pregabalin has demonstrated superiority by producing more consistent therapeutic effects for psychosomatic anxiety symptoms. Long-term trials have shown continued effectiveness without the development of tolerance, and, in addition, unlike benzodiazepines, it has a beneficial effect on sleep and sleep architecture, characterized by the enhancement of slow-wave sleep. It produces less severe cognitive and psychomotor impairment compared to benzodiazepines.
A 2019 review found that pregabalin reduces symptoms, and was generally well tolerated.

### Other uses

Although pregabalin is sometimes prescribed for people with bipolar disorder, there is no evidence showing that it is effective.
There is no evidence and significant risk in using pregabalin for sciatica and low back pain. 
Evidence of benefit in alcohol withdrawal as well as withdrawal from certain other drugs is limited as of 2016.
There is no evidence for its use in the prevention of migraines and gabapentin has also been found not to be useful.
A 2025 review found possible benefits to sleep quality in patients with fibromyalgia.

## Adverse effects

In a systematic review analysing data from 5 cohort studies having 1,085,488 patients, use of gabapentinoids (pregabalin and gabapentin) was associated with an increased risks of thrombotic events (deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary thrombo-embolism) as early as three months of use, and with increased risk of cardiovascular events on prolonged use of more than a year duration. Heart failure was not increased with the use of gabapentinoids.
Exposure to pregabalin is associated with weight gain, drowsiness, fatigue, dizziness, vertigo, leg swelling, disturbed vision, loss of coordination, and euphoria. It has an adverse effect profile similar to other central nervous system (CNS) depressants. Even though pregabalin is a depressant and anticonvulsant, it can sometimes paradoxically induce seizures, particularly in large overdoses. Adverse drug reactions associated with the use of pregabalin include:

Very common (>10% of people with pregabalin): dizziness, drowsiness.
Common (1–10% of people with pregabalin): peripheral edema, blurred vision, diplopia, increased appetite and subsequent weight gain, euphoria, confusion, vivid dreams, changes in libido (increase or decrease), irritability, ataxia, attention changes, feeling high, memory impairment, tremor, dysarthria, paresthesia, vertigo, dry mouth, constipation, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, feelings of drunkenness, abnormal walking, asthenia, nasopharyngitis, increased creatine kinase level.
Infrequent (0.1–1% of people with pregabalin): depression, lethargy, agitation, anorgasmia, hallucinations, myoclonus, hypoaesthesia, hyperaesthesia, tachycardia, hypersalivation, hypoglycaemia, excessive sweating, flushing, rash, muscle cramp, myalgia, arthralgia, urinary incontinence, dysuria, thrombocytopenia, kidney calculus.
Rare (<0.1% of people with pregabalin): neutropenia, first-degree heart block, hypotension, hypertension, pancreatitis, dysphagia, oliguria, rhabdomyolysis, suicidal thoughts or behavior.
Cases of recreational use, with associated adverse effects, have been reported.

### Withdrawal symptoms

Following abrupt or rapid discontinuation of pregabalin, some people reported symptoms suggestive of physical dependence. The FDA determined that the substance dependence profile of pregabalin, as measured by a personal physical withdrawal checklist, was quantitatively less than benzodiazepines.
Even people who have discontinued short-term use of pregabalin have experienced withdrawal symptoms including insomnia, headache, heart palpitations, nausea, anxiety, diarrhea, flu-like symptoms, major depression, pain, seizures, excessive sweating, muscle twitching, and dizziness.
A tapered discontinuation is recommended to reduce the chances of withdrawal symptoms. Lyrica's US package insert recommends a taper period of at least one week. Best Practice Advocacy Centre New Zealand and NHS Somerset recommend a much slower withdrawal.

### Pregnancy

It is unclear if it is safe for use in pregnancy with some studies showing potential harm.

### Breathing

In December 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned about serious breathing issues for those taking gabapentin or pregabalin when used with central nervous system (CNS) depressants or for those with lung problems.
The FDA required new warnings about the risk of respiratory depression to be added to the prescribing information of the gabapentinoids. The FDA also required the drug manufacturers to conduct clinical trials to further evaluate their abuse potential, particularly in combination with opioids, because misuse and abuse of these products together is increasing, and co-use may increase the risk of respiratory depression.
Among 49 case reports submitted to the FDA over the five-year period from 2012 to 2017, twelve people died from respiratory depression with gabapentinoids, all of whom had at least one risk factor.
The FDA reviewed the results of two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in healthy people, three observational studies, and several studies in animals. One trial showed that using pregabalin alone and using it with an opioid pain reliever can depress breathing function. The other trial showed gabapentin alone increased pauses in breathing during sleep. The three observational studies at one academic medical center showed a relationship between gabapentinoids given before surgery and respiratory depression occurring after different kinds of surgeries. The FDA also reviewed several animal studies that showed pregabalin alone and pregabalin plus opioids can depress respiratory function.

### Abuse potential

Pregabalin has potential for recreational use and abuse. It possesses a relatively wide therapeutic index and margin of safety compared to other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, and its effects may include euphoria, anxiolysis, and sedation.
Although generally considered to have low abuse potential, reports describe pregabalin inducing sensations of euphoria, calmness, excitement, and a "high" comparable to that of cannabis. These effects may contribute to the development of substance dependence, and withdrawal symptoms can occur if the medication is stopped abruptly.
While pregabalin and cannabis share certain effects, such as CNS depressant and orexigenic (appetite-stimulating) properties, they differ significantly in their pharmacodynamics. Cannabis is primarily an anxiogenic substance with mild psychedelic effects, whereas pregabalin is an anxiolytic agent associated with mild euphoria that is prone to rapid tolerance.

## Overdose

An overdose of pregabalin usually consists of severe drowsiness, severe ataxia, blurred vision, slurred speech, uncontrollable jerking motions (myoclonus), and anxiety. In one case study, macular detachment was reported with overdose Despite these symptoms an overdose is not usually fatal unless mixed with another CNS depressant. Several people with kidney failure developed myoclonus while receiving pregabalin, apparently as a result of the gradual accumulation of the drug. Acute overdosage may be manifested by drowsiness, tachycardia, and hypertonia. Plasma, serum, or blood concentrations of pregabalin may be measured to monitor therapy or to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized people.

## Interactions

No drug interactions have been demonstrated in vivo. However, the manufacturer notes potential pharmacological interactions with opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, ethanol (alcohol), and other central nervous system depressants. Concurrent use of ACE inhibitors and pregabalin may increase the risk of angioedema. Pregabalin may also enhance the fluid-retaining effects of certain antidiabetic agents, such as thiazolidinediones.
Pregabalin may independently increase the risk of angioedema, and this risk is further elevated when used in combination with other drugs known to increase the likelihood of angioedema. These include, but are not limited to, certain L-type calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and other agents that inhibit the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system.
Pregabalin can also cause rare but serious adverse effects, particularly when used in combination with other CNS depressants.

## Pharmacology

### Mechanism of action

Pregabalin is a member of the gabapentinoid class, also known as α2δ ligands. Despite being a structural analog of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), pregabalin is inactive at GABA receptors and does not mimic GABA. Instead, its action involves binding to a specific site on the α2δ-1 protein and reducing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters in synapses.
Pregabalin does not directly block calcium channels (it is not a calcium channel blocker), as it does not bind to the ion conducting channel protein, called α1. However, in vitro studies show that pregabalin can reduce the normal traffic of calcium channels from intracellular sites (where they do not function) to membrane sites where they are functional.
While the mechanism of action of pregabalin is not definitively characterized, its action in animal models of pain, seizures and anxiety requires binding to the α2δ-1 protein. It has been found that this binding inhibits several actions of α2δ-1 and also inhibits the release of excitatory neurotransmitters. These excitatory neurotransmitters include glutamate, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), serotonin, dopamine, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide. By inhibiting the release of these neurotransmitters, pregabalin reduces excess activity of neuron networks, which helps alleviate symptoms and provides relief for patients experiencing pain, seizures, or other related symptoms.

### Pharmacodynamics

There are two drug-binding α2δ subunits, α2δ-1 and α2δ-2, and pregabalin shows similar affinity for (and hence lack of selectivity between) these two sites. Pregabalin is selective in its binding to the α2δ VGCC subunits and does not bind significantly to other known drug receptors.
Despite the fact that pregabalin is a GABA analogue, it does not bind to GABA receptors, does not convert into GABATooltip γ-aminobutyric acid or another GABA receptor agonist in vivo, and does not directly modulate GABA transport or metabolism. There is currently no evidence that the effects of pregabalin are mediated by any mechanism other than binding to the α2δ-1 protein. In accordance, inhibition of α2δ-1 proteins by pregabalin appears to be responsible for its anticonvulsant, analgesic, and anxiolytic effects in animal models.
Recently, the α2δ-1 protein has been found (independent of calcium channels) to associate directly with certain NMDA-type glutamate receptors, some AMPA-type glutamate receptors and also with the extracellular matrix protein, thrombospondin, and to modulate the function of these proteins. This has been proposed to contribute to the analgesic action of pregabalin animal models and in clinical use.
The endogenous α-amino acids L-leucine and L-isoleucine, which closely resemble pregabalin and the other gabapentinoids in chemical structure, are apparent ligands of the α2δ VGCC subunit with similar affinity as the gabapentinoids (e.g., IC50=71 nM for L-isoleucine), and are present in human cerebrospinal fluid at micromolar concentrations (e.g., 12.9 μM for L-leucine, 4.8 μM for L-isoleucine). It has been theorized that they may be the endogenous ligands of the subunit and that they may competitively antagonize the effects of gabapentinoids. In accordance, while gabapentinoids like pregabalin and gabapentin have nanomolar affinities for the α2δ subunit, their potencies in vivo are in the low micromolar range, and competition for binding by endogenous L-amino acids has been said to likely be responsible for this discrepancy.
Pregabalin was found to possess 6-fold higher affinity than gabapentin for α2δ subunit-containing VGCCs in one study. However, another study found that pregabalin and gabapentin had similar affinities for the human recombinant α2δ-1 subunit (Ki=32 nM and 40 nM, respectively). In any case, pregabalin is 2 to 4 times more potent than gabapentin as an analgesic and, in animals, appears to be 3 to 10 times more potent than gabapentin as an anticonvulsant.

### Pharmacokinetics

#### Absorption

Pregabalin is absorbed from the intestines by an active transport process mediated via the large neutral amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1, SLC7A5), a transporter for amino acids such as L-leucine and L-phenylalanine. Very few (less than 10 drugs) are known to be transported by this transporter. Unlike gabapentin, which is transported solely by the LAT1, pregabalin seems to be transported not only by the LAT1 but also by other carriers. The LAT1 is easily saturable, so the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin are dose-dependent, with diminished bioavailability and delayed peak levels at higher doses. In contrast, this is not the case for pregabalin, which shows linear pharmacokinetics and no saturation of absorption.
The oral bioavailability of pregabalin is greater than or equal to 90% across and beyond its entire clinical dose range (75 to 600 mg/day). Food does not significantly influence the oral bioavailability of pregabalin. Pregabalin is rapidly absorbed when administered on an empty stomach, with a Tmax (time to peak levels) of generally less than or equal to 1 hour at doses of 300 mg or less. However, food has been found to substantially delay the absorption of pregabalin and to significantly reduce peak levels without affecting the bioavailability of the drug; Tmax values for pregabalin of 0.6 hours in a fasted state and 3.2 hours in a fed state (5-fold difference), and the Cmax is reduced by 25–31% in a fed versus fasted state.

#### Distribution

Pregabalin crosses the blood–brain barrier and enters the central nervous system. However, due to its low lipophilicity, pregabalin requires active transport across the blood–brain barrier. The LAT1 is highly expressed at the blood–brain barrier and transports pregabalin across into the brain. Pregabalin has been shown to cross the placenta in rats and is present in the milk of lactating rats. In humans, the volume of distribution of an orally administered dose of pregabalin is approximately 0.56 L/kg. Pregabalin is not significantly bound to plasma proteins (<1%).

#### Metabolism

Pregabalin undergoes little or no metabolism. In experiments using nuclear medicine techniques, it was revealed that approximately 98% of the radioactivity recovered in the urine was unchanged pregabalin. The main metabolite is N-methylpregabalin.
Pregabalin is generally safe in patients with liver cirrhosis.

#### Elimination

Pregabalin is eliminated by the kidneys in the urine, mainly in its unchanged form. It has a relatively short elimination half-life, with a reported value of 6.3 hours. Because of its short elimination half-life, pregabalin is administered 2 to 3 times per day to maintain therapeutic levels. The kidney clearance of pregabalin is 73 mL/minute.

## Chemistry

Pregabalin is a GABA analogue that is a 3-substituted derivative as well as a γ-amino acid. Because of its chemical and pharmacological similarities to gabapentin, it is sometimes called a gabapentinoid drug. Specifically, pregabalin is (S)-(+)-3-isobutyl-GABA. Pregabalin also closely resembles the α-amino acids L-leucine and L-isoleucine, and this may be of greater relevance in relation to its pharmacodynamics than its structural similarity to GABA.

### Synthesis

Chemical syntheses of pregabalin have been described.

## History

Pregabalin was synthesized in 1990 as an anticonvulsant that was developed as a successor to the related gabapentin. It was first synthesized by medicinal chemist Richard Bruce Silverman at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. During 1988 to 1990, Ryszard Andruszkiewicz, a visiting research fellow, synthesized a series of molecules requested by Silverman. Upon testing in mouse seizure models by collaborators at Parke-Davis Pharmaceuticals, one looked particularly promising. In vitro, it activated L-glutamic acid decarboxylase, an enzyme, but this later proved to be unimportant to prevention of seizures. Silverman had originally hoped that the enzyme would increase the production of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA and block convulsions. After extensive development studies and clinical trials by Parke-Davis the drug was approved in the European Union in 2004. The US received FDA approval for use in treating epilepsy, diabetic neuropathic pain, and postherpetic neuralgia in December 2004. Pregabalin then appeared on the US market under the brand name Lyrica in the fall of 2005. In 2017, the FDA approved pregabalin extended-release Lyrica CR for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and postherpetic neuralgia. However, unlike the immediate release formulation, Lyrica CR was not approved for the management of fibromyalgia or as add-on therapy for adults with partial onset seizures.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

United States: During clinical trials a small number of users (~4%) reported euphoria after use, which led to its control in the US. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) classified pregabalin as a depressant and placed pregabalin, including its salts, and all products containing pregabalin into Schedule V of the Controlled Substances Act.
Norway: Pregabalin is in prescription Schedule B, alongside benzodiazepines.
United Kingdom: On January 14, 2016, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) recommended that pregabalin, along with gabapentin, be controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. In October 2018, it was announced that pregabalin would be reclassified as a Class C controlled substance, effective April 2019. As a Class C drug, pregabalin now requires a prescription in the UK, and the prescription must clearly specify the dose.
In the United States, the FDA has approved pregabalin for adjunctive therapy for adults with partial onset seizures, management of postherpetic neuralgia and neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and the treatment of fibromyalgia. Pregabalin has also been approved in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Russia for treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.

### Economics

Pregabalin is available as a generic medication in a number of countries, including the United States as of July 2019. In the United States as of July 2019 the wholesale/pharmacy cost for generic pregabalin is US\$0.17–0.22 per 150 mg capsule.
From 2008 until 2018, Pfizer engaged in extensive direct-to-consumer advertising campaigns to promote its branded product Lyrica for fibromyalgia and diabetic nerve pain indications. In January 2016, the company spent a record amount, \$24.6 million for a single drug on TV ads, reaching global revenues of \$14 billion, more than half in the United States.
Up until 2009, Pfizer promoted Lyrica for other uses that had not been approved by medical regulators. For Lyrica and three other drugs, Pfizer was fined a record amount of US\$2.3 billion by the Department of Justice, after pleading guilty to advertising and branding "with the intent to defraud or mislead". Pfizer illegally promoted the drugs, with doctors "invited to consultant meetings, many in resort locations; attendees expenses were paid; they received a fee just for being there", according to prosecutor Michael Loucks.

### Intellectual property

Northwestern University in the US holds the patent on pregabalin, exclusively licensed to Pfizer. That patent, along with others, was challenged by generic manufacturers and was upheld in 2014, giving Pfizer exclusivity for Lyrica in the US until 2018.
Pfizer's main patent for Lyrica, for seizure disorders, in the UK expired in 2013. In November 2018, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled that Pfizer's second patent on the drug, for the treatment of pain, was invalid because there was a lack of evidence for the conditions it covered – central and peripheral neuropathic pain. From October 2015, GPs were forced to change people from generic pregabalin to branded until the second patent ran out in July 2017. This cost the NHS £502 million.
