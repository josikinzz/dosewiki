## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenylpiperidines. These are compounds containing a phenylpiperidine skeleton, which consists of a piperidine bound to a phenyl group.

### Background

A narcotic analgesic that can be used for the relief of most types of moderate to severe pain, including postoperative pain and the pain of labor. Prolonged use may lead to dependence of the morphine type; withdrawal symptoms appear more rapidly than with morphine and are of shorter duration.

### Indication

Used to control moderate to severe pain.

### Pharmacodynamics

Meperidine is a synthetic opiate agonist belonging to the phenylpiperidine class. Meperidine may produce less smooth muscle spasm, constipation, and depression of the cough reflex than equivalent doses of morphine. The onset of action is lightly more rapid than with morphine, and the duration of action is slightly shorter. The chemical structure of meperidine is similar to local anesthetics. Meperidine is recommended for relief of moderate to severe acute pain and has the unique ability to interrupt postoperative shivering and shaking chills induced by amphotericin B. Meperidine has also been used for intravenous regional anesthesia, peripheral nerve blocks and intraarticular, epidural and spinal analgesia. Meperidine is considered a second-line agent for the treatment of acute pain.

### Mechanism of Action

Kappa-type opioid receptor
Agonist

### Absorption

The oral bioavailability of meperidine in patients with normal hepatic function is 50-60% due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Bioavailability increases to 80-90% in patients with hepatic impairment (e.g. liver cirrhosis). Meperidine is less than half as effective when administered orally compared to parenteral administration. One study reported that 80-85% of the drug administered intramuscularly was absorbed within 6 hours of intragluteal injection in health adults; however, inter-individual variation and patient-specific variable appear to cause considerable variations in absorption upon IM injection.

### Metabolism

Meperidine is metabolized in the liver by hydrolysis to meperidinic acid followed by partial conjugation with glucuronic acid. Meperidine also undergoes N-demethylation to normeperidine, which then undergoes hydrolysis and partial conjugation. Normeperidine is about half as potent as meperidine, but it has twice the CNS stimulation effects.

### Half-life

Initial distribution phase (t
1/2 α
) = 2-11 minutes; terminal elimination phase (t
1/2 β
) =  3-5 hours. In patients with hepatic dysfunction (e.g. liver cirrhosis or active viral hepatitis) the t
1/2 β
is prolonged to 7-11 hours.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of adverse effects can be increased when Meperidine is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Abacavir
Meperidine may decrease the excretion rate of Abacavir which could result in a higher serum level.
Abametapir
The serum concentration of Meperidine can be increased when it is combined with Abametapir.
Abatacept
The metabolism of Meperidine can be increased when combined with Abatacept.
Abemaciclib
The metabolism of Abemaciclib can be decreased when combined with Meperidine.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol.
Take with or without food. Food does not significantly affect absorption.

### Mechanism of action

Meperidine is primarily a kappa-opiate receptor agonist and also has local anesthetic effects. Meperidine has more affinity for the kappa-receptor than morphine. Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist). This results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability.

### Volume of distribution

Meperidine crosses the placenta and is distributed into breast milk.

### Protein binding

60-80% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin and α
1
-acid glycoprotein. The presence of cirrhosis or active viral hepatitis does not appear to affect the extent of protein binding.

### Route of elimination

Excreted in the urine. The proportion of drug that is excreted unchanged or as metabolites is dependent on pH. When urine pH is uncontrolled, 5-30% of the meperidine dose is excreted as normeperidine and approximately 5% is excreted unchanged. Meperidine and normeperidine are found in acidic urine, while the free and conjugated forms of meperidinic and normperidinic acids are found in alkaline urine.

## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Bioavailability: 50-60%
- Threshold: 25 - 50 mg
- Light: 50 - 100 mg
- Common: 100 - 200 mg
- Strong: 200 - 400 mg
- Heavy: 400 mg +

**Duration:**
- Onset: 30 - 60 minutes
- Peak: 4 - 6 hours
- After effects: 2 - 10 hours
**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) , [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or other [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Pethidine** , known as **meperidine** in the United States (sold under the brand name **Demerol** ), is a synthetic [opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) [analgesic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) used for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. Compared to traditional opioids such as [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) , pethidine was originially thought to be much safer and have less potential for abuse. It was later discovered that pethidine is significantly less safe than morphine and its metabolite norpethidine can be extremely toxic.

## Chemistry

Pethidine is a synthetic opioid of the phenylpiperidine class. Pethidine is the prototype of a large family of analgesics including the pethidine 4-phenylpiperidines (piminodine, anileridine and others), the prodines (alphaprodine, MPPP, *etc.* ), bemidones (ketobemidone, etc.) and others more distant, including diphenoxylate and analogues. The most coomon hydrochloride form is a white crystalline substance with a melting point of 186 C to 189 C. It is readily soluble in water and has a neutral reaction and a slightly bitter taste.

Toxic pethidine blood concentration: 500 ug/dL and lethal pethidine blood concentration: 1-3 mg/dL.

Pethidine can be produced in a two-step synthesis. The first step is reaction of benzyl cyanide and chlormethine in the presence of sodium amide to form a piperidine ring. The nitrile is then converted to an ester.

## Pharmacology

[Opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) exert their effects by binding to and activating the [μ-opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid#Mu_.28.CE.BC.29) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) . This occurs because opioids structurally mimic endogenous endorphins which are naturally found within the body and also work upon the μ-opioid receptor set. The way in which opioids structurally mimic these natural endorphins results in their [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) , [pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) and [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiolytic) effects. This is because endorphins are responsible for reducing pain, causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or general excitement. The bioavailability of orally administered pethidine can vary from 50% to around 60%.

Compared to traditional opioids, pethidine has a very unique pharmacological profile. In addition to being an opioid, pethidine is also a muscarinic [acetylcholine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acetylcholine) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) [antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antagonist) . Pethidine is also a [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake inhibitor. Pethidine is a κ-opioid agonist and its metabolite norpethidine is also an extremely powerful [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) reuptake inhibitor.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.* Many users note that they find pethidine just as, or more euphoric than [oxycodone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Oxycodone) .
### Physical effects
 
- The general sensation of pethidine can be described as one of euphoria, relaxation, anxiety suppression and pain relief. 
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)**
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - This particular substance can be considered as very intense in its physical euphoria. The sensation itself can be described as extreme feelings of intense physical comfort, warmth, love and bliss.
- **[Itchiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Itchiness)**
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)** - At low to moderate doses, this effect results in the sensation that the breath is slowed down mildly to moderately, but does not cause noticeable impairment. At high doses and overdoses, opioid-induced respiratory depression can result in a shortness of breath, abnormal breathing patterns, semi-consciousness, or unconsciousness. Severe overdoses can result in a coma or death without immediate medical attention.
- **[Constipation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Constipation)**
- **[Cough suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cough_suppression)**
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)**
- **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** *or* **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - While most users report that they find pethidine to be considerably sedating, others report it to be stimulating.
- **[Pupil constriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_constriction)**
- **[Decreased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_libido)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Orgasm suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orgasm_suppression)**
- **[Seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures)** - High doses of pethidine may cause seizures. This is because of its metabolite norpethidine. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - This particular substance can be considered as very intense in its cognitive euphoria. The sensation itself can be described as powerful and overwhelming feeling of emotional bliss, contentment, and happiness.
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)** ### Visual effects
 
- - **[Acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acuity_suppression)** - Pethidine is a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist which may cause blurred vision at high doses.
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: Pethidine](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Pharms_Meperidine.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

Pethidine has a high toxicity relative to dose. As with all opioids, long-term effects can vary but can include diminished libido, apathy and memory loss. It is also potentially [lethal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) when mixed with [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) like [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) and generally has a wider range of substances which it is [dangerous to combine with](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pethidine#Dangerous_interactions) in comparison to other opioids.

One of pethdine's metabolites, norpethidine has little to no opioid action, but is known to cause seizures. Pethidine should not be taken during [benzodiazepine withdrawals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine#Discontinuation) as this can potentially cause [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure) . In 1984, Libby Zion, a teenager was brought to the emergency room due to a "flu-like" ailment. She was previously prescribed and taking phenelzine, a [monoamine oxidase inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) , which in combination caused fatal serotonin syndrome.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , the chronic use of pethidine can be considered extremely addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal symptoms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids#Discontinuation) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of pethidine develops with prolonged and repeated use. The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects, with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly for instance. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Pethidine presents cross-tolerance with all other [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , meaning that after the consumption of pethidine all [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) will have a reduced effect.

The risk of fatal opioid overdoses rise sharply after a period of cessation and [relapse](/w/index.php?title=Relapse&action=edit&redlink=1) , largely because of reduced tolerance. To account for this lack of tolerance, it is safer to only dose a fraction of one's usual [dosage](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage) if relapsing. It has also been found that the environment one is in can play a role in opioid tolerance. In one scientific study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the drug in contrast to a familiar environment.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Alcohol** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. Place affected patients in the recovery position to prevent vomit aspiration from excess. Memory blackouts are likely
- **Stimulants** - Stimulants increase respiration rate which allows for a higher dose of opiates than would otherwise be used. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the user and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Benzodiazepines** - Central nervous system and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present. The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position blackouts/memory loss likely.
- **DXM** - Generally considered to be toxic. CNS depression, difficulty breathing, heart issues, and liver toxicity have been observed. Additionally if one takes DXM, their tolerance of opiates goes down slightly, thus causing additional synergistic effects.
- **GHB** / **GBL** - The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position
- **Ketamine** - Both substances bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the user falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
- **MAOIs** - Coadministration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) with certain opioids has been associated with rare reports of severe adverse reactions. There appear to be two types of interaction, an excitatory and a depressive one. Symptoms of the excitatory reaction may include agitation, headache, diaphoresis, hyperpyrexia, flushing, shivering, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor, diarrhea, hypertension, tachycardia, seizures, and coma. Death has occurred in some cases.
- **MXE** - MXE can potentiate the effects of opioids but also increases the risk of respiratory depression and organ toxicity.
- **Nitrous** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position. Memory blackouts are common.
- **PCP** - PCP may reduce opioid tolerance, increasing the risk of overdose.
- **Tramadol** - Increased risk of seizures. Tramadol itself is known to induce seizures and it may have additive effects on seizure threshold with other opioids. Central nervous system- and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present.
- **Grapefruit** - While grapefruit is not psychoactive, it may affect the metabolism of certain opioids. Tramadol, oxycodone, and fentanyl are all primarily metabolized by the enzyme CYP3A4, which is potently inhibited by grapefruit juice . This may cause the drug to take longer to clear from the body. it may increase toxicity with repeated doses. Methadone may also be affected . Codeine and hydrocodone are metabolized by CYP2D6. People who are on medicines that inhibit CYP2D6, or that lack the enzyme due to a genetic mutation will not respond to codeine as it can not be metabolized into its active product: morphine.

#### Serotonin syndrome risk

Pethidine is known to have a significantly increased chance of causing serotonin syndrome than other serotonergic opioids such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Combinations with the following substances can cause dangerously high [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) levels. [Serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) requires immediate medical attention and can be fatal if left untreated.

- **MAOIs** - Such as [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , phenelzine, selegiline, and moclobemide.
- **Serotonin releasers** - Such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) , [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) and [αMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91MT) .
- **SSRIs** - Such as citalopram and sertraline
- **[SNRIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNRIs)** - Such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) and venlafaxine
- **5-HTP**

  "wikipedia": `# Pethidine
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pethidine*

Pethidine, also known as meperidine and sold under the brand name Demerol among others, is a fully synthetic opioid pain medication of the phenylpiperidine class. Synthesized in 1938 as a potential anticholinergic agent by the German chemist Otto Eisleb, its analgesic properties were first recognized by Otto Schaumann while working for IG Farben, in Germany. Pethidine is the prototype of a large family of analgesics including the pethidine 4-phenylpiperidines (e.g., piminodine, anileridine), the prodines (e.g., alphaprodine, MPPP), bemidones (e.g., ketobemidone), and others more distant, including diphenoxylate and analogues.
Pethidine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe pain, and is delivered as a hydrochloride salt in tablets, as a syrup, or by intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous injection. For much of the 20th century, pethidine was the opioid of choice for many physicians; in 1975, 60% of doctors prescribed it for acute pain and 22% for chronic severe pain.
It was patented in 1937 and approved for medical use in 1943. Compared with morphine, pethidine was considered to be safer, carry a lower risk of addiction, and to be superior in treating the pain associated with biliary spasm or renal colic due to its assumed anticholinergic effects. These were later discovered to be inaccurate assumptions, as it carries an equal risk of addiction and possesses no advantageous effects on biliary spasm or renal colic compared to other opioids. Due to the neurotoxicity of its metabolite, norpethidine, it is more toxic than other opioids—especially during long-term use. The norpethidine metabolite was found to have serotonergic effects, so pethidine could, unlike most opioids, increase the risk of triggering serotonin syndrome.

## Medical uses

Pethidine is the most widely used opioid in labour and delivery. It has fallen out of favour in some countries, such as the United States, in favour of other opioids, due to its potential drug interactions, especially with serotonergics, and its neurotoxic metabolite, norpethidine. It is still commonly used in the United Kingdom and New Zealand, and was the preferred opioid in the United Kingdom for use during labour, but has been superseded somewhat by other strong semi-synthetic opioids (e.g. hydromorphone) to avoid serotonin interactions since the mid-2000s. 
Pethidine is the preferred painkiller for diverticulitis, because it decreases intestinal intraluminal pressure. Pethidine is the preferred drug for the management of shivering during therapeutic hypothermia, as it provides the greatest reduction in the shivering threshold.
Before 2003, it was on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system.

## Adverse effects

The adverse effects of pethidine administration are primarily those of the opioids as a class: nausea, vomiting, dizziness, diaphoresis, urinary retention, and constipation. Due to moderate stimulant effects mediated by pethidine's dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, sedation is less likely compared to other opioids. Unlike other opioids, it does not cause miosis because of its anticholinergic properties. Overdose can cause muscle flaccidity, respiratory depression, obtundation, psychosis, cold and clammy skin, hypotension, and coma.
A narcotic antagonist such as naloxone is indicated to reverse respiratory depression and other effects of pethidine. Serotonin syndrome has occurred in patients receiving concurrent antidepressant therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or other medication types (see Interactions below). Convulsive seizures sometimes observed in patients receiving parenteral pethidine on a chronic basis have been attributed to accumulation in plasma of the metabolite norpethidine (normeperidine). Fatalities have occurred following either oral or intravenous pethidine overdose.

## Interactions

Pethidine has serious interactions that can be dangerous with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., furazolidone, isocarboxazid, moclobemide, phenelzine, procarbazine, selegiline, tranylcypromine). Such patients may suffer agitation, delirium, headache, convulsions, and/or hyperthermia. Fatal interactions have been reported including the death of Libby Zion. 
Seizures may develop when tramadol is given intravenously following, or with, pethidine. It can interact as well with SSRIs and other antidepressants, antiparkinson agents, migraine therapy, stimulants and other agents causing serotonin syndrome. It is thought to be caused by an increase in cerebral serotonin concentrations. It is probable that pethidine can also interact with a number of other medications, including muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, and ethanol.

## Mechanism of action

Like morphine, pethidine exerts its analgesic effects by acting as an agonist at the μ-opioid receptor.
Pethidine is often employed in the treatment of postanesthetic shivering. The pharmacologic mechanism of this antishivering effect is not fully understood, but it may involve the stimulation of κ-opioid receptors.
Pethidine has structural similarities to atropine and other tropane alkaloids and may have some of their effects and side effects. In addition to these opioidergic and anticholinergic effects, it has local anesthetic activity related to its interactions with sodium ion channels.
Pethidine's apparent in vitro efficacy as an antispasmodic agent is due to its local anesthetic effects. It does not have antispasmodic effects in vivo. Pethidine also has stimulant effects mediated by its inhibition of the dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET). Pethidine will substitute for cocaine in animals trained to discriminate cocaine from saline, probably as a result of its inhibitory actions on DAT and NET.
Several analogs of pethidine such as 4-fluoropethidine have been synthesized that are potent inhibitors of the reuptake of the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine via DAT and NET. It has also been associated with cases of serotonin syndrome, suggesting some interaction with serotonergic neurons, but the relationship has not been definitively demonstrated.
It is more lipid-soluble than morphine, resulting in a faster onset of action. Its duration of clinical effect is 120–150 minutes, although it is typically administered at 4– to 6-hour intervals. Pethidine has been shown to be less effective than morphine, diamorphine, or hydromorphone at easing severe pain, or pain associated with movement or coughing.
Like other opioid drugs, pethidine has the potential to cause physical dependence or addiction. The especially severe side effects unique to pethidine among opioids—serotonin syndrome, seizures, delirium, dysphoria, tremor—are primarily or entirely due to the action of its metabolite, norpethidine.

## Pharmacokinetics

Pethidine is quickly hydrolysed in the liver to pethidinic acid and is also demethylated to norpethidine, which has half the analgesic activity of pethidine but a longer elimination half-life (8–12 hours); accumulating with regular administration, or in kidney failure. Norpethidine is toxic and has convulsant and hallucinogenic effects. 
The toxic effects mediated by the metabolites cannot be countered with opioid receptor antagonists such as naloxone or naltrexone, and are probably primarily due to norpethidine's anticholinergic activity probably due to its structural similarity to atropine, though its pharmacology has not been thoroughly explored. The neurotoxicity of pethidine's metabolites is a unique feature of pethidine compared to other opioids. Pethidine's metabolites are further conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted into the urine.

## Recreational use

### Trends

In data from the U.S. Drug Abuse Warning Network, mentions of hazardous or harmful use of pethidine declined between 1997 and 2002, in contrast to increases for fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine, and oxycodone. The number of dosage units of pethidine reported lost or stolen in the U.S. increased 16.2% between 2000 and 2003, from 32,447 to 37,687.
The terms "hazardous use", "harmful use", and "dependence" are used in accordance with the Lexicon of alcohol and drug terms, published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1994. In WHO usage, the first two terms replace the term "abuse" and the third term replaces the term "addiction".

## Synthesis

Pethidine can be produced in a two-step synthesis. The first step is reaction of benzyl cyanide and chlormethine in the presence of sodium amide to form a piperidine ring. The nitrile is then converted to an ester.

## Control

Pethidine is in Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act 1970 of the United States as a Narcotic with ACSCN 9230 with a 6250 kilo aggregate manufacturing quota as of 2014. The free base conversion ratio for salts includes 0.87 for the hydrochloride and 0.84 for the hydrobromide. The A, B, and C intermediates in production of pethidine are also controlled, with ACSCN being 9232 for A (with a 6 gram quota) and 9233 being B (quota of 11 grams) and 9234 being C (6 gram quota). It is listed under the Single Convention for the Control of Narcotic Substances 1961 and is controlled in most countries in the same fashion as is morphine.

## Society and culture

Marcial Maciel (1920–2008), a Mexican Catholic priest, accused of sexually abusing children, founder of the Legionaries of Christ and Regnum Christi congregations, was repeatedly accused of being addicted to the substance Demerol as well as morphine.
In John D. MacDonald's book Dress Her in Indigo (1969) one of the protagonists speaks of thinking of killing an immobilized enemy of hers by injecting him with meperedine which was left over from a husband who used it while terminally ill.
In Raymond Chandler's novel The Long Goodbye (1953), in response to "How is Mrs. Wade?", police Lieutenant Bernie Ohls answers, "Too relaxed. She must have grabbed some pills. There's a dozen kinds up there -- even demerol. That's bad stuff."
Harold Shipman was addicted to pethidine at one stage, convicted of forging prescriptions to obtain it, fined £500 and briefly attended a drug rehabilitation clinic.
Danish writer Tove Ditlevsen suffered a lifelong addiction to pethidine after her husband, a doctor, had injected her with Demerol as a painkiller for an illegal abortion in 1944.
Pethidine is referenced by its brand name Demerol in the song "Morphine" by singer Michael Jackson on his 1997 album Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix. Pethidine was one of several prescription drugs which Jackson was addicted to at the time and the singer describes this in the lyrics of the song with phrases such as "Relax/This won't hurt you" and "Yesterday you had his trust/Today he's taking twice as much".
Pethidine is referenced in the television show Broadchurch, season 2, episode 3, as it was given to the character Beth after she has her baby.
In the 1987 Malayalam movie, Amrutham Gamaya, Mohanlal's character, Dr. P.K. Haridas self-injects pethidine and gets addicted to it.
A doctor in the TV show Call the Midwife becomes addicted to pethidine.
In William Gibson's book Neuromancer, one of the characters says '"A mixture of cocaine and meperidine, yes." The Armenian went back to the conversation he was having with the Sanyo. "Demerol, they used to call that," said the Finn.'
South Carolina-based modern rock group Crossfade mentions Demerol in the lyrics of their 2004 song, "Dead Skin".
In Korean drama Punch, main character Park Jung-hwan is illegally given Demerol by his doctor in exchange for legal counseling.
In the episode "The Fight" of the TV show Parks and Recreation, some characters become intoxicated on a mixed drink called Snake Juice. Rashida Jones' character Ann, who is a nurse, asks, "What the hell is in Snake Juice? Demerol?"
In David Foster Wallace's book Infinite Jest, one of the main characters, Don Gately, is a Demerol addict in recovery.
Demerol was mentioned in the 1988 film Colors by a sergeant walking past a group of cops right after a meeting about gang violence. He says comically, "What I need is a shot of Demerol and some clean sheets".
Demerol is mentioned in a 1990 version of the song "Pennyroyal Tea" by Nirvana. It is implied the painkiller is being used to combat pain caused by “bad posture”. However, this line was not included in the final 1993 version recorded on the In Utero album.
