****Cocaine Mega Thread and FAQ**
**


This FAQ is going to cover the basic, most commonly asked questions on BL. More detailed information can be found in the threads linked below.


**My dealer told me my coke is pure. Is it?**


No. If you are in any country outside of South America, there is a 100% chance your cocaine is not going to be pure. Even if you are in South America, unless you are extracting the cocaine yourself, there is still a very high chance that your cocaine is not pure either. Coke is cut even before it leaves the country in which it was produced. Once it makes it to it's destination country, you can pretty much assume with great certainty that it is cut every time it gets in the hands of each dealer or distributor in line before it gets to your dealer. Once it gets to him, he will most likely cut it one last time before he sells it to you. Average purity of cocaine in quantities under 10 grams was 62%. Even if you did wind up with cocaine that pure, you are one the lucky ones.


**If my coke is not pure, what is in it?**


This is probably the most commonly asked question. The problem with this is, no one is going to be able to tell you. The only way to find out is to have some sort of test ran on it. Whether it be with a GC/MS, some Marquis or Reagent testing, I have no idea, but the fact is, we will not be able to tell you from 1,000 miles away over the internet.


However, there are a couple cuts that have been showing up more frequently, and those are amphetamines. The best way to know if you have amphetamines is to pay attention to how the cocaine is affecting you. Cocaine is not the energetic, bouncing off the walls drug that everyone tends to make it out to be. If you are over-energetic, cannot sit still, have feelings of isolation or wanting to be left alone, excessive talking, or you have the shakes, those are all signs of amphetamines.


**If those effects are from amphetamines, what is good coke supposed to feel like?**


As Erowid.org describes it:


> Varies with dose and the tolerance of the user. Increases alertness, wakefulness, elevates the mood, mild to high degree of euphoria, increases athletic performance, decreases fatigue, clearer thinking, increases concentration, increases energy, increased irritability, insomnia, restlessness.
> 		
> Click to expand...


The effects of coke are more relaxing than people assume. It's a mild energy that it provides. Good coke will not make you feel an urge to get up and move around all night. You will feel perfectly content with lying in bed watching a movie, or sitting around talking with a group of friends. It causes euphoria, and puts you in a good state of mind. It does not make you want to be alone and does not make you talk incessantly without finishing one coherent sentence. It provides clarity, so it should actually be a lot easier to convey your thoughts with words.


Do not be fooled by the amphetamine ridden garbage circulating all over the world now. If you like that kind of thing, go ahead and get it, but you're not doing real cocaine when you are doing it. You're doing amphetamines.


**How much coke do I need for a fun night?**


It depends. Are you doing it alone? If not, how many people are you doing it with? How experienced with cocaine are you and your friends?


There are many variables that make this question almost impossible to answer. The best advice anyone would be able to give you is to just spend as much money as you are willing to spend, and if it turns out you bought more than you need, just save it for another time. There is never anything wrong with buying too much, but it would really suck if you bought too little.


As an estimate, for non tolerant users of cocaine, get about a half gram of cocaine per person.


**How much cocaine should I do?**


If you're asking this question, it's obvious you are inexperienced with cocaine. For someone new to the drug, it's suggested to take a normal sized match stick, cut it in half, and do a line of cocaine that is the same size as that matchstick.


To be honest, it's going to be very hard to OD off one line of cocaine. As long as you aren’t doing a line that’s 5 inches long, you'll be fine. You could get away with doing a line up 1.5 or 2 inches long (skinny line, not fat) for your first time and be perfectly OK, but it's always best to start small, that’s why you should go with the matchstick idea.


One thing to remember with any drug is “you can always do more, but you can never do less.”


**What are good drugs to mix with cocaine?**


The answer to this question is highly subjective. It depends on what you like. A few things that are commonly take along side cocaine are benzodiazepines, marijuana, and opiates. Remember, when mixing cocaine with any drug, always do a little bit less than you would normally do of each drug. Also, make sure you are experienced with both drugs on their own before mixing them.


The easier question to answer is what NOT to mix with cocaine. There are two obvious answers. One, MDMA. Two, alcohol. Mixing cocaine with MDMA will totally negate the effects of the MDMA. Some people report that cocaine on the comedown of an MDMA high is good. At this point in the high, the desired effects of MDMA have worn off, so there is no longer any worry of negating the effects. The problem is, you won’t feel the typical euphoria from the cocaine. It will give you energy and positive mood lift, but the euphoria is greatly diminished.


Mixing alcohol with cocaine is dangerous because of the chemical cocaethylene. It's a chemical that is highly toxic to the liver. Despite this, drinking alcohol while consuming cocaine is a very popular practice amongst cocaine users, mostly due to them being uninformed of the dangers.


**I'm all out of coke and I feel like shit, I can’t sleep, and I have to be at work in 5 hours. What do I do?**


The comedown: everyone’s least favorite part of using cocaine. The good thing is, it's easy to deal with. A good tip for anyone using cocaine who knows they won’t be able to sleep at the end of the night is to make sure you have some sort of depressant drug on hand BEFORE doing the coke. The mad dash to find such drugs at 4am always ends up unsuccessful so make sure you have them before you start blowing lines.


Typical drugs used for the comedown are opiates and benzodiazepines. Good opiates to use include Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, and even Heroin. Good benzos to use would be Alprazolam, Diazepam, Clonazepam, or even Triazolam. There are many others of both opiates and benzos. These are just examples. If you have a favorite opiate or benzo, you can just use that instead.


Marijuana can be a decent choice, but it can also be a really bad choice. It's common for inexperienced users to really freak out from smoking pot while on coke. So, if you're going to use pot, be sure you'll be able to handle it.

**Questions about cocaine**


Okay, I've never done coke but I think I'm about to very soon, so I have some questions for someone who's experienced.


1) Is it going to kill me?

2) Is it going to kill me if I work out with it?

3) Is it going to kill me if I use it a couple of times a week?

4) Does the acetone wash treatment work?

5) Is it an effective study drug


I think that's it...![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Hey DangerChamber


I think it depends how much you take. It'll increase your heart rate so if you have a congenital heart defect it could place enough load to trigger a heart attack, which could be fatal. If you're already pretty fit you should be fine.


From your questions it seems like you've never used it before but you're thinking about taking it regularly to help with studying and exercise. I don't think that's a good idea at all. 


The more you use it the more likely you are to develop a dependence on it.


Think of it this way: when you start it may help you study/work out, but the way the brain works means that you will need more to regain that magic you felt at the start. 


Then the coke may become unavailable and studying/exercise will be harder than when you started using - the activities may become totally unrewarding and you may have problems with motivation.


If you really want to try it, use the least amount you can to obtain the desired effects, and try to avoid long-term use.


Maybe I've misread your situation - what are your thoughts?

1. It *probably* won't kill you, but it could if you were extremely irresponsible.


2. Again, the potential's there. Just do everything in moderation and you'll be alright.


3. You don't want a cocaine dependency, and that's all that will come of it.


4. If you've never done coke I wouldn't worry about acetone washing anything just yet.


5. No, it most likely will not help you study. As soon as your high you'll feel jacked and be too distracted with other things. Then when you come down you won't want to do your work and you'll be probably be trying to redose. And the cycle continues until you're out of coke/money...

Really, even over here in FLA?  They say the coke here is supposed to be fire (the people I know) but I guess anyone would say that to make a quick buck. 


If I'm paying ---- for coke, then it's the coke I'm after.  Im not sure I care too much for cut but we'll see.  The first hit I take will most likely be without doin anything to it

Well the wash give's you more of a pure product more desirble for IV use. Some cut's are probobly bad for your helath so it's good to wash it but  a lot of people don't for one time use you don't have to do it.

**Cocaine leads to negative thinking?**


If I do a couple of lines or so, this never happens.  But I notice that when I do a lot of coke, my thinking becomes deeply negative when the effects wear off.  I also noticed that when I do coke when I'm already feeling under the weather, i feel even MORE under the weather after doing so many lines.  


I experience a downfall with E, but cocaine for me is much worse of a crash.  Is it common for one's thinking to become deeply negative after a cocaine binge?

Quick cocoa question...didn't think it was worthy of a thread.


How long after a decent session is it safe to drink? I know there are many variables here but just a rough estimate in terms of hours. I'll probably choose the most credible answer and add an hour or two.

I'm gonna say about 24 hrs.  Most people drink while doing coke anyway, but if you absolutely do not want your liver making any cocaethylene, I wouldn't drink till I already got a nights sleep after the session.

**cocaine help**


Hi, my friend just got a gram of coke and is worried that he won't be able to snort it properly because he has sinus problems and is congested.  Any suggestions on how to effectively snort coke when congested?  Will the coke still absorb through the membranes if it doesn't make it very far up and just sits there half way up his nose? or is it a waste to snort coke when your congested and having sinus problems?


ps my friend realizes its not good to be snorting shit when congested but hes fairly set on doing it tonight 


thank you

Take a decongestant.


You can also parachute the coke, or take it another ROA.  


You could also convert it to crack for vaporizing.


I'm going to move this over to the mega thread.

**Questions on Cocaine! HELP!**


Q :  if on a cocaine comedown, you stomach is feeling less than good, is that normal?  i feel semi nauseous, and just kinda uncomfortable.  


people say, when you get good coke, you'll know.  I bought some coke and got kinda ripped off one line, but i'm very new to experimenting with cocaine, and i don't know fi the high i feel is intense or not, it doesn't feel intense, but i don't know if its strong compared to the good stuff.  apparently its 70% pure,  Last time i bought of this connect it was cut way to much and burned my nose a lot. and i told him i was not pleased with it, he said don't worry next time it will be better promise, and it is  it didn't burn my nose and i got a lot more high.  but i still don't know if he is just cutting it with something different so it doesn't burn my nose, or is he gave a legit count this time


so my question is.

Q: How do i know if my coke im doing is strong?

I would be flabbergasted if your product was actually 70% pure Cocaine.  I would be extremely surprised/impressed/jealous if it was even 40-50% pure.  There is a water test you can perform to estimate actual Coca content vs. cuts.  Do a search and you will find how to do it.

Here is a good question, how to know the coke your snorting is good quality?


I've heard things like "no taste at all is better" and "petrol like smell and flavour" means the shit is better quality... the truth is, with amphetamines in the mix is very hard to know how good coke is (some feelings mix together and is difficult do discern to a novice user).


I've been a novice user for some time now (I only snort around twice a year, for 4 years now), and have been getting my white in different places every time and they are never ever the same!


My experience tells me:

- If you can feel a very acid/burning taste or feeling after you snort, it is because it is cut with something that is causing that reaction (not good!).

- No taste and odour means more tremors/shackiness and bigger comedown; which leads me to believe it has been cut with amphetamines (not good!).

- Soft acid taste with strong petrol smell: very good hights with lesser comedowns (still a major pain in my ass! coke comedowns are the worse I've felt!). The best I've personally tried.

After doing adderall for about 2 and a half weeks I agree.  I couldn't pinpoint it at first, I thought it was just me being emo, but that feeling of despair must definitely be due to the amphetamines.


Good read on cocaine purity tests for the ignorant (me).  I didn't know about this so sorry if this is common knowledge for everyone else


[http://books.google.com/books?id=OT...esnum=10&ved=0CCsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=&f=false](https://books.google.com/books?id=OTAlolM3XlwC&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=stannous+chloride+cocaine&source=bl&ots=AhuFo_bMK9&sig=6Nob35HbOrprYRvRQC5NjWzcUqY&hl=en&ei=vLS2S4itFIS-8wTe39nqAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CCsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=&f=false)


Page 37 is particularly interesting.  To sum it up


- Most common cuts do not dissolve in pure methanol, but cocaine does (methamphetamine does as well, don't know about the other amps)

- Cocaine burns clear, while sugar cuts will dirty the smoke, amphetamines will pop

- The use of stannus chloride.  All -caine cuts dissolve, while cocaine does not.  Readily available on amazon, I believe.

- Water test.  Cocaine dissolves almost instantly while the other cuts will more slowly.

- True cocaine has a shiny glittery appearance, unique to the appearance of most cutting agents.

**Crack vs Powder: crack fails**


I promised myself since the first time I stole my dad's vodka that I would never smoke crack, well I broke that promise. I figured what the hell? It's worth tryin once right? Nooooooooo. Not at all.  I'm a big fan of the powder though.


The chick I was doing it with said it was good and she seemed quite jacked from it. I wanted a bellringer or whatever, just to experience it. I know other powder users who have told me its worth trying once just for that. I wasn't aware there was a such a fine tuned technique to smoking crack properly, she tried to show me but I think I kept fucking it up. Anyways all I know is I wasted $50 that would have been much better spent on some powder or weed. Either would have lasted more than 20 minutes.


I got some thick white hits upon exhalation, we were smokin through a stem. It tasted like a woobanger rolled with nasty resin instead of weed.


I'm still after that bellringer, so any tips if I ever decide to try this again? It would have to be someone else's gear cuz theres no way I'm wasting any of my powder that way. I just hope I never cross the other two lines I forbid myself to cross...needles and meth.

it would be easier to get a bellringer by injecting some powder.. but since this is a harm reduction site and you said that's a line you won't cross, I don't advise it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

A bit trip reportish yeah, but there was a hidden question in there. Why do some people choose crack over powder? It's not cheaper, 20 minutes and 5000 cigarettes later $90 was up in strange smelling smoke. I've heard that crack is sold in small increments like $5 rocks and $10 rocks etc, but this ain't that kinda town.


That and I kinda feel like rambling since a few good lines made up for the shitty crack experience. I got a feeling working is going to suck tomorrow.

Crack is wack seriously I ended up in rehab at 15 for crack/powder cocaine and iv morphine/oxycodone addiction. 


If you want a "bellringer" like someone mentioned before just fucking shoot it. Make sure you can shoot the coke though BE CAREFUL. There was an epidemic of blindness when I got out of rehab from people shooting coke that was cut bad.  


Also since this is a megathread I have a question about the coke culture I would like to ask and see if anyone agrees with me.


Q: After the recent emergence of "cocaine rap" which I have nothing against, at all. And I know rappers have always rapped about it but recently it has been popularized again. I thkn this has lead to the influx of dirty coke going around. Everyone wants to be a coke slingin' scarface and sell shit they have no idea about. Every little hustler out there will sell you white shit in a bag thinking they are hustlin when in reality they are pushing customers away. I truly believe its a conspiracy that this influx of coke rap has caused more "drug naive" dealers to sell shit product because the demand will never cease.

So me and a friend are getting coke for the first time this weekend. We are splitting a gram and it's our first time doing it so i have a few questions:


Is it true that if you do it more than once over the course of 2 nights your going to be addicted ?


Do you think it would be safe to do it all in one night ?


Is there anything other than benzo's and opiates to help with the comedown ? (legal stuff)


How long will the comedown last, because i've done MDMA before and I could handle the comedown with ease. Is the comedown for coke worse than MDMA ?


Is a party a good scene to be at while we are on it ?


Thanks for any answers or responses, i just wanna be prepared for the night.

Agreed.

Fuck that no needles for me, and blindness doesn't seem worth it for a bellringer. Maybe I'll never experience one, from my once experience with crack I doubt I'm missing much anyway. Snorting is so much better, and way more social.


Coke/rack rapping? ...IDK since I listen to mostly punk and classic rock. But there is a ALOT of shitty coke out there. The overall quality of blow seems worse than it was when I was into it 5 or so years ago.


> Is it true that if you do it more than once over the course of 2 nights your going to be addicted ?
> 		
> Click to expand...


No. But if you do it once there's a good chance you will like it, which is already a step towards addiction.  But after my experiences with opiates I'm not sure true cocaine addiction even exists. Be careful though.


> Do you think it would be safe to do it all in one night ?
> 		
> Click to expand...


Safe or not...there's a rule about cocaine. Whatever you buy there's a decent chance it will all be gone by the morning. Start slow.


> Is there anything other than benzo's and opiates to help with the comedown ? (legal stuff)
>

Not exactly legal but some dank will kill the jones and maybe allow you to sleep. Not sure why you care if it's legal since coke is anything but. Nothing beats weed + xanax though.


> How long will the comedown last, because i've done MDMA before and I could handle the comedown with ease. Is the comedown for coke worse than MDMA ?
> 		
> Click to expand...


Depends mostly on the quality of the blow, and how much you do. If it's decent yak the up/down should be fairly smooth, but again weed will help smooth it out.


> Is a party a good scene to be at while we are on it ?
> 		
> Click to expand...


Maybe, but even though you think you can act sober on coke other people will notice. They may even want some.


All in all, start slow, be safe, and have fun. Don't get busted! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

New amesome thingy- READ ME

So Lots of pEople around here love coke.  Apparently quality has gone up lots the past year and wasn't total shit or anything like that before the quality went up(new dealer here).  I tried a few times(snorting), and it didn't work, ever, giving me nose bleeds.  This was from the same bag, equal or bigger than other peoles lines who would be loving it, and nothing but some jitters for me.


Waited a few months, then earlier today snorted 170mg(so bigger than normal line of this, "normal" seems to be about 100mg), right away nose bleeds(that nostril, ended up not being too bad though, will clean nostril sooN).

No feeling 5 minutes later


6-10 minutes later, put 250-300mg under my tongue and 100mg on my gums(THIS wasn't as good as the snorted line earlier BTW, I was given it from a friend who owed me money, he said it wasn't quite as good and told me that I'd be smart enough to figure out how to get it in me without my nose or the ROAs not used around here(nobody smokes crack or IVs that I know)), let rest about 6 minutes, till no chunks/anything is left, just a thick saliva with wierd texture, let sit longer(held all the thick mouth wierdo stuff on gums for a few minutes).


Spit that into shot glass, then filled it with 21% alc, drank, filled again most of way and drank.

30 seconds later I get all jittery than get hit by that nice coke feeling I hadn't truely had before, with music sounding better and being all hyper and such.


So I finally get it, and thought I'd let people know this way does work(the line I(stupidly) snorted did not contribute IMO, I'd tried this coke before, thought I'd try again today hoping for no nose bleed or something, nothing from it).  From the people around me, I am better off than they are from 200mg lines.


So there you go.  Soon I'll try it again, ONLY under my tongue(sublingually is the word I've found here for that), only 200mg, then spit into like 60% alc, take 1 or 2 shots and see how it goes.

 Will update when I'm all crashy, it's lasted 30ish minutes now.  Possibly the crash will be better than people get snorting(probably just being hopefull).  May also help that I'm not re dosing.


ADDING EDIT: Anywhere I should post this?  I tried looking up many oral cocaine things on BL and didn't find much helpful info.

BTW, been good 45ish minutes now, is wearing off a bit but no bad feeling(I remember it taking like 2 hours to feel bad though, my friends just left for a few minutes so I've got nobody to ask).  Same heart beat as 15 minutes ago.

what appetite?

You have literally NO appetite on blow, when I comedown I get realllllly hungry, but I'm in no mood to eat...I just want another line or death. But yeah, it could cause you to binge.

Take a cold shower to get rid of feeling overheated, maybe? And benzos might help to not feel so shitty.

Uhh, no.  A serotonin precursor supplement(5-htp?) won't increase dopamine levels.

Dopamine precursors of course ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Phenylalanine and Tyrosine come to mind.

Although in all honestly, all you really should need is a good night's sleep, some excersize, and a decent meal.  A short break from drugs couldn't hurt either ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Unlikely, as diphenhydramine(benadryl) is a histamine antagonist.

Why would you want to binge *after* the comdown?  That makes no sense.  You would (theoretically) want to binge *while still using*, not after the effects have worn off.


You have little to worry about though, catecholamines are synthesized in vivo just fine(assuming your diet is sufficient and you don't have a tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme deficiency).


How long have you been using?

Lol, dopamine dosen't determine appetite.

In layman's terms, appetite is caused by the need for energy at a cellular level.

If you are hungry, you will eat(...or not, and die, I suppose ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)), and when your body's energy levels are sufficient, you will stop.

I'm not saying dopamine(or lack of) isn't a factor, in fact it definitely IS.  I'm saying that there are other, *much* more important factors.

no no, i'm much more qualified. i'll show him how. lol.


OP if i were you i'd save the coke and buy another gram. 1.3 grams would be a lot better than .3 grams. 0.3 grams is just gonna make you pissed you didn't have more.

Depends on the quality.  0.3g is a lot of high quality coke for someone with a low/no tolerance.  If it's typical street quailty you may only get one or two lines out of it.

I think 0.3g is enough, if you have decent quality supplies and you've no tolerance. I usually buy a .5 for myself and it lasts me the whole night, easy.


Then again I'm not much into coke, and I prefer milder doses to heavy doses (probably due to my stuff not being pure). I like doing small bumps frequently rather than long lines every hour. 


Also if you're coke-naive, you're better to start with a small bump to see how it makes you feel. You don't want to do a big line and have it make you all jittery and uncomfortable. I once eyeballed an amount of coke to add to my coffee in the morning, taking into account an assumed BA of 2:1 (meaning I put twice as much in to drink as I would have snorted). The end result was me getting reaaaally nauseous and dizzy, feeling like my heart was going to blow, and having to lie down for an hour. Almost no euphoria or pleasant effects.


EDIT: for your last question, "How should I space them out", you'll have to go by feel. When you feel ready for more, do more. You'll know once you're in the situation.

put it in your vagina, if you have one.  if you do not, put it in someone's vagina.  you will find a strong correlation between vagina and cocaine.  it makes you lust for vagina, it morphs you into a pussy, and you will start to smell like fish.

**bumps**


Just do bumps up each nostril like 3 minutes apart. I have found that if you take your drug in bumps about 5 mins after the last bump, you will be peaking way harder than if you railed it all at once.![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Wow, am I really the only person that thinks the best way to enjoy coke is by doing one big line and not redosing at all?


I always feel like I'm pointlessly chasing an impossible to obtain high when redosing coke...


With such a small amount I would suggest doing it all at once if you are sure you can handle it.

I'm the same way, Hammer.  Maybe it's because we have really good coke in costa rica, so I don't feel the need to binge and do line after line all night long.  I can remember plenty of times going out with friends, buying a little bag for a few bucks, having one line, then just giving the bag away to the rest of them to fiend all night long.  And no comedown.  It's over when it's over, and I'm not craving for more.

Get friends to try the stuff out first, have them spend some money on it, see what they say.  


Overall it's really just luck if you can get good stuff, most people can't.

same way. once i get that first bit up my nose thats it. thats gonna be the best high i get from it that night and anymore is just prolonging the comedown pretty much.  

generally though my friend has a gram and jsut gives me the bag throughout the night so i keep doing it. i typically dont buy it because ill keep doing it till its gone in one night and only about 5 or 10 bucks would have been worth it. 


i've had small amounts and tried doing skinny 2 inch lines every 30-45 minutes but it isn't worth it. bigger lines and put it away seems to be the best even though i wont be able to put it away. not too big of a line though cause i occasionally get nauseous from it.

Unfortunately I think your right...but try doing that when youve got a big bag of yayo on the table lol ! like ive mentioned on other threads Iam classic binger will buy 5 grams and sit there for 12 hours till i do every grain, after getting thorugh half of it it pretty much loses its effect i.e it will give me a 5-10 high which is 25% strength of the first couple of hours of indulgence, your right but just impossible to do

Hell man, I wish I could afford to do that here! 

The problem is, here in Australia, it will run you up to $400AUS  for one gram! 

I admit it isn't often that the price gets that high but the lowest I have personally gotten a g in Australia was $200AUS so yeah when you factor in the rediculously high price, by the time you get that sacred baggie in your hands there's no way I'm having one line and giving it to my fucking fiend ass buddies lol..

But don't get me wrong, if I could get a gram for five bucks I wouldn't be given a fudge neither, power to ya man!![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

Treatment? I would imagine enforced Abstinence, group therapy, life coaching etc.. 

I don't believe that Cocaine is recognised to be physically addictive in the sense that Opiate based drugs are, but in terms of mental addiction Cocaine can completely take over some peoples lives so from what I have seen the treatments all seem to focus alot on the mental side of it... 

I'm not sure if there are any drug based treatments for cocaine addiction if thats what you are getting at..

That's hard to say without knowing actual weight.  A Marble size shot sounds like it could be to much though all at once.  Over a couple hours you could probably do a whole bag of marbles.

If a marble-sized amount would be 1/2 gram plus, then yes, all at once would be enough to cause a seizure or kill you.  Don't play with more than 100 mg. if you don't know what you are doing; don't play with more than 250 mg. if you want to stay alive.

dude even 100 mg seems a little high for me. (no tolerance though).


I cant find a sweet spot with IV coke, only once did I get a rush and actually experience the euphoria your suppose to....and that was IV crack and it was as much scary as fun... Ive tried like 10 times too, decided its stupid as hell, lot of re-dosing and mostly fiending.

The real trick honestly is benzo's. If you dont have those then opiates. And if you dont have that, then a few beers/weed. I wouldn't take any somas.

**iv coke crazy echo**


so i just did what was definitely in the top 3 most reckless things ive done in my drug career. i just eyeball dosed a shot of coke (which i havent done in a good 4 months) and just had the most intense rush ever, never experienced anything like it. i eyeballed cause i was at work and in a hurry, usually it takes about 20sec to feel it but this was instant and it felt like it was mixed with K (but i know it wasnt). the ringing was really strong but everything started echoing like fucing crazy, and this wasnt typical ecoing, every little tiny noise had this crazy fuckin echo. i honesty thought there HAD to be someone else in the bathroom making the noise, but it was empty.  cleaned everything as fast as possible and flushed the rig cause i thought i was gonna have a stroke and i didnt want it to look suspicious if someone found me unconscious. could i have gotten a stroke what are the chances of that?

dam son. coke is one of the things i haven't IVed yet, but am planning on it. it'll probably happen with the next week or 2, but i'm also kind of scared im gonna die or something cuz i've heard it can be a scary experience.


the bellringer sounds intense, and i'm sure it feels way better than IVing methylphenidate.

My husband and I iv'd coke for months. Started doing it like fiends for a bit. But the stupid thing was, every time I got a bellringer it scared the3 hell out of me. Everytime I could just tell I was walking that fine line between good hit and OD. So I got to the point where I was afraid to get the ringers but at the same time wanted them so bad. Does that even make sense. I was afraid to put enough in the spoon and would disappoint myself so many times I would say "fuck it" then finally give myself enough, once again scaring the shit outta myself with a ringer. So stupid, I know.

I've only done coke a couple times previously but when i was in Panama (3 weeks ago) i got what i think is the best shit i'll ever have the chance to try. One little line and I felt like i was flying, i had euphoria equal to what i get on E but it wasn't speedy like i was cracked out on Adderall like i sometimes feel from coke. We also got an insane ammount for the ammount of money. Basically what I am saying is, if you love blow, go to Panama lol.

One little line and I felt like i was flying, i had euphoria equal to what i get on E but it wasn't speedy like i was cracked out on Adderall like i sometimes feel from coke. We also got an insane ammount for the ammount of money. Basically what I am saying is, if you love blow, go to Panama lol.

i had 4.0g of coke when i did the acetone wash Le Junk described, step by step. by washing it, then filtering it, then letting it dry over night and next day it weighed 3.5g so i thought cool got some cut out etc. took 3 decent lines and felt nothing at all! what do you think the reason for this is?

Acetone bath won't remove all cuts/impurities, especially the most widely used one: levamisole. Try rocking it up and then reconverting to HCL. That will help but won't remove the Levami. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

My first time doing coke was filthyyyyyy. (filthy = slang for cool)


Me and my friends had talked about doing coke, but hadnt tried it yet.


Summer before my senior year of high school I go to Whistler, Canada to stay at my condo with my family. I wanted to bring a friend but they all had football so I went alone, super bummed.

Turns out the weekend we were there was this huge mt. biking competition so the village was like a huge party all weekend. Awsome!


I ran into a girl from school. So we hungout. At night some kid came up to us looking for yayo. I was like "sorry dude cant help you" but then I decided to help him look for some.

We were just about to give up when I found some.

I got a half gram **snip** but I dont care ahaha I have money.

Me and her each did half (so .25 each) and within like ... 5-10 minutes im just NUMB.

I keep saying "OMG Im SOO high right now" 


Ive done coke 5-7 times since never come close to that high.

Do people still recommend doing an acetone wash?  Or does the prevalence of levamisole make this more a less a waste of time?

I don't use cocaine anymore but just wondering how effective is the oral ROA?


I know they used to put cocaine in drinks like wine and the original Coca-Cola is it the same as snorting it? 


I know it's probably not the same as IVing, smoking, or doing a cocaine enema or booty bump that some people do coke and other drugs as a ROA.

When the cocaine feels "speedy", its also very probably that it was cutted with caffeine and ephedrine.


Also Ive heard that cocaethylene its produced ONLY when cocaine its ingested ORALLY with alcohol.

i don't think it (the coke) necessarily has to be ingested orally to form cocaethylene with alcohol.  in vivo, taken together, they form cocaethylene.


do correct me if i'm wrong, that's my understanding.

yes i'm curious too.


i've always considered performing Le Junk's preparation, because the one time i got good coke (and i mean GOOD coke), the experience was soo good. i can't even explain how good it would make me feel. i'd do a line and feel on top of the world, and everything was just perfect, with hardly any crash at all. i always end up getting bad coke tho, and regretting the money i spent on it, so i haven't touched the stuff for over a year.

%100 true! I live in South America and as me and my friends always talk about, the pure coke leaves SA and gets cut x10 in europe or u.s.a, either way i know the coke we get is obviously more pure than the coke in u.s.a or europe but no way is it %100 pure, i'd say %40-50 with a good connection, could be higher and could be lower but no way is it pure and i live in one of the countrys that produce most cocaine in the world. In Peru if you want %95 pure cocaine its out there but you have to buy a kilo and know the right people and your everyday drug user wont buy that much, especially knowing the time jail time it would land you and here $1200-1500 is allot of money, what allot of people make working hard in one year.

[QUOTE

The effects of coke are more relaxing than people assume. It's a mild energy that it provides. Good coke will not make you feel an urge to get up and move around all night. You will feel perfectly content with lying in bed watching a movie, or sitting around talking with a group of friends. It causes euphoria, and puts you in a good state of mind. It does not make you want to be alone and does not make you talk incessantly without finishing one coherent sentence. It provides clarity, so it should actually be a lot easier to convey your thoughts with words.

------------ unquote]

Sometimes, i get coke that makes me feel stoned. I get all relaxed, and just wanna sprawl out on the couch and stare into space. It's nice, but if I wanted that effect I could've gotten some good bud.  Other times, I get coke that reeks of ether and burns like paint thinner in my nose. It makes my lips, tongue and mouth numb, my heart beat fast, my stomach flip, and I feel f---in amazing. (the song "invincible" by adelitas way pretty much describes it) I want to listen to hard rock and dance like a stripper, I don't want to be alone, I want people to see me. Sometimes my nose will bleed, and the blood will make my upper lip numb. I want to talk about drugs, think about drugs, and do more drugs when I'm on this kind of coke.  I'm guessing thats the amphetamines talking right now...

Also, I noticed that the day after I do coke, i sometimes take OTC pills with 500 mg acetaminophen and 60 mg of caffiene. I take between 2 and 4 of these over a few hours for headaches. A bit later, I get this trippy, disconnected feeling, like I'm floating. I never knew acetaminophen had "recreational effects", but its pretty cool... Except when I'm sitting in an art class, trying to paint a lemon, and all of a sudden my hand isn't mine. I asked the teacher to take a break, and I wanted to go lay in the grass outside. Any ideas why this happens? It's only when I take the pills the day after doing coke

cant believe how many people see drinking on coke as such a bad thing, i think they go hand in hand... maybe cocaethyline should be viewed as a gift, or a miracle; the first time any drug has created another (your liver is overrated anyways, lol)... ive read about the risk involved. ive been doing this shit for years, and never had any problems. in all honesty, i couldnt see myself snorting blow without alcohol...

just how bad is a coke binge? I've hit about 4 or 5 rails today total but all spaced about 2 hours apart, and well as anyone knows after a night of doing coke (or day in this case) you probably aren't going to sleep anytime soon without the aid of benzos or seroquel or whatever, but I don't have those, I only have like .5 of pot and some clonidine that actually put me in a worse state instead of making me pass out unless combined with other OTC sleep aids which I also currently don't have, I'm well aware it was probably a stupid idea to do coke without benzos or whatever on hand but I did anyways, so now I'm wondering if it would be a bad idea to wait to sleep til tonight and would it be an even worse idea to do a few more rails through the day? if so, why? what am I risking? I appreciate the response in advance.

I used to make a tincture with weed that was much more potent than smoking.  I read a while back that if you bake weed for 5 min it activates something.  Check out the recipe for green dragon, and just turn the weed into capsules or eat it raw instead of making the tincture.  That'll put your ass right out.

**What shall I do with my last bit of coke...**


Picked up a half gram on saturday, which is way more than enough for me.  Would just grab quarter grams if I could, but no one sells that little.  So I did just under half it that night, and then sunday I woke up still having like a .30 left.


So I've just been doing small bumps since yesterday, still got about .15 left.  I wanted to hold it for next weekend but I keep finding myself going back for another small bump...


Anyway to just f*cking manage to hold it instead of bumping it all day lol.

Merging this with cocaine megathread since this doesn't warrant a thread of its own.


You can stop bumping it all day if you have the required self-discipline. One trick is to go out somewhere and leave the coke at home. Generally though, if you're alone with cocaine, only one thing is going to happen.

I don't think you are allowed to mention prices, however, I don't see how that was really a rip-off regardless.

No it won't kill you.. If you buy the good shit straight uncut it's bomb as hell I think everyone should do it but once you start you can't stop cuz coming down makes you want more and more. It's super addicting. But less addicting to heroin . Your super happy at first and nice to everyone then you get irritated with people them you just get depressed lol you talk non stop smoke cigs every 5 min. Coke is def not overrated it's my favorite drug!!

Wow I just got the strongest coke of my life from a delivery service in Brooklyn. Man do they have their shit on lock. The receptionist takes the order after verifying your name, she then uses her computer to determine where her delivery drivers are by using that sprint/nextel service for business owners who have a fleet and want to be able to walkie talki bleep each other as well as locate via GPS. She sends whoever is closest onto the next delivery. IMO its a pretty legit delivery service they got goin on there. On top of that, if a runner gets arrested they pay for counsel in return for not ratting.


The coke is nice fluffy coke that is almost like oily in texture.. ideally you would use a razor blade to cut it up. I have been getting dubs from Paterson which are soft/rocks/etc.. and I consider it to be 'good.' Well this stuff BLEW the ptown coke out of the water. 70mg hit me like a freight train and trumped the 200mg shots I have been doing by FAR. I got a orgasmic bellringer and a rush that I can only hope is what life feels like in heaven. It was just pure total bliss multiplied by 1,000,000.


Another cool, thing is that literally as soon as water hits the coke it turns to a 100% completely clear mixture./ I did nto even have to do a single stir (atleast not for the coke, for the dope I did).  Man I can't imagine what would have happened if I did a 200mg shot without testing it. I got scared that the 70mg shot was putting me 6' under but I leveled off nicely.

Just got some coke from a new dealer.... its beige crystallized coke in rocks, really really sticky not too hard.. The thing is... he says he got that from jamaica.... (he swallow or what ever) but the coke smell like ass ! ahahah I mean really It smells like shit. Its the best coke ive got so far I think, a bump and your heart race you dont feel your throat anymore and maybe a lil bit nausea.. after the second bump (like 30min-45min after) I felt nauseous probably like when I did freebase but I did not vomit. Ah the high is amazing, calm, and long lasting compared to any other cokes... (other cokes I can do lines, not bump every 15 min lol) Could it be really good stuff or just cuts that make me feel like that?

Have been IV'ng coke for the past week almost everyday. Usually only do it on the weekends but just recently got a better hook on way better shit and its hard to stay away. But IV coke is the way it was meant to be done, in my opinion.

I'd just like to say the cocaine megathread link on the 'list of megathreads' sticky does NOT WORK.

I notified an admin weeks ago, so just thought i'd let people know again. This thread needs to get some momentum going!


(p.s mephedrone one does not work either - they both direct you to something random)

That's f*cking disgusting man haha, their probably is traces of feces in it, do an acetone wash or something man!  


On another note, today marks day number 33 no coke.


Although I did ethylphenidate once which was sort of similar, but less of a high and less of a low.

yo i been trying to look around and cant find an answer so ill post it here. I understand about 1/3 of all cocaine that comes in is tainted with levamisole.  "washing" wont get rid of it so if there is some in cocaine i prurchase, will low doses of it actually do anything to make me ill in any way i dont mean line after line i mean more like bumps here and there spread out. from what i understand it cant be helped if there is some in it.

The last day I used cocaine was july 23rd, that means I'm 7 weeks and 5 days completely sober from cocaine ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Monday will mark 2 months, and other than some occasional use of the RC ethylphenidate, and with it etizolam, I'm completely clean of any other hard drugs ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Feels great to not be scrumabing together enough money every week to at least buy a gram of blow, and EPH has worked great as a "methadone-esque" solution to my cravings, just as methadone is used for heroin withdrawal.  This is great, a gram of EPH lasts me weeks without issue, is more potent, is far less impulsive IMO as far as re-dosing goes, and costs a fourth of the price.  Haven't had a cocaine craving in weeks either, EPH really helped in that category as well.  I can still see its addictive properties though, so this definitely isn't a permanent solution and I plan on dropping EPH all together soon as well.

Thanks ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Prior to this 7 weeks, 5 days clean (which I actually only just calculated right now, because cocaine was so far off my mind I wasn't even counting sober days anymore ^-^), the most I'd went clean was 15 days.  During a period from october 2011 to july 2012, I was using at least once a week if not more (other than a single 15 days clean I managed to do once, but than the following weekend quickly gave into the craving and phoned a dealer), and at the very least a half gram in a night, but at the worst parts over a ball in a weekend or even close to in a single night.  


Later in that habitual usage the comedowns got worse and worse, and the high I quickly had fallen in love with become more scarce, and every single time while coming down I would say to myself, this feeling sure as fuck ain't worth it, this is the last damn time ever.  And for a day or two after I would feel the same, still have that horrible come-down anxiety-ridden feeling in my mind and be happy with never doing coke again, but by day 3 or 4 I would forget the negatives and just remember the euphoria, causing me to use again the following weekend, or even sooner.


Thank god I finally had the courage one morning after a 8-ball binge in a night, to take my phone and delete all my dealers, as well as everyone that would even have their numbers.  Same goes for any connections through facebook.


That is what truly helped the most, by having no availability to the drug by placing a quick simple text, it helped tremendously to stop using.  I did try a few times to get dealers numbers through friends of friends but thankfully they never came through, and I haven't even attempted any purchase of the drug in like 6 weeks.


And even worse, just before I quit usage of cocaine I virtually never even snorted it anymore, but rather either did "foilies" where I added a bit of water with half and half coke/baking soda on foil and smeared it equally, and then smoked it, or I cooked it in a spoon and then smoked it off foil as well via chasing, cause where I live actual "glass roses" that are used as crack pipes aren't around in every store. (aren't around at all actually, never seen one). Looking back, I never ever though I'd smoke "crack", or technically ghetto foil freebase, but I so easily in that mind-set justified smoking it that way for the rush, thinking it was no big deal lol... Blocking out the fact that I was literally becoming a crack head.

Sadly almost 2 weeks ago on saturday september the 29th I relapsed and did two and a half lines of blow supplied by a friend.  I was so drunk I barely remember the usage, still remember that beautiful cocaine smell though.  But the following weekend I did MDMA and while rolling I was watching people at my house do blow and thinking god damn thank god I quit that shit, in my head I was just thinking "why the fuck are you guys doing nothing but talking over each other every 10 seconds in a conversation and talking shit to yourselfs even though your friends lol.  Chirping for fun once in a while is one thing, but every convo had everyone just talking shit every other line lol.  This interpretation was likely caused by the fact I was rolling tits on mdma that I think had a fair amount of MDA in it because I was tripping a bit too.


Anyways, so I had that small cocaine relapse 12 days ago, and before that I hadn't used for almost 10 weeks.  Either way, It ain't a big deal and it has already been 12 days since that small relapse and I'm not fiending at all.  When I had formed a small habit I couldn't help but use every weekend, so even just using one more time and then not using for almost 2 weeks again shows I have made serious progress.  Deleting my dealers and any sources at all helped a great amount though.  If I really tried I'm sure I could get a dealers number but I just don't care enough to try and am certain I will go to christmas without using again without problems.  I do plan on using on newyears though, but just as a treat.  New years and my birthday are both 6 months apart so it is perfect, i will only ever use on those two special occasions and the best thing is that the one dealer I do have would only sell it to me on my b-day and new-years because he's a non-greedy friend and a friend of my older bro, so I'm not remotely sweating temptation.  He'd never sell to me on any random weekend, and I know that for a fact because before originally quitting blow he was already just ignoring my txts to pick up, which lead me to another dealer (whom I've deleted now)

ahh coke is so easy for me to stay away from, i just don't know why it doesn't really appeal to me. And i've done it plenty of times to. I can't imagine IV'ing it, like after your shot when you feel antsy and your body is sensitive. I can't imagine poking a needle in me while i'm crashing from some coke, that seems so grimy ! : o

I think most of the the coke now is cut with bullshit, stuff like speed and you don't get the feel the good effects of coke. Your just amped up and geeked out.

If your lucky enough to know the difference between real coke and that shit their selling as coke (you'd be surprised how many people do not know the difference) and can get the good shit, hold on to that connect. Most of the dealers i buy from do not get high themselves so they don't know what they are selling. Has anyone else noticed this. I have bought ready rock and coke from many different people from the corner to people with a little weight and it can't be all garbage. Any ideas? I have read  LeJunk's purification process, does this really work? Is there any quicker or easier ways to get rid of pseudo or epedrine (same as amphetamines)? I have been using for almost 20 years and have noticed a huge difference in quality in the last 5 to 8 years. I think most people don't even realize the difference and regard a high amphetamine cut in coke as "good stuff". I thought I was the only crazy one thinking this but its good to read other people share the same thoughts. Sorry I went on and on but you seem like you know what your talking about. Any ideas??

Can anyone help me make sense of this.  Over the last two weeks I have IVed coke and crack.  Pretty size able amounts each time.  ONE time I got serious euphoria about 5-10 minutes worth, every other time nothing, and when I say nothing I mean nothing.  No elevated heart rate, no euphoria, no talkativeness... I just IVed a bag and I'm falling asleep... But person next to me gets blasted...


I don't understand.

Who here still thinks rock cocaine is "high-quality"?

They're just adding levamisole and rocking it up. Fuck that shit, there's practically just as much animal de-wormer as there is cocaine...

Most of the dealers i buy from do not get high themselves so they don't know what they are selling. Has anyone else noticed this. I have bought ready rock and coke from many different people from the corner to people with a little weight and it can't be all garbage. Any ideas? I have read  LeJunk's purification process, does this really work? Is there any quicker or easier ways to get rid of pseudo or epedrine (same as amphetamines)? I have been using for almost 20 years and have noticed a huge difference in quality in the last 5 to 8 years. I think most people don't even realize the difference and regard a high amphetamine cut in coke as "good stuff". I thought I was the only crazy one thinking this but its good to read other people share the same thoughts. Sorry I went on and on but you seem like you know what your talking about. Any ideas??

dude, getting cut coke is just a nightmare for me mentally. Amphetamines create the worst feelings in me, totally geeked out like you said, comedown lasts for hours... it is totally noticeable. In fact, it was a main factor that contributed to me seriously cutting back (Iv'd once in the last 3 months, used to do it as much as i could)


First times I sniffed coke, i barely got high... it wasn't until i started IV'ing it with heroin and getting drunk that it became totally magical. Doing cocaine without opiates and alcohol is disastrous for me... It creates a deep fear inside of me, coming down on cocaine without opiates/alcohol. honestly, so bad it makes me contemplate suicide.

Is it common for blow to cause your sinuses to totally close up a couple hours after use.....unless you sniff a tiny amount of coke and then it opens right back up again.....at least this is my experience. Now some new stuff is not having this effect on me, and generally not performing as i expect and im totally baffled as to if its crap/cut/best shit ever and i am not used to it or what. Doesnt have much taste to it either, and the drip is almost non existent.

**My last year**


I'm a massive "coke head". You know, the type that stays clean from any drugs for few weeks then have a massive cocaine binge for a few sleepless nights. (spend around £100-£1000 the more money i spend the more days i`m high) 


Using cocaine makes me feel like i am some *king of the world* type character in the first day of my binge. 

Then there is a huge difference in my high after the first night. Doing the same amount again without sleep (or a few hours sleep) or food and a lack of liquids. 

After the second night, £200 and using all my energy... I feel terrible, but will keep sniffing continuously until ive spent the same amount of money as Greece's Debt. 


My point is, shit cocaine makes you feel like youre in the 3rd day after a few hours. Good cocaine will plessure you for longer, but either way you`ll end up in the same state. SO use coke responsibly, if you complain too much.**![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)**

I'm male, 150 lbs, exercise/sweat a lot everyday, fast metabolism, and have to pass 5 panel test for job one week from last use of coke. Estimating on high side, i sniffed approx 12 grams, and plugged 3 grams. Over the last 3 weeks. Please expert advice, will i pass? All others i had were prescription opiates. Oxycodone/hydrocodone/morphine all pill form taken orally. Except some morphine plugged.  Im new to bluelight hope this is the right place to post this

By the way last opiate i had will be 8 days before test, and was cwe hydrocodone 80-100 mg. Morphine was weeks ago, so no worry. Coke was pure dealer says, but research and experience tells me it was cut, though not with meth or other stims. Seemed like just coke, but weaker. Last use of marijuana was over a month ago. And i eat healthy 3 meals/day veggies/fruit. Any knowledge is appreciated.

Sorry for being out of topic. 


Greece's debt?  


Firstly your expression is out of meaning.


Second: The Western World owes to Greece almost everything, in terms of providing the fine materials for the building of modern civilization , technological achievements and scientific advancements, starting a couple thousand  years ago.


Third:  All the countries in the World owe trillions of dollars. Many countries owe multiple amounts than Greece. 

Just for your information.


If everyone is in debt, who is the loaner behind the curtain? 


Food for thought.

wondering this right

i dont do cocaine

but i have indulged in IV cocaine about 3 times

with dimes of hard

first stuff i had, put vinegar to it, some of it dissolved, but there was a white residue left over

shit was rocket fuel. ringing ears all that

get some hard from somewhere else, for someone else, got broken off right

mix it up, all dissolved clean, shot it, felt a little rush, but mostly nausea

2nd shot and i was puking out of a moving car, but not high

wtf was that

i was shooting heroin all day the 2nd time, but then again i was the first time (with the rocket fuel) too.

wat is this i dont even

and the 2nd time i used only enough vinegar to dissolve it, first time i used 30 units.

2nd time coke too, dude who paid for it/wanted it smoked it, said it was above average quality

so why did i get literally like no high but the nausea?

What's up fellas, I've recently become a weekend binger of cocaine. I recently got put on probation and I fucked up and am pretty sure I have to test TOMORROW at around 8PM. I didn't binge at all this weekend but today at 4PM I insufflated a small dose of 150mg. I read the benzoylglycine will stay in your system roughly 4-5 days even with small doses used while clean. Is there any chance of me passing? Or am I going to have to dilute the hell out of my urine and pray for the best? It will be a NIDA-5 dipstick test. Anyone have any input?

Just what I pulled up real quick about that substance, since I'd never heard of it before. Stims aren't my thing so I bow to the wisdom of Google lol:


"Benzoylecgonine, also known as ecgonine benzoate, is the main metabolite of cocaine. Produced by hydrolysis, benzoylecgonine can be detected in urine for a minimum of 5 days after usage of cocaine. Heavy usage can lead to detection up to a month after usage, and it can take heavy users up to four months to clean out their system completely"


So yeah, dilute and pray bro, dilute and pray.........


And if by the grace of God you slide by this time, quit fucking around with stupid shit like this that will get you sent back to the slammer. If you fail, throw yourself on the mercy of your PO and beg for another chance. Not all POs are power hungry little dicked undercover nutjobs getting off on power tripping. Most but not all.

I believe the member Lejunk made a few how-to's, involving pure acetone washes and stuff. I dont have a link, but you can google "the cocaine handbook" for all the info.

No, there are legit ways to remove cuts. Acetone wash removes some, but it gets more complicated if you want to remove ephedrine, etc.

I tried cola for the first time last night at a NYE party. I did two lines each about 2 inches long.


I had already drank a fair amount and the effects were subtle but definite.


It definitely wasn't cut with an amp since I was surprisingly able to sleep well afterwards.


I plan on buying some saline nasal spray to clean my sinuses and what not.


Anyone care to speculate how much damage I did to myself? I'm not concerned just curious.


It can't be as damaging rolling. Then again, I mixed cola and alcohol which combines to make that cocathylene.

Why do I like cocaine so fucking much? I did it tonight and I feel like I could conquer the world. But I always get dry mouth and INSANE heartburn. Sometimes I get paranoid and think I'm having a heart attack or that the powder went into my lungs and is damaging them. But if I take tums it usually goes away. But man! It's so hard to stay away from this stuff.

I gotta ask, if there is anyone who is certain they've had very high quality coke, maybe they can help. I've done coke many times and never really been too impressed. I've had all sorts, all smells, all tastes, all numbs, I've had fiending for more and chest pains, but I've never had the "I am God" feeling that is supposed to come with high purity stuff. My ex was from Miami and tried coke there vs Midwest usa and said we don't even know what real coke is. Now I'm wondering, could it just be that it just doesn't do it for me? Or will high purity cocaine do it for anyone?

Try it orally. I'm from close to SA and I get some fishscale shit. Even sniffing it is absolutely shitty IME. I switched to doing it orally and must say that the effects mimick that of a good roll. With all the empathy n shit. No extreme euphoria but it's decent. Much better ride than sniffing it. IMO cocaine is quite overrated anyway. I'm pretty much done with it. Maybe I'll only do it when I wanna get out of a stupor or something. Otherwise I see no fun in it. 


Even when I used to sniff it i'd only have ONE line. Any more never did shit for me but make me more tweaked. Sometimes it's not your thing. Maybe this is the case. It's no good anyway.

Thanks, that's what I'm thinkin...just seems people who like it really really love it and I've tried everyone's stuff...paid top dollar prices n did it out of people's bags who were tellin me it's good stuff. I think it just isn't my thing. Oral sounds interesting, what's your dosage range for that?

200-400mg


never tried more than 200mg in a cap.


usually i get sufficiently intoxicated on booze and have a small dose of Valium in me and it makes the ride all the more smoother. Then take the first cap and redose 1.5hrs later

Cocaine could be an OK stim, if it wasn't for the ridiculous fiending.


The God feeling you will only get in the 3rd day of a meth bender OR if you IV Coke


Id suggest ritalin. OK duration. OK euphoria. No fiendinf whatsoever. And is worth IVing.

I've had stuff tested and it was top of the line stuff. I can't remember ever thinking insufflating cocaine was all that, but that's because I spoiled it with freebasing and eventually mainlining. Now most coke offered to me as powder I politely refuse. Anyway, godlike confidence and shit? Hell no. I'd say it's a more clean, emotional, slightly euphoric (but not vastly) stimulant compared to amphetamines which are quite neutral and functional. Smoked and IV it's the shit, but for me, even really, really pure HCl is meh.

I almost find the purer and cleaner the blow the more fiendish I am with it.  Bought two grams of the best coke from the tor sites, gone in a day just sniffing.  Have done upto 5 in the spoon with bicarb before in a day between 2. Of the best I can possibly score flake.  Even tried IV a couple of times, 50mg and 75mg twice with two diff batches, not for me.  But sniffing is a problem, it literally even smells nice when its just right! Crack aswell, 3 minute buzz didn't seem worth it.

Hello folks. Swim is new here, and will contribute either way, but as swim types this, swim is pretty lit up, and thinks it says he cannot start his own thread. Is the ability for him to start his own thread predicated on donating? If so, totally cool...if this is made clear in the sign up process I apologize. Swim wanted to start a thread about recommended movies to watch when swim has no benzo's or ambien etc...swim has always found light or comedic TV shows/movies are a huge help...for instance - watching multiple episodes of It's Always Sunny in Phili is a great come down show...swim was wondering if anyone else has any suggestions for those tough days when the come down is uber rough...thanks!

Watching films on cocaine is pretty wasteful. I can do it after a couple of days but that first day you need music or people to chat to. When coming down I usually just bludgeon myself with wine/beer and cannabis.

Pricy and cut. Not to mention about its shitty comedown. I can literally say I got sick of it when I was younger.

Still going. 6 grams in 7 days of various batches of pure pearlescent flakes. Some days as much as 1.5g others just 3 lines. Don't feel too bad about it somehow except the outstanding bill.

Can't beat a good few lines of nice gear though :D seems like every bit I buy lately keeps getting better. Starting to sting alot of money but a few grams of lovely stuff infront of me and some £50 a gram powder coke that's still not bad. It would be hard to keep your nostrils keen in this situation I guess... :D

My friend says hes done more than 7g of uncut cocaine to himself in a week, in the past week i've done 5g. I'm just wondering how much really is too much? Would we say more than 1g a week is a habit?

Experience with the EZTest Cocaine test kits?   


EZTest for Cocaine Purity comes back as dark burgundy red -- "Very High Cocaine Content" -- exactly has hoped for.  


Same stuff.  EZTest for Cocaine Cuts comes back as a really dark blackish-yellow.  Any reaction is bad on this one in general but the color it is turning seems to map to either Phenacetine or Ephedrine, I can't really tell which.  


How to interpret these two together?  How does it have high purity but then also says it's cut with something.  


Any input appreciated.

I'm new to this site, so I'm not familiar with how everything works. Anyway, here's my question..


If someone has been shooting coke for 3 days straight, how long should they wait between shots? Basically, say they've been doing about 1g of coke per day, of very clean, good quality coke. They've got 1 shot left in their possession..and just did a strong shot at about 5pm (about 35min ago). If they wait till the next morning around 8am, will they get a pretty good rush? Or could they hit it sooner and get a good rush? Sorry if it is confusing...trying to explain to the best of my ability haha. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

So I got introduced to a new dealer and he is the guy that supplies all the dealers I've gone through since I first started two years ago. I got a gram to start with and when I put it on my car manual the smell was strong. It smelled strongly of paint and just smelling it gave me a rush. I licked the baggie it was in and it numbed my mouth pretty good. When I inspected it I noticed it looked was very shiny like a pearl. I flashed my light on it and it was beautiful. I searched up Fishscale cocaine and what I had in front of me was what came up in my search results. I crushed some up took a bump and instantly felt the effects. No nose burn unlike all the other shit I was getting before. I was already high after a couple bumps which usually would take 5 in each nostril of the shit I was getting before. My nose would always bleed after a session and burn like hell for most of the night. This new stuff not a single drop of blood or burning in my nostrils. I took a picture of it for you to see what I had. [http://image.doc2pdf.net/temp/image.jjpg](http://image.doc2pdf.net/temp/image.jjpg)

I skipped a few pages so I hope this hasn't been asked. If so direct me to the original question. 


I'm a casual user. I can do a little daily for a week or two or none at all for awhile. So I'm not worried about longterm affects or urban legends like Stevie Nicks hole in her nose, but sometimes my nostrils just kill me. I don't think its a cut or quality issue because it happens with different batches from different sellers.

After I've been using I rinse my nose with saline solution and use a q-tip to get any blood out. Is this helping or hurting? Any better suggestions??

Antipsychotics being used in cocaine addiction treatment?


Hello,


So let me give a brief background story, so I was admitted to a hospital because of my "addiction", which wasn't really serious tbh. It all started in late 2014, when I was going to electronic clubs and festivals here in Brazil and using mdma pills mostly, one time a friend had some coke and asked if I wanted some, I was really reluctant because of the stigma cocaine has specially here in Brazil, but used it anyway... long story short I felt a huge increase in confidence (I'm really shy), and felt like a new person, he gave me that g of coke. I actually only used it in special events, and treated it as a "magic" social lubricant wtf haha, it lasted me 2 months... I liked it specially, because it's not so obvious that you're high on coke, as oppsed to mdma that you just use in places where peopel are rolling.


Then I started buying a g every weekend, there was no fun without some yayo, going to bathrooms at bars chopping up lines on my phone at first I was really comfortable with this, then became a little paranoid people would notice. But it was fun doing with friends talking about so many subjects, which I'm not comfortable doing sober, not even alcohol makes me more social, it only makes me tired and sleepy, so in my head it'd help me socialize, I never used alone, always when I needed to be social, a g would last me a long time.


Then one day at work, I was kinda bored went to the bathroom, and decided why not use some to get me through the day, did one line, felt like a new man, started talking to people, was happy working even though tired... you can imagine how it went down, started using to work to socialize and shit.


Fast-forward a few months I decided to use steroids, in hopes it would shift my focus awway from coke, I loved the roids, gained a lot of muscle, strength... but it made me a bit impatient and angry at people.. I was obcessed about getting girls, and this girls I was putting alot of effort into ignored me, and I just lost it broke some shit at home.. and went back to doing cocaine my mom caught me doing some lines, i didn't even care like it was not a big deal.


My mom wanted me to seek treatment in a facility to get clean, at first I thought thats not the case... but then one day I was confused, and went for a visit at this psychiatric ward with my family, and accepted their decision.


It's known to be a psychiatric hospital, but they have drug addiction treatment aswell, what I don't undestand is why they give heavy doses of antipsychotics in the first weeks, like risperdone, haldol IM, quetiapine, Chlorpromazine, Levomepromazine some mood stabilizers too which turned me into a zombie, had some Tardive dyskinesia, could barely eat as my jaw was unresponsive, and they give it to all pacients, for the entire treatment.


I was even strapped to the bed once, because I got irritated by the nurses and staff, they contain you and inject some haldol and Promethazine.


Even after you're released from the hospital they give the drugs to you, but what I don't get is why give this drugs, what relation do they have with cocaine addiction.


I think I developed gyno cause of the prolactin rise, and after I got out I developed some premature ejacualtion, and im depressed too, and i tried some coke and I dont euphoria from it anymore, also i believe that it has some relation to the drugs they gave me. MInd you Im not taking them anymore.


I never heard of rehab centers giving these drugs to apparently treat some addiction decease.


What are you guys opnions on this? could you shed some light on my situation I'm really confused and tired right now

Don't know if this is cocaine or not. A friend of mine purchased 7 grams of cocaine last night. I saw a picture they text to someone, they were holding it in the palm of their hand, it looked like it could have been pasty all clumped together somewhat kind of like Silly Putty. It was shiny like it could have been somewhat wet. It was white in color or maybe a slight off-white color or a slight creamy white color and it could have also been just the quality of the picture. Is this a form of cocaine? They referred to it as "good news". Really just wondering if it could be cocaine they were holding in their hand.

There's no way we can tell you just by seeing a picture, just a proper lab test will tell you. Because of that substance ID is against the rules

Maybe cocaine that was moist from them holding it in their hands..They should not be holding coke in their hands because any sweat will be absorbed into the coke since it is water soluble..high humidity will make coke clumpy and sticky, but letting it dry out in a lower humidity area will let it get back to more powdery, although some people cut the coke with stuff that will make it clumpy or sticky, especially novices to cutting it.

This stuff looked almost like Silly Putty or molding clay  That had a little bit of a shine to it. Houston does have a lot of humidity. I was surprised that they were holding it, if it was cocaine, in the palm of their hand.  the person my friend sent the picture to said "iv got some good news" and then sent the picture. The person they sent it to replied "wow! what is that?" and my friend replied "good news!" I'm just wondering if this sounds like cocaine or if it's something completely different.

Ok, so I think I finally did too much crack. I knew this day was coming no matter how cautious I was cuz I just fucking LOVE bellringers. My only symptoms are anxiety and HUGE bells pealing in my ears until it's hard to hear actual sound (yes, I'm hard of hearing but I was BORN hearing and I wear hearing aids and I know what sounds are supposed to sound like. But this is like the worst-EVER case of tinnitus.) Slight headache but that's typical of me. My heart rate is NOT fast because I took a beta blocker before starting on this binge. I've consumed 5 dimes in the course of, well, overnight (9 PM to 5 AM.) I read somewhere it's NOT a good idea to take a beta blocker because of mixed signals to the heart or something but I don't have benzos and this is the next best thing. Paranoria setting in; keep checking that my door is closed and that the cops aren't here. I still have some left that I was SUPPOSED to save for the next day (today, but AFTER sleeping!) The good news is, no nausea, vomiting, or itchiness. Or seeing things that aren't there. I tend to get some faded LSD flashbacks when I do any other drug but that's also normal for me (I've consumed WAY MORE LSD in my life time than any one person has a right to, and is good for them!) Some chest pain. I had it earlier tonight but chalked it up to Pepcid. A few of those made it go away. Guess I'll try that again. Anyone got any helpful tips for me? And NO, unless it is life=threatening I WILL NOT go to the hospital as I have no insurance and the resulting bill would put me so far in debt I'll never crawl out.

How effective is taking fish scale when it gets flaky by mouth? Like taking a little flake by mouth every 10 to 15 minutes? Is all that's going to do is just make your mouth numb or will you get the effects of the cocaine? It taste like a cross between brake cleaner and antifreeze.

Hey all, can someone tell me about fishscale? I was at a party and dude gave me a pretty small line maybe 2 inches. I tooted it, and it was probably the best I ever had. I can't explain it but it was super clean and I felt mellow and zooming at the same time. Zero paranoia or crash. So what's the deal ?

Fishscale is just good coke. That's what good coke is like. I'm a little jealous. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

So I've been doing coke for a bit now, only ever in small amounts (I've never got more than 1.5 grams). I only do it once every 2-3 weeks so I don't kill my wallet. Something I've noticed though is that I have this immense fear of having leftover coke after a night out, because I feel like having it for days in a row puts me more at risk of becoming dependent on it. My friends love me because i  literally spoon out bumps to ppl because of this fear. 


Anyone else share this?

nod true good coke is somewhat "blissful" and surreal, slow feeling.  not to mention that taste the rat will eat instead of food and water until dead.

I'm not really sure how to make a post on here so if someone could help me out that would be great!!! My first time I shot up coke was about 3 years ago. When I did it the first time I fell in love. I had been shooting heroin for about 3 months before I tried coke. But the second I got that first rush I only cared about dope if I was sick other than that, I could careless. That is of course until I ran out of course and my only solution for making the come down not completely unbearable was dope in that case dope was my best friend and then my mentality would switch to I hate coke. Even tho I fell in love immediately. I rarely went out of my way to look for it. And when I did get it, it was only once maybe every 2 months and I've never done it longer then 2 days in my life.. until now.. as of tomorrow it will mark 14 days since I've been on coke shooting binge with the exception of maybe 3 or 4 days tops ( I was in the hospital for 3 days for completely unrelated reasons but still got high 2 out of the 3 nights I was there ? Anyway to sum up my rant, I've been reading a lot of threads in which people are asking what the symptoms of a cOcaine overdose is. It seems like the most popular answers are "sweating, shaking, blurry vision, ringing in ears, fast heart beat" my problem with all

I've always heard this drug is over-rated but I finally got fishscale and in my opinion it's under-rated. 


It makes me feel all chill and smooth and slick, and* really *euphoric.


Not to mention, helps me focus. I can't handle any stimulants like adderall or even coffee as I have a panic disorder but this one is fine. It seems mellow but energizing, with a bit of a crash. 


Also, it keeps my mind off heroin, at least for a while. I haven't used in 12 hours and normally I don't go 4 without a line. If the line is small I can get sick in a few hours so 12 is definitely not normal and has to due with the C use which I'd say has been 50 milligrams total. Also, it helps with the constipation associated with chronic opiate use, just like green tea does. And I can sleep shortly afterwards (like 2 hours). Very functional. I make sure to stay hydrated, take magnesium for the vasoconstriction, and also have several cups of valerian tea to relax a bit (and at some point my daily benzo... haha...)


This is totally under-rated, I always hear people say this is just stomped on shit and I think most of the time it is. I perhaps just got lucky for once, because I don't recall it being very much anything like this. Edgier. More abrasive. It's definitely a little fiendish still since I've kept it going for most of the day. The one major thing for me is that it really drastically reduces H withdrawals. I was not expecting that. I should have needed a hit several hours ago. If I was rich I would totally use this on a regular basis, but the crash is different from being sick which I am very used to by now. The crash feels like it's unhealthy for the body a bit, while opiates certainly are not to any great extent apart from the cycle of addiction which is mainly related to prohibition and inflated costs of these things that should have much less value than they do. It's just an alkaloid from a plant. 


I really need a break from H in terms of tolerances, no intention to quit that is, and haven't been able to manage it after several years the withdrawal has become very relentless so, yeah... not promoting what I'm doing haha but if I'm using C instead of dope and my tolerance to H is lowering while C isn't really my thing, but it's keeping me out of severe pain and extreme wd's - I mean, it can and probably does work. I don't think they complement each other as much as people say though. I feel like the C prevents me from appreciating my beloved H as much as I normally do. I prefer to get back to using the H when I'm coming down from the C, not while I'm still on it. I actually really dislike mixing the two, I feel like they interfere with each other but H will eliminate most of the crash of course. 


Also, it's even a painkiller somehow. I didn't think C was a known painkiller, but I live with extreme chronic pain in my spine and it helps a little bit. Not very much, nothing like H which makes it evaporate, but enough to hold me over for several hours. Completely lifts the withdrawal depression and despite all the uncomfortable physical symptoms I have always found psychological symptoms to be some of the worst of all. All of this is remarkable for something that is reputed to be a shitty, stomped on party drug mainly for people who are uneducated regarding drug use. Fishscale is the only stimulant I have any interest in at all. The doses I am using are around 10mg - I have girlfriend who has used it for 10 years anyway and she says it is very good quality. I've used it before too and hated it because it was cut trash. I guess I just felt like writing something other than "this is stomped on crap these days, not worth it, don't do it." As this is obviously way less harmful than something like Mdma or methamphetamine to the body, and way too many people do too much M these days. In my opinion this stuff is way less damaging than M but that's just my view. 


Music is vital. I've got this underworld/slightly sleezy/mysterious midnight vibe going on right now. It's chill. I think it's the coke but also the music I'm listening to (DJ Krush...Meiso) - I have it on repeat because this album just goes so well with the drug(s). Definitely improved confidence too. I feel really chilled out for a stimulant, and I get panic attacks really easily but I haven't had one at all. I do feel a little edgy but I expected that. I would never want to overdo it with this and it would be very easy to for someone not tolerant. I'd have a panic attack I think. 


It's nice having wee bits of really damn pure H and C at the same time. The C is a luxury while the H is a necessity, and I am by no means presently rich. It's tough enough to keep myself well. So I will enjoy this while it lasts, hopefully use it to lower my tolerance a bit since I really need to go from a point a day to half of one, but I never thought I'd enjoy a stimulant stronger than green tea. Especially to this extent having a high degree of depth to the nature of the high.

Fishscale typically means washed coke, namely and usually acetone washed coke to rid impurities (besides levamisimole which disolves with the coke) and it is a bit cleaner prolly 30-60%. It is a rock that glimmers like fishscales. All I ever had was touted as fishscal, in the united states, most was not but about 1/2 was actual shimmery rocks that really fuck you.


THE THING to watch out for is re-rocking after cutting with hair-spray to make it rock and shine. SMELL IT, if it smells like fingernail  polish that is the acetone which is typically a good sign in low quantities meaning a wash was done.

So new member here. I've done more than my share of cocaine over my years but never got technical with it. After reading up on here I have wanted to try a acetone wash on some to take some of the impurities out. Some of the tagged links I've found here don't open and I'm not a scietist but I do wanna make sure I'm using the right acetone and properly doing it. I'm not sure on how to make the anhydrous acetone since I read that even .01% can dissolve everything. Would love some clear steps and products to use. 


Thanks in advance!

**Cocaine 101. MUST READ!**


Listen guys, I'm getting annoyed with constantly looking up what effects cocaine have. You know when your off your noodle and you start researching whether or not your going to die or not, well imma put an end to all this and hope you save this thread. 


1st things 1st I'm a regular user I have been for 20+ years and I'm a business man all over Europe so I can guarantee I have tried it all.  and one things for sure nothing is 100% unless your getting it while it's just out the oven. Or you know a very good source. 


2nd of all the effects, first time users are going to use Google obviously, I still do it when I'm jamming on my own or in my offices. Trust me I have went Pete tong. 


OK the obvious one... fast heartbeat. It's a stimulant your blood pressure is gonna rise it's asking itself "what the Fuck is going on?" "DO NOT TAKE COKE REGULARLY (OR AT ALL) if you have any sort of brain, heart, vascular or lung disorder. Seriously DON'T"

Anyway stimulants increase your blood pressure. The coke you took on that binge will hit it's peak at the comedown so when your chilled you will feel it more. At the point where you start getting a headache all over but especially at the back STOP it's pressure building up between your tonsils (brain tonsils). If pressure gets stuck in there boy prepare for a nasty 10" needle I'm your spine, it's thee scariest worst painful experience of my life! If you feel your heartbeat is causing discomfort and you think your going to die... let me just put this too rest... YOUR NOT you can die off the shit you get off the street after about 5G in a night but the pure stuff. You would need to do a Scarface to die guys! 


If you start freaking out and google your symptoms it will always say your going to die. Take it from me go home or wherever you are practice your deep breaths on the way slow and steady don't be tempted to use the last bit in the bag (save it for tomorrow... you will need it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png).)Go home sit back hands behind your head and deep breaths, some say sitting I'm a shower stimulates your high better, but I'm my opinion it calms me down DO MOT SMOKE ANY FORM OF CANNABIS! that would just stimulate it even more and you will hit "The Fear" once you do that your on your own man. After your shower (if you do with continued deep breathing) you should feel better. But you have that come down to deal with. I have found in my personal experience that a bit off Valium from the doctors sorts you right out. It's worked with people that had anxiety attacks border personality disorder, ADHD (MYSELF) and loads more mental disorders. DEEP BREATHING IS KEY!!! if none of that works it's cause you done it on the basis of ignorance to your disorder that I mentioned at the start. If you don't have any that you know of. You should seek medical advice and make an appointment with your Dr. 


Side effects below are normal and can sometimes last for 48 hours (usually). 


Sore head 

Sick 

Instant diarrhea (first bump usually. It's because it's a stimulant. Or you just bought laxative if it's continuous) 

Euphoria

Alertness

Tingling 

Weird hand movements

Alarming heart rate 

Paranoia 

Talkative

Aggressiveness

Emotional 

Chilled 

Quiet 

Stiffness of body 

Sore eyes 

Tiredness 

Jerks 

Difficulty breathing 

Bunged nose 

Burning nose 

Numbness in face and teeth (normal!!!) 

Runny nose 

Nose bleed

Stinging nose 

Inflamed sinuses 


If you know any other side effects please add I'm sorry I can't think right now I'm noodled as we speak... oh yeah forgetfulness haha. 


OK. How to tell the good cocaine from the bad cocaine. NOT PURITY before you all start. 


First things first, if you get a guy willing to give you a tester by all means do it, ask them. The worst case is they say no and you loose or win! 


"This is my personal experience and it's never let me down" 


GOOD COCAINE: 

If your dealer gives you in rock form doesn't necessarily mean it's "pure" (I have been bumped off quite a few times by "emergency dealers") visually inspect your rock out the bag on a plate so it doesn't melt hold up to the light and check if it has a shimmer.. like a pearl or fish flake look. If it does that's GOOD it's one thing you can tick off. Next is to smell it. If you smell the rock and go "pweeew wee" that's also GOOD (petroleum smell the stinkier the better) next crush it up on the plate (or bag if your going out) and start to make a line. (I use a credit card on my first line them a razor after) cut a line with your crushed up clumps try make it room temperature. Don't put it next to something hot you will dry it out ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) when your cutting if it is soft to the cut and bits aren't "pinging" everywhere then that is also GOOD! (Don't mistake pinging from crunching some coke is pressed really compact and you will get the odd one or two bits flying). And last snort that bitch up !  If it goes clean up and it's a sudden rush it tastes like petrol and your off your face it's good shit!!


BAD COCAINE: 

OK so I get promised when I'm traveling "best stuff about" and it's "pure crap" luckily I have contacts now. In the event you do end up in that situation here are most of the warning signs to look out for. 


1. If it's anything but white, it's BAD 

2. No petrol smell, no go! 

3. Crumbled or pre chopped? Most definitely been cut with BAD things. 

4. What looks like dark specks I'm your baggie it's been tampered with something dodgy don't go. (Some say it's due to it being snuggled in coffee beans but if you reached stage 4 by now.. would you even risk it) 

5. If it pings while chopping it's cut with something laying about the house (baking soda, salt, paracetamol etc... you should be throwing it in the bin at this point and accept your loss) 

6. If you do end up snorting it like the fool that you are. And you get instant numbness and you end up saying (oh wow I'm off my face I'm completely numb). Get your friend to slap your face as hard as you can. Cause sorry to say it's Novocaine. (Teething powder) good coke numbs seconds after the bump. 

7. Your nose. Once you snort BAD coke it should sting after the first couple. Sometimes the 1st time (if it stings the first time and it's all of the above in "bad coke" throw it away. You do not want to have a nose if you finish it. Your nose will be on fire ! 


Your nose...


So onto the main event. The big beak! OK so first time users will experience a nose bleed. Without a doubt. I still do after 3g on a quiet night but I have a higher tolerance. Once you get that nose bleed.. "try not to use that same nostril for a while. And stick to your own straw too" it's normal. Your attacking your membrane (mines still here thankfully) 

Your nose will be major blocked after a night on the "sesh" it's your sinuses. Your Putin something up your nose that wants to attack your membrane and corrode it away. So it's getting inflamed that's why you get a blocked nose. Runny nose is normal... it's the glands trying to produce a barrier to repair what you just damaged. So constant blowing of the nose is a certainty. (This could last for days). 

Best way to handle this in my own way is to rinse your nostrils after every couple of lines warm water just sniff the water rinse it out. (IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS LET ME KNOW!!!) 


Again if you have any input on bad cocaine please let others know! 


If your reading till the end of this thread. You really shouldn't be doing drugs man. Just stop, they Fuck your life up. Don't do drugs.

Nice post, I'd like to add in something for inexperienced users. Cocaine in itself, even before its cut and turned into smokable forms/etc., is a dangerous drug due largely in part to its specific side effects. Vasoconstriction combined with increased heart rate and blood pressure is a perfect recipe for a heart attack, and with increased use in frequency comes greater risks because the substance destroys cardiovascular tissue on contact and this is tissue that will never fully grow back. That being said, I do love letting the white lady come visit from time to time. I don't partake the substances abuse more than once a month, with the typical schedule being once every few months when one of us finds some thats too good to pass up. 


I'd also like to add in my personal treatment for the dreaded "coke nose," and the comedown. From my few years of experience, there is no 100% cure-all that doesn't come with its own whiplash. You can use mucinex nasal spray, which uses the active ingredient "oxymetazoline" but after a day or so of use you will get a stuffy nose from actually *not *using the spray, its a habit forming substance but does work wonders for instant relief. If anything, use it before bed and it will help, and is only a few bucks at any grocery or drug store. Personally, here is what I do to deal with the dreaded comedown and "coke nose":


-No prep for the nose before indulging, and no water during the use. For me the water doesn't do much except make the drip hit really hard and I end up swallowing a good amount.

-Once I'm out and ready to head into the comedown, I boil water for tea and my sinus rinse, and take a double dose of nyquil. I don't usually have access to benzo's or even opiates, but if you do they work absolute wonders for easing the onset of sleep and putting oneself in a general feeling of comfort. It goes without saying that bud is nice to have too. Anyways, give it about an hour from your last dose, then take your benzos or opiates and start a smoke sesh if it please you. Since stimulants suppress appetites you'll likely be on an empty stomach so the onset of the medication may be quicker than usual, a good thing depending who you ask.

-Around the same time I'm ready to smoke and take any benzo's, so an hour more or less from the last dose, I go to the bathroom and do a thorough, sometimes two sinus rinses. Personally, I use the NeilMed Sinus Rise and it can be had for around $15 from a supermarket or drugstore, and that's for the starter kit that includes like 100 packets of the rinse solution along with everything else you need. The procedure is a bit awkward at first but I'm so happy I read a post from another member on here suggesting a sinus rinse. It makes a night and day difference with the intensity and recovery of coke nose, including easing a little bit of the burning once the anesthetic properties of blow wear off. 

-Once sleep is finally ready to take hold of me, if my nose is clogging up I use the mucinex spray before bed only, and only do one spray in each nostril. This keeps me comfortable long enough to go to sleep, but sometimes this isn't necessary. In the morning, my secret weapon is nasacort. Its an intranasal glucocorticoid, and is not habit forming like the oxymetazoline. It takes about an hour to an hour and a half to kick in, and has helped me recover after I went on multiple-day binges. The nasacort is rather expensive at $15-20 but lasts a while and IMO/IME is worth the price for its role is recovering from a coke binge. 


One last tip, is to only buy as much as you want to do in that one sitting/session/binge because it has been my experience and pretty much that of everyone I know who's messed with blow, that there is no moderating the stuff in terms of saving it for another time or weekend. I used to stock up when I found really fire stuff thinking I'd save it for a rainy day or something, only to find myself up for the past 24 hours working on killing a whole ball of absolute flame to myself.

**Take with a grain of...salt?**


All very good points. I just want to add a different aspect about the mind. 


Because of my location I have found some pretty good stuff. BUT! It has taken time and a lot of trial and error. As well as learning what is good coke, and what is bad coke. Which only comes from living! I don't partake as much as I used to (growing up is a rad/daunting thing) but when I do, I know who to call and it is never a disappointment...consistent. Please please please don't do bad cocaine. What a waste of money, emotions, and time. 


However when you find your secret squirrel stash...I say this 


In my opinion it's all about your mindset. If you have a semi deep understanding of what cocaine IS and what it "represents" grasp that it's  supposed to be FUN! (Cocaines history is very interesting) but...VIBES! great talks and interactions with strangers of friends!! I would go as far to say share the fuckin stuff. Nowadays I don't even trip about it. I know I'm going to do my toots, get euphoric, talk talk talk, smoke ciggies, and have a grand ol time. But thats only because i have come to realize it has the depth of a kiddie pool compared to other substances. And I mean that in the utmost respect to all the users. Compared to say LSD, coke doesn't do much for the conscious expansion of your MinD. But boy is it a fucking barn burner. 


Anyway what I'm trying to say (I think) is don't covet thy blow. UNDERSTAND that there is never enough. Don't put the coke onto a pedastool where it doesn't belong. Share good times with your friends and maybe a couple skanky vulchers. Fuck it. For when you understand that there is much more than huddling in a bathroom bickering of who pitched on what or squawking about line size, there's so much FUN KoOky times in it! Share, love, and don't be a butthole about it.

^Imo it's never safe to combine CNS depressants like alcohol and benzos as this'll increase the risk of a black out (particularly if you took a stimulant) and dangerous respiratory depression

A question :


If the substance numbs the gums it is most probable, that it is cocaine or not ? I thought I'd have street phet but the effects are not what I expected so I guess it might be, that the source confused his miniscule speed stash with on of the yayo probes, that usually change the owner inside their tavern, or not ?


The effects are not negative. Just not what I expected. No typical 100% rational unemotional phet rush, which I was aiming for. Instead a sharp minded, albeit hyper talcative empathetic effect, that is useless for me.

A friend who is experienced with coke confirmed that it is "good stuff" (high purity coke). For me it is just rubbish, kind of like mephedrone light, not as cranked out but nevertheless useless. I also overdosed, thinking it was average street speed so ...


At least now I can say, that RTI-111 is not far from real coke. RTI is a bit more dopaminergic and has stronger side effects and a shorter effects window.

It's definitely possible. Some people absolutely love it but the time or two I tried it I didn't find it very addictive at all, I could take it or leave it but I've seen a few people go batshit crazy spending every cent they had on it. Not a cheap habit.

I think they just need to legalize some of the good, relatively harmless, phenethylamines ... Lol even Spice was more damaging than street phet.


Many people get addicted to coke too fast. They usually don*t drink alcohol on the plus side. I dunno  what's worse. Integrating coke in everydaylife or booze.

Howdy all, a guy I read about has been running all sorts of tests on a yellow tinged, slightly greasy, almost-but-not-quite crumbly batch of coke that is supposedly incredibly light on the nose and gives a great buzz.


Two issues - when he ran a simple foil test apparently the sample gave off a strong smell of original flavour bubblegum - nothing like a -tose smell. He isn't sure what this could be.


The other oddity was that despite leaving no residue of note, I'm  told the sample left a stain somewhat darker gold than achieve with a pharma sample.


Are these likely to be due to related alkaloids or might there be something in there that he hasn't encountered?  He was saying that he has no experience of pemoline and suspects it may have been added (no idea why, I don't know that drug).  Is this common, and if so is it put in as a base or as a salt? Can they be blended at base and resalted? If so, how do you get it out?


Any thoughts?


Cheers peeps.

Im quite educated in performance enhancing drugs and roid rage is a myth people that have anger issues on steroids have or had anger issues beforehand and the extra hormones just increase that natural aggressive personality if your not an aggressive person you wont get any sort of 'roid rage' as i havent on the few courses ive used and  ow would be the time id get aggression issues as im using tren as its the most anabolic steroid there is lol but yet again ive never taken all three together so i dont know what the reaction will be but im a very calm person and hardly ever lose my temper even when hungry or tired haha

Great post....I just started snorting again after about 20 years and while I am enjoying myself, I still browse thru the forums for feedback. I've experienced the Bad...& the Good! Right I have a great connect! My only issue is 2 things, 1) my teet hurt on the comedown & 2) the nose thing, what else works best for the burn? I mean yea yea yea "drugs r bad and yada yada yada" but I'm all in for the moment so no judgement responses, only helpful ones! Thanx!

The shimmer of shinning fish scale cocaine can be repliaced by a number of means requiring no more than house hold products. For instance, hair spray.


The petroleum smell can actually come from a numbr of sources. I Europe it most likely comes from the big pressing machines (I don't know their real name), which distributers in the Netherlands use to press the coke back into 1 kg bricks after they have diluted it and are ready to distribute the former 90% columbian cocaine.

I guess the same is true in the US. Whether it happens in Mexico or the US I don't know. The point is that the smell of petroleum cannot be used as an indicator of good coke as it can come from a number of sources.


Regarding your bad list indicators, the same goes for petroleum. And I don't know what you mean with "pre-chopped" but if you mean that the cocaine do not come in rocks but as powder, and that this is a indicator that is is bad cocaine, your are wrong. People receiveing 1 kg will get bricks. If you order 500g you will get half a brick, if you order 250g you till get 1/4 of a brick. But lets say you order 250g from a source who have a lab test proving at 90% purty (that is with levamisol) or even better 95-99% purity (that is without levamisol) and you want it send by mail. Letters are by far the most secure method of shipment wereas packages involve more risk. So you get him to chop it into fine powder in order for it to be contained in a flat letter. The same goes for the ones using humans to transfer cocaine, they cannot exactly swallow a 250g 1/4 brick or shove it up their ass. But sorry if I misundestand you.


Pure cocaine will not "block" your nose no matter how much you take. Pure cocain will dissolve completely thus only leaving you with a running nose. When I think about it, this might actually be one of the most basic indicators of the purity of your cocaine. High purity no stopped nose, despite from dried blood. Bad cocaine will make it impossible to breath through your nose after a certain amount.


One way to get cocaine that are 90% or 99% pure are by cleaning it yourself.

Cocaine containing Levamisol (currently 70% of seized cocaine in Denmark contain levamisol) can become around 90% pure Cocaine without Levamisol can become 99% pure. There is is relatively big difference in how 99% purity cocaine looks and how 90% purity looks. 99% purity truely looks like snow crystals. But as it get pressed or cut up into lines it will start to look like regular cocaine.

Thank you for the input. I will try to search for information there. Some countries have very detailed (and publics) statistics about seized cocaine, the amount, hoe much they seized, the purity, the drugs use to dilute it, where it originated from etc. The problem with countries or origin is that the actual cocaine can be made one place, put on a boat registered from another countries faking logs and what else the relevant authorities use the determine where the seized product came from. And this makes it very hard to achieve reliable knowledge about the differences in the cocaine produced in different countries.


But I don't know if you have experienced this in the US. Sometimes people are willing to pay more for cocaine from X country than cocaine from Y country becayse they think all kinds of things about what it means for the effects they experience when taking it. So in one month everyone demand Bolivian cocaine and other months Colombian cocaine and ofcourse the dealers suddely have "the badest fish scale diamond cocaine from Bolivia", but it is impossible for the normal street dealer to have any clue what so ever about the origin of their product. Most likely it is from Colombia as they remain the biggest producer of cocaine in the world. I don't understand this phenomenon.


You observe it on the dark web too. Dealers divide their products between Colombian and Bolivian cocaine. Though they might actually have an idea where it is from. Atleast those big enough to be selling whole or half bricks.

No problem. I have noticed cocaine advertised as such, originating from diff countries of origin, but never realized this was the reason (I always assumed it was mostly hype and marketing, which admittedly it still is). Something like 9/10 of the cocaine in the US is tainted with this stuff, but that is about the extent of my knowledge on the subject.

You mean they passed a local/state bill to reduce penalties for small quantities of these drugs. It doesn't make them legal, it just reduces draconian sentences for minor drug possession like this. We had something similar in CA last year or the year before in Prop 47.

According to what I understand, it is now legal to have small quantities of those. From what I understand the state says that throwing you in jail isn't going to stop you from doing the drugs.

How soon after snorting a line can you blow your nose? Then what can you do to get rid of the nasty nasal drip taste in the back your throat? I have access to some stuff that I know is cocaine because my friend bought about seven grams of fish scale and sold a little bit of it and kept a little bit and then gave me a little bit. She says it's good strong stuff. She does it a little more often than I do, a couple of times every couple of months. I did a skinny line of this three weekends ago because it's been a couple years since I've done any so I wanted to start off easy. Didn't notice any High at all, just noticed my mouth getting numb, my teeth getting them and the nasty nasal drip taste in the back of your throat. Did a bigger line last weekend still no high feeling, just the typical runny nose and numb mouth and throat and nasty nasal drip taste. Did a bigger line about 15 minutes, still no hi, just the same runny nose and numb mouth and nasal drip. I'm a triathlete so I naturally have a much lower heart rate than most people. Sitting on the couch watching TV right before taking the line my heart rate all three times taking it has been in the upper forties and then my heart rate about 10 minutes after taking it all three times has been in the low 70s. Like I said before, three weeks ago when I took the first line it was just a skinny line probably no longer than a Matchstick. The second time last weekend it was probably about the same length just a slight a bit fatter and then when I took it just now it was still probably the same length but just a little bit more fatter than last week. ( trying to be somewhat conservative with the amount of stuff I have and still try to achieve somewhat of a good high. )  right now about 15 minutes after taking the line I feel a slight good feeling. But nothing like a big rush of euphoria. I know the stuff is good because when my friend purchased the seven grams it was good fish scale.  She always does an acetone wash when she gets cocaine that she plans on selling some of. There's only one person that she sells to and like I said neither of us do cocaine on a regular basis. Back in the mid-2000s she was more into doing it and getting coked out once in awhile. Back around that same time when I was playing in bands I had access to it but never did a whole lot at one time. If I was going to do it for the night, I almost always do one line and then do two or three bumps the rest of the night and it could be a week between doses two weeks between doses or even four weeks between doses. Usually when I was doing it, it was because I was quote on quote in the band so when whoever had it was passing it around I always got a small amount. A lot of times I had stuff left over that I didn't do. Never built up a big tolerance for it. But usually got a good Buzz and good Rush when taking the first line and then the bumps we're enough to keep it going. So anyways the stuff that my friend gave me has been acetone washed and the person she sold some of it too reported back to her that it was quote unquote good stuff as usual. Anyways, other than the line I took this time giving me just a slight good feeling, no big rush or anything. I figured the other two times I took it recently the lines weren't big enough but I figured since it's the first time and doing it in a couple years that it should have been enough to get me going. I had all the effects of the cocaine except for that nice Rush that rush you get about a couple of minutes after snorting it. My friend that I got it from says that she bumped it every once in awhile when she needs a little bit of energy to get started in the day and says that it always works for her the two or three times that she buys a year she always gets from the same supplier and from what she says it's always reliable stuff. She always does and acetone wash and the same person that she always sell some of it too just wondering why I'm not getting a good high off of it. And I've always wondered how long after snorting it can you blow your nose? I've always been afraid to blow it for a fear of blowing all the cocaine back out. And is there a trick to getting rid of the nasty nasal drip taste in the back your throat?


And since I mentioned acetone washing, just how pure can cocaine be if it's been acetone washed? And can you acetone wash it more than once? Like let's say your supplier acetone washes it and then when you get it you acetone wash it not knowing it's already been washed. Well that have any effect on it?

 It could wind up very pure, but the problem is some cuts(including levamisole) aren't acetone soluble. So you can acetone wash as much as you want, and it will clean it up some, but any non-acetone soluble cuts will still be there. That's why an acetone wash and then a chloroform wash is recommended.

No, it's actually the opposite. cocaine is soluble in chloroform at 1 gram per 12.5 mls. So you would want to discard what's left in the filter, your cocaine would be in solution in the chloroform, so you would have to dissolve that all away and be left with your cocaine crystals.

I can't handle even very good cocaine. I've used less than a handful of time, all with purer than average stuff (face numb from keybumps,  even experienced users could not handle a matchstick line, no come down, almost calming not speedy)


After sharing even a gram my nose feels worse than railing grams of ketamine. I don't experience a noticable come down from adderall or even focalin. But cocaine on friday puts me out of comission for the weekend.


I'm done with cocaine for good. The high is not worth the legal risk or the heart damage. I also feel like I have blood on my hands, knowing  all of this crap funds the cartels. 


Cocaine, take your cool hand off my head and go kiss your sister morphine for me.

IDK where this goes I'm confused. If this is wrong please let me know where to go.


last night it was taken (coke) and it smells of mint, that's the first thought. Euphoria comes on strong but dissipates quickly. It causes hands and feet to sweat pretty badly as well. It has a mild numbing, almost no burn, and has an awful taste IMO.


This morning it was taken and not much is felt. It now has an aftersmell of ammonia. It is fluffy and it needs taken 10x more to get the same feeling and it comes with tightness in chest.


This is a weird feeling but the weirdest is the mint smell and taste? It's also not numbing anymore it's not bitter. It doesn't numb anything and it doesn't taste like coke. I just want to know wtf I'm doing. 


Side note:

It tastes like that fake cocaine if you've ever tried it but it doesn't burn like it. I did the bleach test and it mostly sat in flakes ontop of the bleach until it moved over to the glass and stuck there. Some of it very slowly fell down leaving trails and the bleach very cloudy. No yellow, red, or other coloring.

Sounds like poorly refined coke. Maybe it's cut with an RC stim, who knows. If it is making you uncomfortable, get some new shit. If you have a lot of it, send it for lab tests. Nobody can tell you what it is over the internet. Maybe take it back where you got it, see if they will give you something else in exchange for what you got. If you're using a lot, maybe take some time out.

So this might be in the wrong area but I’m having trouble finding the correct place to ask this question as I’m very new to posting here. Can anyone tell me if emergen c is safe to use for iv crack? If it is how much should one use? If not safe then what would be better and how much should be used? I’m trying to find a better alternative to the vinegar I’ve been using lately.

How long does it take for the effects of the Comedown to start after you guys do cocaine? And does it depend on the dosage? I've never been a heavy user. Even when I was playing in bands and had easier access to cocaine at the most I would do a line and then a couple of bumps the rest of the night once maybe on a rare occasion twice a week. I've never really experienced the Comedown that a lot of people describe but then again I've never really experienced the crazy Europa, full of energy feeling either. Just a mild (sometimes a very mild) relaxed, happy feeling. Do I just not do enough when I do it to get the crazy good feelings and the crazy come down effect?

Yeah you're not blasting enough coke there buddy. Usually if you have a gram to yourself you will have a bad, sweaty comedown shortly after the last line. I find codeine can do wonders to take the edge off.

The comedown is dependent on the quality of the cocaine. The better the coke the less harsh is the comedown. 


If the coke you are doing is cut with amphetamines it will be a speedier buzz and a harsh comedown. You would find yourself agitated and anxious.


Better quality coke causes less anxiety and is not speedy. You can sit and chill with friends instead of cleaning your whole house. Lol

You just only dissolve a small part to begin with. You cant consume the part of your sample that has been reused for reagent testing. That part of your supply is gone.

Good coke still makes you feel like shit after. It depletes norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine and is very dehydrating. I find that L-tyrosene, an amino acid supplement that is a precursor chemical for dopamine and norepinephrine, significantly helps with the potentially brutal crash. I only really trust myself with like a point of the good stuff or I am going to be feeling like shiiiiiit after, and not only that, but craving opiates the drugs I actually have problems with for relief. Coke crashes after using it for a few days are shit regardless of the quality... if anything it is worse I find, as the high is so much better and it leaves the system so fast. 


I prefer 2c-c or 2c-d over coke any day. Those psychedelic stimulants are way better and don't make me feel like shit after, especially 2c-c.

Yea I like to binge on coke every now and then. My personal choice is IVing, you can never beat a good ole bellringer. I currently have some pretty pure shit, crystal clear on the spoon, no residue left behind. Def not chocked full of fucking baby laxitave. Anyway, happy new year!! Stay safe. If you don’t IV just bump it, no need to be 0-100 real quick starting 2018 with coke siezures or a hear attack.

Happy new years! Be cautious with this one! 


I'm choosing high dose 2c-d and bong rips today the 2c-d is stimmy as fuck and laying me out! Kinda like good coke where you can just chill if that's where you're at. (I worked overnights past few so... partying with myself lol)

I loved 2c-d. Probably my favorite 2c mostly because of the shorter duration but also because I found it pleasantly warm and stimmy.


If you plug it, the come-up can be considerably intense especially if you dose high. Like being rocketed into outer space. It's an odd form of torture... It's not pleasant to rocket into psychedelia that quickly yet for some reason I still enjoyed it. Similar to snorting it but much much much less painful.

Man I think I am becoming enough of a masochist triple conch piercing my ear in oxy wd's. Was such a bloody mess I asked my brother to help clean it lol had no idea until I saw the bloody qtips later. Poor dude. 


2c-c is my favourite for sure, 2c-d is amazing too though. I am saying pink, green, neon, purple, violet all these lovely colours on the screen. I feel stimulated and very much in control. It's a little pushier than 2c-c which is nice if you like stims. Glad I got a quarter ounce of this shit I can't say I prefer it to coke as I love coke but there is no crash and I'd take it over coke these days as the crash leads me to relapse. I am crazy stimulated right now took a bit over 80mg and in oxy wd's it's pretty intense. 


This is fucking crazy. The colours on the screen are dancing to the music. The vibrations are trick as fuck and this is very high frequency stuff. Can't believe how much I am liking higher doses, lower ones didn't do much for me but this is like 2c-c x metalcore. It was actually really cold and analytical earlier a little hard to deal with but I am in OC wd's, now I'm pleasantly warm enjoying the visuals. I kind of even want to take more I don't know how safely high I can push this one though I'm already floored.

Even when I was playing in bands and had easier access to cocaine at the most I would do a line and then a couple of bumps the rest of the night once maybe on a rare occasion twice a week. I've never really experienced the Comedown that a lot of people describe but then again I've never really experienced the crazy Europa, full of energy feeling either. Just a mild (sometimes a very mild) relaxed, happy feeling. Do I just not do enough when I do it to get the crazy good feelings and the crazy come down effect?

The crazy comedown is dose dependent and route of administration. If I decide to blow some lines, I’m way less compulsive in redosing and find a sweet spot. If I decide to shoot it the high is so euphoric that when it wears off depression sets in.

Don't know what happened to my first post before I posted the long one just now, anyways the first post said getting the night started with a medium sized line of fish scale. This seems to be pretty good stuff because with only one medium size line, I'm getting a pretty good euphoric feeling. Not this big rush or anything like that but just a good happy relaxed feeling. Took it 4 minutes ago and already my lips and teeth in the back of my throat is getting numb. I got to say, that nasty nasal drip taste you get in the back your throat, as nasty as it is, there's also something pretty nice about it. This is much better stuff than what I took back in November. The stuff I took then, I had to take three medium-sized lines in about a 45 minute period and didn't feel this good. The stuff back in November was older stuff in powder form. The fish scale I took just now, a friend of mine bought 7 grams of it 2 weeks before Christmas a year ago.

Speaking of fish scale, the fact that it's in fish-scale form, does that automatically indicate that it's a more pure product over let's say powdered form cocaine? How does one get cocaine into fish scale form? If you do an acetone wash will your end results be fish scale? Does it leave South America in fish scale form? Another question I've often wondered is, what is the difference between the cocaine I was doing between 2002 and 2007 versus the fish scale that I have right now which was purchased a couple of weeks before Christmas a year ago?

You'll be fine.  I've gone over 100 hours before with meth, and while I don't recommend it, it's not lethal.  It would be a good time for some benzos if you have any.

Yea it's completely normal to hallucinate while sleep deprived and especially while using stimulants and sleep deprived.


Hallucinations can extend to all senses. You can hear, see, smell, taste and/or feel things that aren't real. The hallucinations can be minor - like for example thinking you see  something out of the corner of your eye -

 to very extreme where, for example, you might hear and see cops following you (when they actually aren't).


The hallucinations can become overwhelming where your sleep deprived and drugged mind begins to forget they are just hallucinations. Best way to avoid this is to not stay up too long, not use reckless amounts and to call it quits when the first signs of hallucinations appear.

I just shot up some coke and I got instant blurry vision,  blood pressure was 170/120 and pulse rate was 160. Why did this happen? I shoot coke quite often (pretty much everyday). Blood pressure, heart rate,  and blurry vision is all balanced out now but I have never had it shoot up that high before...

You should be hearing music and conversations in white noise by now.  I started going in to all the possibilities, but realized that might not be helpful.  Sometime with anxiety and some paranoia, the hallucinations can become overwhelming, and it's important to remember that's all they are.  Keep breathing slowly, try to relax, and they'll go away once you get some sleep.

It happened cause you just injected powerful stimulants directly into your veins.  Why it didn't happen before is anybody's guess.  Maybe the shots are beginning to catch up to you, maybe you've got a flu, didn't sleep enough, not enough water, a diet of nothing but french fries.  


Probably want to slow down a little, at least for a while.

Hey guys, don't forget about my few questions about fish scale. Also I have another question, back when I was in band and playing in clubs during 2002 through 2007, I always had access to cocaine because I was quote-unquote in the band. I've got probably four or five hard chunks of cocaine probably about the size of a kernel of corn to just a bit bigger. Although they're hard, when chopping them with a razor blade they're a bet firm when making the initial cut with the razor blade but they're not rock hard like crack rock. Eventually you can chop them up into a nice powder form. How does cocaine get in this form? Like I said in my earlier post I've never acetone washed cocaine before. So I don't know what the end result turns out to be. I'm not sure if acetone washing cocaine leaves it in a powder form, turns it into fish scale or leaves it in hard chunks. I got these few chunks back around 2005. Because they're in a chunk form and not powder, does that indicate a better quality product? And I'm still very curious as to the difference between cocaine from 2002 to 2007 versus cocaine you get today. And again, all the cocaine I have done, I've gotten in the Houston Texas area. I try looking this stuff up on the internet to get answers but of course can't find anything. Any experienced knowledge would be appreciated. These hard chunks of cocaine, back when I got them I never did anything with them as far as chopping them up and snorting them. Just took one of the chunks and chop it in half and cut it up into a nice powder form. Made a decent medium size line. Snorted it. Don't feel any euphoric rush or anything like that, but I do know that it made my nose run more then the fish scale I did a couple days ago. It also made the front of my teeth a lot more numb and the back of my throat a lot more numb. But not very much of a euphoric good feeling. But I do have to say, I've always liked the num feeling you get in your mouth!

I wish I was wealthy enough or "in the band" enough to have the kind of connoisseur knowledge you're asking for.  My stims come as pressed translucent rocks with thumbprints on them.  I step over dogshit and stolen aluminum siding to find my guy (there was a time I had corporate-job money and the stim of choice was quality cocaine, but alas . . . ).


Sorry, reminiscing a bit after your last lines.  People said they hate it, but I loved loved loved me some cocaine drip down the back of my throat.


I can't speak for cocaine quality, 2000-2009 were the years I sampled, but I always had more of a "weeee! let's do this!" attitude than a slow-foods nuanced take.


I can say that the hard nugget coke is probably just from water absorption.  Just like sugar that gets left out, it slowly absorbs moisture and recrystallizes into lumps.  Probably whatever it's cut with does most of that.  In which case it's harmless.  I can't even make up an answer about fish scale versus snake skin or whatever else you have.


I'll add that unless you shoot it, I think acetone washes are wasteful and pointless.  It might remove something bad, but more likely you'll fudge it and just lose product, keeping a lot of bad cut anyway.  I think it's meant for conspiratorial tweakers, to give them something to do that is least likely to hurt themselves or others.  If you shoot it, then you want the cleanest thing you can, and it becomes more reasonable to lose some product in the process. 


If you do wash it, the end product should be powdery, no big lumps.  Unless you leave it out for a long time (months), then lumps can form.

Hello, as I been under rehab for a time now, few months already clean, I thinking to come back with some coke, just 1gr each 4 days tops (btw i'm paying upto $<snip> per gram) i just want to know how safe it will be mixing it with some hydrocodone and a couple pills of ibuprofen all smashed together to snort at 1 shot, and probably drinking a redbull or something similar. I just need extra energy to work again.


 I have experience with hydrocodone (1-2 pills a month) but i usually take it to chill not actually hooked into it, just wantd to mix with coke to lower down the effect of the coke, just dont want to rush to hospital with a bleeding nose. my tolerance with coke is high but the one i'm buying is 90%+ quality so it will take higher quickly compared to the 60% or less i was taking last year in august.

If you're a few months clean after rehab, why would you be doing any coke?  A gram a day for four days?  That's a bender, and could hurt you now that you have no tolerance.


It could set you back all the way before your rehab, start up a whole new addiction cycle.


Taking a hydrocodone or two (just swallow it, please, don't snort it, you won't get anything out of that) isn't going to hurt you.  I don't know why you would add ibuprofen to that.  And if you wanted to take it to smooth out the coke, why would you drink RedBull on top of it?


Your tolerance with cocaine is going to be LOW if you're a few months clean.  Go slow if you do this.  Do not crush up pills and add them.  Take a hydrocodone by your mouth, drink a beer, and then water.  Go slow, it's been a while.  Don't snort pills or take things you don't need.

So for some reason anything cut with anything besides that ether smelling ingredient, I get the worst runny nose. Like I will do a line then blow my nose 5 mind later. This usually happened after an hour of using


Yes , one time I stupidly went on a 5 day sleepless coke and molly binge. Let?s just say I looked like I was enduring and exorcism plus I was anxious and scared. I blacked out and started talking to my loved ones like strangers. Also, I think it was the Molly but I kept falling and banging into walls. The bruises I had were so bad that I had to stay home


Can I askmSomething that may come off the wrong way but I just want to know for personal reasons? I understand blow is addicting and it?s not a joke. But u don?t get PHYSICALLY sick from withdrawal. I see it more of a mental addiction. And yes I used to abuse opiates.  Therefore, how does a rehab help the cocaine addict? I think we all know that the person needs to Want to be clean. Because I went on a 3 week vacay and was sober from all things. The day I come back, I buy coke


I?ve only shot a handful of time and yes the rush is ground breaking but it?s so short. Plus I feel less social with that MOA than nasal. It?s quite dangerous and only makes sense if u are about to clean ur house lol. The first time I though I was gonna die.. FROM A DUB


If you never experienced a come down then  you consider yourself so lucky. I always have a comedown. Sometimes it?s light but it?s been hell. I notice that GOOD coke doesn?t make u feel like shit but BAD super cut COKE will make u wanna die lol. My remedy is taking Xanax and serequel but the bad comedowns required several benzodiazepines which is scary


Fish scale is meant to be done in key bumps


I always tell everyone to do fishscale in key bumps cuz of its potency


Shitty comedowns only happen with shitty coke ...which sucks cuz most ppl have shitty blow ESPECIALLY in NY


Even for an everyday user I am told to never shoot more than a dub for ur first then dub and a half for second

I never blow my nose after doing a line for fear of blowing all the coke out of your nose. I always wait 30 to 40 minutes afterwards before lightly blowing my nose. Yeah, it means more of that nasty nasal drip and the back of your throat but I would sure hate to do a line and then blow it all back out five minutes later. The last two times I did Coke, I did three lines in one hour. It was all fish scale except one time I chopped up a hard cocaine Rock. Neither of the fish scale or the rock seemed overly potent. I never got a crazy Rush of euphoria. The last time I did Coke a couple weeks ago, my first line was fish-scale, the second line was the chopped up Rock and the third time in that same hour was more fish scale. About an hour afterwards I noticed that I was overly talkative. Something I hadn't noticed with the three lines of fish scale the week before. I'm thinking that maybe the cocaine Rock was cut with more Amphetamines. The fish scale was all from the same batch.

Other than the euphoric feeling cocaine gives you, what is your favorite thing about doing cocaine? Is it the excitement you get knowing you're going to be able to do something tonight? Is it the thrill when your heart starts beating fast when you start to chop up a line? Is did snorting the cocaine? Is it the numbness that you get in your mouth in the back of your throat? Is it the relaxed Happy Feeling, (not the euphoric rush feeling, but the good happy relaxed feeling)? Is it when the back of your throat gets so numb that you can hardly swallow or talk? Is it that nasty-tasting nasal drip you get in the back of your throat? Is it the pounding of your heart? Is it being social and talkative? Is it the energy that you get?


For me it's not so much the euphoric Rush that you get. Because when I was doing cocaine more regularly ( once or twice in a two-week period. Usually one medium sized line to start the night off with and then maybe but not all the time a second line later in the evening with a couple of bumps in between) back in the mid 2000 then I do now. Back then, I probably never took enough cocaine at one time to get that crazy euphoric feeling. It always felt good and relaxing but nothing I would describe as any kind of a crazy Rush that everyone else describes on here. So I guess I can't fully say that the euphoric feeling is my favorite part. For me, I like the excitement of chopping up a line chopping up enough powder to put in one of those cocaine one hitter sniffers. I've always liked chopping up fish scale flakes and the excitement and a little rush of energy you get when your heart starts pounding. It's almost like being a kid on Christmas morning. But I the thing I like the most over everything else about cocaine is when your teeth, gums, tongue, the back of your throat, your nose gets numb. Even as nasty as it is, the nasal drip in the back of your throat. For me that's the thing I love the most and it's a shame after about 15-20 minutes it starts to go away. Don't get me wrong, the good relaxed feeling is nice too and I'm sure the full on euphoric feeling is crazy good too.

Hot plate is the way you want to go. Your C has absorbed humidity. Heat a ceramic plate in the micro for 60 seconds and break up your stuff on that. It will bring it back to powder. Enjoy

I presumed discussion of aesthetics was verboten - could someone clarify this?  People I hear from regularly pretty up their coke during the the purification process, replacing the active crap with inert filler to spread the active dose over more satisfyingly sized lines.


On a separate yet connected point, has anyone used any of the volatile silicone derivatives as a coke solvent?  Quite remarkable if done correctly,

You're talking about the Hard Rock's? I have stuff that I got and already a rock form back in the mid-2000s, and then I have other stuff gotten at the same time. I live in Houston where you can ring out the humidity with a rag, the stuff I got that wasn't in powder form that's assumed to be as old as The Rock stuff, is still in powder form. Can a true crack rock chopped up with a razor blade and turned into powder? I've never seen a crack rock and I've also never seen cocaine in a rock form other than the five or six pieces I have now that are about the size of a kernel of corn.

While Bluelight staff indeed have vision to pierce the limits of human understanding, we are not allowed to use this power on your dope--it would ignite under such scrutiny and burn down your house.


So we can't have discussion on what your dope may or may not be cut with, and I suppose that does come down to aesthetics sometimes.  Simply admiring the fluffiness of one's lines is maybe better for other subfora, but is not strictly disallowed.


So: it's OK to describe what your drugs look like, but if it looks different than normal, it's not OK to ask if it's something else, or cut with something.


I think "my powder coke forms rocks here in the swampy parts of Texas, what do I do?" is OK, cause just do the hot plate thing.


But, "my powder coke forms rocks here in the swampy parts of Texas, is it really crack?" is not OK, cause maybe?  maybe not?  we don't know.

Just had a nice large flake of fish scale. Was able to chop it into two medium-sized lines. Did both lines about 5 minutes ago. Not experiencing a whole lot of numbness or the nasty nasal drip or even they crazy runny nose. It chopped up into a really nice fluffy powder. Had the typical petroleum smell and had a slight burn when snorting it. But not a lot of numbing of my teeth or the back of my throat. Kind of weird.

You won't get a bell ringer off your first hit. Saturate your chore, pack it FULL and puff on it gently like a cigar until you see thick smoke come from your mouth. Exhale and torch only the chore, spin the pipe and drag on it as long as you can (you should feel steady, warm NOT SCALDING smoke seeping into your mouth), deep inhale to get all that into your lungs, and slow, staggered exhale. 


Make sure not to inhale but drag, cause you want to get as much smoke as possible to actually intake past just your mouth. Make sure the heat is constant and steady and does not touch the pipe, straight center into the chore; it should be a constant roast, not a burn, or you'll get a nasty taste and waste your stuff and your chore.


Push chore regularly, i.e. Between every pack, to keep it sticky and sealed. 


That's the best way to get that ringer if you're not used to it, but also incredibly wasteful. 


If you melt it first, very slowly so there is no sizzle, and then do all of the above but less aggressively and with the right breath techniques, same effect but works with way less per pack. It took me some practice. 


Also if your chore and pipe are not on par, you'll never get a good hit. If you hear whistling you either have to adjust chore or you have a crack.

Had the typical petroleum smell and had a slight burn when snorting it. But not a lot of numbing of my teeth or the back of my throat. Kind of weird.


I'm still very much interested in learning more about fish scale. Without asking any questions that aren't allowed on blue light, most of what I have is flaky fish scale. Has the typical pearlescent bit of a shiny/ wet look. I've seen cocaine before in fish scale form that was a big solid lump that was claimed to be about 7 grams worth. I assume when you break that lump up you start getting individual flakes of various sizes. And that's what I have, what I call the fish scale flakes of various sizes. Nothing crazy big. The one I just did now was one of the larger flakes. Like I said, was able to chop it into two medium size fluffy powder lines.


But what I'm wondering, and I've asked once before but didn't get very many answers, just how does cocaine get into fish scale form? When it leaves South America in bricks, are the bricks powder or fish scale? If cocaine leaves South America as powder how does it get turned into fish scale? Fish scale is known to be a more pure product and if that's the case where it is a more pure product, then I doubt somebody is cutting it full of crap and then turning it into fish scale. When cocaine leaves South America as bricks, is it fish scale and if I'm getting it from my supplier as smaller chunks of fish scale does that mean it hasn't been messed with as much? Or is there a process done to turn it back in to fish scale after it's been cut with junk? What makes fish scale to be a more pure product as people claim it to be?


Like I've said in an earlier post here recently, all the powder, fish scale and hard Rocky chunks I have are all from the mid-to-late 2000s. And it's pretty much all been mixed together meaning I have powder, fish scale and hard Rocky chunks all in the same container. No way to tell if the fish scale flake I took today is from the same batch gotten at the same time as the fish scale flakes I took last week ( which seems to be more potent). What I can say is, the couple of lines of fish scale flakes I did last week had much more of an effect as far as a lot more numbing of the mouth and teeth and back of the throat and made my nose a lot more running then the stuff I took now about 15 minutes ago. The only effects from what I just took now are just very slightly numbing of the teeth and back of the throat almost like when do a couple lines 30 minutes ago and now the numbness and runny nose are starting to go away. I checked my heart rate before doing the lines and it was 46 beats per minute now it's up and I low 80s beats a minute. I feel relaxed but nothing euphoric. I'm just really curious as to what the difference is between what I took now and when I took a week ago. Is there a link or website describing the process of how cocaine gets to fish scale? And is there also a link that describes the different types of cuts used when cutting cocaine? Possibly a website that talks about what cocaine was cut with in the 2000s vs what it's being cut with now?


Like I've also said in an earlier post, I've got five or six Hard Rock chunks of cocaine probably around the size of a kernel of corn or maybe a half size bigger. One chunk I have is probably big enough to break it into thirds and then make a line or two out of the smaller pieces. They chop up with a razor blade into nice powder. I've noticed when I've done a couple lines of the chopped up hard Rocky chunks, I had a stronger numbing of the teeth, the tongue and the back of the throat got extremely numb to the point where it was a little difficult to talk. The nose was a lot more runny. And I was a lot more talkative. Again, a good relaxed feeling, heart rate up into the mid-80s from the mid-40s where it was before taking it . dry mouth that nothing I would describe as a really good euphoric feeling. I mean I felt good and talkative but didn't feel like I had to clean the house or that I had a huge rush of energy. And with all the stuff I have regardless of what form it's in, absolutely no comedown. I've noticed this the last couple of times I took one of those hard Rocky chunks and chopped it into powder and snorted a line of it. Again, I got the stuff back in the mid-2000s. Now that I've asked my questions about how cocaine gets into fish scale form, how does cocaine get into a hard Rock like form? One person told me it was due to the humidity. But if that's so, I have some powder that I got back in the mid-2000s that is still powder and hasn't gotten hard. I wonder if the Rocky cocaine is cut with more crap then the fish scale I have, causing it to have more of a numbing and runny nose affect.


If anybody's got any links or websites that talk about fish scale and even the Rock chunks that I have, that would be appreciated. I'm very curious to learn more about this and how cocaine gets into fish scale and hard Rock like chunks and even what cocaine was being cut with back in the mid-2000s vs today. Thanks guys.

Hello. First post. So, between 2006 and 2009 there was a lot of discussion regarding the collapse of the quality of cocaine over the last 20 odd years. At first people like Le Junk were saying it was due to the new cuts, and that it could be solved through acetone wash and alcohol extraction, and later some people started saying they now think it's caused by country of origin manufacturing shortcuts and shortages of critical chemicals needed to remove unwanted alkaloids. The last thread content I can find on this subject is from 2008 where Le Junk was saying he's now sure it's the alkaloids but that for some reason the acetone wash still works. Does anyone know whether this puzzle was finally solved? Anybody heard from Le Junk in recent years?

Yes, the man is alive and well, and posted in a thread earlier this very day (unless it was his levamisole-zombie doppelganger or a confidential informant, possibly the ATF concerned about sudden demand for acetone).


But please use the site's PM ability if you want to summon a member from your snow-shrouded past--it's one of the few vBulletin plugins available and functioning.

Wow, I've never heard of any of those ones.  It seems like you need a degree in chemistry if you want to safely use cocaine today.  I know some people here say that it's a myth and the cocaine is the same as it's always been and it's just our memory not serving as well, etc.  It's not a myth though, because in the early 90s I personally witnessed and experienced for myself the change in cocaines quality and the increase in it's speedy, ampy effects.  In 2000 me and my buddies concluded "you just can't get good Coke anymore".   Then I quit for 16 years, and trying it again recently I found it's 1000 times WORSE and even MORE 

Ampy and way MORE jittery than it was when I quit.  At least  back in 2000 it didn't give you chest pains and constant pacing and still had some, albeit only some,  positive feelings and euphoria.  In today's Coke that feeling of warm wellness and that everything's gonna be OK and positiveness  and wanting to chat all night with your buddies is completely GONE.  Now it's just heart racing, pacing, unable to sit down, paranoia, not wanting to talk to anybody, shortness of breath, etc, basically the absolute opposite of what it used to be like.   But people who say that this is all in our head obviously never did Coke in the early 90s.  None of us old-timers can understand why a new user would ever try Coke more than once today.  Its just not a good high,  Nothing enjoyable about it at all.   Who the heck is even buying Coke today, and why?

This is more speculation but you can get an idea of why there are so many dam crazy cuts out there and why it might be best to move on from the Cola..

Changing the subject, I know when you snort coke it makes your nose run. And I've noticed, since I've been doing 3 or 4 lines once a week for the past 6 or so weeks that my nose has been a bit more runny. It's not like it's running down my face like it does when you first hit a line but I've been needing to blow a lot more everyday. I understand Coke is corrosive and getting a runny nose is your body's way of attacking the coke and trying to get rid of it. What I'm wondering is if I'm doing 4 to 5 lines once a week, in general how long does it take for your nose to get back to normal after you stop? I've got a very good friend that used to do Coke back around 2005 to 2007. She could have probably been doing it before then and after then. I can't say how heavy of a user she was. I do know from what she's told me that she would do three or four lines once every couple of weeks and then in between a couple times a week she would bump a few times. And she that once every four or five months she would get coked out which I'm not sure what exactly that means. Don't know how much coke you have to take to get coked out and at what point do you go from high to being coked-out. Anyways, I've known her since June of 2016. Since I've known her, I only know of her doing as she said one small line to get some energy early in the morning. Anyways, I don't think she does it but maybe once every couple of months if I had to guess. But ever since I've known her, she's always had a runny nose. She is always blowing her nose on a regular basis . And before I knew she did Coke in the past I didn't think much of it but after finding out, I've often wondered if that's due to the cocaine that she did years ago, or if that's a sign that she's doing cocaine now.


What my question is, is the runny nose and routinely blowing your nose a short-term side effect? Or is it something that's pretty much with you the rest of your life? If it is short-term, if I did four lines tonight, how long would I have to go before my nose got back to normal? Is a runny nose only a short-term side effect for light users or is it a sign of somebody that used to do a lot of coke on a more regular basis? I guess I'm trying to figure out is her runny nose from all the coke that she did back in the day and that it's a sign that she did more coke then what she's admitting to or is it a sign that she's currently doing coke? When first told me that she did cocaine, at that time, Thanksgiving 2016 she said the last time she did it was back in August and she only did a small line because she woke up and was dragging and needed some energy. She also said that she had three or four grams of cocaine that was pretty old stuff. So anyways, about a month later I found where she kept her "shoebox" stash of cocaine. Well I took a picture of everything in the Box. About three weeks later I was able to check it and everything was still in the same position. So anyways, several months of checking nothing looked out of the ordinary. So I'm pretty if she's doing cocaine once in awhile she's not getting into her shoe box. Well, about February of 2017 I found in her dresser a ziplock bag with fish scale flakes in it. Just by eyeballing it, every time I checked it looked to to be the same amount amount. So about May time possibly June the ziplock baggie was on top of her dresser. She could have just said it there while she was digging to the dresser and didn't put it back in. A few weeks later, I found in a Zicam bottle, one of those tablets you take that dissolve in your mouth to help prevent a cold anyways, she had a clear vitamin capsule that was full of fish scale flakes. Don't know if that was for her to use later or if that was to give to someone. She did tell me when she first told me about her doing cocaine, that she has one person that once in a while she'll buy and sell to him. I know for a fact that she bought 7 grams of fish scale about two weeks before Christmas 2016. I saw a picture on her phone where she pet scented to the guy that she sells it to. I'm assuming it was fish-scale. It was in one solid lump butthead that pearlescent look to it. Not sure of fish scale comes and big lumps like that and then you can chop it up two flakes. I've only seen it in flaky form. Anyways, I am pretty sure the baggie that she had which was just a Ziploc sandwich bag for her kitchen is where that fish scale came from. Not sure why I went in to that much detail.


I guess what I'm trying to ask is, is her runny nose that she's had ever since I've known her due to the cocaine that she used back in 2005 to 2007 even if she was telling the truth about doing there are four lines every couple of weeks and then maybe twice a year getting coked out or would you have to do a lot more cocaine to still have a runny nose or does the runny nose eventually go away after you stop using? Or is her runny nose now a sign that she's using now? If you did two lines once a month, is that enough to make your nose run consistently or would your nose stop running a few days after you did the lines? I guess I'm trying to figure out if she still using, how frequently or how much.

Speaking as a guy who grew up with America's Worst Air (seriously) I don't understand you folks and your dry noses. I really did stuff both nostrils with kleenex like I had a bloody nose as a kid.  Right now if my nose isn't a little runny, I take it as a sign I'm dehydrated.


So as a diagnostic for drug use, I think a runny nose is as helpful as a pulse: can't rule it out.  IME, cocaine abuse presents nasally as enormous compacted bloody boogers, not clear snot; dead mucous membranes don't make mucous.  In your case, I'd go with the obviousness of her stashing cocaine and nibbling at it, as a sign that's what she's doing.  


I'm not sure if you're second-guessing yourself that she may have cleaned some trout in her bedroom, but if so, I do admire you acknowledging that is an extremely remote possibility.  Meanwhile there's no way to know what she's up to without asking her.  You never know, it might really be a trout.


And anyone who can leave coke in a shoebox and not use it for *months* is the essence of "I don't have a problem".


Sorry if you had a different angle that I'm missing completely.

Well if you times we talked about it, she's always referred to it as back in her mid-twenties back in her party days she would do it couple times a month. And like I said, I do know of one time back in December of 2005 where she got coked out. And again I'm familiar with the term but I'm not really sure just exactly what it means. I mean how much coke do you have to do to get coked out or is getting coked out going to be on the highway? And my case I would probably be coked out if I did 8 lines over the course of a night haha. As far as the shoebox cocaine, she's got the box stashed away where it's not like super quick to get to. It's not like hiding under the bed or anything like that. It would probably take 5 minutes to get to it. And the cocaine in the Box, from the picture I took of everything in there, I don't think she gets into it all that often because everything always looks just like in the picture. And the stuff in the Box, it's probably stuff she had leftover from when she used to do it in her twenties. (Mid 2000s). She claims not to have a addictive personality which I'm not sure that holds true for someone using cocaine. But she told me one time that she's never had the urge or the need to take it. She just likes it for the fun of it. That's like me. I can see how can you be addictive especially when that first line starts to wear off but for me, I like it for the fun of it. And if I'm going to do a couple lines I said a limit and it's easy for me to stick to it. And since I'm a light user. Medium lines, nothing fat. I probably not experienced a full-on euphoric crazy high like everybody describes on here. I just get a nice relaxed Happy Feeling. I actually enjoy the numbing effect, your gums your tongue the back of your throat and your nose is getting numb probably as much if not more than whatever High I get. In fact here lately I've been judging the Cocaine by how the numbness. How strong and how long it lasts.


The runny nose thing, I was just curious and even for my own knowledge. Back in the mid-2000s, when I would do it two or three times a month and bump a few times in between I don't ever remember my nose. And I don't mean like running like a does right after you sniff. More of just having to keep blowing it several times a day. I know she's not blowing out bloody boogers. In fact I don't even do that. She just blows her nose several times an hour. And at first when I first met her I thought that was just the way she was but when she first told me that she used to do cocaine and that she now does it a few times a year, it made me start to wonder

Ok, I was gonna say again, that you could seal the coke in a lock box encased in concrete and build the room around it as foundation, and it would last as long as it took for me to get money to rent some kind of jackhammer.  Meaning, she's got it under control.  But then you say this stuff is ten years old, at least?  So it's not even coke, probably, it's nostalgia-baggies.  Or actual salmon skin decoy, if she knows you're keeping track.


But I tend to see complex machinations as the night goes on.

I think it's the same as it is with meth--it's less about how much you do, and more about when you had your last.  You're most coked out at 6am, when you're startled by light coming in the window, trying to figure out why all these candles are lit and whose bathrobe you're wearing.  And why is there a gun on the counter.


Meanwhile I actually did some due diligence on "fish scale" which seemed to reach its popularity peak (the term anyway) back in 2005.  I definitely bought a solid mass with an opalescent sheen in 2003.  Along with small bags of powder with more of a grit to them.  Oh, and I bought an extremely expensive bag of aspirin too, in New Orleans.  Then I had a break till ~2007-2010, with substantial dips in a quality friend's graciousness.  That was pleasantly uniform and smooth, but I never saw the source to ogle.


But there's nothing special about it, I'm sure the name was the only thing new about it, and it's probably still around if whatever gave it that sheen is still used to cut (or it's an artifact of whatever machinery compacts it).  It's just an indicator of how many hands touched it between the brick wholesaler and that guy standing outside the bathroom in the back of that club.  Compacted brick plus uniform cutting--> rocks that shine a bit.  Rocks from that brick + sand and kitty litter, resettled in a baggie grinding in a back pocket-->sign you're getting desperate; just go home, this stuff won't help.

Clear, watery snot, right?  "Post-nasal drip?"  Then it's just a normal, healthy human nose.  More snot in cold weather to protect those membranes, snot in the spring to wash out the pollen, snot in the summer from pollution, snot in the fall as reaction to "pumpkin spice".  The whole year-long there's cat hair.


(I seriously came one dose short of cardiac arrest from the first non-drowsy antihistamine, Seldane.  Poor CYP3A4 metabolism in action.  So I spent many a long night being young and not understanding, waiting for my heart to restart, and contemplating snot.)


A healthy mucous membrane has mucous.  Think about every dog and child you've known, smearing snot every where, no rails necessary.

Oh crap, stupid autocorrect. Should have said "so, I'm not sure what it means to be coked out, how much coke does one have to do to be coked-out or is it going beyond the high," not be on the highway

 But as far as the blowing, yeah I get it when you have allergies or it's cold season. But if she blows her nose 20 + times in an hour, it's like that morning noon and night regardless what time of year it is. And I was able to talk to her about it today and she says she does it once in a while when she's out with friends just for the fun of it but she doesn't do a whole lot at one time because it will mess up her sinuses. I figure the sinus problem is more due to it being cut with more amphetamines. I have never had that issue. Usually after I do a few lines, even if my nose is quite runny, my sinuses are usually quite clear and I can breathe through my nose with absolutely no trouble.


And since we're on the topic of blowing nose, how soon after doing a couple of lines should you blow your nose. I usually wait at least 30 minutes. And usually by that time the intense running that you get right after you do a line usually starts to go away. But I always feared blowing your nose a few minutes afterwards would keep you from getting the full effect.


Another question, when snorting, how hard should you snort? I know this is like a newbie question but I always snort pretty decently. My thoughts are, if you snort hard wouldn't you just sniff the cocaine down your windpipe and more into your lungs and if so does it still have the same effects? Or do you want to sniff just hard enough to get it up in your nose, just passed your nostrils so it can get absorbed in your nasal cavities? I was fine, no matter how fine I can chop up into powder, if I don't snort hard enough some of it falls back out. If you snort it and it has a bit of a burning sinsation, is that a sign that it's got a lot of cut in it or does Cocaine by itself have a bit of a burning sensation? Some of the stuff I have tents to burn just a little bit more then the other stuff. Usually the fish scale flakes don't have much of a burning sensation, maybe a slight bit but nothing major. Some other stuff I have, it has a more noticeable burn as you're sniffing it.

Well I'm pretty sure that back in her 20s she did more coke then what she does now even if it wasn't more at one time, but I'm pretty sure at least more frequently. But when she blows, it's just a quick Short Blow, it's not like she's blowing a load of snot out. And then again, she could have been like this ever since she was 10 years old blowing your nose and it's nothing at all related to any cocaine. I'm just trying to look for signs of how much she did back then and how much she does now. Other than the blowing of the nose, I haven't noticed any other signs that would lead to thinking that she's a frequent user right now. I just care for her and since she's not one to openly talk about this subject, I'm just looking for different signs. She claims that she's never been addicted to it or never had the urge or craving to do it. She says the only real effect it had on her besides the euphoric feeling, was that it would mess up her sinuses if she did too much in one night. She claims to not have an addictive personality but I don't know if that works when you're doing cocaine. I know for me, when I'm doing a couple of lines, yeah I get a bit of a craving to do more but it's not overpowering and I set a limit for myself and it's easy to stick to that limit. But I can see how cocaine can be quite addictive.

I used coke years ago but I got sick from dealing with lunatic cokehead and asshole dealers.


Now I use coca leaves from those "mate de coca" tea bags, I mix them with baking soda and some water, then I put a big spoon of that on my mouth and wait till I get my tongue, cheeks and gums all numb. Its great specialy when I do it drunk.

Welcome to Bluelight, Mr. Deathwish.  Unfortunately, you need some kind of mild alkali to convert your powder cocaine to freebase, or "crack".  You cannot "will" the cocaine to do your bidding and become crack rocks, no matter how much of it you do, or how much it makes you believe you can manipulate molecules with your mind.


Baking soda is pretty convenient and easy; ammonia is easy to get, but smells like piss.

I see you're Chileno, so it's good we're not at a party face-to-face, because I'd be drunk and start talking about my old roommate and bad Spanish and do some way too loud bad accent "arriba, a bajo, a centro, a dentro" bullshit with my "piscola" and you would be very embarrassed for me.  It's why I do only meth now and hide in my internet cave.


OK though, you're telling me the good Catholic citizens of Chile sell coca tea, such that you can buy enough to get high on?  How is this not several megathreads of people asking the best way to make coca tea, if they purchase ten kilos and use 83C tap water, and what if they take promethazine with it, and someone will demand its closure?


But why the baking soda?  Cocaine as a salt is water soluble, it will leach out of the leaves and diffuse bucally just as it is.

LOL


Most sellers of coca tea and coca leaves are from peru and bolivia vegetables shops. Traditional shops and supermarkets dont sell them because coca itself fall into a grey area of legality (its illegal but not enforced in the practice by the narcotic police in any way)


The alkaline compound its essential to make active the alkaloids (like cocaine) in the sublingual process. I tried coca soaked with only water and it doesnt work

I know this is a long post but there's a detailed report of some new stuff I got. Forgive my autocorrect. I'm sure you can get the gist of what I'm saying.


Just scored 4 grams of nice powder for the price of an 8-ball. Got this from a friend who is very particular about where she buys her Coke and the quality of what they sell. She says the person she gets it from always has good stuff and she's never had any issues with it. First cocaine I've had since early February. I think it's January and February I was building up a slight short-term tolerance to it, the effects of the coke felt to be stronger in January than they did and February. Doing three to four medium 2 million lines about 2 and 1/2 inches long each once or twice a week. Back in the right February used up all my stash. Figured it was a good time to take a bit of a break anyways took this new powder I got tonight about 12 minutes ago. Before taking heart rate was 46 beats a minute, and just a minute ago it was up to 83. My heart rate normally doesn't jump above 105 after taking a couple lines of Coke. I never seem to experience that feeling where your heart feels like it's going to jump out of your chest.


Just took 2 skinny medium wines 2 and 1/2 inches long each, one for each nostril. Don't want to overdo it until I know how this new powder is going to affect me. Nice clean powder, not in fish scale form which is what I usually prefer. The stuff was mostly powder with a few fish scale soft flakes here and there but didn't require much chopping with a razor blade. I try to stay away from okay that's already in powder form. It's easier to cut it with something when it's already in powder form, but my friend only buys Coke from just a couple people that she trust and who always have what she claims to be real good stuff. So I trust her.


Nice clean powder. No hard chunks and just a few soft fiscale flakes mixed with it. Chops up really easy into a nice fluffy powder. As the typical petroleum smell and the typical taste and numbing effect when touched to the tongue. Powder snort it up each nostril nice and clean with nothing falling back out of nostril. The numbing effects on the tongue and gums and the front of your teeth started to be noticed after doing the first line and while preparing the second line. Didn't kick in super strong all at once but in the minute after doing the first line and while preparing the second line the numbing effects slowly but steadily came on. Had the typical runny nose in both nostrils but I noticed with this cocaine versus the fish scale I had earlier in the year was that this time my nose got runny in the same amount of time as it normally does with the running us about the same intensity level as normal but what was different with this powder cocaine versus the fish scale I previously had was with the fish scale my nose stayed runnier typically 20 to 30 minutes after snorting. What I mean by runny is I think the sniff to keep your snot from running down your nose. I always blow my nose and make sure it's nice and clean before starting my first lines, and I'm always hesitant to blow it immediately afterwards. I usually wait till about 40 to 45 minutes after taking a line before blowing it. I know the cocaine dissolves in your nose quickly but now that mucus has the dissolved cocaine in it and in my opinion still holds the effects of the cocaine. I would rather it run down my throat even though it tastes nasty and make my throat numb and to blow it out. With this new powder cocaine I got tonight, my nose was as normal, runny within about 30 seconds after snorting. And for about 10 minutes, I was sniffing to keep the mucus in my nose but after about 15 minutes it seemed to dissipate and the sniffling wasn't needed as the mucus wasn't running anymore and now about 18 minutes laughter snorting, my nose is dry and clear, not stuffed up and not running. The back of my throat is a little numb, my tongue, teeth and gums are the typical intensity of numbness from what I would expect and have experience with the fish scale I previously had. I prepared the lines is 1 Normal size and thickness line, I wouldn't call it an overly fat line and I wouldn't also call it just a medium line. More on the fatter side of medium. Pretty equal thickness throughout the whole line from tip to tip, two and a half inches long which is the size of the razor blade I use and then I cut that line and half and started the now two lines one in each nostril. A little bit on the lighter side of what I normally would do, but with this being a new product I wanted to test it first before diving in like I normally would.


The real big difference between the fish scale I had earlier this year and this powdered product other than one being fish-scale in one thing powder it is, the fish Scale was about 12 to 13 years old. In my opinion being that old, it was still a very decent product. No way to tell the purity of that versus this new powdered cocaine. I've had what I would call. Quality cocaine and I've also had stuff that I would consider pretty chunky, you would have to snort four lines to get the same effect as doing two lines of a better product. From what I experienced, the fish scale had pretty decent effects and so far I would consider this new powder I got how long the same level, the effects seem to be pretty decent. I just prefer the 5th scale because it's a little harder for a small-time dealer to do a quick cut of it versus something that's already in powder form. I also enjoy the excitement of chopping up the fish scale and turning it into powdered lines. This power I got tonight didn't take much to chop it into a nice fluffy powder which took some of the initial excitement and fun out of it.


Now it's been about 45 minutes since snorting. My heart rate was 46 when I started chopping the lines. About 12 minutes after snorting when I started writing this post my heart rate was up to 83. 15 minutes it went up to 87 bpm, at 20 minutes it was up to 91 bpm before falling back down. Right now it's at 75 bpm. I check my heart rate with a Garmin heart rate strap and monitor and a Garmin 920xt Triathlon Watch. The watch and heart rate strap and monitor is reliable and accurate enough that the pros use the same set up. That's what I use each time I check my heart rate to keep things consistent.


One thing I have noticed that I did not notice was the fish scale is that just in the past minute or so my throat which has been numb since a couple of minutes after snorting, saved to get very numb and felt swollen to the point where it was hard to swallow water or speak. But then after about 2 minutes, it seems to listening and not as intense as it was just a few minutes ago. I have experienced something along this line with the fish scale once or twice where the throat gets so numb from the nasal drip that it's harder to speak but nothing as intense as this just was. And, with this powder cocaine, I didn't experience much nasty-tasting nasal drip.


Now it's been 55 minutes. Not experiencing any come down. The feel-good Rush has been gone for a while which is typical for it to only last 15 to 20 minutes depending on quality and the amount taken. But my tongue and gums in the front of my teeth and back of my throat are still numb. No runny nose and no stuffed up nose. My nose is nice and clear. My mouth is quite dry. You might describe it that has that cottonmouth feeling you get when your mouth is really dry. For me, that's typical if I snort anything more than just a bump. Some people experience dry mouth others don't. I've always seem to have. And for me, cocaine always seems to make me a bit horny. Another effect that not everybody experiences. But with me, anything over a bump, I tend to get a bit horny. I don't feel the need to be up cleaning the house or dancing at a party or that I can't concentrate on my thoughts. Usually I don't get overly talkative when I snort. A couple of times I did get extremely talkative. Right now I don't feel the urge that I need to be talking a lot. Some people, my friend who I got the coke tonight from say they get a bit of an energy Rush when they bump or snort, if I have pretty decent Coke, I never feel a strong noticeable Rush of energy. The few times I've had questionable Coke, I could notice a bit more energy Rush but I'm sure that was due to a cut of some sort.


So in a nutshell, compared to the 3 grams of fish scale I had earlier this year that was around 12 to 13 years old, this powder which is current day product is nice and fluffy. A nice White color and consistent from what I can see throughout the powder which is in a clear plastic tube roughly the diameter of a 50-cent piece with one of those child-proof prescription style caps where you have to push and turn at the same time. It's nice and white, not a slight bit off white which I have seen before. Here in the Houston area where it's very humid, the powder doesn't seem to be sticky. It's not clumping up as I dropped it and it's not sticking to the blade either which is nice. I've had some cocaine that was in a hard Square chunk no bigger in diameter than your thumb nail that was slightly off white. It at first was hard to chop up with a razor blade but after a few minutes you could turn it into powder which seemed to be a bit more tacky or sticky, it kind of clumped together a bit in powder form and stuck to the razor blade. I had about 4 chunks just like that and each one was the same way when chopping it up. The fish scale that I had earlier this year didn't seem to be sticky and didn't clump or stick to the blade once it was chopped into powder. The fish scale ad a slight burn when snorting. The hard chunks had a more noticeable burn when snorting. I have never had a nosebleed before, but I did experience one of those hard chunks that I chopped up and snorted, one line gave me a nosebleed. That's the one and only time I've had a bloody nose. 4 grams of stuff I got today is about 95% fluffy non-sticky powder, very easy to chop into a finer powder. From what I can see in the clear tube it's in there are a several trunks, some small and some a little bit larger than your thumbnail and probably as thick as your thumb it is at your thumb nail. No particular shape just small little chunks or clumps. They break up quite easily. They're quite soft. And with a razor blade they chop up into a nice fine powder with no difficulty. I haven't noticed any traditional fish scale flakes that have the pearlescent Shimmer. But there are a few larger flakes that resemble fish scale without the pearlescent Shimmer. This powder doesn't burn at all when snorted. I would describe snorting it as nice and smooth. Didn't see any of the powder fall back out of my nose. I didn't experience that much with the fish scale earlier this year. But the square off white hard chunks, even though it chopped up to a fine powder, I noticed several times that even though I use a straw and snorted it no different than I normally do, it wasn't uncommon to have a few specks fall back out of my nose. The stuff I got today, my first line I did was a medium thick line evenly from tip to tip that was 1/2 inch long which is how long the box cutter blade is I always use. Once chopping it up into a fine powder I cut the line in half and snorted each line 1 per nostril which is typically how I do it, I usually alternate between nostrils back and forth or I'll cut the fat line in half for each nostril. The powder snorted smoothly. Usually with the fish scale even though it's in a fine powder, I can always feel it getting snorted up the nose. And once it gets to the back of the nasal cavity I usually get a slight burn. This powder snorted nice and easily, barely felt it in the nasal cavity as I was snorting, much less noticeable than the fish scale. With the fish scale my numbers ran within the first 30 to 45 seconds of snorting. And within the first two minutes, when typically start to get that nasty tasting nasal drip in the back of my throat which would numb the throat nicely. The runny nose where you have to keep sniffing so the mucus doesn't run have your nose and onto your upper lip usually lasted around 10 minutes. And the nasty tasting nasal drip would usually last around 5 to 10 + -  minutes longer depending on how much you snorted. After the initial point where the mucus would stop constantly trying to run out of your nose which usually lasted the first minute to minute and a half after snorting, the nose would continue to be runny normally for the next 10 minutes. Even though after about 10 minutes or so the running mucus goes away you still have the feeling in the urge that you need to sniff because it feels like you still have a runny nose even though it for the most part dissipated, the sniffling would last anywhere from an hour to 2 hours after you snorted. And then occasional sniffle here and there every couple of minutes like the last the rest of the night on average. This new powder, I get the usual constant runny nose where ear sniffing hard to keep it from running out your nose and on your upper lip takes about 30 to 45 seconds to start and then seems to go away within the next minute. And then the typical sniffling seemed to last 5 minutes and by 10 minutes the nose seemed to be pretty much dry with no runny mucus and the need and or feeling that you needed to sniff seemed to go away completely between 10 and 15 minutes afterwards. The only time I got any kind of nasal drip was within the first couple of minutes when the nose was really runny and your sniffing to keep the mucus in your nose and you end up sniffing it to the back of your throat. Even though I some of the cutest into the back of my throat, did numb the back of my throat but didn't seem to have that typical nasty taste. It did have a slight bit of that nasty taste but nothing remotely comparable to what I normally experienced with other cocaine in the past. Not sure if I just wasn't sniffing enough mucus at one time into the back of my throat or if it's cocaine just didn't create a strong nasty taste. I noticed in the past with previous cocaine that I would get the typical tongue, teeth and gums and back of the throat and sometimes around the opening of the nostrils and tip of my nose numb and once in a while a slight lip numbing but that could be due to the results of licking the cocaine residue from the razor blade after chopping off of my finger and after snorting whatever teeny specs are leftover from dropping it, I scrape as much of that into a pile with the razor blade. I'm always very efficient with my cocaine and Jeep my mess to an extreme minimum. I've seen some people that are a bit messy with it, putting it on the scale and letting pieces of it yet stuck in the cracks of the scale or knocking some off the scale on to the table continue gets knocked around, I'm always very neat and tidy and not wanting to waste a single spec. It's kind of like pennies, each penny adds up, well each respect adds up. So what's left over, kind of the dust from the powder, I scrape it up and use my finger to wipe it off the blade and then whatever is left on my finger I lick it off. I don't see how it's enough product to make my lips numb so my lips probably just get occasionally numb depending on the quality and quantity of the product and the quantity I snorted. So far, the Nelly experience seems to be the usual numbing experience, nothing two particularly out of the ordinary versus the fish scale or the hard off white chunks. I did notice when I was doing the fishtail late last year into really February this year, typically two or three medium size to a fatter medium size lines or if I was going to do four lines of a more typical medium size and again two and a half inches long and usually a bit skinnier at each end of the line over the course of an hour to an hour and a half, usually the four lines if I was only doing it once that week and three lines if I thought I was going to do it two different times in a week. I cut back on the amount of lines mostly to just Preserve and not use up all that I noticed after about five or six weeks of occasionally doing it once or twice usually several days apart if I was doing it twice in that week that I started to build what seemed to be a slight tolerance and after about five or six weeks I started to notice that the numbing affect and whole seemed to not be as strong as it was the first couple of weeks when I started. Not sure if the numbing effect is affected by tolerance or if I was just thinking that the numbing effect wasn't as strong. The powder I got tonight seems to be numbing all the typical areas like you would expect. And it doesn't seem to be an overpowering numbing feeling for a week numbing feeling. Feels just like what you would expect for the amount of cocaine I did tonight the only thing different was about 50 or so minutes after snorting, probably less than 3 minutes the back of my throat seem too quickly swell up to the point where it was hard to speak or swallow water without getting it in your windpipe.. it seemed to come on quicker and then took a little bit more time to go back to the normal numbing I would expect. Never experienced that before. Tonight I did one skinnier medium thickness line two and a half inches long of equal thickness from top to bottom and then cut the line in half and snorted each half in each nostril. And then an hour and 15 minutes after snorting the first mine, I chopped up another line equal to the first lines I made repeat the same process, cutting it in half and snorting each half in each nostril. The second time around, everything as described with the first line I took seem to be pretty accurate way to describe the second line I took an hour and 15 minutes later are the effects seem to be pretty much the same intensity and lasted about the same amount of time. The second time I also experienced about 45 to 50 minutes after snorting the same throat swelling sensation where it was hard to speak and swallow. It came on quicker and lasted a few minutes and was it little bit slower to dissipate.


Maybe someone who has experienced the same thing has an idea of what causes this. Could that be happening due to a cut in the cocaine, or is that a typical side effect to a known cut that could be in this cocaine?


My heart rate the second line I took and every 15 minutes later, while chopping the line, my heart rate was 63 where it has the first go-around it was 46. The first time around 20 minutes after snorting it was at 91. The second time around after snorting it was 94 beats per minute. Which is pretty typical for the quantity of coke I snorted.


As of now, if I had to rate this cocaine versus the fish scale I had at the beginning of this year and the hard off white chunks that I was also doing around the same time as the fish scale which I'm comparing the new stuff to the other stuff mentioned is because The fish Scale and the hard chunks are the most recent cocaine I have to compare to. Which I'm not sure if comparing really says anything about this new Coke or not but I'll stick it in here anyways. The fish scale I would rate as the best. The most euphoric feeling and same to last the longest before fading. The numbing effect was as expected. With the typical nasty nasal drip. The Fifth Scale chopped up into a nice fluffy powder. Even though it was Fluffy you could feel it in the back of your nasal cavity as you were snorting it.. the initial intense runny nose immediately after snorting was what I would expect from cocaine. As far as the intensity and the duration of it. The feeling that you need to sniff because you have a runny nose even though it's not actually running was typical and what I would expect. The occasional few steps every couple of minutes lasted what I would expect, six seven or eight or so after the last snort and  an even more occasional sniffs kind of like what you would get a few days before you get a cold, would last a day or two before completely going away. My nose was always clear and the sinuses were never plugged up. The euphoric Rush, wasn't what is typically described when someone talks about the crazy intense rush. But then again I've never experienced a rush that I feel would be described the way you guys describe it after a night of partying. Never experienced any sort of a come down with it. Next I would put this powder just underneath the fish scale. I'll have a better idea of how good this coke is the next time I do it since I won't be taking test size lines, the numbing effect was what I would expect. The guy the ordinary there. The initial intense runny nose didn't last nearly as long and the sniffling you get once your nose stops the intense running us was pretty short-lived and an hour after snorting, I don't feel the need to sniff. At all. My nose feels dry and not running, it's nice and clear, sinuses are nice and clear. I can breathe perfectly through my nose. The euphoric feeling wasn't intense but then again I'll know more when I take a normal size line next time. It felt good but didn't seem to last as long as the fish scale or be the same intensity of a good feeling as with the fish scale. And so far, no come down but then again I'm sure I didn't take enough to cause one. And then third I would put that hard chunks. They were hard to chop up but once they were chopped up they were easy to get into a powder but they seem to be a bit sticky and stuck to the blade a bit. The runny nose and numbing feeling was what would be expected. Nothing out of the ordinary. When sniffing, it did burn out of the three the most and the only time I got a bloody nose was sniffing a line of this hard chunk. And the only time I felt the need to be overly talkative and switching conversation topics randomly was while doing a line of this hard chunk stuff. Again, the runny nose and sniffling and the nasty nasal drip was pretty much the same as with the fish scale. As far as how long it lasted and intensity. Again, never experienced a crazy euphoric Rush, just the nice feel good relaxed feeling. And no come down. If I had to guess, this hard chunk stuff was probably cut either the most out of the three or cut with something that's not in the other two. The only time I've really experienced talkativeness, a bloody nose and they burning nose each time is Norton was with the hard chunk stuff.


My friend who is a bit more experience with cocaine and knowing good stuff from junk stuff says this new stuff I got tonight is pretty good. So her word is all I have to go by as of now till I do more of it and get a better idea. So far with all of my experience with cocaine, I've always had the best experience with fish scale versus powder or other forms of cocaine.


That's my report for the night with the new stuff. Been awhile since I posted in here. In fact it's been awhile since anybody's posted on here.

I just scored 4 grams of powder cocaine. For now it's in a plastic round tube with a childproof cap on the top. In the past I've kept my cocaine in a desk drawer that locks in my home office. At the beginning of the year I had a couple grams of fish scale. I kept that in a ziplock bag and it seem to do just fine. I'm not sure how does powdery will do.


I live in Houston where it's crazy humid nearly all year long. What's the best way to store cocaine if you do not have a dehumidifier? Obviously keeping it in a cool dry place like inside an AC house versus a hot garage is a no-brainer but what else can I do to keep the powder nice and dry or just like the fish scale, should it not be affected that much by the humidity?

Stick it in the freezer, it's the least humid place in your house.

I hear a lot of people say that use a nasal spray to clean out there nose after snorting. How soon after snorting a line can you do this? If the cocaine dissolves in your mucus in your nose, then that mucus gets tainted with the cocaine and could it allow the effects to last a little longer or once the cocaine is dissolved then it's pretty much done?

That comedown hurts.


What can you do about the nausea and fatigue?

This cocaine I got just a couple weeks ago is the first time I've experienced any kind of negative side effects a couple hours after my last line and Lasting into the next day. Mostly just that really hungry feeling it yet, kind of like hunger pains. No nausea no sickness. No feeling of being tired. Or paranoid I had maybe jusgt a slight onset of not so much a plugged sinus but just a little bit of sinus pressure. It was still easy to breathe through the nose with no problem. Really the first time I've ever experienced anything negative like that. Not what I would describe as the typical come down that people talk about on this forum.


This cocaine all around as far as the positive and the desired side effects seem to be not as intense. Everything from the initial intense runny nose right after snorting to the intensity of the high and longevity of it. I've had other stuff even as recent as the fish scale I had in February that seem to be much more stronger with all of the desired side effects and high with absolutely no come down to speak of.


You would think that cocaine that produces a stronger High and more intense positive side effects would be a good candidate for also creating more of a come down. I've been told, taking a Xanax afterwards helps with the lack of sleep and come down the next day. Was never experiencing a calm down, never had the need to take anything after doing the cocaine. So I don't know from personal experience what works and what doesn't.


Some say benzos work better, other say opioids work better. If I was going to take something, it would probably be a 2.5 peach colored Xanax cut in half to start off with only because my very close friend has a prescription for those and when I cocaine from her for the first time about two years ago, she gave me about 5 Xanax and said to cut them in half and take them once the high starts to wear off and you're done for the night. She says it always works for her the couple of times a year that she is out with friends celebrating something and she's going to do 2 to 4 lines throughout the night. So as far as the Xanax, I have some access to them. She a reasonably light occasional cocaine user, mostly just for the fun of it, a bump here and about there and a small line here a lot of times just to get the day started when she wakes up and is dragging. Maybe a l 3 or 4 light/medium sized lines through the course of a night if she's out with friends celebrating something which could easily be 4 or 5 months in between.  She always says that she experiences a stuffed nose and clogged sinus if she does bigger lions or more than that throughout the night so she always stops before that happens. The times she said that she has had a come down, she says half of a 2.5 milligram Xanax does the trick for her. But then again, she is very athletic, 5 foot 6 and about 120 pounds. I'm sure a larger Xanax would be needed for some dude that's 6 foot 4 and 220 lb.


But from what I've always heard and read, if you have really decent cocaine of very good quality, you shouldn't experience much of a come down if any at all. Maybe it's because you need less cocaine each dose to achieve a good high compared to Coke that's been cut with crap where do you need a lot more dosage to achieve a good high.


With all of my experiences, the classic fish scale shimmery flaky somewhat pearlescent looking cocaine that chops up with a razor blade into a nice fluffy powder that seems to be ever so slightly moist, has always been good cocaine. Good relaxing happy content feel good hi with maybe not a crazy intense euphoric rush like a lot of people describe, but a nice euphoric buzz. I've never really experienced from what I can remember a crazy euphoric Rush type of a high. At least nothing I would describe as that. Not even the first time I took it  or I should say the first time  I took more than one average size of a line at one time, not even then I didn't experience any kind of come down. I know that I always have the best experience with shimmery Frankie pearlescent looking fish scale that chops up into a nice fluffy powder versus cocaine that's either in a harder Rock like chunk or stuff that's already powder.


Typically I normally don't experience any kind of a nose burn or a burning sensation in the back of my throat while snorting or 10 to 15 minutes after snorting fish scale. Maybe the very rare occasion all notice a very slight minimal burn while snorting or in the back of the throat several minutes after but that's not the norm and when I do experience it it's very slight. The times I had access to the hard Rock like chunky cocaine that you need a razor blade to chop up and get it into powder is usually the times when I experience a more noticeable nose burn or a burn several minutes afterwards. To be honest, IMO the hard Rocky stuff has always been my least favorite. Don't get me wrong, it's still good stuff, but I wouldn't compare it to fish scale. The two different times that I experienced a runny bloody nose seconds after snorting was the first time I did two medium-sized fine of some rocky stuff that I cut up into powder probably about 15 years ago and then the second time was with the rocky cocaine after doing two medium lines one in each nostril. Both times for the first time to do any cocaine in over a month. The rocky cocaine always seems to be a bit stickier and clumps together and sticks to the razor blade a bit more and more times than not it burns while snorting. Some people say it's pretty pure stuff Fresh Off the kilo and others say it's cut up rerocked Coke either way, if I'm able to choose an 8-ball of powder and an 8-ball of the rocky cocaine, I'm picking the powder for sure.


But as far as the come down, other than a very slight sinus pressure and a pretty decent hunger pain feeling in my stomach which I experienced with this 4 grams I bought about 3 weeks ago of mostly powder stuff  wish I had  a lot of small little fish scale like flakes with a nice clump a little longer than the size of your thumbnail but about as thick as your pump is at the thumbnail. It resembled fish-scale. Kind of firm like what you would expect and what they razorblade you could scrape off or break it into smaller fish scale like flakes, but had a much more doll not as shimmery look with minimal pearlescent if any look to it. Not what I would consider the classic fish scale look. Didn't have a strong of a chemical smell or taste and didn't numb as strong or as quick either when touched to the tongue or right after snorting. The initial intense runny nose seconds after snorting wasn't as intense and only lasted just a few minutes. The need to sniff only lasted no more than 15 minutes after snorting and with about 30 minutes after snorting, your nose was completely clear, not running and no need to feel like you had to sniff every 20 seconds. Not a lot of nasty tasting nasal drip and numbing of the back throat. Probably due to to they not as intense chemical taste nor runny nose. But I did experience about 30 to 45 minutes after snorting that for no more than 10 minutes total the 5 times it happened from start to finish that my throat down towards where your voice box is and where your esophagus and windpipe meat got so numb to the point where it felt like it was swollen to the point we're for about 3 to 4 minutes it was hard to talk and try to swallow water caused some of the water to go down your windpipe. Each time I've experienced this swollen throat feeling in the past was when I was snorting a couple of lines of the rocky cocaine that I described earlier. It doesn't happen every time I'm with the rocky cocaine nor with this powdery fish scale. But this is the first time I've experienced it with something other than the rocky cocaine.


I just wonder if that swollen throat feeling is the side effect due to a particular cut or even multiple cuts or could it be the sign of the lack of a particular cut or multiple cuts?  The swollen throat feeling if something I normally typically most of the time never experienced but the few times it does happen it is usually far in between.


As far as dealing with the Comedown, I would suggest Xanax and from what people have told me from their experience, it doesn't take a large dose for the typical three or four line night. That would be my go-to and it's relatively safe to take. In regards to the nausea, I'm not sure there is but you can do. It's probably more of a psychological triggered feeling then an actual feeling caused by being sick in other words, I would say that it's more of a feeling being caused by your brain then it is because of being sick. And the fatigue, I've never really experienced fatigue with any cocaine. It's kept me awake a time or two on a long road trip where you find yourself starting to doze off.

With my experiences with typical shimmery pearlescent flaky fish scale is that it chops up with a razor blade into a very nice fluffy powder. Almost like it's ever so slightly moist and ever so slightly sticking to itself but not enough to stick up to the razor blade.


If I get some classic shimmery pearlescent flaky fish scale and it chops up into a dry not so fluffy, kind of a fine grainy looking powder and not a fluffy looking powder which seems to take a bit more time of chopping with the razor blade than what I would have expected with fish scale that was shiny pearlescent looking and in a nice lump.


Should I be concerned about it appearing to be more of a dry not so fluffy powder, kind of has a fine grainy  appearance (instead of the nice fluffy powder you expected to get with fish scale) when finely chopped up  ready to snort, and what seems to take a bit more time of chopping with the razor blade then what I've experienced with nearly all of the other fiscal I've had in the past. Is fish scale like this normal? I've had fish scale many times in the past and it's always chopped up with a razor blade into a nice fluffy very fine powder with a very slight moisture to it kind of making it ever so slightly stick together but still look fluffy and powdery.


****EDIT****


This current 4g of fish scale I got today, when I got it from my friend we split a small line which ended up probably the equivalent of a little more than a typical bump. I noticed then about 15 minutes afterwards that the back of my throat where you typically get the nasal drip had a slight burn to it. Right now, I did a slightly larger then my normal size line and within a minute or so I noticed that the back of my throat had more of a burning sensation then it did with when my friend and I split a small line. Not overpowering but quite noticeable. The burning sensation started about a minute after snorting and only lasted about 2 or 3 minutes before going away.


With fish scale cocaine, I rarely hardly ever experienced any kind of nose burning or burning in the back of the throat. I've always heard that higher quality cocaine shouldn't burn your nose or your throat. Does anybody have an idea of what could cause a cocaine to burn in my case the back of my throat (not intense like eating a red pepper flake, but very noticeable) right after snorting which lasts for a few minutes?

What is the freezer is a no-go? Warehouse and the house would be the best place to store it? I live in Houston where from about March to about November the humidity is normally above 80%. I've got my stuff stashed away in a shoebox and it's in constant AC with the temperatures anywhere from 71 to about 73 degrees and lesser humidity than what it is outside but not as low as I would like it especially for storing cocaine.


Does it matter how it's stored? Leave it in the little ziplock baggie or something like a small plastic snuff like container that I'm sure a lot of people use for containing a gram or two, about the size of a 50-cent piece and probably an inch and 3/4 tall with a screw-on lid? Or is there a better method?


What about those damp rid products that you can buy at the hardware store that are designed to absorb the moisture in the air? I have a couple of those that I use one in my 61 Willys Jeep wagon and the other in my 79 Hurst/Olds. I know they absorb a lot of moisture and only last about 2 months with the cars out in the garage even though they're designed to last 3 months. Never use them before in the house so I'm not sure if they would absorb enough moisture to bring the humidity level down in a small closet size room?


I know cocaine will absorb moisture. Weather I'm coming back from purchasing a few grams for taking a small amount with me that I'm going to use later in the night, I try not keep it in my truck longer than absolutely necessary just because I know it's going to absorb the humidity. So I make it a point that if it has to be out in the elements that it's for as short of a time as possible. From about March through November here in Houston the humidity is outrageous. I know from past experience that if I take a small amount of powder out of my house and into a car and cutting up a line within the first 10 minutes of being out of the house that it starts to noticeably get a little more damp and sticks to the razor blade a bit more than it does when it's been in the house for a while.


I've often wondered if your cocaine is outside of a climate control setting for let's say an hour or less, if the humidity has any real big effect on it other than making it a tad bit more sticky. Of course, it's pretty obvious you wouldn't want to stash your cocaine in your vehicle for more than a couple of hours or even a few days.


But if you did have to take it out of a controlled setting for more than an hour, without having a dehumidifier to store it in, what would be the best way to store it to keep it out of the elements? Like if you purchased some and you couldn't head straight back home for a while or you have it with while you're out and about but I won't be doing any of it for several hours. Any tips on how to keep it nice and dry? Or does it not really make a big difference as long as it's not actually getting wet?

After your shower (if you do with continued deep breathing) you should feel better. But you have that come down to deal with. I have found in my personal experience that a bit off Valium from the doctors sorts you right out. It's worked with people that had anxiety attacks border personality disorder, ADHD (MYSELF) and loads more mental disorders. DEEP BREATHING IS KEY!!! if none of that works it's cause you done it on the basis of ignorance to your disorder that I mentioned at the start. If you don't have any that you know of. You should seek medical advice and make an appointment with your Dr.

If it does that's GOOD it's one thing you can tick off. Next is to smell it.

This is a great post. Lots of good info. I consider myself a light occasional user. I'm one of those guys that do it just for the fun of it. I don't do it for the need or the urge. So it's pretty easy for me to go a couple of months without doing anything. And then out of the blue decided I'm going to do a couple small lines just to get a good numbing feeling and a good Buzz. And then I'm good until the next time.


A couple of side effects that I would add that I personally experience that I don't hear people mention very often would be,


Dry mouth/lips

A bit of a loss of appetite

I get that feeling in my stomach like you get when you're hungry and you get the classic hunger pains.

Getting a bit horny

Swollen throat, not a numb throat from the nasty nasal drip. But the actual feeling that your throat is getting swollen to the point where it's hard to talk and swallow water. I don't experience that every time but when I do experience it is always been with cocaine that I've gotten in powder form. It's never happened with fish scale. Because it only happens with powdered form cocaine, but not every time, kind of makes me wonder if it's a certain specific cut that causes your throat to feel that way for about 5 minutes usually 15 to 20 minutes after snorting your last line. I would definitely be curious to know if anybody else experiences a pretty good swollen throat when they do cocaine that's already in powder form.


I don't know if I've ever seeing anybody or hear anybody mention that they get those side effects. So I often wonder how common those side effects really are

The bleach test is lacking and the biggest variation is usually only with quinine, most everything else just pulls the coke down and doesn't leave swirly, colorful residues anyways. It's from the cocaine handbook but I'd get an EZ test* coke purity test if I was serious about it.

When I want to know is what's the proper way to do a bleach test? And what do the different colors represent? I know it's only an indication of what some of the cuts are in your Coke but at least it's a start.

I am not sourcing or promoting any companies with this post, if this is in any way breaking any rules, by all means throw the book at me and smack me on the nose! Ok, here goes. As someone who deals with coke on almost a daily basis, I’ll leave those details out, my suggestion is to get on a wholesale China product supply site that sells kits and get yourself some. They are cheap in bulk and wouldn’t hurt to get some fent strips as well. With so much shade these days, being safe is key

*Hello all, new user here. Ive researched this topic for about 7 hours now and I seek more information which is why I have created an account.*


A festival I've been planning for several months is coming up this Thursday. I got an ear infection on Saturday and started the 5 day course for Azithromycin (Z-pack). 


I took the last Azithromycin pill on Wednesday (today), 32 hours before the festival starts. I've researched a ton on antibiotics and their interaction with recreational drugs and know enough that it's pretty stupid to ingest drugs while on antibiotics.


However, I'll be finishing the antibiotics over 24 hours before the festival starts but I know Azithromycin stays in the system for 5-10 days or so. 


The drugs I was planning on taking (before I got the infection) was:


?Cocaine 


I couldn't find many studies on the interactions with taking Cocaine **after** completing the antibiotics (but while they're still in the system).


If anyone has any valuable information, that would be much appreciated. Thank you.


Thank you all for your time.

I'm getting conflicting info about whether cocaine is active orally. Can one put some in a shot glass of water or vodka, drink it, and get the effects? How much would I have to do to match the effects of a 25 or 50 mg line?

Out of Lidocaine, benzocaine and procaine, if your cocaine is cut with some kind of cane, which one of those three is most commonly used? Or are the three pretty equally used?


Correct me if I'm wrong. If you do a bleach test on your cocaine, if your cocaine is cut with lidocaine, benzocaine, or procaine, should have did leave a color Trace in the bleach? If so, do all three have a specific color for is it the same eye color? If it's a different color for each, what is the correct color for each one of those three canes? And if it's just one color, what color should I be looking for?


I just got a couple of grams of some flaky cocaine that pretty much resembles fish-scale, pearlescent shimmery look, flaky, and chops up nice in easily into a nice fluffy white powder.


My girlfriend told me that she was going to pick up 7 grams of some stuff that was supposed to be real decent good quality and ask me if I wanted a couple grams. Anyways, before buying she did a small test online the size of two large bumps. After leaving her supplier, she text me and said that the stuff was really good and numbing. She said that her now was nice and numb, and that her face was getting numb. After I got my couple of grams from her, I did a small line and noticed that the numbing sensation was very noticeable, my tongue teeth back of my throat and my nose we're all nice and numb. Even my cheeks were getting numb which for me, my cheeks hardly ever get numb. The numbing sensation wasn't stupid crazy intense but it was pretty strong. A lot more noticeable then what you would normally expect with really decent quality cocaine. Which led me to wonder if it could have been cut with lidocaine, benzocaine, or procaine so before I waste a bump doing a bleach test, I'd like to see if anybody has a definite answer based on a first-hand experience of what color or colors should I notice if there's any one of those three kings cut into it and not just and assumption answer based off of what someone heard through the grapevine. I've done the bleach test probably half a dozen times here in the past couple of months on some different stuff that I have gotten that was claimed to be lab tested with a purity 94 to 96% pure. And some stuff that was lab tested with a purity of around 88 to 92% pure. And then on some stuff I got that was good stuff but noticeably not as good as the lab tested stuff with all side effects being noticeably not as intense, the numbing sensation, the intensity of the Hide, the duration of the high etc... H bleach test faded with the bump of powder slowly swirling towards the bottom of the glass leaving they water down milky looking Trail. A slight oily residue on the surface but nothing left floating on top and no noticeable colors.


Just wondering, what color should I be looking for in the bleach if the cocaine is cut with another Cane, what exactly should I be looking for if it does leave a color? How will the color react, will it float on the top or sink to the bottom leaving a color Trace? What should I be looking for? Will the cane itself float on top? Sink to the bottom? Or was it just completely dissolve?

**Crack usage**


So I don't know if I'm doing this right but I was trying to see if anyone could give me some feedback. My fianc? and I smoke crack on the weekends together and for some reason we could do copious amounts of it that night and he and I seem to fall asleep on each other within a half hour of finishing our bags or sessions. We're not getting shitty stuff either. We were curious if we're the only people this happens to or are we just immune to it or what? I have severe ADD and ADHD so I assumed that had some sort of impact on how I can sleep so easily. Thank you for your help!

> No. If you are in any country outside of South America, there is a 100% chance your cocaine is not going to be pure. Even if you are in South America, unless you are extracting the cocaine yourself, there is still a very high chance that your cocaine is not pure either. Coke is cut even before it leaves the country in which it was produced. Once it makes it to it's destination country, you can pretty much assume with great certainty that it is cut every time it gets in the hands of each dealer or distributor in line before it gets to your dealer. Once it gets to him, he will most likely cut it one last time before he sells it to you. Average purity of cocaine in quantities under 10 grams was 62%. Even if you did wind up with cocaine that pure, you are one the lucky ones.

> However, there are a couple cuts that have been showing up more frequently, and those are amphetamines. The best way to know if you have amphetamines is to pay attention to how the cocaine is affecting you. Cocaine is not the energetic, bouncing off the walls drug that everyone tends to make it out to be. If you are over-energetic, cannot sit still, have feelings of isolation or wanting to be left alone, excessive talking, or you have the shakes, those are all signs of amphetamines.

> The effects of coke are more relaxing than people assume. It's a mild energy that it provides. Good coke will not make you feel an urge to get up and move around all night. You will feel perfectly content with lying in bed watching a movie, or sitting around talking with a group of friends. It causes euphoria, and puts you in a good state of mind. It does not make you want to be alone and does not make you talk incessantly without finishing one coherent sentence. It provides clarity, so it should actually be a lot easier to convey your thoughts with words.

> To be honest, it's going to be very hard to OD off one line of cocaine. As long as you aren’t doing a line that’s 5 inches long, you'll be fine. You could get away with doing a line up 1.5 or 2 inches long (skinny line, not fat) for your first time and be perfectly OK, but it's always best to start small, that’s why you should go with the matchstick idea.

Remember, when mixing cocaine with any drug, always do a little bit less than you would normally do of each drug. Also, make sure you are experienced with both drugs on their own before mixing them.
> 
> 
> 
> The easier question to answer is what NOT to mix with cocaine. There are two obvious answers. One, MDMA. Two, alcohol. Mixing cocaine with MDMA will totally negate the effects of the MDMA. Some people report that cocaine on the comedown of an MDMA high is good. At this point in the high, the desired effects of MDMA have worn off, so there is no longer any worry of negating the effects. The problem is, you won’t feel the typical euphoria from the cocaine. It will give you energy and positive mood lift, but the euphoria is greatly diminished.
>

> 
> Mixing alcohol with cocaine is dangerous because of the chemical cocaethylene. It's a chemical that is highly toxic to the liver. Despite this, drinking alcohol while consuming cocaine is a very popular practice amongst cocaine users, mostly due to them being uninformed of the dangers.

> The comedown: everyone’s least favorite part of using cocaine. The good thing is, it's easy to deal with. A good tip for anyone using cocaine who knows they won’t be able to sleep at the end of the night is to make sure you have some sort of depressant drug on hand BEFORE doing the coke. The mad dash to find such drugs at 4am always ends up unsuccessful so make sure you have them before you start blowing lines.
> 
> 
> 
> Typical drugs used for the comedown are opiates and benzodiazepines. Good opiates to use include Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, and even Heroin. Good benzos to use would be Alprazolam, Diazepam, Clonazepam, or even Triazolam. There are many others of both opiates and benzos. These are just examples. If you have a favorite opiate or benzo, you can just use that instead.

> Marijuana can be a decent choice, but it can also be a really bad choice. It's common for inexperienced users to really freak out from smoking pot while on coke. So, if you're going to use pot, be sure you'll be able to handle it.

I've never smoked crack before so I could help you with that. I've got classic ADHD and it does not affect me whatsoever when I do cocaine

It was not crack, it was just a bit sticky & waxy. It stuck to my razor and credit card a bit when I tried to chop it up. I loked around some other places to see if anyone else had this problem, and found out I could of used a hot plate, and a lamp to dry it out. In case this happens again.

**Banging Coke questions**


I've been banging my 8mg Dilaudid (half pill at a time) for a li'l while now. I'm disabled due to spinal issues & found this the best way to manage my pain with the li'l bit I get due to the CDC crackdown on Opiates. This site (BL) helped me learn how to properly & safely IV my dilaudid. Looking for the same kind of help with IV'g coke. Haven't messed with coke in a long time but my past is quite colorful with it. Found a good source & got 3.5g about a week ago. Went through all of it through the sinus ROA. It was good coke; fish scaly, petrol smell, chopping up chunks were soft & not pieces pinging everywhere. It was a relaxed coke high not cut with amphetamines; just spent a lot of time on my laptop (FB) which I don't normally do. Teeth/gums numb & back of throat but not entire face. However, my sinuses took a major hit! Used saline nasal spray, NeliMed device & neosporin on an ear swab B4 bed. I use a CPAP so sleep was good. But being out now for like a day or two I've been blowing my nose with a LOT of blood, chuncks of clotted blood snot, really gross shit. I thought that since this is good coke maybe I could bang it & save my very sensitive sinuses. This is something I've never done & looking for some good 'ole BL help from you guys. I read this entire Megathread & no luck finding what I want. Please respond with a safe & proper (HR) way to do this. Already have the supplies from banging my Dilaudid. Along with the "how-to" I'd also like to know what to expect. I read some posts talking of a bellringer but would appreciate an elaborate explanation. Thanks in advance for your help.

Hi texUSA 

read your post and here to help/offer advice where possible ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 

just want to say before anybody states it's not right giving advice on how to do such things it's clear that this person knows what he/she wants to do and also appears to know what they are doing if already injecting drugs, I think it's more safe to offer some advice and help from own experiences and knowledge rather than leave them to figure it out and possibly go wrong! 


so I will say if you have never done this it's always best not to as people say and it's true for my self once you do coke this way it's rare that you will ever use it any other way again! I get you don't want the sinus problems but that's a little inconvenience to suffer from possible OD which can easily happen with this ROA. Question why not try smoking first? Safer in sense of less chance to OD and also less hassle in finding equipment as such. 


If injecting is what you really want then equipment needed - water for injection/ 0.9% saline for injection is best thing after that boiled water (not bottled as can contain lots of unwanted things been naturally sourced) clean needles, mixing dish/spoon and most importantly SCALES! Please do not be a hero and try to eye up an amount this is life and death here seriously if your spending ??? or in your case $$$ spent $20 on some scales!


now it's not safe me telling you what amount to start with we are different people different levels of tolerance and cocaine purity can vairy so I won't state how much I use but start small when I say small 40/50mg thats 0.04/0.05 now this may be very small and not do anything or feel any effect but this is safety and harm reduction if comfortable at that level slowly increase the amount each time till desired effect. You will see people may push 120/150mg but this is insane to start here as this may scare the shit out of you and may push you over the edge.


E.g start with 40/50mg and draw up 2units of water/saline (cold/room temp) you do not need a lot of water unlike heroine or other drugs I dissolve way more than 40mg in 2units of water. put coke into spoon or dish and put water onto it it should dissolve nealy straight away into completely clear liquid may need a little stering around. Now if things not dissolved this is where u need to filter but I can't help you here I have never had to filter so can't explain that process I apologise. If all clear draw back up into syringe and should now hav more than 2 units in with the coke been added into the water and then I'm guessing you know what to do from there. What I will say make sure you hit a vein as if not can lead to ulsars and painful tissue. P.s read advice at bottom before injecting!


BELLRINGERS! 

This is the term used when you literally here bells in your ears because the rush has hit you so fast and hard the blood pressure builds up and sounds like a freight train in your head. Is it gud? This is what people look for but it's also scary as you know you are on the edge of ODing. I always say as long as u feel and here the train rush by you and not hit you your all good but be warned it's scary but addictive!!  


Advice

when you shoot make make sure your sat down inject quickly 1/2 seconds pushing it in, and remove needle asap. Shooting can make you feel sick or want to be sick can make you unsteady once it starts to hit. You will possibly first notice a metallic taste in your mouth/breath then your heart increasing then boom! The tinnisis starts if a good shot, if it's a big shot this turns into ringing (bellringers) your eye sight goes tunnel vision breathing becomes heavy. This lasts for 1 min or so then settles down to an intense hugh for 15/20 mins or so. It always best to have someone there if things go wrong but if they do there isn't much hope, plus this isn't a sociable drug when injecting iv found I'm always alone and want to be alone when using via IV.  also this is very addictive you will use all your coke that way that night and not stop until it's all gone. Make sure you have things close by so bowl if going to be sick as don't try and walk if it's hit you hard your legs will be jelly this can cause further dangours of falling. Can make you very paranoid if on a heavy session of injecting cocaine. And last thing..... enjoy it's one hell of a ride my friend when you find how much you inject its unbelievable how intense and amazing it is but please be carful. If you would like anything else or help il try my best hope this has helped some what ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hi victornc. Thank you so very much for your well written, well meaningful & thoughtful reply. Like I said; I have a colorful past (mid 80's) with various types of "things" (dealing & using; I was my own worst enemy) & thought I had an extensive vernacular. But, reading your reply I realized just how wrong I was. It was well written but clear enough to scare the crap out of me. Yes, I've been banging my Dilaudid but that's something I know what's in it. I never know exactly what I'm getting with Coke. You helped me realize what a novice I am & that my thoughts were mis-guided & dangerous! I never once banged any street drug & don't wanna start now. As much of an inconvenience it is I'll stick with the nasal ROA w/some teeth/gum rubbing too. Will just continue my sinus regimen of care hoping for a less intense experience than the last time. Like tonight, hasn't been as bad as last night. Tried a few different types of intake & has been decent. And lastly, I live alone & would be idiotic to try something like that by myself. TY again.

Plugging c0ke is probably the best(safer) roa I?ve tried. It?s almost like a mild dose of hqE. Your investment lasts waaay longer and the comedown isn?t as crappy. I don?t get that nasty squirrely feeling. And I?ve literally tried every method numerous times... it is a way overpriced overrated experience, plugging or walrusballs are the only rec uses I really enjoy it in. Micro dosing is a great tool if you?ve got to pull a60+ hour work week tho...

Also if you are banging it, if you don?t puke within the first two minutes, the prod is whack AF and you may want to contemplate what else is really in it and plug it instead....

This statement is completely false. My drugs make you throw up quickly via IV ROA (meth, coke, heroin, mdma, I could go on...). While I normally didn't puke or dry heav from any IV drug except coke (SOMETIMES high dose meth), it is certainly NOT an indicator to determine how pure your drugs are.

Like I said; I have a colorful past (mid 80's) with various types of "things" (dealing & using; I was my own worst enemy) & thought I had an extensive vernacular. But, reading your reply I realized just how wrong I was. It was well written but clear enough to scare the crap out of me. Yes, I've been banging my Dilaudid but that's something I know what's in it. I never know exactly what I'm getting with Coke. You helped me realize what a novice I am & that my thoughts were mis-guided & dangerous! I never once banged any street drug & don't wanna start now. As much of an inconvenience it is I'll stick with the nasal ROA w/some teeth/gum rubbing too. Will just continue my sinus regimen of care hoping for a less intense experience than the last time. Like tonight, hasn't been as bad as last night. Tried a few different types of intake & has been decent. And lastly, I live alone & would be idiotic to try something like that by myself. TY again.

Hi texUSA

In a way I am pleased you have came to this decision my friend ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) and pleased to have helped with my first ever post on here just for you haha. I apologise about spelling/lack of English I'm hopeless and dyslectic but I try haha. As I say it really can be scary and frightening but also a wonderful rush. It is completely a different drug when IV and not snorted they are incompatible they really are. My advice is true from my own experiences although admit to being a hypocrite as I never really had people there and have done it before with out weighing out the coke and just chucking it in the spoon, but would never endorse this same as never endorse IVing it but will always try to offer advice if I can because that's better than saying 'don't do it you junkie' that helps nobody in my eyes. Least my advice and help has actually helped your decision to not do it is a perfect example of this. I am lucky as as have this under control and my use has gotten way less over this year it use to be once a month but iv only used 4 times this year so it can be controlled easily but still once I start a session there's no stopping till all the coke has gone ano I know I'm planning this again very soon and I'm already butterfly's and tightening of the stomach thinking of the effects it's that powerful. Anyways hope the nose gets better maybe try saline washes in between every few lines? Maybe that might help but not sure I never had much issue with nose only when coke was wearing off hadnsore nose for a hour or so that was it. Have a good day sir ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

So how many lines do you guys typically get out of half a gram?


A very close friend of mine who is also my supplier, over a 7-hour long night out at the Club, she told me she did 11 lines which was half a gram which she was a bit embarrassed because she very rarely does that much at one time.


I've never really thought to count how many lines I get out of half a gram or even a full gram. My friend always tells me that she does small skinny lines so her stuff will last longer and also so her sinuses won't give her trouble but yeah she was a bit embarrassed to tell me she did 11 skinny lines over a 7-hour night. She said if her two friends that she sold three grams each two weren't we as much as they were doing, she wouldn't have done the amount she did.


It's been probably three or more years since the last time I went through half a gram over a long night.


My lines are 2 and 1/2 inches long which is the length of the razor blade. Pretty skinny at both ends and then it gets a little thicker in the middle. I wouldn't say that my lines are skinny and I would definitely not say there fat. I always consider them on the lighter side of a medium-sized line if a two and a half inch line can be considered medium compared to the length of a credit card.  I just I got 3 grams from my friend yesterday. I guess I should have kept track of how many lines I get out of that half a gram over the next week and a half, two weeks or so for a better comparison before posting this. Oh well


One more question, when I first started dabbling with cocaine in my early twenties, I quickly came to the conclusion that a regular size Stanley box cutter blade a, 2 and 1/2 inches in length works a thousand times better when chopping your line in a powder compared to a credit card. I know a lot of people use credit cards and make their lines as long as the credit card. I try to never use a credit card if I don't have to. So pretty much my lines have always been 2 and 1/2 inches long. I'm not sure if that would be considered a short line or a pretty average, or if using a credit card is more of the standard. I just prefer the blade because they chops the lump or the flakes into a really nice fine powder.


I'm assuming that 11 small skinny lines ( which she said it came out to half a gram) over a 7 hour night would be considered more of a lighter usage compared to if she did the 11 lines in a four or five hour period.

Hey victornc, in your 1st reply you mentioned 2 units of water. How much is 2 units. The syringes I have are 1ml. And I admit (like you did) that I caved & tried it the night we 1st chatted. I used a very small amount; like the amount I would lay out for 1 line. Didn't get a huge rush or bells but could tell I did it. It was rather mild but that's good. I may've unknowingly done way more if I hadn't read your reply. Anyway, I'm out of C right now buy might recoup soon. Just curious about the question of what is 2 units? Thanks.

On an average 1ml syringe you will notice numbers rising up to the top from 0-100. Those are the units. There are 100units per 

1cc/1ml. 

2 units would be to the very first line that is marked on the syringe, so its 2/100ml. That amount of water won't dissolve anything. He probably meant 20 units. which is just about 1/5 of the way up the barrel. Most of the needles I have seen have the units marked in increments of 10. 

I STRONGLY encourage you to read up on IV usage and safety if your are going to do this. You dont sound all to knowledgeable on the subject and that is important if you are insistent on using this ROA. ESPECIALLY with coke. 

This drug is not for the unseasoned user when IV'd. Be careful.

I'm not asking what cuts are used more as a filler and nothing else. I'm asking which most commonly found cuts by themselves most resemble the effects of cocaine. I know the benzocaine lidocaine procaine are all numbing agents and caffeine acts as a stimulant but what other cuts are used that could fool you into thinking your cocaine is better than it really is?

Hey texusa

I got it wrong the bloke above is right it?s 20 units. The second line from the needle. Lyk I said best to start slow nd steady if u used 50mg maybe try 70 mg next if u get to 100 mg then take it up 10mg every time Altho I think 80-100 should be gud may just be under bell ringers but start getting the rush nd feeling nd feel safe doing so too. Haha I knew u would try it tempting nd curiosity that gets us all as the saying goes curiosity killed the cat, so just be carful. Have to let me know how it goes if u re-try and can help u more I will try. Think harm reduction is better than not helping.

I've been checking out the internet and looking at different Forums on the topic of how many lines do you get out of a gram?


A lot of these guys are bragging if they can get two or three lines out of a gram and then others say they can get 6 to 8 lines.


I'm just an occasional, just for fun user so I can get quite a few more lines then most people. Over the course of the past week I was able to get 35 key bumps out of half a gram. 4 key bumps visually equals a normal line up for me. I guess if you do the math, it comes out to an average of about 8 lines per half a gram. So that being said, I should normally average about 16 lines plus or minus a line out of a gram.


My girlfriend who was also an occasional, just for fun or went out celebrating with friends kind of a user. About a month ago she went through half a gram over 7 hours while out at the clubs with some friends. She rarely ever does that much in one night. Anyways, she was able to get 11 small skinny lines out of half a gram. Which would come out to about 22 lines plus or minus a line per gram


Neither of us are newbies or beginners. They both have over 12 years of experience with cocaine, we're just not heavy users at any given time.


How many lines do you guys normally get out of a gram? On average?

A lot of people like to brag about how big they make their lines. In reality, the size of those huge lines would kill them 3x over with pure coke. 

They are most likely getting very poor quality cocaine which is nothing to brag about. 

If you can do small lines and feel good from them and you're not a novice, chances are you have better product than them.

**cocaine- unanswered questions- overrated?**


So I tried cocaine the other night got around 2 grams went at it alone with some drinks.  The high was good, but definitely not worth the comedown that shit sucked.  Over the course of the night I tried managing both responsibly haha did maybe .5-1g of it before I forced myself to stop in a period of 5 hours, had maybe 5 standard beers along with it.  Renounced to me later while doing research I guess cocaine interacts with ethanol to produce a more toxic drug in your bloodstream that makes the comedown worse and the high last longer.  Could not get to sleep for the life of me, 6 hours after my last line in pretty shitty depression before I slept for a couple hours and went to class.  Oh yeah, I was pounding water too and made myself eat a little halfway through the comedown.  Very jittery, not worth the high at all.  I heard taking some kind of opiate when in the comedown period works but, I did not have any opiates or depressants in that matter besides alcohol and I didn't like the thought of mixing alcohol and cocaine let alone adding in another drug.  I have a little more than half of it left and would like some suggestions on how to use it and not have a shitty shitty time.  Probably gonna take it during the day so i can sleep later and not mix it with alcohol and take it in less quantity and longer periods of abstinence.  What do you guys think would that help?  I want to do cocaine and not fuck myself up, too late for that anyways but I would rather have a good time.  Why is this drug so popular it just seems like a instant gratification with greater consequences compared to other stuff out there.

I would give these threads/ links a peek to help explain some of the issues surrounding issues with today's coke. If you want to go even deeper you might look into "Operation Purple" and the spinoffs of that program targeted at controlling "Choke" chemicals like the K/Na Permangenates used for coke production.


[US federal cocaine essential (‘precursor’) chemical regulation impacts on US cocaine availability](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/add.12839):

Coacaine used to be of a lot higher purity years ago. While I personally hate coke, it is one of the most euphoric substances out their.  People including myself have endured the horrible pain of drastic spikes in heart rate/ BP ,panic, and severe palpitations to get that rush.

It now very heavily cut and the feeling is hardly the same. 

Much of what is sold now are other chemicals that when combined  walk, talk, and act like cocaine. 

Very poor quality product disguised as top notch. Like Epiphone and Gibson hahaha

I'm fortunate enough that a very close friend of mine who I get my stuff from gets her stuff from two different people. She has a third person but that's She has a third person but she only uses him for emergencies when the other two can't pull through which is not very often.


The lady is a player my friend started using back in late May who is recommended by my friend's boyfriend she knows. The lawyer guy told my friend that this lady supplier always has very high quality fish scale, pearlescent, shimmery, flaky stuff. The after scout people always talk about. My friend usually buys and quantities of 7 grams or 14 grams and then we'll keep a grandpa for herself and then sell the rest at a minimum of 3 grams. Everything she has gotten from this lady supplier has been the classic fish scale that everybody talks about. I am fortunate enough to have access where I can send a sample off to get lab tested. Everything I have sent off to get tested has been between 89% and 96% pure.


Of course with stuff that good, a little bit goes a longer way. But even with that stuff, size of my coupons are the same as I would normally do. I always find that two or three key bumps at a time goes up a further distance then doing a line at a time.


I have done on a very rare occasion a full half gram over the course of eight or nine hours. A little here and a little there. Other than the loss of appetite and not being sleepy. There is really not much of a come down. Of course, after you do that much cocaine even if it's a little each time, when you do have a gram in that amount of time regardless the quality, at some point your nose is going to start to burn and will usually burn for a couple hours once you're done for the night. But the harsh come down everybody talks about, I rarely experience that with stuff that is as good as what my friend gets from this lady supplier. 


With that being said, even though I'm just more of an occasional, "just for fun" type of user. Or if I'm going out on the rare occasion to celebrate with a few friends. I'm just as content doing a couple of bumps every week or two as I am doing 4 lines over a 6-hour night. Like I said earlier, there are the rare occasions 2 or 3 times throughout the year where I'm at with friends and over the course of a long night May do half a gram. Even though nowadays, it's easy for a gram to last me a month if not longer, I'm definitely not a newbie to using cocaine. Back in my early to Mid twenties there were times when I would go through half a gram over a long night once or twice over the course of two or three months. And during that time, there times when over the course of 24 hours I would do a full gram. But nowadays it's more just two or three pumps every couple of weeks or if I'm going out with a few friends or celebrating with friends. So I have a lot of experience with cocaine just not a regular or heavy user.


With that being said I know for a fact I've come across cocaine that has been properly acetone washed many times over the years. There's been times where I've been told it's then acetone washed and is of high quality. More times than not the stuff proved to be very decent, but I was never able to 100% prove it was actually acetone washed. I have never acetone washed cocaine and I've never seen it being properly done.


Of course when you acetone wash product, you're getting rid of 95% (if not higher) of all the crap cuts that have been put in bye 75, 80% of everyone who has touched it along the way until it gets in your hands. So yeah, it's pretty safe to say that acetone washing your cocaine is the best way 2 get your cocaine back to as pure as it's more than likely going to be until the next person starts cutting it again. So yeah properly acetone washed cocaine Purity is going to be a very high.


I've tried to do a lot of research and find out a lot of information about acetone washing your cocaine. Of course there's been post on here that are very detailed and the process from A to Z how you should go about washing your product. I've never heard or seen in pictures and of course what you see on YouTube you got to take with a grain of salt, but I've never seen what the final product should look like once it's been washed and dried.


After washing and drying your cocaine, what should the final product look like once everything is complete? What I'm trying to find out is, if you have the classic definition of fish scale, shimmery, pearlescent, very flaky and a tad bit sticky, when you have a lump of it you can take a razor blade and Flake off as much as you need without it crumbling or crushing into a powder, even the flakes are nice and shimmery and pearlescent looking. When you have that kind of fish scale cocaine, at some point could it have been acetone washed to get it back up to a much more pure state or is the fish scale that I'm getting and having samples tested with results of a very high-purity, is that cocaine that has some out slipped through the cracks and has been cut the crap and back?


Can cocaine that has been acetone washed and dried properly be altered to have a textbook fish scale look with the pearlescent shimmery look and the weighted flakes instead of crumbles without altering the purity of it?

Question.... for the longest time i had to have xanax when i got coke, specifically for when i have to call it a night because i need some sort of sleep for work the next morning or because i just plain ran out. But lately i started wondering if taking a xan bar before i start doing bumps will help me out... Becuz my issue lately is i cant enjoy my coke because i start having an anxiety attack. Not just a general anxiety attack its wierd, basically i cant stop focusing on my heart "thinking" its going fast and i like stiff my shoulders the whole time for some reason. Does this happen to anyone else?? Im just trying to find out if its common. Because it sucks i used to have so much fun when i pick up coke, lately not as much because of this. I do 3 small bumps at a time. High quality

Lyk I said best to start slow nd steady if u used 50mg maybe try 70 mg next if u get to 100 mg then take it up 10mg every time Altho I think 80-100 should be gud may just be under bell ringers but start getting the rush nd feeling nd feel safe doing so too. Haha I knew u would try it tempting nd curiosity that gets us all as the saying goes curiosity killed the cat, so just be carful. Have to let me know how it goes if u re-try and can help u more I will try. Think harm reduction is better than not helping.

Hey Victornc and also Mr.Deeds,

Have made more than 1 buy since my last post.  I had to put some Harm Reduction on myself when it came to buying a scale or not.  I know you said I probably could start with 50mg maybe.  My hesitation was that I'm 52yrs old, disabled, with Hypertension and I knew that if I had a scale in front of me, I would most likely bang 50mg.  But I wanted to know how much was the li'l bit that I had already done and asked myself if I really wanted to intensify that startling rush which I was already familiar with and run the risk of something health related happening.  So I did some research online and discovered that 1 of my Dilaudid 8mg tablets is = to 15mg in weight.  Well, since I only bang 1/2 a pill (4mg) at a time then I knew just how much coke would be = what I see in the spoon when I bang Dilaudid which is 7.5mg.  I was floored!  The 7.5mg that I already did would be, okay to repeat safely but not much more that.  I can't even imagine what I would've experienced if I had banged 50mg of coke.  Y'all are the ones that instilled in me that sense of HR and safety which led to my positive decision to not tempt myself to do something that I shouldn't be doing.  Yo know, my favorite movie is The Matrix and there's a scene in it which the Oracle talks to Neo.  There was a sign above her door in Latin.  She told him it means "Know Thyself".  Thank you Victornc and Mr.Deeds.  So now, I've been banging the coke almost every time I bang Dilaudid; "together"!  Yeah!  I mean, the excellent Dilaudid rush I get when I bang it is great but it lingers for about a minute and then dissipates.  So, this ROA mixture kind of intensifies the Dilaudid rush and helps it linger for awhile.  Sometimes, I just bang the coke by itself but I know that I'm doing 10mg or less.  In fact, halfway through this post I stopped, went and banged some coke by itself and came right back to finish typing this out.  I have a li'l tinnitus going on and my hearing sounds a tad muffled but it's all good.  For anyone reading this that are considering this ROA; stop!  I have a high Dilaudid tolerance since I've been on it many years for my chronic spinal pain.  And, if you're dead set on banging coke by itself, I would advise against it.  I've made 2 3.5g (=7g) buys since Thanksgiving.  It's not only costly but it's dangerous.  Mr.Deeds said too me "This drug is not for the unseasoned user when IV'd. Be careful.".  If your dead set on doing it though, please do you're due diligence in researching it well on BL and don't be afraid to ask questions.  We're on here for Harm Reduction purposes not for story-telling.   ~TexUSA

No, your dilaudid pill contains 15mg of dilaudid as well as additional fillers and binders. The pill * does not* weigh 15mg, it weighs a lot more than that because of those extra fillers and binders. This is a common misconception.

I thought he said his pill was 8mg of dilaudid? His pill has to weigh more than 15mg, because the pill definitely has more fillers than active product, but the 8mg pill only has 8mg of hydromorphone, not 15mg. OP, could you weigh a whole pill and post the weight?

Lol, my bad. But yes, the pill weighs more than 15mg, I wonder if they meant 150mg. But regardless, a scale would help.

that's what I was thinking, its probably ~150mgs. So half of that weight in cocaine is a pretty decent sized shot. I'm not surprised he was floored from that hit hahaha. Glad you are ok OP, just make sure you are reading your scale correctly! One decimal point off and you're a goner with this stuff.

I disagree. Did much research. One 8mg Dilaudid tablet does not contain 15mg of Dilaudid. I know it contains fillers and binders but that does not mean it has almost twice the Dilaudid than what is stated in the drug manufacturers and the FDA's data sheets. My research was based on "volume weight" of one tablet and 15mg was always the answer. I'm done w/this conversation.

I already said I was wrong earlier. I had misread what you wrote. Obviously a 8mg pill contains 8mg. I still believe it is unlikely the full weight of the pill is only 15mg.

Yes I'm sorry, i threw everything off topic. I like cocaine too. But it's probably the one stimulant I have the least experience with, not by choice. I just don't cross paths with it very often.

I might have to switch it up to coke again because meth just isn't doing it for me any more. Or maybe save my money and go sober.

Dear MDPV Psychosis, my deepest apologies as I didn't see the other thread posts that were submitted prior to my last post.  Didn't mean to sound like an a*hole & I'm sorry if I did.  When I put 1/2 a tablet of 8mg Dilaudid in the spoon it really doesn't look like very much to the eye.  I may be wrong about the volume weight being 7.5mg, (half of 15mg from what I believe is the volume weight of 1 whole tablet of 8mg Dilaudid), but I doubt it's 150mg in volume weight either.  If it was; it would've knocked me on my ass or worse.  The effects of coke that I eyeballed as the same as half a Dilaudid were a li'l startling but mostly high-mild & mostly tolerable.  My hearing got a tad muffled but no bellringers & not sure I want to take it to that point.  Anyway, I'm in the process of obtaining a scale & will report my findings once I get it.  Thanks in advance for your patience & understanding.

Do you have a scale that can weigh the pill? I'm curious to see how much it weighs. Once you know the weight of the pill, you divide by 2 and calculate your dose. It seems to me that you had a pretty good experience, so it would be beneficial to find out the exact dose you took so you dont accidentally do too much and OD or do too little and be very disappointed.

Crack cocaine is my current fav drug. Imo the best smoked stim. Very pristine effect, clean, etc. 


All is about not indulging in it too much. Ive stopped allmost all drugs, and one time a month, or one time each two month, I buy a 0,2 then smoke it. No more or it's too much fiendish.


If for example you buy 1 gram, after the 3 first smoke, other one become dirtier, it's useless, and you just want more, before knowing it you spent 300 buck the night. Not to mention a comedown wich will make your world upside down.

Hey, no worries. Check out this website for a point of reference:


[https://www.bluebulbprojects.com/measureofthings/](https://www.bluebulbprojects.com/measureofthings/)


According to them the average long grain of rice weighs about 29mg, so 15mg is about half the weight of a single grain. 


Those pills would have to be tiny if they weighed only 15mg. Manufacturers always bulk up pills so that they are easier to handle (not drop and loose forever in the carpet, etc). At 15mg it would be like a microdot, not a pill.

Well, I went & bought a brand new digital scale. Hate to admit it but I WAS WRONG! The weight of 1 Dilaudid/(Hydromorphone) is exactly 0.15g = 150mg. So half = 75mg.

Sorry for the commotion before. At least now we all know.

MDPV_Psychosis & Mr.Deeds, now that we now know that 1/2 of an 8mg Dilaudid/(Hydromorphone) is 75mg & I decided to bang 60mg; what would be a safe amount of time to wait before repeating that ROA?  I waited 1 hour & already banged 50mg & all seems fine.  Just thought I'd put this question out there to get your opinions as well.  Thanks.

I was very unhealthy with my IV coke use and would dose anywhere from 10-30min apart. I would suggest to wait until you are feeling somewhat "baseline" again. By this I mean no more tremors, dizziness, fast heart rate, palpitations, ect. 1-2hrs in between shots seems pretty reasonable to me as long as you know your body can handle more. What you dont want to do is slam another shot because you're fiending but in the back of your mind your body is telling you "I'm not really ready for more yet". This mentality is dangerous, and yet very common with IV coke. Dont let the urge to redose overpower what your body is able to handle.

I do appreciate your information about your opinion on safe periods of time to wait between shots. I feel we've posted some good HR information for those needing it. Take care my friend.

**5% Cocaine + 15% Caffeine and the Rest is Unknown The Hard Truth About Brazilian Coke**


This is based on an interview I made with a guy I knew on Skype who lives on Rio de Janeiro. Let's call him Rodrigo. The story goes like this...


Rodrigo is a very curious guy who always looks for the truth. He is kind of perfectionist and would always like to get "the real thing". He has the knowledge and money to experiment and this led him to these conclusions that I'm pretty sure you would never see in any other place.

Our friend did not try cocaine in other countries. He was mostly confined to Rio's coke. Rio has hundreds and hundreds of favelas (shanty towns) completely controlled by criminal factions. They usually have kiosks where you can buy weed, coke and may be some other drugs. Our friend experimented with cocaine from at least 20 favelas, and he'd always notice the same thing: all the coke here is orangish and has a texture very very different from what he would see online. It looks more like powdered milk, and it has absolutely no shine to it. Still, there is a huge variety of color tones, textures, highs and side-effects between cocaine purchased from different favelas. After looking for the best available yellow coke for several years, he settled on a wholesaler which is consistently considered the best dealer in Rio. The coke comes as a big rock which looks like it has been cut from the brick, damp with a strong smell of acetone and a little bit sticky. The high is "good" and you don't particularly feel bad after taking it.

Now since he bought it for a very very low price, he thought that he would be able to experiment with that big quantity that he has. He started with anhydrous acetone wash, which almost didn't reduce the quantity. The a chloroform wash, which reduced the quantity to 70% and gave a completely different product! Now it's more granular, light yellow and the high is more subtle. It also does not clog the nose. Good news right? Now read on!

Being a curious guy, he wanted that "fish-scale" he'd always see on the Internet. He brought ammonium and muriatic and started the recrystallization process on the coke already cleaned with chloroform. First step was dissolving the coke in water and....IT DIDN'T DISSOLVE!!!! I mean, almost nothing dissolved!!! The water was full of white flakes that didn't dissolve neither with stirring nor with heating. Adding ammonium did not make any difference! He then dried the coke and put it on an aluminum foil and heated it, and it evaporated quickly! I know what you are thinking: it's cocaine base/crack. But no, it isn't. Simply because it does not dissolve in anhydrous acetone.

So..what's next?

The guy started looking online for laboratories and he found Energy Control. He sent them a 100mgs sample of uncleaned coke and after waiting for a month lo and behold: 5% coke + 15% caffeine and the rest is unknown!!!!!!!!!

So all these years has was only taking this crap? A tiny bit of coke with a mixture of caffeine and medicines?!!!

This reminded me of a conversation I had on some forum a couple months ago with a guy that allegedly knows the cartels in the Paraguay, and they told him that they prefer sending coke to the US and Europe due to the huge difference in exchange rate and purchasing power. I mean think about it: it is sold here for 10% of the US/European price.

The last thing I heard from him was that he could get in touch with a dealer (not related at all to favelas). This guy allegedly sells to foreigners and artists exclusively. It was 4 times the price of the favela coke and it looks, tastes and feels completely different from anything he has seen. It looks EXACTLY like fish scale cocaine that he sees online. However, the taste is just too bitter and it's too "ampy". He thinks that it is much much purer than that favela shit but it is almost definitely mixed with amphetamines. Now he's thinking of sending a sample to Energy Control of this "fish-scale" next months...

I would appreciate feedback on my outline for an "ultimate" wash/purification technique. Cuts do vary based on location, but this is designed to cover the most common ones for me.


1. **Ethanol/isopropyl alcohol recrystallization**

-Dissolve 1 to 2 grams of product in shot glass with 200 proof ethanol or 99%/salted isopropyl alcohol

-Filter to remove insoluble impurities

-Evaporate solution on teflon pan or glass dish


2. **Hexane extraction**

-Create freebase using typical method

-Remove water and let base dry overnight

-Mix freebase with heated to 75 degree celsius 95% anhydrous hexane

-Let it cool then add water in a sep funnel and shake until two layers are created

-Discard water layer. Repeat previous step 1-3 times

-Evaporate hexane


Now, either consume the base orally (if you have an aversion to smoking base) or turn it into HCL. Anyone have suggestions for how to turn it back into HCL? I'm getting conflicting info whether or not putting the base in a very small amount of distilled water, then adding muriatic/hydrochloric acid dropwise until base disappears, then evaporating that solution works.

Picked up half a g of supposedly "good" stuff. IV'd ~50mg. Small rush, hardly the bellringer I wanted.

What are the typical IV dosages (w/ no tolerance)?

⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻

Also,

Peripheral stimulation, heart rate, blood pressure, etc.


Should I take: 

- propranolol

- clonidine

- safe to do both?

- neither?

⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻

What supplement/medicine can I take to stop cocaine nausea.


Crack can give me a bellringer w/o nausea, but IV seems to always cause nausea.

Why is that?

Hi Madrus, funny, I picked up 4g's a li'l earlier today. First, I want to make sure you're using a scale & NOT eyeballing it! Secondly, I wouldn't expect much of a rush IV'g 50mg. When I recoup after a while of nothing; I'll start with 80mg & after an hour go 90mg. After a few hours I may go 100mg but usually stick around 90mg.  As far as the ...

Peripheral stimulation, heart rate, blood pressure, etc. I can't tell you what to take. I have my Clonazepam, BP pills & Hydroxyzine but usually just let it pass on it's own.

What an expensive and overrated drug, even with IV. Only that first shot is the best, the rest just stimulate, then no self control = all gone.


Just buy online next time, street stuff always disappointing. Really fast way to empty one's wallet though.

If the coke is decent, a half point shot (50mg) should be plenty w/o tolerance. I once shot 150mg of fish scale and had a ?whiteout? went blind for about a half hour. Very scary indeed. If you?re going to IV coke (or any drug for that matter) definitely get a miligram scale to measure it out.

Help. I've been IV'ing coke about 25-50mg ~30-60 mins apart for 5 hours.

Is it normal for your vision to get really fucky? Like it's just glitching a lot. Could be the heroin as well combined with a lack of sleep?


Also, how do you deal with the cocaine nausea? Is that from levamisole or just what coke does?

Everyone is different but cocaine shouldn't make you nauseas to the point where you need to ask how to deal with the nausea, at least in my experience. I used to experience some nausea if I took a big hit of crack, but it would dissipate very quickly. If you are experiencing a lot of nausea I'd say that's a sign you're doing too much. Vision problems are also a sign you are doing too much.

Hey Victornc, 1st off; I'm grateful the coke I get is chipped right off the brick (no cut). I say that to say this; my tolerance went up so it felt okay to bump up my doses to 120mg (for me & me only! Not a suggestion!). Yeah, I try to have T.V. on so I can sit asap. The T.V. sound gets louder & has a loud echo which is what they call a bellringer I guess. A few times I did 140-160 that knocked me flying & barely made it to my chair. My main issue is trouble finding a good vein. I'm a hard-stick. TTYL, Peace  ✌

Yeah I get the same effect from IV cocaine. It's similar, imo, to a freebase cocaine smoked bellringer, but not quite the same. IME, vaping crack hits faster it seems.

Makes sense. Via injecting it goes like this: vein -> right part of the heart -> lung -> left part of the heart -> brain

By smoking it you skip the vein -> right part of the heart part, which can lead to a faster onset

Oh yeah. I forgot about that. I kept thinking it was going vein -> brain, and thought that smoking -> lung -> heart -> vein -> brain. But no, you're right, see image:

I want to know what the actual mechanism behind the  bell-ringer is. I can produce even when it seems that I'm  all out of dopamine pleasure, so norep. related? Dunno. Only stimulant I know of that produces audio distortion like that.

Yeah I kind of figured nobody would be able to answer it. Was just more curious as to what the top five or so most common Cuts were. Kind of along the lines of these are the cuts that more than likely expect Orbitz that are in a couple of grams you buy on a regular basis. I know lidocaine, benzocaine, procaine are commonly used. Laxatives are commonly used, amphetamines are commonly used. Fentanyl is getting to be quite popular but I haven't read any studies that determine just how often it's being used. Is it in 20% of the cocaine you're doing or is it more than likely in 80% of the cocaine you're doing.


More of a curiosity question. Kind of like X Y and Z cuts are most commonly used and more than likely that 1/2 gram I did New Year's Eve was cut with it. I often wonder when I buy a couple of grams what Cuts I'm more than likely taking on a normal basis versus other cuts that are less commonly used.


My friend that I get my stuff from has a supplier she uses from time to time, the supplier consistently has what I would consider textbook fish, nice pearlescent and shimmery look, the lump is firm but not hard, easy to flake without crumbling. Just moist enough that it's slightly sticky to the edge of the razor blade. Slightly waxy consistency to it in the sense that it's firm but yet very easily chopped up into a nice fine fluffy powder. Noticeably starts to get a bit more sticky and slightly moist shortly after being exposed to more humid air such as storing it in your house and then taking it to your car and within a couple of minutes you can easily noticed that it's getting slightly. And a high is incredible with very minimal come down. I've done three or four easy white tests on several different samples obtained throughout the course of 2 months. The supplier claims its very good you're quality, about 93% or better. Which of course every dealer is going to claim their stuff is very pure, which I always take with a grain of salt until I've chopped up a few lines and tested a couple samples. The stuff each time I tested it with the easy white kit, the results showed the Purity on the color scale was very very dark indicating that it contain a high amount of cocaine vs cuts.  Even then I still wonder if it is let's say 90% or better, what cuts are still in it.


At one time I had access to a source that could do lab testing and determine exactly what was in your cocaine. If I knew then what I know now, I would have taken more advantage of getting it lab tested. But of course, that was back in the mid mid-2000s and for sure cocaine is cut with a lot more things today then it was back then.


Okay, well at least I tried with my question. I can find stuff on the internet but nothing that rates the cuts from most commonly used to least commonly used.


I buy in small quantities, usually less than 5 grams at a time on average and only have about 5 people that I buy for me on occasion. I don't have the means or the knowledge of how to cut cocaine nor do I find it worth cutting a gram just to get a gram and a half out of it.

I'm not asking what cuts are used more as a filler and nothing else. I'm asking which most commonly found cuts by themselves most resemble the effects of cocaine. I know the benzocaine lidocaine procaine are all numbing agents and caffeine acts as a stimulant but what other cuts are used that could fool you into thinking your cocaine is better than it really is?

Hey Lotus, 

Not sure what your original question was, but if you want to know the most common cuts, I think that would be hard to find out, but we may be able to find a list of the most common cuts ranked in order (not even factoring in geographic variables) based on what samples have been confiscated/submitted and tested and their results published.


**1.** Find every possible database, journal article, paper, govt health disclosure of street drug test adulterants/purity results.

**2.** Compile all data into one uniform database that can be sorted -> voila descending order of most common adulterants found


**1.**

a) Find every single published result of street drug testing you can. Here's a good starting point that names some of the biggest testing services:

I give up on this post. Sorry.

Read up on proper, sterile IV administration. Micron filter your solution if possible. Start with a VERY small amount. Consider having an expert IVer shoot you up so you can't do it yourself. Personally I've used it every way possible & I don't find IV worth it. Much too short lasting. I don't regret trying it but I doubt I'll ever IV it again.

I would just look up the Getting Off Right pdf guide as well as this "MQI Safer Injecting Guide"

[http://www.drugs.ie/resourcesfiles/guides/mqi_safer_injecting_guide.pdf](http://www.drugs.ie/resourcesfiles/guides/mqi_safer_injecting_guide.pdf)

It should apply - as I don't think there's much difference in procedure between heroin and coke.


Notes: - Do not apply heat to your solution beforehand

- With street stuff, and all the cuts, I would not want to IV that at all. Maybe just try the DN stuff, which is still shit these days, but less stepped on.

Tex and I have a good conversation a couple pages back on how to safely use coke IV. If you are not experienced with cocaine and/or IV then I would strongly recommend against this ROA. If you are insisting on using it this way then please read through this megathread. IV coke tops the charts on dangerous drug usage and should not be underestimated in the slightest.

Cool guys, I get it, nobody's going to answer anything about Cuts because nobody really knows for sure. Cool, I get it.


Okay, we get it, nobody's going to talk about cuts because nobody really knows without testing.

Changing the subject slightly...


Why do some Steelers put duct tape around the little gram baggie before selling? I have one supplier I use as a backup. Everything you get from her as always individually backed up into those really teeny 1in by 1in gram bags. She well then put duct tape whether it's a solid color or has a pattern on it around the whole bag and even slightly above the opening and then folding the tape back onto itself, Sticky Side to Sticky Side allowing the opening of the bag to have about a quarter of an inch of duct tape above the opening but still allow you to be able to access and and reseal the bag.


I used at the supplier that's my go-to throughout the month of May June and July last year and then on and off quite regularly another two months. Her product is very consistently the textbook description of fish scale. I've even sent a couple of samples at different times to a lab what's the results coming back both times above 87% purity. I know you just her more as a backup or when somebody request the "real good stuff" 


Every time I have bought from her which requires a minimum of a 5-gram purchase, everything is always been individually packaged and those little teeny one gram size baggies. Each time I purchase it from her, the baggies have always been duct-taped. 


Is this to conceal what's on the inside so you can't see it? 

Or is that her style of calling card? (Some people use baggies with Ace of Spades or Superman or Stars printed on the baggie which allows people buying to identify the source depending on what's printed on the baggie).

She consistently has fish scale and the two times I tested it having results of very high quality. From my experiences with her, one time doing about 5 lines and taking hits off of her bong over a 3 1/2 to 4 hour time span. She doesn't come across as a mid-level dealer or she has lots of guns with armed guys by her side waiting for something to go down. She's probably a higher up low-level dealer where she can get stuff straight from Mexico but still keeping it low-key and nonchalant not making it obvious that she deals. But everything I've ever gotten from her has always been weighed and deals. But everything I've ever gotten from her has always been weighed in 1 gram increments and packaged in one gram individual baggies instead of just selling you a 5-gram lump and one of those four or five gram size baggies you get at the smoke shops.


My question is a, what's the purpose for duct taping the bags. Or is it more just her personal preference of how she wants to do it with no real specific purpose for taping the baggies

What household item or what object other than an actual calibrated weight weighs exactly, precisely, 1 gram? Not something that weighs approximately but something exactly one gram that I can use to check the accuracy of portable digital scale?


I picked up 3 grams from a very close trusted friend. The normal two or three gram size baggies that come 100 to a package that you can buy from any smoke shop, when empty consistently weigh on my scale .6 grams. I've never weighed an empty baggie on her scale but I assume it would have the same result. So on my scale if I weigh a gram while it's still in the baggie it should come out to 1.6 grams.


Today when I picked up 3 grams from her she was using a different baggy, slightly larger and made of slightly thinner plastic. Not sure what the baggie weighs empty. She put the three grams in the baggie on her scale and it showed 3.2 grams. I have no reason to not trust that she shorted me on my three grams. When I got home I put the baggie on my scale just out of curiosity and it showed 3.6 grams


So now I'm curious to see how accurate both the scales are. What can I use that weighs exactly precisely 1 gram so I can test the accuracy of each scale and determined if 1 scale is off and I can't be calibrated correctly then it definitely needs to be replaced.


A brand-new nickel supposedly is supposed to weigh 5 grams. Not sure how accurate that information is, and not sure is it exactly 5 grams or can it very from 4.9 to 5.1 grams

Considering a precise 1g calibration weight is only a couple bucks, it would be my first choice. Although if you have a syringe, 1mL of pure water = 1gram.

Thanks


I've done quite a bit of extensive internet research how many different topics concerning cocaine. As far as my original question, I'm sure somewhere the DEA or a credible testing facility has a list of the top 5 or 10 or however many cuts that they most commonly find when testing I would assume there would be several list from credible sources, I haven't been able to find anything other than the same information that these websites are copying and adding to their site. They mentioned common cuts but it sounds like it's just more of a general listening. I would like to find something a little more detailed. Possibly in order based off of the samples being tested over the course of a year or two. I figured the DEA website would have information, from what I see, there's not much information at all.


I'm just curious and I'm sure we've all wondered at one point or another what cuts are more than likely in our cocaine versus other cuts that are less commonly used.


I've seen a number of times where websites have listed sheetrock as a cutting agent. I'm sure somewhere in the world it's used but I have yet to find any Source from a testing Lab or government-affiliated stating that they found sheetrock being used as a cutting agent or even mentioning it when talking about common cuts. I'm familiar with sheetrock and I just can't figure out how someone with half an ounce it's going to use sheetrock as a cutting agent without it being noticeable.


I used to have a good family friend that was a Narcotics officer for 27 years before retiring from the Houston Police Department. Back in 2007. He now lives out in California. Quite a few times after he retired I was able to give him a small sample "anonymously" what she would send to the Police lab to get tested under the basis of harm reduction while turning a blind eye. Mostly testing for purity and to find out what is cut with. Of course that information by today's standards it's pretty much obsolete as far as the cuts go.


Okay so nobody knows of a list or a website with good information. Okay great. No need to keep going on about this particular topic.

It?s one of those knowledge things that should be passed from experienced IV user to novice users. Not to be attempted alone.

Gotta have experience taking a test sniff and waiting an hour to know the quality of your product. Not something you want to be learning via trial and error. 

IV coke is way less forgiving than IV meth IMO... the safety margins are greater for meth than coke. You can accidentally shoot .1gs more meth than intended and just suffer horrible anxiety and insomnia. Coke is not as forgiving. .1g extra could equal a seizure and or death.

Stay safe peeps

Hi there,


over the last year or so, I've started using coke on a regular basis (strictly intranasally), mostly in order to escape my chronic depression and to get myself to do some work, be it a job-related stuff or my creative outputs such as writing or music. Before that, I was sometimes using a designer drug known to me as "Charge" to achieve the same results. It honestly worked much better than coke  but also came with horrible, soul-draining comedowns (much like speed, for better or worse, does), and eventually, the source ran dry and a much less effective substance was substituted for it (the original one was flephedrone, a mephedrone derivate, the other one I don't recall but it sucked). At the same time, I gained a ridiculously easy access to coke and gradually succumbed to it, ending up using it far more regularly than anything before. The quality was not always the best (I had one other source which gave me a pretty solid point of reference regarding what good coke is about), but (probably) regardless of that, the desired effects were increasingly less reliable and the negative effects such as increased heart-rate and general physical discomfort became a common issue. 


At some point, I sought treatment and among else, started taking drug tests every week. However, due to a pretty rapid pharmacokinetics of coke, it left me with some limited opportunities to go on with using. So right now, I am treating myself to half a gram once a week, as a sort of reward for enduring the whole week being more or less functional while experiencing a severe mental suffering most of the time, despite regularly taking high doses of SSRIs and Lamotrigine + occasionally some Modafinil. The thing is, it mostly sucks. It stimulates me for a little while, but soon, it just starts to feel uncomfortable. Above all, it makes me extremely aware of my heart activity - even though my heart rate remains between 110 and 120 bpm (which I understand is still below the truly alarming numbers) and mostly regular, I just become overwhelmed by the very sensation of the heart beating and the slight yet continuous chest pain to go with it. I am pretty sure it has something to do with the effect of various cutting agents such as caffeine, lidocaine, benzocaine or levamisole, but at the same time, it feels like a sign of my body being no longer able to handle the effects of coke, possibly even having developed some kind of cardiovascular issue as a result of the regular use in the past year. It might also be psychosomatic to some degree, me getting used to carefully watch myself and eventually augmenting the symptoms such as tachycardia just by worrying about it too much. However, I usually end up taking the edge off with some wine or beer, no matter how big of a no-no it is to my liver... Such outcome is not unfamiliar to me, but currently, it has pretty much become a rule. And I find it odd in a way, since I have been now for some time sticking to a much healthier lifestyle, eating well, regularly exercising, having stopped smoking months ago etc. Which makes me ask some ludicrous questions such as - could it be that the more fit I am, the less capable I am of handling coke? Was I previously able to use it at times even daily because my body was so fucked up that it sort of accepted it as a standard contribution to its metabolism?


All in all, my question is: Regardless of the great individual variability of how all these different factors may manifest themselves, would you ascribe the undesirable effects of taking coke once a week, as described above, to the poor quality of the product or rather me having become so maladapted to the effects of coke in general? 


No matter what the answer is, it is obvious that I should just ditch the habit entirely, since it only does me harm by now. I guess I continue to pursue it because no matter how bad it may feel, it still takes my mind off my usual shit and thus offers me some kind of temporary relief...


Anyway, sorry for tl;dr, by all means, I will appreciate any sort of feedback. Thanks.

More good news about Levisamole:


> Cocaine adulterant may cause brain damage; Higher levamisole content, lower brain power
> 
> 
> 
> In order to estimate the consumption of cocaine and the amount of levamisole content, the scientists analyzed hair samples of their study participants. Based on this, they examined the cognitive performance of those who had taken cocaine with a high levamisole content (more than 25% proportional to the cocaine) and those who had taken cocaine with a low levamisole content (less than 25% ), and compared the results with a control group who had not taken cocaine.
> 
> 
> 
> As expected, the cocaine users showed lower performance than non-users in all areas -- attention, working memory, long-term memory, and executive functions. However, those who had consumed cocaine that also contained a high level of levamisole showed even greater impairment in their executive functions than those who consumed cocaine with lower levels of levamisole, even though the amount of cocaine they had taken was the same.

I don't know if anyone is still following this thread. Basic question. If you go through 4 bags in a day and then pop 150gm valium plus 100 clonodine, 60 deralin and 20mg melatonin will you actually go to sleep.


Sidenote. My valium tolerance is off the scale so I'm not really worried about that one.


However I haven't done c for around 8 yrs and I really need to go to sleep.


My husband will most likely divorce me if he finds out. So it's either stay up all night or try a mixture of downers and heart rate medication to get at least a few hours sleep. 


I'm not particularly worried, but after reading some threads I'm wondering if I should just stay up and feign insomnia.

I know you said you have a high tolerance to benzos but 150mg does seem excessive. By 100 clonidine do you mean 100 tablets, 100mgs? Clonidine is active in the .1-.3 range.

I can?t recommend you take this many sedatives. Try starting out with 30-40mg of Valium, and take a tiny bit of clonidine. What?s crucial is that you wait at least an hour to see how you respond. For God?s sake do not take all those pills at once! You can always take a little more but you can?t un-take a handful of pills. 

Just tell your husband you?re feeling anxious about something happening tomorrow and just read a book to ?try? to take your mind off it.

Please be safe and use good judgment. Taking a decent dose of Valium is one thing (so long as you don?t combine with alcohol or opiates) but taking a huge dose of clonidine is a whole other matter.

Stay safe

Just had a look through this thread and am staggered at the sheer amount of misinformation offered on a harm reduction forum.


Please people - nobody can ascertain how pure / impure / identity of cuts etc etc by either looking at cocaine, smelling cocaine, touching cocaine, tasting cocaine and definitely not by reading about your cocaine! Everything can be (and often is) faked.


You want to know what's in your product? Easy - send it to Energy Control lab in Spain and for a fee they will provide a full analysis  including percentages. Alternatively send to Wedinos in UK and they will tell you what is in your product  (no percentages though) for free.


Coke is increasingly being adulterated with new RC's. Levamisole is in a LOT of cocaine (particularly so in the States) and can be devastatingly unhealthy. Very happy to say that my personal consumption of  this stuff is (hopefully) firmly behind me


Be safe(r) everyone, much love

I'm having trouble working out whether my dealer is good or not, one week I'll get stuff that I need to take every 15 minutes to keep feeling buzzed, but the next week, I'll get stuff that gives almost the same buzz as MDMA (more rattly and eager to talk to new people) and I only need a bump every 30/50 minutes? Is my dealer stepping on my coke, or is it normal for this to happen? Coke newbie but frequent MD user, trying to use coke for local outings as MD gurns get you kicked out of most places in my area.


tl;dr : How to know whether your coke is good or not

you answered your own question, when it's good coke you only need a few bumps every 30 mins, it. doesn't burn, when. you look at it, it shines, that's y they call. it fishscale. also it doesn't make. you feel restless or edgy, you feel happy, with confidence, on top of the world, that's y coke used to be so popular bcz in the 80s the US was flooded with a lot of good quality cocaine. the quality these days is trash, not even worth it doing it nowadays unless u have a really really good contact. I live in Perú and this is how good coke should look like.

I appreciate the feedback man, it's rare that I get this type of stuff where I live (UK). I wish I had the balls to marketplace but living with too many people to risk that, nobody sells Coke in rocks anymore around here it's all already bashed up or tiny flakes, that's why I'm suspicious of it, is there anything you usually look out for when identifying dodgy coke? The smell, taste, anything common that's out of the ordinary?

sadly, in ur country is always cut and overpriced, I live in Perú hehehe that's y I get good stuff for a really cheap price. but good.coke shouldn't even smell. it's kinda hard to explain you, you would have to try it to know how good coke is, but my advice would be that don't do coke in ur country, if u wanna try good coke, go to either Colombia, Bolivia or my. country ?? Perú ?.

Take care man, NZN

Also looks alone aren't a guarantee as Boric acid can add a fish scale sheen to it. Plus if it's traveling any distance then there's a good chance it will contain Levisamole which metabolizes into a dirty stimulant once it's in your system. The latest figures showed it in 70%+ all seized cocaine at the US border and even straight out of some exporting countries before being cut.  I have to agree with nznity that you could probably find enriched yellow cake uranium easier than good coke in english speaking countries. That nznity Peruvian does look awful nice though. ?

Get a neti pot and clear your sinuses and have nasal spray and lots of Kleenex on hand. Clear your sinuses with the neti pot between every couple lines.and do smaller lines. But you could also smoke it.

Even though I stopped IV'g coke a few months ago, this is a perfect pic of the 3.5g I was using every week here in N. Texas. Guess I'm lucky. One thing I looked for (purity wise) was when I put it in spoon water. Approx 90mg/coke to 2 units/water. If it would dissolve crystal clear then it I'd shoot it. If not clear, I wouldn't.

 Hey hey TEXUSA!!! Hope u r doing well my friend. I see the good news u gave up the needle, that’s good to here and impressive too. Can’t say I have I still keep it well under control although saying that just ordered some stuff of the dark net for tomorrow or day after and no chance il be sniffing that lol. Did u just think not worth it anymore or a bad experience off it? I don’t know y I still do it my self as it causes not but paranoia and awful cut downs but that rush man it’s just to much and the blast or the train rushing by ???. Hope my advice on doing it was decent and also still remember when I put it I said don’t do it it’s best not to start but pleased to see u have stopped least much more safer that way. Be good to here back from u when u can fella. 


To anyone else thinking of IVing I will try to reduce harm as much as possible giving u my advice over the years I have done it but also TEXUSA would be a good source of advice and knowledge too. Take care peeps

I know the bleach test is very basic and somewhat okay primitive way to test cocaine purity


A few questions that I've only been able to find answers that were a bit vague. I have read the article in the cocaine users handbook butt was still a bit confused in regards to the answers to my questions.


First question, how should the cocaine react when coming in contact with the Bleach? The stuff that slowly floats to the bottom leaving a somewhat milky, cloudy Trail cocaine or is it the cut floating to the bottom?


If it floats to the bottom and doesn't completely dissolve, is that the cut?


Should the cocaine dissolve immediately without floating to the bottom, leaving eight slightly oily residue on the surface of the bleach?


Or, is whats slowly floating to the bottom leaving the trail, the actual cocaine?


I've had very good quality fish scale that with an EZ test kit add results of very high cocaine content that one tested with bleach, it slowly floated to the bottom leaving a trail. It also left a slightly or any residue on the surface where the actual cocaine was in contact with the Bleach. And also did not leave any residue undissolved at the bottom of the glass.


How exactly do you determine what is the cocaine and what is the cut? I assume the residue that doesn't dissolve is the cut.


What I'm unsure of is, what do you want to see? Lots of trails as it's only flows to the bottom or a minimal amount of trails? Are trails that are left behind a good indication or a bad indication?

Good evening,


Swim2222 here,


Lovley to be with you finally - long time lurker and peaker/short time member loving it already.


I’d like to open my show with a bang and would like to know if one would be so kind or able as to pick one or more of the Bluelight.org scientists or long time psyconaughts minds;


Here it goes: 


*swim had a beautiful Christmas Day experience with some supreme Cocaine HCL completely smashing time - and it was all down to a unique bit of one might say organic rubber* material! 


This magic material had been made in the jungle of peru and had been sent over to swim ![🏊‍♀️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f3ca-2640.png) in two 8g blocks, that person whom had this sent over had extracted from this the purest product one had ever tried, it literally was a pure unencumbered bout of blow ones socks off at a speed of 400million light years with complete focus.


The problem that Swim had is that the gentleman whom was a Sherpa (from swims mountain climbing days in the andies) the magical Peruvian has taken back with him his secret of extracting this Cocaine HCL from the starting material.


What swim can remember of the time is that a pH meter was of most importance and solvents were most definitely used - but swim allowed the ‘magic man’ to do his magic and he did At the same time as gifting me one more of these smokey smelling almost burnt rubber 8g blocks of heaven, I have pictures, videos and potential even a ‘ample’ for magicians to work upon.


Any help of what he done would be fantastic and I am here to upload and discuss everything and anything to help assist this.


Peace and Love in this major shift.


Swim2222

To be completely honest I've always found cocaine to be one of the most overrated compounds out there. It's annoyingly short duration and fleeting glimpses of pleasure or euphoria always left me with a sense of great disappointment. It would increase anxiety, leave me nervously stimulated and at times dysphoric.  I haven't done much of it throughout my life, but I figured the quality of product I used was above average. Needless to say I wasn't really interested in trying it anymore.


For whatever reason something piqued my interest to give it a last trial run. I previously had always dealt with products sourced directly from the streets. This time I procured the cocaine from a reputable online vendor.


I received it shockingly fast and then I proceeded to lay out a few lines. From what I've gathered this appeared to have all good visual characteristics of good cocaine, so I was feeling cautiously optimistic. In nervous apprehension I gently insufflated both lines.


I was expecting much, but to my surprise a relaxed and focused energy came washing over me. I wasn't left agitated and uncomfortable. My thought processes became much more fluid and my cognitive clearer with a subsequent increase in sociability. This lasted for 30-40 minutes before the disire for another redose emerged.


Even after multiple rounds I was able to retain most of these pleasant effects.  I was expecting a nasty crash, but it wasn't as bad as I had anticipated. 


I guess I never really encountered decent cocaine, but after this stuff I definitely see the appeal of it.

Hey Guys, 


Not posted in a while, thought I'd just check the fuck in with the fellow bluelighters to share my current situation. I been messing around with coke for the past couple of years in varying amounts. Anyway, I got a plug for some really high quality yay- this shit was like butter to snort and kicked like a mule, easily the best coke I've had. Anyway, I had a week off work and studying and my girl was away visiting family so I was like why the hell not? Bought myself a ball, went through that in a few days just drinkin and gaming/chillin with some friends who bought some for themselves/surfin the interwebs/zoom callin my girl...ended up buying myself another gram and I think i finished that in a day/night. All in all I did like 4.5g in a week after not using any coke at all for probably about a month?- I've been back at work and uni for a couple of days now and my nose fucking hurts so bad + I feel like garbage haha. 


I'm not overly worried or anything, I was making sure to saline rinse and use coconut oil on my nose every night- stayed pretty good with eating and hydration + was sleeping pretty good at the time all things considered...I  spent too much money on dumb shit but eh, shit happens.


But yeah, railing lines for like 6 days really beat the shit out of me. My brain feels like it's running at about 60%, I normally go to the gym like every day and I have absolutely no motivation to exercise- I can barely concentrate on any kind of complex task and my nose absolutely wrecks + is producing some highly questionable material to say the least. 


I'm just taking it easy on myself this week, not forcing myself to do anything too challenging and eating plenty of good food. Hopefully I'll get back to normal soon and never repeat this completely ass-backwards waste of time/money lol. 


Hope everyone is doin good ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Damn guys, if your noses are hurting or blood coming out when u blow ur noses it's bcs it's low quality product, not worth snorting imo. To the OP: CMON MAN, 6 days snorting in a row? Think for a lil bit.... your snorting tiny microscopic crystals along with who knows what depending on what it's cut with.....the nose developed to inhale oxygen to ur lungs, not solid stuff that does lil cuts to ur septum( which Is cartilage). Take care of ur body man, the odd bump or a few bumps throughout a night out it's k....but snorting grams and grams during 6 days IN A ROW, cmon man. Your body is a temple  love ❤ yourself a lil bit more. That's all the advice I got to give you from my years fucking around with that shit too, cheers.

I live in Perú and this is how good coke should look like. [View attachment 11802](https://www.bluelight.org/community/attachments/11802/)

I just got a ball that looked just like the pic. Flaky, not crunchy, good taste....but I never got a good high. It also burned like hell after a few good sized lines. Haven't used in over a month, the first line made my front teeth numb but I suppose I'm used to the stuff that's cut with uppers. I was able to concentrate (packing to move) and I never got jittery. I put some in my mouth and it went totally numb. I've never had blow like that, but I liked not feeling like I was tweaked out. Had to stop snorting though because my throat got raw after like 6 lines and that has never happened before. I'm thinking it was cut with that dewormer stuff from the research I did. My nose has sores from that little bit, switched to sublingual but no numbing...weirdest product I've had so far. I'm happy that I never got that sweaty come down though. Thoughts?

I get that way, I like whiskey and weed with it. The few times I had really good quality blow it actually took away my anxiety. The blow ive been doing for the past two days has made me feel confident and in control. The stuff cut with uppers makes me so paranoid if I don't have a downer.

Frustrated that I'm getting involuntary jaw-clenching and mouth movements, long after the initial cocaine high wears off.

What is this cut with?


The last time I felt this way was when I accidentally took a large dose of the amphetamine vyvanse.

Amphetamine cut: Is it possible?


Without testing the contents, on an amount <0.5g, which solvents could possibly filter this crap out?

An amphetamine cut is definitely possible. 


I would think an acetone wash would remove most of the cut, but I'm not sure if it would work to remove amphetamines from cocaine, as many people do acetone washes on amphetamines to remove cuts. [@negrogesic](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/34956/) or [@Xorkoth](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/77889/) might have a better answer.

Good quality DN cocaine, mixed with small amt. of heroin #3 IV.

The audial distortion... the rush, it's nice. Too nice. Must not redose...

Surprisingly heart-rate remains below 70bpm while laying down. Perhaps taking ashwagandha supplement beforehand, which is allegedly calming, helps with this.

---------------


Explain something, experts:


> Cocaine significantly increased beta in frontal and central areas and enhanced alpha in frontal and temporal regions. Cocaine-induced increases in EEG beta power had a cortical distribution similar to those produced by **barbiturates** and **benzodiazepines**. As all of these drugs reduce cortical glucose metabolism, the increases in beta power may reflect a **reduction** in cortical neural activity.

##### Cocaine-induced increases in EEG alpha and beta activity: evidence for reduced cortical processing - PubMed

To understand the effects of cocaine on the cerebral cortex, 14 male polydrug abusers were enrolled in a study on the effects of cocaine on the electroencephalogram (EEG). The experimental treatments were placebo, 20 mg cocaine or 40 mg cocaine i.v. administered in a double-blind, pseudorandom...

How is it that a stimulant is associated with a **reduction **in neural activity?

How is it that the stimulant cocaine produced similar changes as seen from ***barbiturates**** and ****benzodiazepines****?*


Fill in my gap of understanding this please.

Propranolol? Clonodine? Other alpha or beta blockers?

Advise? Dosage? Personal experiences?


Odd Experience:

Clonodine 0.05mg taken

4 hours later: ~35mg cocaine IV

Results: very little felt rush. Disapointing from good quality coke. Peripheral stimulation and shakiness and heart rate felt, but pleasure dampened.

*"Clonodine peak concentration in the blood occurs 2 to 4 hours post-ingestion, and its half-life is between **5 and 13 hours**."*


Yikes. Some sort of blocking effect, you think?

Yes, clonidine has been said to often block some of the euphoric effects of stimulants. When I injected cocaine I personally never really bothered with such a small dose, as it would typically be fairly underwhelming. Not really suggesting that you go higher, but I could imagine not really getting much from a 35mg injection of cocaine. Maybe if it's very good quality or has been washed, which may be your case I haven't read any posts beyond this one.

Thanks. If the alpha-blocker clonodine only affects a1 and a2 receptors then why is the pleasure part of the cocaine blocked?

Beta-blocker fear is unwarranted?

##### Avoidance of β-blockers in patients who use stimulants is not supported by good evidence

KEY POINTS Physicians often hesitate to prescribe β-blocker therapy for patients who actively use stimulants, even for indications such as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and tachyarrhythmias, worrying that potentially harmful interactions will outweigh well-established benefits.[1][1

Yikes.

Today = roughly 20 or 30 IV cocaine shots.

30mg...50mg..70mg... no more than 100mg (though all eyeballed)


I'm stuck in the bellringer.

I only hear the train.


**How did this happen? What is going on? **What have I done to my body?

Thoughts?


So hot and sweaty. Pupils huge.


Took *clonidine 0.5mg & propranol 20mg *both, but spaced out.

+ 10mg ondenstron.

+ 0.25mg clonazepam.

+ many herbal supplments (ashwagandha, gilloy, shilajit, bhrami, bhringraj)

Cmon experts - speculate as to what is going in my body and brain, because it is not pleasant!


Little food due to little appetite.

Please god, help me not binge again tomorrow - give me this strength.

No tolerance? Then its a Bit too much if ist good stuff. I think Abfrage cocaine (gut ca 50%) ok dose would be 30max and redosing only once. Perhaps get a little Bit more benzos in board.

Some good advice there pal. I've not read the thread you replied to, just came across your post. Totally agree, I fucked with the brown at 17 & by 23 it had chewed me up & spat me back out but with a five year sentence on me toes! That was 22 years ago, I've never gone near that brown shite since but last 3 years the white shite has sunk it's teeth into me & I now find myself with a £100/day problem. 5 times as expensive as the H, no physical withdrawals at all but mentally, WOW! I don't sniff, I smoke. If I haven't got any, I can't see the point in wasting my time breathing. Can't be arsed to do anything & depressed is an understatement. Addiction is a bitch! Wouldn't wish it on anyone.

....at least my recent experience in Chattanooga, TN:  It's **hit **or** miss.**


As some of y'all know, I dabble in coke now & then. I got the urge about a week ago. On an impulsive whim (rare for me these days) I bought a gram from a source I'd never dealt with before. Mistake! It was bunk. I had no way to test it, but my educated guess is that it was 80% levamisole. After doing 4 lines, I threw the rest in the garbage can-- and believe me, I am not in the habit of trashing drugs. Of course I'll never buy anything from that person again.


So I still had a hankering for blow and yesterday a coworker said he could hook me up. I went for it and this shit is FIRE! I'm flying high and it's the reason I'm texting to y'all right now-- I just HAD to share ♥  

Here's the kicker: the good stuff was significantly *cheaper *than the bunk! Go figure.


So y'all be careful out there. Use caution and know who you're dealing with.


Love ya! Bye for now...

I was hooked on coke 1986-87 and I won't be doing that again. I only do it a couple times a year. Also, coke is NEVER worth what it costs-- it just goes too fast. It's something to splurge on only every now & then, like high-dollar champagne or caviar.

I know what its like all too well, I also was addicted to coke, severely, now I feel like I have enough control over my use, I still use one g 2 to 3 times a week tho, but nothing.about it feels problematic at this point...


Im only using drugs again since about 6 months or so, I was actually clean from everything, besides cigs, for two full yrs, not even one sip of beer, that completely turned my life around, I am now actually capable to feeling happy again and being okay with how my life is atm, things I considered long time to be impossible I would ever get there again... And this notion that I actually have a life again only contributes further to my well being.

What did me in was IV coke (coupled with alcoholism). It was disastrous. I talk about this in some other threads.

Ya I also am someone that’s gone from problem coke user to reformed once or thrice a year kinda guy.  I don’t seek it out but when people close to me get good stuff they’ll often toss a little my way. It happens when it needs to and I don’t try to rush the system.


Last line I did late last spring, was absolute kill powder.  Chatting shit, getting cocky, typical coke stuff.  Probably the best I’ve done since maybe 2018-19. That’s my problem with it though, I do a line and I think I’m the baddest MF in the room (sometimes I am lol).

I actually got a gram of coke for the first time in a long time recently. At first I sampled a small amount and thought it was meh quality (likely due to some 4F-MPH that i had taken a few hours beforehand). But when I tried it again on a different day it was quite good.


Problem is, I have a pretty significant permatolerance to cocaine due past crack/freebase use, as well as very heavy MPH and MPH analog use. This, combined with the cross tolerance bestowed to me by my current adderall script (which I don't use on the same day as drugs like MPH analogs or cocaine), means that a gram of cocaine doesn't go very far these days (if cocaine cost $30 a gram I'm sure I'd buy alot more of it, but it doesnt -- unless you buy a couple ounces of it). Given the expense of cocaine it doesn't make much sense, nor do I get particularly high when snorting it. Smoking the freebase is a different story, but I'm trying to avoid that mousetrap these days. I did cook up one rock just to gauge how pure the cocaine was, which when smoked produced a far more satisfying effect than when sniffed, but I was able to control myself from cooking up more.


I like quiding coca flour as well, produces a far more usable stimulation. When I'm snorting cocaine I'm back at the chopping block within 40 minutes.

A lil late but with some high quality someone told me about hot plating it, this my first post so idk if it’s common knowledge so I’ll explain briefly jic, basically microwaving a plate that’s a nice surface to cut on and while it’s hot(maybe like gotta be bouncing it on your hands hot) cut up your yay on it and it’ll help get it more powdery by removing the moisture cause when it’s like how you said and you don’t break it properly it can leave you hurting at least in my experience. So this made it easier on the nose for me when i took the time to do that and noticed the difference. Hope this helps even tho I’m all late lol blessings to you all

How bad is occasional use of cocaine ? 

A line here and there a few times a month on a long term basis ?

Well depends on how occasional.. IMO a few times a month is too much for a lot of reasons.  I’d say 3-6 times a year would be max safe consumption in my eyes.  Maybe I’m wrong, but tolerance alone will continue to go up (and lasts a long time) if used any more than that.

Few times a month on night out is ok but the trouble starts is when you have to get packets in before you even go to the pub . My nose just cant take it no more i can only snort one nostril and after a gram or 2 it blister up inside . 13 years of daily heroin smoking did hardly any damage then the years of meth or coke use caused on mental and physical wellbeing

Of course it all depends on the individual.

For me, 3 or 4 times a year (an 8-ball per session) is safe...I don't dare do it more frequently or in more volume than that.

YMMV


Edit: If I could limit myself to "a line or two" I'd probably do it more often. But I know that I don't have that kind of self control.

is very tricky this idea of occasional, because there is the possibility of you find excuses to make this an habit.

But this is my experience: at first I used only on weekends, but I have some moments where I want to use everyday because work is hard and because I want to feel the same happiness I felt when I used for the first time (which will never happen). I'm entering on a line of addiction that started because I have this idea of "occasional use". Today I didn' t use after one week snorting 0,5 - 1 gram per day.

The best option is to avoid the best you can because cocaine will never satisfy you. Your body will always ask for more and more.

However, if you want to use and have self control, try to establish some limits. I just don't snort more than I do, because I try to occupy my mind with other thing (like study, watch a movie) before I move to the next line. I also think a lot about the money and how I could do other things beside the drugs with this money. Maybe some mental strategies could help. I'm just not so f* up like I should thanks to this mental strategy and the little self control I have..

I hate the stuff, never score it, never look for it, never buy it but as many of my friends use it, it always finds me and I sometimes can't get away from it. I have been using occasionally and sporadically but over a long time, about seven or eight years.

Honestly your usage sounds non-problematic to me - probably the best way to enjoy any recreational drug would be sporadically and infrequently. However since you don't enjoy it, it seems a waste. Maybe just make excuses with your friends for not having any of it and just enjoy your time with them in other ways?

Yes, it forms cocaethelyn which is far more cardio toxic. 12 beers and a gram per month would be my max. Now it’s around 4 times a year for birthdays, New Years, Halloween etc with that combo. Ultimately abstinence is best. Fuck peer pressure.

Tried cocaine for the first time this week. Bought half a gram. Diced it into 4 lines.


Took 1 line, every 20 minutes. Was nice. Pleasant. That's about it. 


After the last line, about an hour later I took 20mg of valium and 50mg of seraquel. I feel relaxed, sleepy, a little headache, probably since I havent eaten and need to drink water. I can see why people get super addicted. Thankfully in Australia its too fucking expensive lol. I'd probably be happy doing half a gram, once or twice a year. Couldn't afford anymore anyway.


I'm a daily methadone user, prescribed valium for anxiety, try not to abuse it, mostly I do alright unless its a particularly shit week or whatever. Originally addicted to Tapentadol. Nasty stuff in my opinion. 


Just my little story. In case it helps anyone.

I buy coke in larger quantities, I sell a large amount in one go and keep 50 g or so for myself, that way I make some profit and have a nice stash of usually over 80% purity, thats real fire, my base is in the 90% pure, heavy stuff...


Why cant his coke be 70%? Over here the average purity of coke is 76%...

Omega 3 and CoQ10 should on paper help, at least if looked at in a chronic use situation.

I was on a stag weekend and everyone was doing alcohol, as you would expect..lots of coke around in the trips to the toilet to do it. 


Doesn't seem to bother people mixing alcohol and cocaine.  Difficult to find a person who is doing cocaine but NOT alcohol.

At the end of a cocaine session I take 0.1mg Clonodine and 10mg Propranolol.

Is it safe?

Can I increase the dosages?

Hate this drug.

I can puff nicotine and put it down.

I can take a drink and put it down.

I can do any other drug and put it away.

I start cocaine, I end up in a binge. It wrecks my impulse-control and reward-seeking pathways.


Taking a psychedelic now to slap some sense into me. Probably will cry. Wish me luck.

anybody ever take too much coke or a good serving of coke and find that it makes them gentle? i've used coke to paint and play guitar before and i find that my brush strokes and guitar playing come off super gently and soft. it's like i'm afraid to have heart problems, so i get super gentle. that's the only way i can describe it. it's like my body goes limp because i'm afraid to stress any muscles or my heart. i have really fond memories of doing one painting on coke. good times.

Whenever I get into that cycle I use a good candyflip.  You need the MDMA with the psychedelic for its TAAR1 agonism.  I just got out of a recent addictive cycle once again using this method.

I love smoking basecoke, it gives me the perfect rush, not too intense like IV coke shit Im gonna kick it! but basecoke is perfectly ballanced, and still heavy enough, my heart pounds and Im high as a kite after a hit from the pipe, I only IVd coke two times by itself and one time I IVd a speedball with #3 H.


I can honestly say my basecoke kicks ass and is the ultimate shit, I get my gear lab tested and to start off my HCL is always between 84% and 95% pure, and I had my base tested last time at 96%, so it really doesnt get any better...


Of course I dont buy per g...


I was addicted a couple yrs to coke, about ten yrs ago, and I snorted mostly back then, 6g a day, now I smoke 1g of base 1 or maybe 2 times a week, and Im perfectly happy with that!

Damn, I had a 140 resting the other day, don’t wanna think about 170 :0. 

I’ve read levamisole/other caines-procaine etc/ and a semi common cutting agent in the us that starts with an e, can’t find it now all cause extra strain on the heart, but who the hell has patience for an acetone wash, not me :D,,,![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Yep….I just finished a 6 month daily Cocaine usage. $200 for 2 grams of decent Cocaine, always oily, shimmering, just a hint of moisture (not dry, hard pressed white powder like smashing a Tylenol tablet into powder), oily to the touch and noticeable classic odour of coke, and frequently produced euphoric talkative happy upbeat mood when having a few beers. Smoking cigarettes with a few buds and blasting lines.


Daily I would snort thin medium lines here and there, in morning after Methadone 80mg, breakfast and then a Jin & ginger ale when Methadone kicks in, snort a nice line in my bedroom and head out to outdoor patio for cigarette and 2.oz Jin cocktail. Night time, same thing.


$200 / 2 grams of Cocaine would last 4 days on average …..every week, $200 for a fat little sack of moist, oily, shimmering flakes of great Yayo. 6 months…….,f@ck. Totally unsustainable and a gross waste of money


I get 120 of Methylphenidate (Ritalin) every month/time I pick up my 100 Methadone tablets (25mg each)


It’s been 3 weeks now, no Cocaine……weird at first…..flat emotions, no vigilance or drive. I have been taking Bupropion 150mg XR in morning and a mixture of Methylphenidate (Ritalin) analogs, great considering Cocaine & Ritalin are very similar in their MOA


4-Fluoro-Methylphenidate & Isopropylphenidate 


Mostly 4F-MPH and a little IPH in a jel capsule. Very tiny bumps to get a little rise in Dopamine & Norepinephrine in my CNS. The Bupropion helps too….but every other day….I smoke and reduces pleasure of nicotine

First I tried coke I though lol, who’s so stupid to get hooked on this stuff*, not considering I thought so for cigs too. Fast forward few months and I was daily snorting amounts that would easily kill a few without tolerance. WDs I really didn’t notice so much (mind you I was getting off a lot of other things too) but “once you pop you can’t stop” effect is HC, also “if you have some you’ll do some” effect comes soon with coke.


*smoking freebase is another beast, just after one hit I got enough insight why there are so many crackheads where crack is a thing

How would you know if your coke is cut with amphetamines, I did 2.5 grams one night and it definitely gave me a lot of energy and made me real talkative but also gave me the euphoria from cocaine. I noticed the effects lasted a while but I just related it to the fact I kept doing more and more. I did a freeze lip and it went numb but what the top post described as amphetamines I definitely got

Test it. If there’s any significant amount you might find taste off. And ofc duration. If you don’t overdo coke it’s quite easy to sleep after effects are gone, at least if you don’t suffer from insomnia.

When coke is pure and you have no tolerance 0.5 – 1g is A LOT! A gram of coke as pure as it gets is enough for a night, for a few persons without tolerance. But tolerance builds up so fast that within weeks or months you end up doing amounts that would kill a person without tolerance and it ain’t hard at all to do many grams over the day/night. Only nose is the limit lol. Lungs and veins being able to take in a lot more makes for a disaster. I only smoked it and really liked it and as for I.V. advice from just about any (ab)user – not only once – is a good one. I would say even smoking it might be best skipped as most of those who don’t find cokes high impressive when snorted, usually do when smoked.

Only nose is the limit lol. Lungs and veins being able to take in a lot more makes for a disaster. I only smoked it and really liked it and as for I.V. advice from just about any (ab)user – not only once – is a good one. I would say even smoking it might be best skipped as most of those who don’t find cokes high impressive when snorted, usually do when smoked.

Yeah I mean I used to smoke a lot of crack, so it wasn't too too hard to sniff 2.5 grams throughout the course of a night, I mean it definitely wasn't pure coke but I was definitely soaring high. Now when Ive done only half to a full gram I definitely got high but not as high as 2.5 obviously and it didn't last as long. There were times I was smoking crack and sniffing powder cocaine together. I'm lucky I never blew up my heart. The times I mixed crack and coke I also had stuff to comedown like one time I had Heroin and vodka and another time I had Klonopin and Xanax.

Did you ever found your tolerance really getting to 0? To me it seems that once you properly abused some stimulant even after a long time you can do a lot more than as a stim virgin. I think that effect is much more pronounced than with opiates. As with opiates with a long enough pause at least first few doses are about as when you first used them, even tolerance builds faster every time. Dissos are I guess most notorious when it comes to perma-tolerance but I think that happens only with some serious abuse, both in terms of doses and time.

Yes I absolutely feel that after long term use of stims that there is almost always is some form of tolerance, I was sober for two years and when I relapsed I smoke both crack and meth throughout the night and I didn't die or anything, so I definitely think stimulant tolerance stays to some degree, especially compared to opiates like you said. I didn't know that about dissociatives though but that explains why I can smoke PCP no problem after years of DXM abuse.

I would say that depending on factors like weight of the person, age, metabolism, heart health and what not that influences resistance to side-effects and toxic-effects of coke even less could be very dangerous. I would say that even those who can handle it better than average would experience signs of overdose anywhere between 100 and 250mg snorted in one line. Whole gram effectively absorbed at once would be very terrible and certainly kill some. In reality a lot would end up as a drip and would clog up nose at least somewhat and slow absorption but would still be very dangerous.

Makes me wonder if the natives who just chew leaves get into the same habits and cravings.

Or do they just scoff at the westerners who end up extracting it smoking it and ruining their lives lol.

Heh, same with ayahuasca, the natives drink it, then the westerners come, "discover" it, extract that shit, now we have protocols for extended DMT trips via steady IV-infusion (see DMTx), and I wonder what they think... "What are y'all doing!" lol

As far as I know the chewing or tea drinkers never develop any problems whatsoever.  The rate of absorbtion is such that it's totally different from snorting or smoking.


It's a bit like drinking coffee - your fine unless you drink 10 cups an hour or something stupid like that.  ( Or if you were to take the caffeine in a different and more dangerous way)

Question on harm reduction and mixing with alcohol.


What if I take one line sober and obviously enjoy the effects for about 30 minutes, then I go to pub as it wears off ( and obviously don't take any more bumps from now on)


Is that slightly safer than mixing it with alcohol directly?

Hey I am sorry this was missed.  Members that would know are too busy drinking and doing blow. (just kidding)


I grew up at a time when doing cocaine and drinking was common.  Hell even a snort of heroin at the end was in fashion before the Reagans made all drug users look like criminals.  So cocaine and heroin became the bad drugs.  But drinking was common, and the info we have today on what happens when mixed is more robust than we had back then.  I myself have used cocaine and drank, took methaqualone and used heroin to come down.


I have pondered this question for years.  If you go to South America the cocaine is great.  When I lived in Houston that great cocaine would come into the port, and most dealers I knew would keep it that way and up the price. A few times desperate dealers would cut it more too.  But in Texas and Southern California, the only places I used cocaine 40 years ago the cocaine was good. Clean, a line made you feel just super human, not edgy, at least if the amount was kept low.  Any cocaine will wire you if you do enough.


So I ponder does this good cocaine leave SA and make it to the UK, Australia, New Zealand, et... as uncut?  Would it come into a port the same as it leaves South America or does it get stepped on to high heaven all along the distance?  Can anyone guess?  I know the the closer to SA the better it was.  And I always wondered if it makes it that distance as pure or get cut all along the way?  Not that anyone would totally know, just something I pondered.

Okay so I got 2 packs delivered today. I went a little crazy one night and got a shit load of different compounds. One pack contained a g of cocaine. I’ve been hesitant to.Use it as I took amphetamines earlier around 10 AM. It was one line of amp sulfate so I think nine hours is plenty of time to try some of this white out. 


Well on the way back from the post office I stopped at the smoke shop to get some vapes and some nitrous for my psychs. Last night, I was casually looking at binding affinities and apparently 7-OH  has a higher affinity for the mu receptors than the suboxone I’ve been on for eight years. I wanted to see if this was true, so I got a pack of six 14mg tabs. Well, it most definitely works. I just took 2 1/2 tabs and I’m nodding out. First time in eight years I’ve had these effects. Then it dawned on me that I have cocaine.


Just did a couple of bumps so let’s see how it goes. Going to start low and go from there.
