## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as diphenylmethanes. These are compounds containing a diphenylmethane moiety, which consists of a methane wherein two hydrogen atoms are replaced by two phenyl groups.

### Background

Armodafinil is the enantiopure of the wakefulness-promoting agent modafinil (Provigil), and is indicated to improve wakefulness in adult patients with excessive sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), narcolepsy, or shift work disorder (SWD). Research has shown that armodafinil significantly improves driving simulator performance in patients with SWD. Armodafinil consists of the (−)-R-enantiomer of the racemic modafinil. Armodafinil is produced by the pharmaceutical company Cephalon Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.) and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2007.

### Indication

Investigated for use/treatment in sleep disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders, depression, and bipolar disorders.

### Mechanism of Action

Sodium-dependent dopamine transporter
Antagonist

### Absorption

Tmax is 2 hours when fasted and can be delayed approximately 2-4 hours by food, potentially affecting the onset of action.

### Metabolism

In vitro and in vivo data show that armodafinil undergoes hydrolytic deamidation, S-oxidation, and aromatic ring hydroxylation, with subsequent glucuronide conjugation of the hydroxylated products. Amide hydrolysis is the single most prominent metabolic pathway, with sulfone formation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4/5 being next in importance. The other oxidative products are formed too slowly in vitro to enable identification of the enzyme(s) responsible. Only two metabolites reach appreciable concentrations in plasma (i.e., R-modafinil acid and modafinil sulfone). Data specific to armodafinil disposition are not available.

### Half-life

Terminal half-life is approximately 15 hours.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

Abemaciclib
The metabolism of Abemaciclib can be increased when combined with Armodafinil.
Abrocitinib
The metabolism of Abrocitinib can be decreased when combined with Armodafinil.
Acalabrutinib
The metabolism of Acalabrutinib can be increased when combined with Armodafinil.
Acenocoumarol
The metabolism of Acenocoumarol can be increased when combined with Armodafinil.
Acetaminophen
The metabolism of Acetaminophen can be increased when combined with Armodafinil.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol.
Exercise caution with grapefruit products. Armodafinil is partially metabolized by CYP3A4, and grapefruit is a CYP3A4 inhibitor.
Exercise caution with St. John's Wort. Armodafinil is partially metabolized by CYP3A4, and St. John's Wort is a CYP3A4 inducer.
Take with or without food. Taking armodafinil with food can delay the Tmax by 2-4 hours.

### Mechanism of action

Nuvigil (armodafinil) is a single-isomer of modafini. The exact mechanism of action is unknown. Armodafinil belongs to a class of drugs known as eugeroics, which are stimulants that provide long-lasting mental arousal. Pharmacologically, armodafinil does not bind to or inhibit several receptors and enzymes potentially relevant for sleep/wake regulation. Armodafinil is not a direct- or indirect-acting dopamine receptor agonist. However, in vitro, both armodafinil and modafinil bind to the dopamine transporter and inhibit dopamine reuptake.

### General Function

A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of various endogenous substrates, including fatty acids and steroids (PubMed:12865317, PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:21576599, PubMed:7574697, PubMed:9435160, PubMed:9866708). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:12865317, PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:21576599, PubMed:7574697, PubMed:9435160, PubMed:9866708). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:7574697, PubMed:9866708). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Metabolizes cholesterol toward 25-hydroxycholesterol, a physiological regulator of cellular cholesterol homeostasis (PubMed:21576599). Exhibits low catalytic activity for the formation of catechol estrogens from 17beta-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1), namely 2-hydroxy E1 and E2 (PubMed:12865317). Catalyzes bisallylic hydroxylation and hydroxylation with double-bond migration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (PubMed:9435160, PubMed:9866708). Also metabolizes plant monoterpenes such as limonene. Oxygenates (R)- and (S)-limonene to produce carveol and perillyl alcohol (PubMed:11950794). Contributes to the wide pharmacokinetics variability of the metabolism of drugs such as S-warfarin, diclofenac, phenytoin, tolbutamide and losartan (PubMed:25994031)

## Subjective Experience

Armodafinil is a widely available wakefulness promoting agent, and is sold under a
variety of trade names. I sampled it a couple of times, specifically on occasions on
which I was feeling drowsy and mentally tired.

A 150mg dose taken in the morning did the job, in that it fought off fatigue and
sleepiness. In this sense it did exactly what is claimed on the packet.

There was nothing particularly recreational about it: it was entirely functional.
Equally, there was nothing markedly uncomfortable either. I didn’t feel particularly
stimulated; just not tired.

I should add that it is probably wise to consume this early in the morning. On the
occasion on which I sampled it during the afternoon (2pm), I was unable to properly
sleep during the night. The following day I was even more tired and drowsy than I
had been at the onset of the experiment.

**(R)-Modafinil** (also known as **Armodafinil** and by the brand names **Nuvigil, Artvigil,** and **Waklert** ) is a [eugeroic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Eugeroic) substance of the [benzhydryl](/w/index.php?title=Benzhydryl&action=edit&redlink=1) class. Armodafinil is the [enantiopure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Enantiomer) formulation of [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) (brand name **Provigil** ). As opposed to the [racemic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racemic) formulation, which contains a 50/50 mix of both the (S) and (R) [enantiomers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Enantiomers) , armodafinil consists of just the (R)- [enantiomer](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Enantiomer) of modafinil.

Armodafinil was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2007 for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea, shift work sleep disorder, and narcolepsy.

In addition to its wakefulness-promoting effects and ability to increase locomotor activity in animals, armodafinil can produce rewarding psychoactive and euphoric effects such as alterations in mood, perception, thinking, and feelings typically observed with other central nervous system (CNS) stimulants in humans.

A study in which patients were administered modafinil, [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) , and a placebo found that armodafinil produces "psychoactive and euphoric effects and feelings consistent with [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) ." Relative to modafinil, armodafinil reaches its peak concentration in the blood later after administration than modafinil does, which may make it more effective at improving wakefulness in patients with excessive daytime sleepiness. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

The long-term risks of regular armodafinil intake have yet to be studied in detail. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Chemistry

Armodafinil, or (R)-modafinil, is a psychoactive molecule of the benzhydryl class. Benzhydryl compounds are comprised of two benzene rings attached to a single carbon molecule. Armodafinil is classified as a sulphinyl benzhydryl molecule, as it also contains a sulphinyl group, a sulfur molecule double-bonded to an oxygen molecule attached to the carbon of the benzhydryl group.

From this sulfur group at R 2 , an acetamide group is bound at its free carbon through a carbonyl group to a terminal amine group. Armodafinil has a center of chirality at its sulfur group. Armodafinil, unlike modafinil, consists of only the (−)-(R)-enantiomer of modafinil.

## Pharmacology

Although the exact mechanisms by which [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) and its R-enantiomer, armodafinil , decrease sleepiness are not fully understood, evidence suggests that these agents promote wakefulness by acting directly or indirectly on many components of the sleep / wake circuit. [Modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) and armodafinil are hypothesized to inhibit [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) and promote [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) , [histamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Histamine) , and hypocretin / orexin.

[Modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) and its R-enantiomer, armodafinil , increase both [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) (NE) and [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) (DA), possibly via their blockade of both the NE and DA reuptake transporters (NET and DAT, respectively). The actions of NE at alpha-adrenergic receptors and DA at [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) D2 receptors are thought to contribute to the wake-promoting properties of [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) . Orexin is a key component of the arousal system; thus, the hypothesized action of [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) on the orexinergic system may help increase alertness. Additionally, [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) may indirectly increase histamine, either by reducing GABAergic inhibition of histaminergic neurons or via actions at orexinergic neurons. The increase in [histamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Histamine) may contribute to both the wake-promoting effects of [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) as well as the potential of [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) to increase alertness.

In genetically engineered mice lacking the dopamine transporter (DAT), modafinil lacked wake-promoting activity, suggesting that this activity was DAT-dependent. However, the wake-promoting effects of modafinil, unlike those of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , were not reduced by the dopamine receptor [antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antagonist) [haloperidol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Haloperidol) in rats. In addition, alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, an inhibitor of dopamine synthesis, blocks the action of amphetamine but does not block locomotor activity induced by modafinil.

## Subjective effects

In comparison to traditional stimulants such as [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , this compound induces an experience which is far less forceful, recreational and euphoric. It instead focuses on general [wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness) and [motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement) . In comparison to regular [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) it is usually considered to be less side effect intensive, more comfortable and with a longer duration.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the user's physical energy levels, armodafinil is commonly considered to be stimulating and energetic, but can be considered as much less stimulating when compared to [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) . This stimulation encourages physical movement and activities such as running, playing sports, socializing and exercising. The particular style of stimulation which armodafinil presents can result in jaw clenching, teeth grinding, or other involuntary movements comparable to that of traditional stimulants at high doses, but are manifested much less consistently and intensely when compared to [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) .
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** - Dehydration and dry mouth commonly occur due to an increase in motivation to engage in physical activities as well as an increased sense of focus which causes one to forget to drink water.
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)** - A possible suppression of appetite can be attributed to dopaminergic properties of armodafinil. There is a disparity between the strength of the suppression induced by this substance and [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , likely due to a higher dopaminergic activity of the latter.
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)** - In terms of physical discomfort, armodafinil can cause headaches especially if dehydrated, if you have not eaten food, or if you have been sitting in an awkward position for an extended period focused intensely on a task.
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)**
- **[Photophobia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Photophobia)** - Although uncommon, armodafinil can cause a temporary visual intolerance to light.
- **[Body odor alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Body_odor_alteration)** - Armodafinil, like the racemic [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) , can leave a very distinct smell of sulfur in one's urine. This is likely because armodafinil, being a member of sulphinyl benzhydryl chemical class, contain sulfur in its chemical makeup. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** or **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)**
- **[Memory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_enhancement)**
- **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought organization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_organization)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - A perceived increase of time can be attributed to the dopaminergic properties of this substance.
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: Armodafinil](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Armodafinil.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

The long-term safety and effectiveness of armodafinil has not been determined.

Anecdotal evidence suggests a lack of adverse health effects when sparingly used at small to moderate doses, although this must not be assumed. This compound is a commonly prescribed prescription medication, thus is considerably less likely to have adverse health effects than that of a typical [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) .

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Lethal dosage

The median lethal dose at which 50% of participants die ( [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) ) from either armodafinil or modafinil for human beings has never been reached. No life-threatening effects have taken place in clinical trials involving the administration of 1000mg to 1600mg of modafinil per day for 7 to 21 consecutive days. Intentional acute overdoses of 4500mg and 4000mg in two adult subjects and an accidental ingestion of 800mg by a three-year-old child did not result in any life-threatening effects or death. After overdosing on 5000mg of modafinil in a suicide attempt, a fifteen-year-old female reported a severe [headache](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches) , [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , and [tachycardia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat) , but did not appear to have any lethal or long-term effects.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Armodafinil, like racemic modafinil, may also possess addiction reinforcing properties, as evidenced by its self-administration in monkeys previously trained to administer cocaine; armodafinil was also partially discriminated as stimulant-like. The chronic use of armodafinil can be considered as mildly addictive with a low potential for abuse. It does not seem to be capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users.

Tolerance to many of the effects of armodafinil develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Armodafinil may present a cross-tolerance with all [benzhydryl](/w/index.php?title=Benzhydryl&action=edit&redlink=1) [nootropics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) , meaning that after the consumption of armodafinil, certain [nootropics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) such as [modafinil](/w/index.php?title=Modafanil&action=edit&redlink=1) and [adrafanil](/w/index.php?title=Adrafanil&action=edit&redlink=1) may have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with Armodafinil should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Armodafinil may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.

- **[MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs)** - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , and some [antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressants) .
- **Hormonal birth control** - Modafinil reduces the effectiveness of hormonal birth control for up to a month after use by increasing the activity of the enzyme CYP3A4/5. Notably, the same enzyme is inhibited by grapefruit juice.

## Legal status

Armodafinil is legally approved for medical purposes worldwide. However, it is illegal to sell and possess without a prescription in most countries.

- **Canada:** Modafinil is listed as a Schedule F prescription drug in Canada and it can be prescribed for human and veterinary use.
- **Germany:** Modafinil is a prescription medicine, according to Anlage 1 AMVV.
- **United Kingdom:** Armodafinil is not a licensed medicine in the United Kingdom and is not covered by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 so it may be considered illegal to produce, supply, or import under the Psychoactive Substances Act. However, it may not be covered by the Psychoactive Substances Act as it is a licensed medicine in many other countries [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] and [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) , the non-enantiopure substance that is comprised of armodafinil and the S-enantiomer of modafinil in equal proportions, is a licensed prescription-only medicine (POM) in the United Kingdom. In this case it would not be considered a criminal offence to possess this substance without a valid prescription and it could be legally be obtained with a valid prescription or through legal import of the substance for personal use as outlined in Section 13 of the Medicines Act 1968.
- **United States:** Armodafinil is a Schedule IV controlled substance in the United States. It is illegal to buy, sell, or possess the drug without a prescription or DEA license.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armodafinil*

Armodafinil, sold under the brand name Nuvigil, is a wakefulness-promoting medication which is used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and shift work disorder. It is also used off-label for certain other indications. The drug is taken by mouth.
Side effects of armodafinil include headache, nausea, dizziness, and insomnia. Armodafinil acts as a selective atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI) and hence as an indirect dopamine receptor agonist. However, other mechanisms might also be involved in its effects. Chemically, armodafinil is the enantiopure (R)-(–)-enantiomer of the racemic mixture modafinil (brand name Provigil). Both enantiomers of modafinil are active as DRIs and wakefulness-promoting agents, but armodafinil is more potent and longer-acting.
Armodafinil is produced by the pharmaceutical company Cephalon and was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2007. In 2016, the FDA granted Mylan rights for the first generic version of armodafinil to be marketed in the United States.

## Medical uses

Armodafinil is currently FDA-approved to treat excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), narcolepsy, and shift work sleep disorder (SWSD). It is commonly used off-label to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and major depressive disorder (MDD), and has been repurposed as an adjunctive treatment for bipolar disorder. It has been shown to improve vigilance in air traffic controllers; however, in the United States, wakefulness-promoting medications such as modafinil (Provigil) and armodafinil (Nuvigil) are not approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for civilian controllers or pilots.

### Psychiatry

#### Bipolar disorder

Armodafinil, along with racemic modafinil, has been repurposed as an adjunctive treatment for acute depression in people with bipolar disorder. Meta-analytic evidence showed that add-on modafinil and armodafinil were more effective than placebo on response to treatment, clinical remission, and reduction in depressive symptoms, with only minor side effects, but the effect sizes are small and the quality of evidence has to be considered low, limiting the clinical relevance of current evidence. However current dosage for bipolar disorder is 150 mg once daily. Paradoxical tiredness and sleeping is observed in some cases.

#### Schizophrenia

In June 2010, it was revealed that a phase II study of armodafinil as an adjunctive therapy in adults with schizophrenia had failed to meet the primary endpoints, and the clinical program was subsequently terminated. However, a study published later that year showed that patients with schizophrenia treated with armodafinil showed fewer of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

### Jet lag

On March 30, 2010, the FDA declined to approve use of Nuvigil to treat jet lag.

### Available forms

Armodafinil is available in the form of 50, 150, 200, and 250 mg oral tablets.
A 50 mg dose of armodafinil is essentially equivalent to at 100 mg dose of modafinil in terms of drug levels.

## Adverse effects

In placebo-controlled studies, the most commonly observed side effects were headache, xerostomia (dry mouth), nausea, dizziness, and insomnia. Possible side effects also include depression, anxiety, hallucinations, euphoria, extreme increase in activity and talking, anorexia, tremor, thirst, rash, suicidal thoughts, and aggression. Symptoms of an overdose on armodafinil include trouble sleeping, restlessness, confusion, disorientation, feeling excited, mania, hallucinations, nausea, diarrhea, severely increased or decreased heart beat, chest pain, and increased blood pressure. Serious rashes can develop in rare cases, and require immediate medical attention due to the possibility of Stevens–Johnson syndrome, or other hypersensitivities to armodafinil.

### Misuse potential

Armodafinil has a low misuse potential similar to modafinil.

## Interactions

Hypertensive crises have been reported when armodafinil has been taken with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) like tranylcypromine.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

The mechanism of action of armodafinil is unknown. Armodafinil (R-(−)-modafinil) has pharmacological properties almost identical to those of modafinil (a mixture of R-(−)- and (S)-(+)-modafinil). The (R)- and (S)-enantiomers have similar pharmacological action in animals. Armodafinil has wake-promoting actions similar to sympathomimetic agents including amphetamine and methylphenidate, although its pharmacologic profile is not identical to that of the sympathomimetic amines. Armodafinil binds in vitro to the dopamine transporter (DAT) and inhibits dopamine reuptake. For modafinil, this activity has been associated in vivo with increased extracellular dopamine levels. In genetically engineered mice lacking the dopamine transporter, modafinil lacked wake-promoting activity, suggesting that this activity was DAT-dependent. However, the wake-promoting effects of modafinil, unlike those of amphetamine, were not antagonized by the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol in rats.  In addition, alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, an inhibitor of dopamine synthesis, blocks the action of amphetamine but does not block locomotor activity induced by modafinil.
In addition to its wake-promoting effects and ability to increase locomotor activity in animals, according to Nuvigil prescribing information from manufacturer Cephalon, armodafinil produces psychoactive and euphoric effects, alterations in mood, perception, thinking, and feelings typical of other central nervous system (CNS) stimulants in humans. Armodafinil, like racemic modafinil, may also possess reinforcing properties, as evidenced by its self-administration in monkeys previously trained to administer cocaine; armodafinil was also partially discriminated as stimulant-like. A Cephalon-founded study in which patients were administered modafinil, methylphenidate, and a placebo found that modafinil produces "psychoactive and euphoric effects and feelings consistent with [methylphenidate]."
Like modafinil, armodafinil is an inhibitor and/or inducer of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes. It moderately induces CYP3A4 and moderately inhibits CYP2C19. In contrast to modafinil however, armodafinil does not induce CYP1A2.

### Pharmacokinetics

Armodafinil exhibits linear time-independent kinetics following single and multiple oral dose administration. Increase in systemic exposure is proportional over the dose range of 50–400 mg. No time-dependent change in kinetics was observed through 12 weeks of dosing. Apparent steady state for armodafinil was reached within 7 days of dosing. At steady state, the systemic exposure for armodafinil is 1.8 times the exposure observed after a single dose. The concentration-time profiles of the (R)-(−)-enantiomer following a single dose of 50 mg Nuvigil or 100 mg Provigil (modafinil being a 1:1 mixture of (R)-(−)- and (S)-(−)- enantiomers) are nearly superimposable. However, the Cmax of armodafinil at steady state was 37% higher following administration of 200 mg Nuvigil than the corresponding value of modafinil following administration of 200 mg Provigil due to the more rapid clearance of the (S)-(+)-enantiomer.

#### Absorption

Armodafinil is readily absorbed after oral administration. The absolute oral bioavailability was not determined due to the aqueous insolubility of armodafinil, which precluded intravenous administration. Peak plasma concentrations are attained at approximately 2 hours in the fasted state. Food effect on the overall bioavailability of armodafinil is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration may be delayed 2–4 hours in the fed state. Since the delay in Tmax is also associated with elevated plasma concentration later in time, food can potentially affect the onset and time course of pharmacologic action of armodafinil.

## Chemistry

Armodafinil, or (R)-(–)-modafinil, is the enantiopure (R)-(–)-enantiomer of the racemic mixture modafinil, while esmodafinil is the (S)-(+)-enantiomer.
A number of analogues of armodafinil are known, including adrafinil, flmodafinil, fladrafinil, and others.

## Society and culture

### Brand names

Armodafinil is sold under a wide variety of brand names worldwide:

### Legal status

In Australia, and the United States, Armodafinil is considered to be a Schedule 4 prescription-only medicine or prescription animal remedy. Schedule 4 is defined as "Substances, the use or supply of which should be by or on the order of persons permitted by State or Territory legislation to prescribe and should be available from a pharmacist on prescription."

#### Romania

As of 2021, new laws do not directly include Armodafinil as a doping agent, but they do include Modafinil, as Armodafinil is an enantiomer of Modafinil it will show up on lab tests, but it can be debated if it is or not the same substance.
New laws state that simple possession is not a criminal offence and is punished with a fine and confiscation. Importing into Romania and exporting from Romania of the substance, without a valid medical prescription, is a criminal offence and is punished with jail time between two and seven years.

## Research

Besides hypersomnia, armodafinil was under development for the treatment of fatigue, bipolar depression, and schizophrenia. However, development for these indications was discontinued. The drug reached phase 3 clinical trials for treatment of fatigue prior to the discontinuation of its development for this use in January 2024. Aside from the preceding indications, armodafinil is currently under development for the treatment of eating disorders and, as of January 2024, is in phase 3 trials for this use.
