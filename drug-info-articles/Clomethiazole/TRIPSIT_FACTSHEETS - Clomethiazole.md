## Summary

Structurally related to Thiamine (vitamin B1), but with binding potential at the GABAa site. This causes it to produce effects most like those of a barbiturate: an effective sedative and hypnotic. Originally developed by Hoffman-LaRoche in the 1930s, it has seen use as a treatment for acute alcohol withdrawal.
