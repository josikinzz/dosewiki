Of course some compounds are easy going and leave the option of irresponsible dosing, while others will kick the fuck out of you. There's a huge amount of psychedelics in the spectrum of human consumption, and a range as to how forgiving or teaching/rough they are.

I snorted 4-aco-DMT last night for the first time, I couldn't really tell you whether or not it worked better or worse than oral. It was awesome though. Any idea on the bioavailability of each ROA for this substance.

SONN; in 2013 (summer-fall) I was doing oral 4-AcO-DMT.fumarate from 10-26 mg. Summer and fall this year I am doing nasal 4-AcO-DMT.fumarate from 10-20 mg (so far). 


What I've noted so far:


-oral takes 25-60 minutes to start, and about 45-75 minutes to peak (on an empty stomach). Substance dissolved in water and added to a slug of diet soda (1 oz) (n 15)

-nasal takes 5-10 minutes to start and 20-40 minutes to peak and lasts 40-75% of the length of an oral trip (n 12)


Both have their positives and negatives


Oral seems stronger, but causes me stomach upset unless I preload with ranitidine. Lasts longer. I have to dose on an empty stomach to get predictable effects.

Nasal seems weaker, but starts faster and fishiness quicker. Little or non stomach discomfort. Can eat regularly and still have predictable effects.


Overall I feel nasal is a better delivery (for me), but weaker. I'm ok with the lessened effects and don't intend to go beyond 30 mg nasal (or the same amount oral).

How accurate are the erowid dosage guidelines on this? It says 25 mg is a strong trip, equating it to 5 grams of shrooms. Obviously it's a different drug with a different character, but is that approximately accurate? Comparing different substances is hard obviously, but I feel like you can make rough comparisons. As an example I'd say 3.5 g of shrooms was comparable to 450 ug of AL-LAD for me, in terms of intensity.

It's hard to say considering the different purities of batches going around, let alone the different potencies of shrooms due to growing techniques, possible degradation, etc. I'd say 5g=25mg probably isn't far off if you're considering really pure 4-AcO-DMT, but the times I've had it it's been more like 3.5g=22-30mg. I'd estimate for 5g, but I've never taken that many shrooms, even though I've gone up to 95mg of 4-AcO-DMT.


It's funny, as I thought about what a more accurate dosage conversion would be, I realized that my image of the two's potencies is probably off. As the shroom trip I always equate with the thought "an eighth can make you break through," was with penis envys, which are stronger than "regular" shrooms. And the 4-AcO-DMT I got a couple years back was probably not as pure as I thought, as even 7mg of my 4-aco-met now can throw me into an experience much stronger than 7mg of my 4-AcO-DMT back in the day did. But now I'm realizing that those low dosages recently have all been with MXE too... Christ, this turned out to be the educational post from hell.


But still.

I've read through about 50% of the big and dandy threads about 4-Aco-DMT on bluelight. What I'm most interested in is that often brought up discussion about people noticing the change in the effects received/perceived due to possible degradation of the product or overuse of the drug. Has there been any general consensus reached on the matter? I ordered 10 grams of beautiful white 4-Aco-DMT about 2.5 years ago with a friend. I did a lot of it over a period of just over a year. I'd say about 25 times over a period of 400 days. There were a good number of beautiful trips, a few really interesting ones and the rest were just a lot of fun with no negative body load or unwanted side effects. My friend moved away and I let him have most of what we had left and just asked for about 250 mg, since I planned on ordering another batch. The new batch that I ordered was a slightly tan in colour and produced a lot more body load and anxiety. So I just stopped using that, and did a few more trips with the original batch, which produced great, euphoric trips with little to no bodyload. I stopped using 4-Aco-DMT for about a year then re-visited it using the original batch (which really wasn't stored very well. A single large zip-lock bag. The product was still mostly white, and completely dry. But when I took it, there was body-load like I've never experienced before. All of my previous trips have been between 30 mg -45 mg of the fumurate. This latest trip was with 30 mg. My legs got incredibly crampy, I experience some nausea, and just a general sense of feeling not well. I almost never experience side effects like this. I can do tons of 2C-E or 2C-T-2...or whatever is famous for unpleasant side effects - feeling great. There hasn't been a change in my health or mental state since my first trip with 4-Aco-DMT and my latest so I don't think that's an issue. 


There was one positive to the trip that I haven't experienced to this degree on any other drug. My sense of taste was elevated like crazy. I was snacking on whatever seemed delicious to me at the time - plums, prunes, dried seaweed, fruit candy, fancy potato chips, nuts. It was orgasmic, and everything tasted 10 times better than they should have. I was literally panting with my eyes rolling to the back of my head while munching down. That was about 2 hours in, and may explain the nausea. But man, my legs hurt so badly that I could barely walk for about 45 minutes. And I felt like puking, which I've never had to do during a psychedelic experience. It this just set and setting? I know that some people have postulated that people taking the brown oily goo degradation product might have their trip affected simply because in their mind the product looks horrible. But I was expecting a great trip like the ones that I had previously from this batch, which until now had been batting a 100. 


Opinions anybody?

Hey guys, I have the opportunity to try this substance and read a lot through the existing threads which made me wonder about the dosage like many people do.


I have 25mg but since I have not tripped for a few years I don't want to have a really intense experience, more like a medium trip.

I know that is pretty impossible to gauge but from my research I will go with 20mg max. More likely 15-18mg. ROA would be oral and a mg-scale is at hand.


Now you all know this "don't want to waste material but also don't want to have my ego dissolved" conundrum and basically I just need some confirmation on my plan ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

If the peak is a little underwhelming one can always add some Cannabis or even N2O for a boost, if one is familiar with how these affect a trip...


Thoughts?

Be careful with adding nitrous. I've personally experienced a trip going bad from nitrous and seen it happen to others. It's great on the tail end of the trip, bringing back the psychedelia and extending the duration a bit. But near the peak it can be risky.

Always find it weird that people are hesitant to do N2O and cannabis during a peak.....I love to ingest as much as possible during my peaks.....talk about making the experience INTENSE!

How long does nitrous bring back the psychedelia for? The effects of nitrous on it's own are only a few minutes, right? I'll have to try that next time I'm tripping.

Nitrous lasts longer for me when I'm on weed or psychedelics. I'd give you an estimate of how much longer, but given the nature of the substances involved that seems pretty pointless. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Next time I'll time it, I'm curious now.

Huh. You're right. I just tried some nitrous on the tail end of a dmt trip. It's the most I've enjoyed nitrous. I don't really like it much in the first place, but this time it was pretty cool.

i have never tried nitrous oxide, and don't plan to.  and although i smoke cannabis daily (a habitual vice of mine), i usually try not to smoke until after the peak of my psychedelic trips...or until i am comfortable with the intensity and decide to "risk it" and smoke anyways.


sometimes a psychedelic trip is strong enough on its own, and feels so "clean" that it need not be muddled by the addition of other drugs.


for some people, cannabis can produce anxiety, which can obviously be more of a burden when tripping.

Recently did a trip with 10 mg +/- 2 of psilacetin combined with 10 mg +/-2 of miprocin. Interspersed throughout with some good indica to smooth things out, or give a boost as required.

Absolutely beautiful substance, and the two complemented each other very nicely. The slightly more sedate come up of the psilacetin served to balance out the more energetic come up of

the miprocin. I will be trying these two again and titrating the dosages up. At this level I found them to be a nice introduction.

I normally take 40mg orally but I've gone as high as 60mg.

It's a very smooth, clean-feeling and somewhat sedating psychedelic with pretty much no body load. It kicks in very quickly (I always feel it after 15-30 minutes) and it's very happy and giggly.

IME the overall experience is reminiscent of mushrooms, but more refined.

I find 4-AcO-DMT to feel just like smoked DMT (in visual quality, body feeling, and general head feeling as well as the high-frequency buzzing of DMT), but not as intense and much slower.  But only for the first half.  The second half feels a lot like the second half of mushrooms, post-peak.  I much prefer mushrooms or pure 4-HO-DMT but 4-AcO-DMT is also a great psychedelic.  I find the first half to be quite stoning and scattered (I also find DMT to be scattered so your results may vary, as I believe I am in the minority on that)... I can't think of words very well and I feel strange and unable to communicate.  Then in the second half I feel great and jovial and communicative.

I too have always found 4-AcO-DMT to be very DMT-like in many ways. I also tend to get the giggles on it. Two of my trips had me on the floor half the time, unable to stop laughing at whatever.


I'm planning to attempt plugging 4-AcO-DMT for the first time. Anyone have an estimated time-to-peak when plugging?

To answer my own question: I plugged 10mg. I started coming up in about 5 minutes and kept going up for the next full hour. Pretty intense (and debilitating) for 10mg, so I would guess about a doubling of potency compared to oral. Unfortunately set and setting were all wrong and I went into the trip already being tired. I felt so slow and sedated that I hardly left my chair for the entire trip. Don't think I would do this at night again, at least without something else to keep stimulated. On the plus side, with two shots of whiskey at T+3h, I was able to sleep easily.

Yeah, plugging 2Cs and 4-sub-Ts generally increases the potency about two-fold or maybe slightly less.

I have a choice of combining this with either or both escaline and 2-cp. Has anyone have experiences with these combinations and can suggest dosing etc. I am thinking of trying it oral first and then plugged for the second time.

Hello fellow BLers ?


I'm wondering how one would tell if the 4-aco that they have is fumarate or freebase. Are there any telltale signs (i.e. coarseness of powder, etc.) Thanks for any info!

Well a freebase won't dissolve in water and a fumarate will.  I'd be surprised if you got the freebase as it's less stable.  Fumarate salts started to be made a while back because they seem more stable than other salts and freebases for tryptamines.

I must be the only that doesn't really care for this stuff. I've only taken it orally but 5 minutes later I start getting the yawns and get tired as shit. Seems a bit serious and I never feel like I'm fully tripping on it but don't think I would want to take more than 25 mg or so. I've puked every time I have taken it, sometimes quite a bit. It's alright if I'm by myself listening to music, half passed out because I'm so tired, but don't really care for it overall. I get some weird body sensations that can be uncomfortable too. Maybe tryptamines just aren't my thing anymore.

^^^^^ I've had some good times on 4-aco-dmt, but my only *amazing* time on it was when I combined with 2c-i. My most recent attempt left me feeling way too tired/stoned to do (or even think) anything useful. Now I'm wondering if the stimulating aspect of 2c-i was what made the other trip great...


The next time I do 4-aco-dmt I'm going to combine with a mild stim dose. I have a feeling it will be good.

I have had mixed reactions with it.  I certainly don't like it as much as mushrooms or pure 4-HO-DMT.  The first half of 4-AcO-DMT I find kind of scattered and uncomfortable, it feels to me just like smoked DMT except slower and less intense.  But the high-frequency disconcerting buzzing feeling is the same.  On mushrooms I feel grounded the whole time even if it's emotionally volatile... I feel like talking and exploring and doing things.  On the first half of 4-AcO-DMT I feel unable to communicate and somewhat out of sorts, usually.  But the peak can be amazing if I lay down and close my eyes to music, and the plateau stage feels just like the mushroom plateau stage if I take a full dose, and I love that.  I certainly prefer it to some other 4-sub-Ts.

Interesting, I'm curious what your ideal mushroom dose is.....or like the highest dose where the above is still applicable.


I've had stellar and positively mindblowing experiences on mushrooms, but there's been times I've overdosed and completely lost that sense of being 'grounded'. 


It sounds like you've pretty much never had a bad time on mushrooms. Would you say that's true?

I recently had a fantastic experience with about 20 mgs. It started with the dread/questions of the self: why do I continue tripping? It makes me uncomfortable... et cetera. After the come up, two friends showed up for some beer and bud around a camp fire, as they had nothing better to do for the evening. Very spontaneous, the whole night. Very good, deep conversations were had, a very great evening. And that's when I remembered: this is why I trip. The sublime euphoria which isn't forced like an opioid would produce, but rather, a deep, self-cultivated happiness that pervades your being, escaping from the cracks in your smile and enlarged pupils. The profound statements that roll off the tongue before you can even comprehend the weight of what you have said; the words and syntax that have been used or omitted

No, I've had various uncomfortable trips and also a trip that was terrifying on mushrooms.  I just mean, I always feel connected to the Earth on them.  I haven't eaten mushrooms a lot of times, but my first trip ever was on 1.75 grams of them and I experienced the oneness.  It felt so natural and self-evident, like waking up from a dream (my physical life) and remembering how things really are.  It totally changed my life.  The highest dose of mushrooms I've taken has been around 4 or 5 grams (I grew them once and just ate some).

I purchased 1 Gram of 4-AcO-DMT, from a source in Canada.  It came in today.. and the color is like a Grayish/Light-Blue color... It is Fumarate. Everywhere I have read/seen, it is supposed to be white/off-white/or brown... 


 Did I receive 4-AcO-DMT, or something else?  And if I got someone else.. what could it be?   Has anyone else witnessed 4-AcO-DMT come in light blue/grayish color(s) ??

It's more of a light gray/clay type of color.. with a slight blue hue to it.

**Curious**


I've read a lot hear on blue light and have learned a ton thanks for everyone's collective research on drugs in general! I've just recently acquired some 4 aco dmt fumarate and some methallylescaline.  Tried the 4 aces at 20mg and it was threshold effects good but light.  Had leg tremors to but I get that with shrooms. Would 40mg be better or should I just try 30 only have about 80mg left and want to get a strong trip.  Also has anyone tried mixing 4 aco dmt with methallylescaline.  I want to try it just not sure how to.  Methallylescaline first wait 2 hours then take 4 aco dmt. Or both at the Same time? I've searched everywhere for info on mixing the 2 but can't find anything.  Will be trying soon and will post a tr.  Thanks for any info given.  Best site on the Internet!

Hi Chrono, I saw you ask about reagent testing in your other thread that was locked, maybe you'll find this reddit forum useful:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/reagenttesting](https://www.reddit.com/r/reagenttesting)


About the blue-ish tint, I just want to say (without drawing any conclusions) that I once blew my nose after insufflating 4-aco-DMT and my snot was kind of blue... but again, just wanted to add this, I'm not saying what you have is 4-aco-DMT. Always make sure to test.

Fantastic, i found the right thread! 


I want to know how to go about injecting this intramuscular. Please, someone elaborate. How many units, what needle gauge and length, how to prepare etc. Lets hear it.


One of my suppliers recently got the fumarate back in store, and i am bent on trying this. IV is out of the question, rectally and orally are higher on my to do list.

The comeup of 4-ACO-DMT is like an oral version of a low dose smoke/vape of DMT. I notice some people randomly out of the blue have bad trips on this due to that, they will panic in the comeup and not be comfortable in the setting. But if you bare in mind the difference in the comeup and ride it out till the peak it completely returns (like many traditional full-rounded psys) what it takes on the comeup.


I also think it leaves the comeup with the potential for a lot of healing work if your into therapy. This can be like Shrooms on the term of healing - extended afterglows etc. But you can really do work if you delve into it during the oral/smoked DMT-like stage, which is not a fun experience but then come through it feeling a lot better and with the peak and rest of the trip to enjoy basking in the glow.


Anyone curious about the different stages just close your eyes during the comeup and then a few hours later. Your CEVs go from DMT like with the feelingof presence[https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=p...ved=0ahUKEwjZ36755NTKAhWH_SwKHc7LBEcQvwUIGigA](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=presence&spell=1&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjZ36755NTKAhWH_SwKHc7LBEcQvwUIGigA)/pulling into direction etc into a shroom-like (depending on dose) stage a few hours later which is more just mad geometrical shapes etc.

~12mg of degraded substance gave me a very quick comeup (feeling strong effects within 20mins), and a racing, manic headspace. 


This has been different to other experiences I have had with this substance. I do not feel this batch is usable for higher dosages.


I believe this has something to do with the substance degrading into psilocin. Typically psilacetin has to be broken down into psilocin.

Removing this process perhaps increases the rate of absorption and makes the experience more fast-paced..

I enjoyed my experiences with 4-AcO-DMT. I felt comfortable, slightly tired, and at home during every part.


Occasionally I yawned pleasantly on the come up. The feeling of these yawns was cleansing. I felt relaxed and at peace.

I'm ordering this in a few days. I can't fucking wait to have this again. I truly believe it is the holiest chemical I've ever tried. So cleansing and the ego death and rebirth it can produce was one of the best feelings I've ever felt in my life

How many mg would be comparable to a low dose mushroom trip I.e 1-1.5g's of liberty caps?

Okay, so I tried 4-AcO-DMT last night and I loved it.


I took 10mg, which I thought would be roughly equivalent to 1 - 1.5~ g's of liberty caps; a nice low introductory dose.


It came on very gradually and I just kept having these weird dreams, but then I couldn't work out if they were dreams I'd had in my sleep recently, or thought I'd had, or events which had happened in my life, until I kind of snapped out of it and thought about it. It was quite bizarre and unlike anything I've ever experienced. Well actually, I have experienced it with other psychedelics, but usually it's at the stage that your mind is racing so fast you don't know what's going on. I wasn't even sure if I was tripping at this stage, which kind of dissipated after the first hour. Then I kind of gradually transitioned into a very gentle, clear and and introspective mind state.


It feels very wise, ancient and beautiful to me. I have another dose which is a few mg higher, so I'll take that next week. So yeah, I fucking love psilacetin. Mushrooms can be quite confusing for me; I'm hoping, and feeling, that psilacetin isn't. It felt completely different to mushrooms at a comparable dose.


Does anybody know if tolerance will reset completely within seven days for psilacetin?


I think I have a new favourite psychedelic.

At low dose this one seems comparable to mushrooms without the gastrointestinal discomfort.


Care should be taken at doses ≥ 40mg; although theoretically safe at a pharmacological level, the actual effects of the peak and plateau are literally debilitating.  At these doses, the come-up is rather quick with beautiful CEV, and the come-down phase is absolutely stunning in terms of OEV.  


Please note that doses between 40-100mg are not advised for the average user, and are physically uncomfortable, although incredibly useful for psychological, philosophical, and shamanic purposes.

Anyone else get a massive amount of deja vú when taking a good dose? (~25mg, I think) The first 2 hours are close to being the best experience I have had, but after that every single thing that happens is a deja vú. It doesn't turn sour, but its really annoying to me, and no other psych gives me that experience. Would going for a higher dose give me more of a peak-like beautiful experience? Seems like a bad idea in terms of HR and what not, but I have done my fair share of higher doses with other psychedelics. And like I said, other than being annoyed by the deja vú I feel fine. Visuals and the beautiful inspiring thoughts subside when that happens, so it makes me think that maybe I need to pass some sort of threshold to be able to hold on to the cosmic brilliance of the first phase.


Or is this just me trying to talk myself in to taking more of a drug? ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


Other than that, this really is my favorite psychedelic. The visuals are so incredibly geometric, my thoughts extremely constructive, an euphoria rivaling a 8mg dose of 5-meo-mipt yet not as overwhelming. I did that 25mg dose 2 nights ago, and it was amazing. The way it works really resonates well with me, this is some top class stuff. Really makes me want to try pure 4-ho-dmt sometime.

I got 4-HO-MET and 4-ACO-DMT at the same time. When i got them they were the same color, now the 4-ACO-DMT has turned tannish brown and the MET is unchanged. Guess the 4-aco isn't quite as stable. Anyways i threw a silica pack in there, hope it helps.

The color change doesn't necessarily indicate degradation. A few years back when I was getting 4-AcO-DMT regularly, I accidentally got a corner of my gram baggie wet as soon as I received it. I immediately scooped all the wet material out to save the rest, put it onto a little paper boat, ended up folding it, putting it in my closet, then forgetting about it. A year later I found it out of nowhere, it had become almost pure black. So of course I thought it had degraded and wouldn't be potent whatsoever. Turns out there was not much degradation and that 95mg I took was pretty damn close to 95, talk about a trip 8)

Were you expecting visuals at that dose? The racing headspace is likely all you'll get at that area and I find low smoke doses of DMT uncomfortable sometimes compared to just getting into the deep end. Feel in a sense 4-aco-dmt can be similar. Not a trainwreck or bad trip, just not the smoothest or beneficial of ones?


Although I don't think when the substance oxidises it looses any potency whatsoever. I can't comment on the 4-HO-DMT conversion since I have not studied chemistry, but surely this could be easily solved by someone sending a small amount of heavily oxidised 4-ACO-DMT to a test centre?


I'd still advise anyone coming across oxidised/brown 4-aco-dmt to seriously view the doses and chemical as the exact same and do not believe it to have degraded in potency whatsoever.

I almost always have this happen to me when I take mushrooms.  I will be trying 4-aco tonight.  I am semi-anxious about the experience because I am worried the same thing will happen.  Hopefully this doesn't negatively affect the trip.  I will be with friends who usually help steer me into a positive experience on other tryptamines.

Well this was interesting. Did a larger dose (35mg) and the deja vu was gone, but the trip turned very dark after 1 hour. I guess now is a good time to reiterate that this chemical needs to be treated with the utmost respect. Did work through some personal stuff and feel a bit more confident about myself right now, so I guess it was worth it.

Hey folks..... Been a lurker on here for a while.  I have gotten a lot  of great information from you folks in the past and just want to say  thank you! I have just recently been introduced to 4-aco-dmt fumarate  and would like to share some of my experiences.  


This compound  is amazing! I recently got a sample from my vendor and after doing a bit  of research, reading through the threads I decided to dose at about  30mg....well i guess it was actually somewhere between 30 and 40mg as  the scale we where using couldn’t weigh anything under 10mg... I am a  pretty avid user of al-lad and 1p-lsd so I was really wanting to try  something different.  I have always been a hard head with these  compounds and I have always had to take quite a bit more to get the  effects I was looking for.  That being said, The 30-40mg range really  didn’t impress me at all. At that dose really all that I felt was just a  very mild euphoric feeling similar to a low dose of MDMA. Very mild  visuals...had to really concentrate to see anything special.  That first  trial left me disappointed. Had to save the night with 600ugs of  al-lad.


The next weekend we where determined to have a better  ride on this stuff.  So my friend and I took the rest of our sample  which was somewhere around 120-140mg dumped it into a cup of distilled  water, let everything dissolve into solution and split into half a cup  doses and we each downed it. After we took our dose we went outside to  have a cig talk a bit then came back in...one other person was there and  he was just taking al-lad...it was his first time. when we came in i  started to set up a gaming console my friend had brought over. as I was  trying to set this up the guy on the al-kept asking me computer  questions, I could feel something coming up fast and while getting asked  these questions and setting up this console my whole world came  crashing in on me....the aco took hold and I got this overwhelming  feeling of failure lol....I could not explain it but it felt like the  whole world was depending on me and I was failing.  It became to much  and I ran to my bedroom and buried my face in a pillow.......OMFG! when i  did that I started seeing the most amazing CEVs I had ever seen! I mean  mind bending stuff....I spend about 20 minutes buried in the pillow  mesmerized.  After the extremely overwhelming failure feeling had  subsided  I decided to come back and join the group but I was tripping  so hard all i could do was lay on the floor and listen to music....I  spend 2 hours curled up underneath my coffee table in a feeling of  complete bliss...I have never done DMT, but I believe this to be very  close to that type of experience...I was in my own world listening to  Shpongle and watching the crazy geometric pyramids in my mind grow and  get brighter.  This is hands down the hardest I have ever tripped in my  life Major Head fuck and CEVs that were off the charts.....even more  than 1200ugs of al-lad.  I could not believe it!  I am just floored by  this amazing substance and more trials are definitely in the works.  Another thing I found really amazing is how gentle this stuff is.  No  body load....and very sedative I actually yawned all the way through the  experience...which is something I have never experienced on other  lysergimides. After about 3 hours of the most intense trip I ever had I  decided it was too short so i took 450ugs of al-lad to ride the rest of  the night out.  God, what an amazing night.  


Sorry if that was  too long....I just wanted to share what a higher dose did to me...so  amazing.  Next trial will be at about 80mg I cant wait.  Will post about  that one when its finished.


Thanks again for all the info over the years!

You really are a heavy hardhead if 40mg doesn't even give you any visuals. Are you sure you didn't have tolerance? What was the last time you did a psychedelic before your 4-AcO-DMT trials and how frequently do you trip?


Your AL-LAD dose range seems similar to what I need to get me going.

Two weeks prior to the first ACO trial I had dosed about 750ugs of al-lad.  Tolerance shouldn’t have really been a factor. I had about a 15 day break.


I generally trip every other week. depending on what I have going on.

I will say that AL-LAD tolerance reset seems to take a longer time than some other psychs, including LSD. After having consumed over a sheet and a 1/2 of it over the course of the last 2 1/2 years, I can tell you first hand. I learned the hard way after building up a large tolerance to AL-LAD. In fact, I have taken as much as a 10 strip of AL to get desired results. Yes, that's a lot, but I was working on a big tolerance and had been tripping about every ten days, give or take, with some breaks just to get back to baseline. Rinse, repeat. I recall that I had to wait for up to three weeks to a month to get my tolerance for LSD, 4-ACO, and what have you in order to bring ANY magic back to it at all after AL benders. Even after waiting 2 weeks after a good AL dose, I needed to take FAR more AL or 4-ACO-DMT than normal. After waiting, everything else righted itself, though.

our entire group seems to be this way.  i thought i was an exception until i started hanging out with them.  maybe its placebo haha.  the interesting part is during the groups first trial, one of us did about 20mg more and he absolutely loved it.  I agree with blur it was very mdma like... and it had the beginning of mushroom style visual warping and patterns but never evolved more than that.  


keep in mind this group usually needs 600mics of AL-LAD to be satiated.  the weird part is that i find my tolerance to swing up and down even though i trip every week.  one week 3 tabs of AL makes me fry and the next week 3 barely gets me a ++.  I suppose it depends on my body chemistry on that day, diet etc.  That is why we do this IN THE NAME OF RESEARCH ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

**4-Aco-DMT 7mg +MAOI. Psychotherapy potential...**


Hi guys, I've lurked for a while, got a lot of invaluable info from this site and thought I could add some of my own.

I've had experience with many different psychedelics, and wanted a solo, introspective trip, so 4-aco-dmt was chosen.


DOSE: 7mg 4-aco-dmt, strongly potentiated by Moclobemide (RIMA/MAOI) (I take 600mg daily and have done for years, only took 300mg that morning)

ROUTE: Orally in parachute, empty stomach

DURATION: 7 hours strong->medium effects, 2 futher hours residual trippiness.

BODY WEIGHT: 64kg, female, mid 20s


I wrote my intentions before dosing: 

1. wanting a lasting positive mindset (treatment of depression) 

2: Why do I want to take drugs often? 

3. How can I be a better person? 

4. How can I enjoy my work more?


Dosed 7mg orally on a beautiful sunny sunday afternoon, in my nicely decorated and comfortable bedroom. Been feeling good recently after coming out of a depressive episode in the winter.


My notes start here:


15.33 7mg 4AcoDmt. Sunny day!

15.55 Alerts! Shower wall breathing. Cheeky smile. Textures! [I remember starting to see 'zooming' in form constants on closed eyes]

16.06 Confused by drips in the kitchen. Where are they coming from? Wrong person to ask LOL 

16.36 Masturbated. Awesome. Bit of yoga on come-up felt lovely. Off for a walk! Adventure! 

[here some beautiful visuals were coming into play. Closed eye shifting colours and patterns red and white upon orgasm, my yoga mat starting to glow with glossy rainbow shading, pattern recognition enhancement on carpets, dusty surfaces and walls become beautiful. Textures much brighter. Feeling very Mother Earth.]


...And the notes end there. This section felt very euphoric.


As I decided to go for a walk, I realised my mood dropped and I'd need food. I wander into the kitchen to make some avocado on toast. This was surprisingly easy, considering I was distracted by faces in the floating, wispy, organic and DMT-esque geometry coming off the tiles in the kitchen. 

I normally see vague faces which are fine but these ones touched me deeper and made me feel unsettled. 

I ate the toast (seeing a chameleon in the avocado and being sad I had to eat him), grabbed a banana and went to my room.

Here I became a little confused. Banana? Coat? Banana? Felt dysphoric and though I was itching to get into the sunshine, I felt it best to meditate. That's what I wanted right?

Right.


Turned my music off, sat on my yoga mat with sun streaming through the window. Close my eyes and breathe. I start to see the organic geometry I saw on the kitchen tiles. It's beautiful, intricate. Then an image appears of a young girl with her hands covering her eyes in an expression of deep pain. Like The Scream by Edvard Munch. I was shocked into opening my eyes, took a breath, and decided to go further. I spoke - what was that? Who are you?


Eyes closed, she came back. I immediately realised she was a depiction of me, as a child, suffering. (short background: anorexia nervosa + suicide attempt as a child/teen. Sober, this feels like an entirely different life that I've basically suppressed)

I sympathised so much with her. She shouldn't have had to feel like that. I wanted to hug her,to look after her. And then a huge, primal wave of anger hit me that she hadn't been looked after emotionally at all. I had had to parent myself. Anger towards my father for failing to even try to understand, when she needed him most. And then a realisation. I'm holding on to this anger, this pain, and the only person it's hurting is me. I need to forgive him. I'll be much happier if I can. (we have never gotten on. It's caused rifts) 


I try. I try and think from his point of view. I try and think of how scared he must have been with an ill child, the worry he must have faced about my future, the impact it had on the rest of the family. I still can't get past the the neglect. I don't want to forgive him, I'm not ready to. It feels red and hot and unfair, and some tears are streaming down my face. 


I open my eyes, and look at the beautiful glossy, soft rainbow patterning and shimmering around my necklaces, how the pattern on my yoga mat has turned into little wolf heads. It's beautiful.


I'm still feeling some of the trapped emotions I felt as the little girl. I tell myself, out loud, that she's fading. She's faded, and I'm a strong adult woman now. Self-resourceful, resolute and assertive. I've done so well.

I close my eyes a little longer and take some breaths. Some intricate, mechanical, flowing shapes are shown to me. I think of how my personality is a breath of fresh air in the environment I work in. How I'm an adult learner, and can take responsibility for that. How I'm interested to learn some stuff soon!


I finally decide to go and walk. Some thought loops persist over my dad, trying to explain his behaviour. I realise I've just got to have a conversation with him to ask him frankly.


I walk to the park, listening to my favourite music. It's all impregnated with meaning. A song I've performed, remembering my anxiety and how it wasn't necessary, and how awesome my performance was! A song I associate with my ex. Appreciate the incredible times, the beautiful drug experiences we had, and appreciate how good a friend he is now. Start crying a little as a family walks past and get some funny looks ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


I get to the park and the trees, the fields, the sky, everything is gorgeous. Pattern repetition, symmetry, strange fractalline or organic shapes. A bush morphs into an odd frog shape. Reminds me much like DMT in its spiritual feeling. I giggle at a crow which is having a paddle. I walk past a fallen tree trunk, which looks like an old, muscular, tattooed arm. I appreciate the beauty of all body shapes... Elderly people are beautiful too, their bodies, scars and all, tell a story. 


I sit by a lake and find my banana! How to eat it? I manage to eat it, trying to look normal, before realising the people walking past don't give a crap. Clarity. Some little girls whizz past on scooters, leaving tracers. I'm mildly confused, I feel too clear for tracers to be that visible!

Keep walking, giggle at ducks doing the things ducks do. Find some people tightrope walking between two trees and watch for a while. They notice me and I didn't want to put them off (and would be incapable of holding a conversation) so I wander off with a smile.


Keep walking around the park during the slow comedown, thinking, seeing, feeling. Pink Floyd playing now. I smirk at the irony, and wonder if anyone else in the park is tripping.


Start to feel tired and the only visuals still present are enhanced and softened textures. I head home, buy a beer and some tomatoes, and make myself some nice pasta. So hungry by now! It's 20.51. 

I  begin watching The Breakfast Club, which helps to put my struggles into perspective. Great film.

Slept at 12 midnight with the help of 7.5mg Zopiclone (some interesting hypnogogic hallucinations here, almost like floaty netting/spiderwebs in the corners of my room. Form constants?)


Side effects: Slight nausea on come up, quite thirsty, needed to urinate freqently.

After effects: Today I felt tired, but assertive. I started a new placement and was far more confident. I noticed the difference. I'll make it last!

Abuse potential: You couldn't do this regularly.


I almost wonder if I had taken a higher dose, would I have been able to forgive my dad? Would be interested in thoughts.


Thanks for reading.

I just received a new batch of 4-aco-dmt from a so far extremely reputable vendor but it has a brown appearance and smells strongly of vinegar... They are claiming 97% purity.  

I was wondering if there is a relatively easy way to purify 4-subbed Tryptamines?

The colour I'm not too concerned about but the strong vinegar odour is of concern.  I'm assuming the vinegar smell is left over acetic acid from making the AcO ?

And not a harmful precursor... They did provide their own NMR analysis and it turned purple when I tested it with an Ehlrich test kit. 

If anyone more knowledgable than I could help me I would greatly appreciate it. 

I hope talking about removing impurities isn't considered synth discussion if so please remove this and I apologize!

I dunno, whether I already discussed this with you in another thread, but IMHO tryptamines in the most cases are earth colored (beige/orange/brown/ash grey/dark grey) and have a strong odor. 


I personally do not like this compound that much, because it once provided a really miserable trip with a lot of self pity. Set and setting play a big role with this (bigger than for any other psychedelic I've tried) because it modulates thought patterns a lot on the emotional plain and if you're unstable it is merciless and you cannot steer the trip in a positive direction. Also really low doses (~5mg) caused depression for me. All in all positive experiences with this were rare and it is the only psychedelic for me, that could not be appreciated. I have to add, that my 4-aco-dmt could have degraded into 4-ho-dmt and that is why it lost its gentleness.


Found a post by sekio regarding degradation byproducts :

Could well be, that my trips were miserable, because of the byproduct content. Luckily I did not indulge often. I would be interested, what color 4-Aco-DMT usually can have and what color those quinones have.

All extremeley pure 4 substituted Tryptamines will be white ,crystallized, and odourless. 

In fact I believe this true for all Tryptamines in general except for aMT and aET which do have a smell. 

I believe even the common plastic mothball smell of extracted DMT is from Skatole from the extraction process.

Untrue, many pure tryptamines have an odor, especially the base tryptamines.  DMT, AMT, AET, DiPT, MET, DPT... those are the base tryptamines I've smelled and they all smell quite strongly, and similarly (AMT is the worst by far though).  The 4-substituted tryptamines have a smell too but in general it's quite less potent of a smell.  The phenethylamines in general have an odor too.  Many chemicals have an odor actually, even if it's not too strong.

Strange that none of my chemicals except aMT have even the slightest odour except for obviously incomplete synths.  My brown dpt that reeks of vinegar is around 50% potency of my white DPT??? 

I have a pretty diverse collection of trypts and I don't recall anything having strong odour except my aMT and the crappy brown DPT. 

But I'm also not breaking anything out of long term storage to smell it.  But now I'm curious.

I got the same DPT and the vendor made good on it. You might check it out.

Their MET was also brown foul smelling shit...actually, now that I think about it, it smelled of DMT.

Oh, as for smell, DMT always smells to me. As soon as I hit it with the lye I can start to smell it...I love that smell!

Then it's all downhill once that flame goes near it, the plastic shit smelling, and tasting DMT washes over you in extravagant beauty as your rocketed to the moon! Pre vape DMT smells floral and is really nice!

That particular vendor (95% sure it's the same one ) actually sent me their entire remaining Poorly synthed MET supply.  Almost 100 g because they said they were going to flush it anyway.  I was under the impression that the same lab made that brown DPT and red MET. 

The MET was impossible to freebase but however impure it was it certainly was orally active!! ?

MET is probably my favorite simple tryptamine. It's really awesome. I had an amazing time IM'ing this with MXE and getting super stoned!


I think I'm going to retry 4-AcO-DMT soon. Pretty excited. The problem I had was either under dosing or overdosing. I need to  find the middle ground which will probably be between 20-30mgs.

Yep, same one RED.

I flushed it after using it a time or three. It was active, but F'n SCARY looking.

The days of eating just any old thing to get high are over for me.


Well, mostly anyway.

The people I got mine from was a decent vendor. It was light brown with a little smell to it. It was so excellent IM. Right up there with IM DMT. In fact because of its easy going personality yet strong effect it was highly enjoyable!

I implore you folks to take at the VERY LEAST 5-7 grams of mushrooms which equates to about 50-70mg of 4-AcO-DMT. If you have the fumarate salt, I would say take 80mg as you might want to compensate for the fumarate molecular weight.

This is a harm reduction forum and you have to realize that everyone is not you and won't neccecarily  have the same experience you have with drugs at the same dosage you took. 

I've seen many people freak out on 15mg of 4-aco-dmt - describing it as overwhelming. 

I personally am quite comfortable at 50-100mg of this stuff but I think that's due to tolorance and decades of tripping experience.  Most people are not going to need that kind of dose and if they aren't ready for it it could real psychological damage.

4-aco-dmt dehydrates me. Omg. I feel that I have drink plenty of water but with no effect. Lips dry, skin dry, mouth dry.. 

Irritates the crap out of me 


But I do love 4-aco-dmt ![❤️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/2764.png)

You are being incredibly foolish with this advice for a lot of people...

I hate to keep repeating myself NOT EVERYONE is going to have a similar experience as you. 

People metabolize drugs differently and have different sensitivities to drugs. 80 mg to night very well like 30 mg to someone new to psychedelics or who is just sensitive to them. 

It is entirely irresponsible to suggest everyone dive into those kinds of dosages. 

I've seen people stumble into medical tents freaking out on 30 mg. Can you imagine what 80mg would do to them if they aren't ready for such an experience??? It might forever turn someone off of psychedelics!

Everyone should start low and titrate up to find their individual proper dosages. 

You are being reckless. Kids read these forums !!!

I really have to question if you've learned anything from psychedelics at all.  I've brought up MANY times that people have different enzyme make ups and different brain chemistry so people experience drugs differently. You keep ignoring this fact. 

People are all individuals with very different life experiences and not everyone (hell not even most people) are ready to stare into the eyes of god on a psychedelic.  

You are being shockingly ignorant and extremeley foolish. In fact, your whole post is a testimonial to NOT dive into taking heroic dosages of psychedelics because your experience is exactly what can happen where you take a huge dose of a drug and have a peak experience and your revelation is to encourage everyone else to simply do exactky what you did. 

This isn't empathic or enlightening it's close minded and ignorant to think that you can force enilightenment on everyone.

Jumping head first into heroic doses of psychedlics without taking a lot of time (and sonetines psychotherapy) can lead to self delusion. I've seen it happen a lot. In this thread even. :/

Also, @Stoned Ape:

What's this terrible advice you keep getting on Bluelight that has impeaded your psychedelic journey???

No open said for you to not take a heroic dose, just to titrate up to find out what your personal heroic dose might be because it'll be different for everyone.

50mg to one person can be  100mg to another. 

Do I don't understand your logic in any way.  Some people have nothing but dysphoric and utterly negative trips on seretonergenic psychedelics.  Everyone isn't you and won't have your experience.

I agree with Ballz Trippington. 


In my experience, 20mg gave a profound experience, which is the dose i'd recommend for first-time users, or actually less to be on the safe side. 


Only when you find out on yourself that 20mg is not enough is the time to bump the dose up to 50mg or more if you want to become someone like StonedApe (no offense).


(And even i feel like i'm giving a bit too lenient and unsafe advice).

Yeah, first timers I'd give 18mg tops (almost typo'd 80mg lol). If they have experience with psychedelics around 26mg? I dunno, LSD/the 2Cs I need pretty large doses of comparatively, but 4-Aco-DMT, Mushrooms and the other trypts can kick my ass pretty quickly

Everyone is affected differently by things.  A friend of mine takes on average 15mg of 4-sub-tryptamines and gets very out there.  Personally I like the 50mg level, but I also like it lower.  I would never recommend anyone without previous experience at lower dosages to jump in at 50mg, I think that advice is quite anti-HR.  Not everyone is built to handle psychedelics or high-dose psychedelics.  You can, but it doesn't mean everyone else can.  And besides, people have a huge variance in sensitivities to substances.  It also doesn't mean everyone wants to use psychedelics in the same way, nor does it mean everyone should use them the same way.  They're tools, they're not some sort of demi-gods that get offended when used the "wrong" way.  The experience comes from within you, because we have everything within us.  They can really help to draw that out, and they can certainly help you find yourself, and find greater understanding, but they can also lead in the opposite direction.  Or, they can be fun to use recreationally, to enhance music or social situations or whatever.  Early in my tripping days I used to go into every trip with reverence and I had several life-changing experiences (particularly with mushrooms - this was before 4-AcO-DMT existed), and I proselytized a bit, but many years later I have grown and changed.  Currently I use tryptamines generally during jam sessions (20-40mg usually), because it's as if something is guiding my hands into brand new rhythms and melodies that I can then remember and bring back into my sober playing.  And I use other psychedelics generally to enhance my experience seeing live music or to just have a great time with my friends, or to make a day out in nature have more of a sparkle.  All of these ways are equally valid, and they all bring something positive into my life.  Ultimately, I have gotten to know myself much better, and I don't need to revisit the deep psychedelic state to know the message.  But I still use them, in different ways.  Some people never feel drawn to spiritual experiences with psychedelics, and that's okay too, that's their journey.  I have a friend who really wishes he could have a spiritual experience with them, but never has despite very honest attempts.  We're all different.


One thing psychedelics have really helped me to understand over the years is that you should never be so sure you're right that you don't remain open to other ideas and critical of your own conclusions, especially about what's right for other people.

Also 4-AcO-DMT isn't a mushroom. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


See my post above that I was writing as you posted this.


To be clear, I am not saying that 50mg of 4-AcO-DMT is dangerous physically, even with syrian rue.  I'm just saying, it's irresponsible to suggest to people to start with 50mg of 4-AcO-DMT their first time, with or without syrian rue.  By no means should anyone jump in there.  Jump in low or moderate, you can take more the next time if you feel comfortable with it.  Personally I love 4-sub-tryptamines at that level, but I'm me, anyone else reading this might not be prepared to handle it.  The fact is, sometimes people have long-term negative consequences like PTSD, or HPPD, from psychedelics, particularly from powerful trips.  Some aren't ready to experience ego loss and it results in a severely disrupted life.  You can read about these experiences all over the place online.  4-AcO-DMT or mushrooms or anything is not guaranteed to be a good thing for someone.

Stoned Ape, I was originally going to quote you in a few areas that your  "reasoning" was fucked and realized that I'd have to quote  EVERYFUCKINGTHING coming out of your mouth and don't have the time,  energy or inclination. So it will suffice for me just to say you are  totally and completely full of shit and that I have come to the  conclusion that your 4-aco-dmt is lacking potency...either that or you  have some exceptionally strong shrooms...I will go with the former  though and hope that any psychonaut (in your case psychoNOT) out there  takes this into account.


I will gladly read your response to this post as soon as the smoke that you are blowing up my/our ass clears.


Mods, I apologize in advance for the outburst, but I couldn't help myself...I'm generally on the receiving end of this sort of shit...how ironic...![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

^Your one of those new-wave fools who thinks he's in the in and has discovered something special. While in reality you were simply lucky you didn't have your ass handed to waking up in the hopital. For the record, PN just literally said less than page ago that he was doing IM shots of 120mg which actually trumps your little experiment! It'd be one thing if you were telling veterans to do this but new inexperienced trippers? Are you out of your fucking mind? You also keep touting the fact it's physically benign as if it's something astounding! "Oh it won't hurt my body?!? Sweet! Let me usurp the beginners doses and jump up to insanely high doses!!! Wooo idiocy!". Yeah man there's clearly something wrong with you.... Just because something won't hurt your body does not mean it won't hurt your mind! I bet you'll feel pretty boss if someone follows your advice, is a new tripper, then we get word back that, being unable to deal with the overly intense feelings it produced, they decided into their mentally deficient state that killing themselves was the only way to end the insanity. You'd feel great right? I mean after all to make an omelette, you need to crack a few eggs right? Not to mention possible PTSD, derealization, depersonalization, aniexty, depression, etc, etc. I mean as long as it doesn't harm the body, we're all good right? Go be a fool somewhere else, we don't have time for your style of shenanigans! Every time you open your mouth it becomes more and more apparent how ignorant you are on all levels, truly, which is hard for the majority of people to do!


I really hate to be harsh but damn! Shits getting ridiculous!

It requires quite the set of assumptions to reach the conclusion that the reason I believe what I believe is because my mind is closed and I have become convinced by the ideas of others.  I've been tripping a long time.  Years ago I might have said things like what you're saying before, though I wouldn't have recommend that someone jump in at 50mg.  But over time my ideas and mind continued to develop and I attained what I feel is a more balanced view.  I've been tripping for 16 years now and have done so many hundreds of times, plenty of time for me to form my own opinions on the subject. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


What's the deal with advocating jumping in at a high dose without trying a lower dose first to ease into it, anyway?  You can always take more the next time, why rush it?  Ultimately this forum is about harm reduction, and advising huge doses for inexperienced trippers is anti-HR.  There are way too many factors involved to not work up to that kind of dosage.

Indeed.  Everyone should formulate their own opinions based on experience, but it seems that you're trying to advocate the "right way" to do it, based on your own experience, and that may not be right for others like it is for you.


You'll have noticed, I hope, that I said a couple of times that I'm not afraid of 50mg, I love taking 4-substituted tryptamines at that kind of level.  I just don't think it's a good idea to jump in there, but rather to work your way up.  My first trip ever was with 1.75 grams of mushrooms, and it remains the most paradigm-shifting thing I have ever experienced, because I went from not believing in spirituality to any extent to waking up as the universal consciousness and realizing that something beautiful is happening behind the scenes, so to speak.  It's not always about dosage.  


The way you're posting reminds me of how I posted in 2006-2007 when I was doing psychedelics very frequently and I was convinced of many things.  I came to realize later that I was on a form of ego trip that came from nothing but good intentions, but which was nevertheless an ego trip.

I guess I did assume you were newer at it than me, so that was my bad.  Doesn't really matter if you are or not, either way my points stand.  And can you answer me why you think it's not a good idea to start lower and work your way up?  


I'm just trying to advocate caution.  If you noticed, I've been saying that there are as many ways to use psychedelics as there are people.  Everyone's experience is their own and unique.

Fuck people, are you serious? **NEVER **start with such doses, for a first time of an unknown batch of any substance. Start low, be familiar with the substance first, you have got plenty of time for upping the dosage later, with more experience. I can't believe what I'm reading lately on this subforum, like that post about a 350mg 4-aco-dmt trip with people encouraging such dosages?


Just no... Even myself as a teenager, when I began to take RC's and psychedelics, knew the golden rules... without reading them anywhere, it's just common sense!

The most astonishing thing about Stoned Ape is that he keeps thinking along the lines of "so what if someone has years of mental anguish and psychological trauma from taking a massive dose of psychedelics... I went through something like that and I came out ok so EVERYONE should!!!!!

If you really came from a psychiatric background I can only assume it's as a patient. 

Either that or taking massive amounts of psychedelics without taking the time to integrate the trip has eroded all common sense. 

I have yet to hear ANY examples of ANY bad advice on bluelight whatsoever from Stoned Ape. 

Again, if you had followed advice about titrating up your dose, you'd still have found that your dose is 50mg or whatever... How is that bad advice????

[/QUOTE]And it's okay to take 5g mushroom (50mg 4-AcO) for your first time. 50mg is harmless. Believe me. If someone starts to freak out, it's okay. They'll calm down. Please do not spread fear, uncertainty and doubt. We do not have fear. We are not uncertain. We know exactly what happens and have for thousands of years. We do not have doubts because we know from experience. Please don't spread FUD. 


I cannot stress enough... people simply are NOT taking enough. NOT ENOUGH.[/QUOTE]


You would think someone with a psychiatric background would have the common sense to realize that some (quite a lot) of people simply aren't able to cope with a ++++ or even a +++ experience. 

I have a friend who's prone to anxiety problems (he sees a psychiatrist by the way) and he litwrally cannot hznxle anything more than 7mg MAX!!

If he looks at LSD he gets a panick attack due to a severely bad trip he had over 10 years ago.  It still affects him today.  That's just one example and it holds true for people without anxiety problems too.  

I cannot believe that someone with a supposed psychiatric background wouldn't have the professional awareness to realize that some people WILL react to such a high dose in such a way that it could be detrimental to them psychologically for possibly the rest if their lives and quite possibly turn them

Off of psychedelics after that one experience forever. 

In fact I will assert that most people who do quit psychedelics do so after not being able to cope with an overly intense/negative trip.

Now that I've had a glimpse of your drug use, your previous posts make way more sense. 

Honestly, this whole thing is playing out as a warning to not use psychedelics foolishly or YOU (Stoned Ape) are what can happen. 

If after years of psychedelic experience you are left being arrogant and self absorbed it's a pretty good indication that you have been doing the drugs wrong for a very long time.

You just sound like an old crazy hippy with mental problems that had just escaped from the psych ward and is delivering free acid on the door of schools for enlightening the kids.

I agree. 50mg of 4-Aco-DMT is not a wise starting dose. I do not think the person will die. I do think a freak out could happen. My first dose of 4-AcO was 15mg (I think) and it wasn't a break through by far (I was looking a break through) I have read many reports where people had breakthroughs on small doses. 


Now having much experience with 4-AcO, I have tried high doses and still haven't had that breakthrough I have been looking for.


4-AcO-DMT feels so safe for me, (tried most of the 4subs feel safe to me) I feel so comfortable with it, so maybe that's why I haven't broken thru or whatever. Although I am looking forward to trying a few new things that are not 4-subs Now that it is summer time. 


Like most of others have said - always start low and work your way up. I have found orally to be much better than insufflation - IMO

Bahahah.. Nah.


For reference, I've been doing hallucinogens since age 14. Now, 9 years later, I've run the gambit with drug classes and dosages. Though I've admittedly slowed my roll lately, my teen years were reckless.


I was also born into occultism, which has influenced my use of hallucinogens significantly. I mean, I haven't "partied" in years.. Mainly I use dissociatives and tryptamines for occult study and ritual.


Also, I'm an elementary school teacher at a prestigious academy. I dropped out of public high school, too. (But I only ever learned bad habits there anyway; I'm an autodidact.)


How's that?  Now you know me a bit better. (Despite the fact that I abhor self-declaration online in favor of anonymity. I believe quality information can stand alone, without appeal to authority, though sometimes some background is relevant..) And yet, despite your consistent admonitions, you've still not given us any real information about yourself or your accomplishments. (As if self-exploration should be considered accomplishment anyway; try contributing to society with what you've learned 'Oh Enlightened One'..)


I just don't know what else I can learn from psychedelics.. Short of applying new perspective to whatever I'm dealing with or working on, I can't imagine hallucinogens opening me up to any new insights.  I've already conceptualized the abstract and mapped my own self and all that jazz.. And even though I'm still surprised by content occassionally, I've always been of the opinion that drugs are catalysts, not generative.


It's all you to begin with, and if you think the hallucinogens are opening you up to novel lessons inaccessible without the proper dose and drug, then I'm just sorry..


 You chide us for being close-minded and dogmatic, yet you insist on blind acceptance of your proposed "truth". 


Objectivity and a sound grounding in consensus reality are prerequisite for successfully navigating psychedelia and returning intact to share what you gained.

You're turning a simple suggestion to start lower and work your way up into a whole lot of nonsense.  No one is saying you shouldn't take 50mg, just that it's bad advice to suggest to someone inexperienced to **start** at 50mg.  You can't possibly know how everyone else will react to things, you only know how **you** will react.  I did in fact read all of your posts, and you've been increasingly going off the handle about this.  You've claimed that those of us contradicting you are imbeciles, closed minded, part of the dominator culture, attempts at censoring, and that we're trying to force our fears and ideas on others.  Those claims are ludicrous, man.  You're either trolling or you're blowing this **way** out of proportion.  Can't you see how your own claims are doing exactly that?  You said (most recently) "Have some testicular fortitude and take 50mg"... so what you're saying is, unless you start at 50mg, you're a pussy", or whatever words you'd choose to communicate that sentiment.  You're trying to force your own idea that the correct way to use psychedelics is to jump in at high doses, and you're doing it in a pretty bullying and judgmental manner. 


Well, you're free to make that claim, we haven't removed or edited any of your posts.  So why is it censorship when other people respond with their ideas?  You got to say what you want to say, and we get to say what we want to say.  This is how forums work, everyone gets to say their part, and then people coming here to read it will be free to make their own choice what to believe, after reading everyone's posts.


You're free to post whatever you want, except for abusive posting including name-calling, or discussing sources for drugs, or discussing prices for drugs.  Your recent posts have strayed into abusive territory.  So please tone it down, there's no reason for you to be insulting the rest of the posters.  Someone disagreeing with you is okay.  People disagree with me all the time, it's just how it works, you're never going to agree with everyone but it doesn't mean they're personally attacking you.


For the record the abusive posting applies to everyone.

I'd also like to apologize because some of my remarks became personal and there's no need for that.

But I do feel that there are real dangers to taking large doses of psychedelics (in particular Lysergamides) without proper time and reflection (sometines also psychotherapy) in between trips. 

I've seen many people go too far with acid over periods of time and watched them become manic and delusional in bizarrely fundamentalist way where they think they've found the answer and it becomes this gospel they have to spread to humanity.  There is also a Bizzare phenomenon of acid heads evolving into born again Christians which is just truly bizarre but it happens more than you'd expect. 

There is also perma tolorance from excessive lysergamide use. 

This is a big part of the reason that my recreational dose for most 4 subbed trypts IS 50mg.  I don't know if it's from receptor damage or simply from taking large doses and simply learning to be comfortable or at least being able to navigate through that kind of head space. 

I don't trip that often these days less than once every two months. 

But the tolorance is always there and I'm pretty sure it's from taking large doses (6 strong tabs) on a weekly or at a festival (daily ) basis.

To be honest, this is pretty much the opposite of what your posts sound like to me. If you give it a rest for a few days, think about something different a little bit and then come back to this thread and read over your posts again, maybe you will see what I mean. If not please feel free to carry on with it, I'm not offended at all. I just wouldn't expect any fruitful conversations if you keep up this, what I percieve to be, very confrontational tone. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


And where did you get the impression that 4-AcO-DMT is no more dangerous than Psilocin? AFAIK this is an educated guess at best, since there have been no actual studies on it. Since we are dealing with rather novel compounds here, there is no telling what kind of longterm effects might show up 20 years later.

Not massively looking forward to this stuff since I don’t like mushrooms - guessing 30mg is a good start and equivalent to 3 or so grams of semilanceta. I can’t see it should be very different to mushrooms unless the prodrug theory is out or perhaps the combo of baeocystin/norbaeocystin makes mushrooms less pleasant since some clain this compound superior or clean than fungal material

Lots of seasoned trippers don’t like mushrooms for whatever reason - they were good and I got some benefits when younger but other compounds esp LSD are where it’s really at  - not inviting a massive derailing of the thread - it’s my opinion and others opinions are valid - I wasn’t even going to try 4AcO-DMT - certainly never taking mushrooms again but it’s there so I’ll at least give it a spin - my psilocybin doses were between 30-60mg sometimes with harmaline but wasn’t thinking of trying so high with this just because eventually it got a bit mixed up and I got a lot of negatives from it. I hope it is nicer cleaner then mushrooms.

Not sure about “require” - it depends why they are there - natural balance or nature knowing best and the like is a sort of religious-ideological or shamanic belief about the contents of shrooms - not saying it is wrong pe se - it might work well for you but I don’t hold that nature always knows best (the boring synth v natural debate) or we have to hold that tropanes containing drugs are ‘good’ and the bottom line is a lot of people including those who don’t like shrooms have said 4Aco-DMT is worth a go. It could be these N demethylated side products are difficult to avoid the way the biosynthetic route unfolds but that many might prefer pure psilocin. Not arguing you are wrong as such I think this is partly individual chemistry or taste and of course at the moment the role baeocystin and norbaeocystin play be it considered good or bad isn’t really clear - the effect could in fact be negligable in blind studies and some of the difference between 4AcO-DMT and psilocin also might not exist in blind studies due to expectation placebo etc. I would certainly agree of all the compounds about I really doubt 4AcO-DMT is at all unsafe.

Advising users to try 200% of Erowid's suggested STRONG oral dose of 4-AcO-DMT for their first time is fucking stupid StonedApe. Just because it's all dandy for you, doesn't mean everyone's going to have some sort of retarded tolerance or fiendish desire to become a vegetable for half the day like you'd have them with the dosage you've suggested.


If you aren't here to contribute to the community positively, please ensure your stay on Bluelight is short. Contributing positively includes guiding newbies in the right direction to ensure they have a safe and enjoyable experience; not advising over the top doses that would potentially have them lose their shit and run into some trouble. 


Please avoid handing out advice on dosing to those inexperienced with these chemicals until you can do so with their wellbeing in mind.

I was going to unapprove your amusing response, but hey let's just leave it here for now so people can read over and make up their own minds as to whether you have anyone else's health or wellbeing in mind.


I have what's commonly referred to as a 'hard head' tolerance; I seem to require that little bit more than others to achieve a relative intensity. Couple this with the fact I personally prefer more intense trips. Think 5g p.cubensis in public. I'm not so wise.


That being said, I have no tried 4-AcO-DMT myself. If I got hold of some, what I would do is visit Erowid's dosage guide page, assess what a "strong" dose is, and perhaps add another 20% for lulz. This would equate to 30mg orally. Not 50-70mg, which I wouldn't necessarily humour AT ALL depending on how intense my initial 30mg was.


Now to address your backwards claims as to your posts and their 'harm reduction' merit: advising anyone to take a large amount of something they're unfamiliar with, regardless of whether the advised dosage is considered "safe" from a toxicity point of view, is not in line with harm reduction. Anyone who disagrees is welcome to do so, but the line is drawn when you regurgitate this opinion in the form of advice on this website. You're welcome to offer your anecdotal experiences, however you must stop short of advising the user to follow your steps. I have no desire to remove anyone from the forums, so long as they participate maturely and respect our guidelines. If you wish to engage in dosage-dicksizing, feel free to take it to a social thread or somewhere more relevant, but please don't advise new inexperienced users to follow your steps just because it was fine for you. 


For example I've had a couple of good experiences on a touch over 2mg of 25i-NBOMe (2 tabs), however I will never recommend anything beyond a single tab of the shit to anyone else, and preferably only after they've trialled half a tab.


I welcome you to consider the above and think about why you've come to participate in Bluelight's community. If you're here to ensure the ongoing safe and positive experiences of users, I invite you to stay and do just that - but please reconsider the way in which you provide advice. Really, if someone took 50mg because you said it would be fine, and they lost their shit and wound up in lockup or the psych ward, do you think you've upheld Bluelight's mission?


Please don't respond in similar inflammatory fashion. I'm trying to help people, and your attitude towards me is not warranted or welcome.

Well I will cut some middle ground - I see where you are coming from - I find the dreaded underdose just that... dreadfed on the whole - more is more (better) to a degree - it’s just that won’t work out well for everyone - people are different and react differently - some hold that the 60s doses were excessive in retrospect - you can’t just sledgehammer others to your own world view even if it is well meaning. Others Shulgin included find lower doses good. Most people I have met who liked mushrooms were more social users - in the old days 15-30 liberty caps was oft quoted by many - about 0.5-1g (1g oft came out around 40 individuals) which isn’t a lot more than pretty pathetic 10mg psilocybin unless they are super potent. My GF loves mushrooms but only requires 2g for consistantly “strong” meaningful experiences. I kept pushing and pushing shrooms stupidly trying to get the wonders I got off acid easily and eventually came out of it badly - there is a lot about psilocybin doesn’t speak to me or sit right and endlessly upping the dose created some real negatives; I came back to them and worked up from small but I would personally favour DMT or LSD if I want to go further. For this reason I’ll give 4Ac0 the benefit of the doubt and jump in at 30 but no more; if it has advantage over psilocybin - ie less yucky bodyload, not being so darkly ‘folky' and presenting double binds etc I’ll possibly go higher.

I agree with trozzle, recommending extreme starting does isn't in the best interest of harm reduction. With every drug begin with an allergy test far below the desired dosage. With 4-AcO-DMT an allergy test of ~2.5mg is advisable is you're certain of the drugs composition. If you're uncertain of the drugs composition then starting with ~50ug is safe.


Protecting each others physical and psychological safety is most important. In forcing the supply of drugs into unregulated illegal markets the War on Drugs makes otherwise harmless usage of psychedelic medicines potentially dangerous. Remember, black/gray market vendors occasionally misrepresent and mislabel their wares.


Start with an allergy test if a chemical is new to you.

I removed a lot of posts that were off-topic, about particular users or the perceived state of the forum.  No one has been censored, except for the posts that were cluttering the thread.  Everyone was given ample time to present their sides, and those posts are still up and will not be removed at any time.  This is a public forum, everyone has the right to say what they want, but at this point this conversation has become extreme disruptive, and has already been discussed fully.  Further cluttering of this or other threads with this stuff will result in further action.  If anyone is not satisfied with participating here, no one is forcing you to stay.


I can identify aspects of all sides of this argument that I agree with, but no one responds well to condescension and inflammatory statements.

There are just so many things wrong with this logic...

We are all here to learn different lessons and there has never will never be a single path that works for everyone primarily due to that fact that we are all individuals with different goals, different beliefs and different life experiences. 

Also, how can you make the claim that no one has had a bad trip under the supervision of a shaman???

Were you present at all those ceremonies during the ages?

I also don't think that anyone who is either constantly on psychedelics or coming down from them is at s qualified to give advice on absolutley anything which it seems like you are from reading your posts in PD.

Well, if you inform them so that they it is no longer the unknown, they no longer have even the chance of having a freakout or a bad trip.

No this entirely your opinion because facts are verifiable and no one can verify your claims of 100% success rate in your trials or your personal anecdotal conversations with "witch doctors" and "warlocks". 

By the way, what ancient culture do warlocks come from???

I have a lot more experience than 16 years with psychedelics and I've seen the shit hit the fan many times regardless of positive reinforcement or reassurance or whatever.  Even if you have had 100% success that in no way means that you won't encounter a problem in the future. 

For some people high doses of serotonergenic psychedlics produce nothing but dysphoria. This universality you speak of is not in any way provable to be universal because you can't experience what any one else experiences. The perception of reality is entirely subjective and so are individual psychedlic experiences.

just acquired some, it is furmate. i saw a few postings on different website saying that because its a furmate i should use just a little bit more.


iv done mushrooms once when i was 17, so 10 years ago. i believe it was half a cut. I'm fairly experienced with weed, benzos, opiates, and dissos but a psychedelic noob. i will be alone in my house doing this, so I'm thinking that 12mg would be good?


also, has anyone had any experience combing 4-aco-dmt with 2-oxo-pce or dck?

i did 10mg. i figured to play it safe for my first time. it was waste of my time. all i got was a huge amount of body load which was unpleasant. i mean i felt the effects of the drug, but it was like being on a roller coaster and getting to the top of the first hill 200 feet up, only to find that it only goes down a very slow hill back to the station.


i most likely will go for 50mg next time.

Maybe you should look in to Stanislav Grof, StonedApe. He argued that lower doses were more helpful in terms of therapy. 


Personally +-30mg has been quite valuable and plenty active. I've been higher, but that does range has been the best for me.

dude I had my initial breakthrough experience on 27mg. you don't NEED 50mg. also IME saying each gram of mushrooms contains roughly ten miligrams isnt very accurate. I find 20mg to be pretty similar in intensity to an eighth of mushrooms, and when I had my breakthrough experience on 27mg it was much more intense than when I ate five grams of mushrooms. 


I think the thing about 4-aco is that it isn't wedged inside mushrooms that take a lot longer to digest than a capsule. thats why think the 'waves' of psychedelia that hit you are more intense/obvious with 4-aco-DMT than mushrooms for me generally

I've read the last couple of pages and it setting aside the debate over how high of a dose is recommended, does anyone find value in low doses (10mg or below). Based on a few posts in this thread it seems like it is just a waste of time. I actually tried ~8mg a couple of weeks ago (along with my daily dose of kratom) and had to take 1mg of etizolam to mellow me out...felt no real body load, but I felt like I wasn't in control of my body. Everything seemed...really smooth and in your face, though it is hard to describe. I've been using dissociatives regularly for the better part of a couple of years and this expecience just seemed weird. I had tried low doses of 4-HO-MET (4-10mg a few times) and the body load combined incredibly with the kratom and had some minor visual effects, it was amazing. 


Want to try this one out again at a low dose but maybe it just isn't right for that. Don't think I am ready for a breakthrough dose though...had a freak out 6 years ago on another tryptamine (don't remember which) and weed.

My take on low does has changed dramatically over the course of my tripping experience.  When I wasn't too experienced with psychedelics yet, I used to get weird bodyloads all the time.  In those days, low doses were uncomfortable for me, I got weird body feelings and a halfway in sort of state that was not enjoyable.  But these days, I basically don't get bodyloads anymore except on a few things, and I really enjoy low doses for what they are.  It's just a slight alteration, a sparkle to the day, a little extra inspiration in your thoughts.


I don't think I've low-dosed 4-AcO-DMT specifically though so maybe I'd find it weird too.

I've low dosed this compound a couple of times and it have been the most horrible experience with 5htc2-x agonists I had. But then again, I would not count myself as "experienced with psychedelics", though I now how to handle them without complications now.

Hence I recommend allergy tests. Alexander Shulgin also utilized allergy tests then incremental dosage increases from there.


Every person's body responds differently and the normal dose in some users could cause extreme effects or a allergic reaction in others. Frequently individuals metabolizes and/or respond differently with drugs than most people do.


If your drug was mislabeled, if your body responds with hypersensitivity, or if you're allergic you'd rather learn these things at much lower doses than the extreme dosages recommend in this thread.


I admire Alexander Shulgin greatly. Shulgin was innovative, intelligent, and lived over 80 years. Perhaps part of his longevity and success was the result of proactive harm reduction such as allergy tests. I proceed with each chemical the same way.

Not sure where this post belongs. 

But I am fucked up and I need to express this. It's been bothering me a while..


I  Love 4-Aco-DMT! ![❤️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/2764.png)


But..... My cats.. Love them with all my heart and soul. But they know when I am on it. And they DO NOT LIKE ME! 

I swear they look like at me like I am a bad enemy. And they won't actually even make eye contact with me.


So this is upsetting to me. And it can take what started out as a beautiful wonderful trip, and when I look at the cats, shit gets dark. And sinister. 


It really messes with my mind and emotions.


Oh and so sorry guys if this made no sense. Like I said I am wonderfully fucked up on my fav 4-sub ![❤️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/2764.png)

And wow so grateful right now!! Because the last. Few trips were rough. 


Today seemed the perfect day to trip because of the clouds! I love the clouds. Fractal! Snowflakes in the cloud! And wow! Never noticed how darn good my lawn looks - greener than ever!! Lol


Anyways... Sorry got off my main topic of posting.


My question is to the people who have cats and love them - do your cats act like you are the #1 enemy? 

And what can I do to make my cats realize I am not bad person. It's me! The one who found their homeless ass, and gave them shelter and love. How can I soften the energy I am obviously giving to them¿¿

GF tried this and wasn’t impressed. She’d taken 15mg, which was fairly strong (she’s pretty lightweight)but she had a depressing anxious eventually paranoid time. she enjoyed the visual aspect but not a lot else. Said it felt cleaner than shrooms but more relentless (less wavy) and empty ie similar language to shrooms but less spirit-shamanic element. “Cleaner’ might be a improvement for me although her stomach felt bad - more so than shrooms weirdly

NN DMT is a functional analog to Aco-DMT, NN DMT in itself is a freebase form, making it smokable and not orally injestable without the use of an MAOi.


4-ACO-DMT is not just Acetyl Psilocin(One would think that from the common name O-Acetylpsilocin) but what it's missing is the Hydroxy group of Psilocin, and 4-ACO-DMT is in fact N,N-Dimethyltryptamine with an Acetoxy group in the 4 position creating(4-Acetoxy, N,N-Dimethyltryptamine) Psilocin is the same but with a Hydroxy in place of Acetoxy. 


The fact that Psilocybin most likely has its own activity as well as being a prodrug has everything to do with the peak and experience of Mushrooms - it takes time to break down into Psilocin through the body, the "waves" of a mushroom experience are an accumulation of activity and digestion/absorption of Psilocybin and other minor alkaloids found in Mushrooms.(My theory)


If you have ever eaten fresh Mushrooms you will know that they act quicker and are stronger by weight because of the higher Psilocin content.


There is a such thing as synthetic 4-HO-DMT, as there are quite a few people who can vouch and have tried it, explaining different effects. 


Most mushrooms have an equal Psilocybin to Psilocin content? In Cubensis case yes, but for all mushrooms not entirely true, as some species vary greatly, such as Azurescens have high Psilocybin to Psilocin content, but YES if they are FRESH Cubensis variety generally have an equal percentage.


You have to realize most people that consume mushrooms are of the DRIED, Cubensis variety, most if not all of the Psilocin is lost due to oxidation in the drying process.


4-Aco-DMT is most definitely active on its own, proven through IV injection before ever reaching any form of metabolism, and also correlating to the less manic and chaotic version of synthetic 4-HO-DMT, furthering proving its own activity and individual metabolisms.


4-Aco-DMT is never converted to Psilocin in the body, as there is no hydroxy group! It's converted into N,N-Dimethyltryptamine which is active in the brain during the experience hence why I mentioned it reminds me more of Smoked DMT or Oral DMT, it's more visionary than mushrooms. 


And to others interested, I hope this post provides some insightful information. 


I hope that clears things up, correct me if I'm wrong.

In my opinion there isn't really much value in low doses apart from initial test dose(s) to make sure it doesn't affect you really strongly for some reason and/or making sure you have the right drug if you haven't had it tested.  Low dose 4-aco-dmt is basically just all the body load with barely any of the unique psychological perspectives/insights, and not much in the way of visuals or music appreciation either.  In my experience just being out in nature automatically makes most tryptamines experiences much better and more posivite though.  Being stuck inside can make you feel a bit "trapped" by the constructs of modern civilization.


That being said I dosed 12mg of it with 150mg of MXP (2-meo-diphenidine) about a month ago and it totally blew my mind.  I was out of my mind with all sorts of ideas rushing through my head and my entire vision was just huge waves/tracers everywhere.

Tried this again after about a year since my last dose. Unfortunately my conclusion is that this drug is not for me. It really amplifies my depression and anxiety, so much so that I resorted to taking 1mg etizolam after a couple hours. Not your classical bad-trip panic attack type anxiety just focusing on everything that is stressing me out and unable to find solutions. Was feeling damn near suicidal until the etiz did its thing. 


I think this only works in combinations for me. First time was with MDMA and had my first encounter with divinity. Any time I take it alone my trip always sucks.

This is exactly how I feel when taking 4-aco-dmt.


Also tried it first time combo with MDMA and it was very joyfull experience like a baby birthday or something very similar to it. 


Second time I tried it without combining and it was so uncomfortable. Constant body tremor or to be precious feeling that all your body muscles vibrating with very high speed wich lead me just to sit on sofa and wait till trip ends. Simultaneously eye closed visuals was very unpleasant too.  From that time I have no more reason to try it again.


 But I must add that second time I tried it exactly after antibiotic medication. So maybe 4-aco-dmt was just sumarasing all side effects of antibiotics, but I have no more courage to proof it. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

With the intention of purchasing some 4-ACO-DMT I have been trying to investigate various Chinese vendors online to ascertain if any of them are reputable or if they are all just scammers. I live in the UK so the chances of getting it here legitimately are zero and I have no knowledge / confidence in the "darknet" and haven't figured out bitcoin yet so that's off the cards for now. So after sending various messages of interest to various sellers I got into a conversation with a representative of a research chemicals seller who is offering to sell me some 4-ACO-DMT ..yes I know it's taking a big risk and I'm still trying to find out any info on the seller that I can. The red flags to this already are that they want payment by WesternUnion and don't offer paypal or the other usual payment methods but offer a "tracking number"..yeah right. So far this has been the story with all the Chinese sellers that I've looked into. Anyway she sent me some pictures on Skype of the product and it's a dark brown crystal, not at all what I would expect. Any opinions, suggestions would be appreciated.

I've had a similar batch op dark-brownish/black-ish crystals of 4-AcO-DMT from a very trustworthy vendor. It was a great product, identical in effect to more white/off-white powdery batches I've consumed. 


But as always: test it to be sure, since there's no way one can identify the purity of a product through pictures.

Interesting. I would have expected if it was a scam to have been sent images of a bag of your typical off-white crystals so I suppose it could be legit. Hope so.

The obvious thought is that the brown product is has largely turned to psilocin but since it has come like that very hard to tell

I don't know anything about what 4-AcO-DMT normally looks like, but that picture says "degraded/oxidized tryptamine" to me. At best.. Also kind of looks like incense resin.

It really amplifies my depression and anxiety, so much so that I resorted to taking 1mg etizolam after a couple hours. Not your classical bad-trip panic attack type anxiety just focusing on everything that is stressing me out and unable to find solutions. Was feeling damn near suicidal until the etiz did its thing.

I can relate to your experiences, although IMHO this compound has the tightest dependency to the current mind and body set of the user of all psychedelics. I had also one positive experience on a medium dose but then a few negative after a few years with the symptoms you both mentioned.


It is likely, that the 4-Aco-DMT degraded into something else over time and the resulting compound is causing all those negative side effects. The degration process was also described by Shulgin in TIHKAL.

If it "degrades" to 4-HO-DMT, then count me in... I had synthetic 4-HO-DMT a few times and damn if that wasn't one of the greatest things I've ever tasted.  Much better than 4-AcO-DMT.

Damn do I want a large-scale synth of psilocin to happen, seems like the perfect chemical to me from all I've read. I'd still rate 4-Aco-DMT as very good though, definitely a tryptamine psychedelic and a modern classic.

Finally took this and it was pretty awful. It is definately different to psilocin; It’s clearer, less visual, less dark and so on mentally so a bit easier - it felt a little hollow compared to shrooms = all these things could be an improvement over psilocin except it has pretty much the full range of unpleasant symptoms and sides effects that make shrooms an ugly endurance test  even if the trip isn’t too bad.

I chicken out and only tried 20mg and yeah probably equipotent with psilocybin which is supposed to be about 10mg per gram of decent semilanceata - I guess this was like 2g semis so a modest go but then it was rather different so hard to say beyond roughly.

I was pretty determined with shrooms and came back to them after swearing off many times over the years - at the end of the day they were decidedly unhelpful - At least I tried but I am not going to make the same mistake with this stuff(of bothering to repeat the experience) 


If someone gets on with mushrooms or find them enjoyable or helpful though they will likely get on with this; if your not in that camp try other psilocybin analogs that are much less similar or PEAs or lysergamides

All of the obviously degraded 4-Aco-DMT I've ever dealt with (brown goop) had no vinegar smell whatsoever but the latest batch I aquired has an extremeley strong vinegar smell, it's has the appareance of brown powder that's not clumpy but like a fine brown sand. I could literally smell the vinegar through the vaccum sealed bag and through the mailing envelope lol. 

I was very concerned about the quality/ degradation of this batch of 4-Aco-DMT until it was bioassyed and appeares to be equipotent to any of the "pure white" batches I've aquired over the years from many different vendors.

The molecule has different appearances depending on the salt and/or degradation. People often report darker 4-AcO-tryptamines retain potency. I expect the purest 4-AcO-DMT could have the appearance 4-PO-DMT has here.

18mg 4-ACO-DMT, fumarate salt, dissolved in 2ml of water, injected intravenously was astoundingly powerful. I thought I'd be up to the task -- I really wasn't. I watched the postive vibes collapse and wither all around me and the negative ones took over. I had to abort with 6mg etizolam, and shortly after that, maybe an hour later--I passed out for 5 hours. I should have waited until setting and mindset were in a better place. Also, I won't be playing with this stuff IV again for a bit. lol Very potent.


In fact, it wasn't but a few seconds after injection that I started seeing the fastest mandelbrot animation before my eyes, almost opaque, so I couldn't see much beyond it -- it overwhelmed me and I didn't know how to enjoy it. I moved from room to room, actually in a bit of a panic. Standing up, pacing, laying down, getting back up. I have never experienced closed-eye visuals like that before. I thought I'd really fucked myself, and I'm no noob to psychedelics. This is so much more potent, IV at least, than any lysergamide or tryptamine I've tried, even at 18mg. I think I needed that, just to remind me I'm playing with fire.


I was humbled.

Ok so my vendor wanted to send me a sample of 4-Aco-dmt hcl. I assume what I have always gotten from him is the furmate and the stuff that has always been a fine white powder.  I have also recieved some from a different vendor that I believe was furmate as well, and it was very light tan(more of a very very light pink maybe)


So this sample came in the other day. I have yet to try it, since my psychedelic escapade at the beach about 2 weeks ago, I was giving my mind and body a little rest and wanted my tolerance go down..


The sample I just got looks very different from any of the other 4-Aco-Dmt I have ever recieved. It is brownish tan and kinda clumpy.  I believe my vendor that it is the hcl. I have done my research on the difference (which seems to mostly be potency and degradation) but couldn't find what it looks like vs the furmate 


Does anyone else have experience with  the 4-aco-dmt hcl form? And also what did the hcl look like they was received? Was it any different or better than the furmate?


I plan to research this stuff very soon tho!

Smoked 30mgs of 4-aco-dmt fumerate  on top of some weed out of my bubbler and had an amazing time, awesome body high and visuals for 3 hours almost, but when I try to find other reports of this ROA the general consensus says it is ineffective...what am I doing that other people are not... the high was amazing really like DMT lite with some longevity haha

Not possible??? Really??? 

I'd say more like not likely but it's certainly possible.  I feel that most vendors just download an MSDS for whatever product their selling and send that with your order. 

I just today recieved some Glaucine in hydrobromide salt form but the MSDS was for the freebase that came with it. 

Maybe your super reputable vendor got some freebase 4-aco-dmt when he ordered the fumarate and now is selling it. That is at least possible

As I said "I do not know how it would be possible" and I order from a lab who produce this stuff personally, not a vendor getting it second hand. As for the appearance it's an off white light amber color powder, and I have tested the same batch by insufflation  and orally as well with comparable effects to the fumarate dosage.... would a freebase have the same effects as the fumarate in an oral dose?

The freebase should be more potent by weight orally but if it's freebase it should not work by insuffilation. 

Not to confuse the situation any further but I've never been able to get much of an effect from 4-Aco-DMT from insuffilating the fumarate even. 

I get threshold effects from as little as 7mg oral but I've snorted like 30mg and just got an ill feeling and needed to sit down for about half an hour. Zero visuals.  Works perfect for me orally though. 

I have no explanation why it works for you via smoking if you do have the fumarate salt.

Yeah snorting acetapsilocin has been my go to  ROA for this substance the past 3 years and I love it. I tend to have a weak stomach on certain psychedelics so snorting a good line of 4-aco-dmt gets me the visuals, body high, and mental state I look for in a tryptamine . This batch has been no different, awesome to snort but last night when I randomly decided to try some on a bowl it blew me away... the stuff bubbled up pretty quickly and within 5 minutes I was blasted. Anyways no complaints just curious if anyone else has had a similar experience...idk if the water filtration from the bubbler influenced the chemical makeup of the smoke to a point where it caused an unprecedented effect, but that just seems unlikely

My understanding was that it is difficult to vaporize the fumarate salt specifically. I don't know if the the Hcl might be easier. 

My one attempt at smoking the fumarate had zero effect at all beyond possible placebo.

yeah a salt will have a higher boiling point than the corresponding base... I did a quick search and found this thread on dmt nexus about smoking dmt fumarate: [https://www.dmt-nexus.me/forum/default.aspx?g=posts&t=9462](https://www.dmt-nexus.me/forum/default.aspx?g=posts&t=9462)

I experimented with this again last weekend, and had MUCH better results than my first time. [I've reached God mode with this substance after IV'ng 50mg.](http://bluelight.org/vb/threads/802146-4-ACO-DMT-50mg-IV-Experienced-quot-God-Mode-quot-amp-other-tales?p=13762973#post13762973)

I tried this for the first time last night and was pleasantly surprised. Just an allergy dose of 5 mg followed by another 7 mg 15 minutes later I was tripping at 30 mins and peaking after about 1 hour for another hour or so, dropping off in intensity fairly rapidly and close to baseline after 5. Very short duration but quite intense visually, especially CEVs which I consider to be more DMT-like than mushroom-like although I haven't done DMT yet. The headspace really was nothing at all like mushroom trips that I've had in the past although it has been a very long time since I've been able to get a hold of any (30 years). It definitely had an artificial feel about it, not as deep as mushrooms in terms of anxiety/mindfuck and I found it hard to concentrate on what was being said. I felt quite zonked out and a bit stoned and stupid tbh. The bodyload was negligible and I felt quite relaxed and comfortable. I wouldn't be scared to try this again at 25 mg in a week or two from now. Looking forward to the next one.

I find it odd that people report 4aco has less anxiety and mindfuck than mushrooms. I can comfortably take upt to 4 or 5g of good cubensis shrooms but if I take any more than 20mg of 4aco im a nervous wreck for the first half of the trip. I wish this one clicked with me better as the second half of the trip is usually orgasmic and very healing but the first half usually scares the shit out of me so I rarely take it.

Yeah that's how it is for me too, the first half feels like I'm slowly coming up on smoked DMT, and it feels kind of jarring and confusing and somewhat alarming.  The second half is beautiful though.

I've never done mushrooms, but I can tell you that when I ate 20mg of 4-Aco-DMT, the come-up was practically non-existent. I felt sober for about 20 minutes then went straight to space as I walked about my local park. I can tell you it was far stronger than any NBOMe tab I've ever taken, but can't compare to actually smoking DMT. 

Visuals were mainly wavy and intense, while the body load wasn't bad. I actually found, (once I settled in from the initial rapid onset) the effects to be fairly sedating, like that of a light opiate dose. I really don't think you can compare these to mushrooms, as they are notorious for causing nausea and I don't believe they have a sedative feel to them. I got no nausea from 4-Aco- although very thirsty- and there was most definitely a hint of sedation, especially on the come-down.

I've never became neusea's from mushrooms and find mushrooms to be pretty sedating actually. That being said I don't find mushrooms & 4-AcO-DMT exactly the same, but they are quite similar. I do like the comparison some people use of the first half of 4-AcO-DMT trips being like a slow onset of smoked DMT though. Pretty accurate. Second half is almost exactly like mushrooms except generally slightly more euphoric, and it is overall more sedating than mushrooms are.

I would agree that I also find mushrooms sedating at the beginning, though I get some energy after the peak. I've also never gotten any nausea from them, though I wouldn't be surprised if I did these days. 4-AcO-DMT does feel even more sedating and easier on my stomach though, but those things alone don't make it unlike mushrooms for me.

I had a strange experience last night on 20 mg 4-ACO-DMT. About 45 minutes after ingestion everything became bathed in this mystical warm golden light like something on a Christmas card. I think maybe another 10 minutes passed during which I was looking at youtube, the next time took my eyes off the screen and looked around and everything had gone green like as if I was wearing sunglasses with green lenses. Everything looked darker. I was quite freaked out for a while. This went on for several minutes. I have never had this happen before. I have read other people saying similar things but it really took me by surprise.

Not sure if this was the same thing happening but I to had weird colour changing effects from 4-ACO-DMT. My skin seemed to go an ash grey colour and I couldnt figure out if Id actually turned that colour or I was just tripping.

So I just tried this stuff for the (what I think is*) first time night-before-last. My scale said 8mg, but I understand with a weight that small it's bound to be inaccurate (I weighed it on top of a little metal tray, on top of 3 quarters stacked on each other). Also ate a couple grams of Green Maeng Da kratom to get myself in a bit-more-giddy mood. It took quite a while to hit, somewhere around 40-50 minutes to hit, then seemed to come-up in a few stages. Over the course of an hour or so it grew, every 20 minutes or so, another step higher; more euphoria, and visuals were more pronounced. Music was wonderful, everything was funny, the visuals were - while not super prevalent - quite pretty. 


At about 3.5 hours in, I decided to take 1mg etizolam so I could comfortably get stoned and relax my head a little bit. I ended up not being able to fall asleep (even after a 2nd mg of etizolam) until T+6 hours. 


Here's a good idea of the timeframe:

Dosed @ 00:30

First alerts @ 01:10

++ @ 01:30

+++ @ 02:10

++ @ 3:00

1mg Etizolam @ 03:30

1mg Etizolam @ 04:30

Asleep @ 06:30


Interestingly, I noticed it was very "wavey", in the intensity of acid waves. I have a similar experience with mushrooms, however this was MUCH more pronounced. Light visuals, chill mind, and euphoria for 20 minutes or so, then ramping up to harder visuals, trippier mind, and less-euphoria for another 20 minutes. During the latter phase, my nose was really runny, and my eyes were quite watery.


Overall, I really really enjoyed this stuff. I'm not really sure what dosage of mushrooms I could compare it to, as they obviously vary quite a bit. I tend to be pretty sensitive to tryptamines (18mg 4-HO-MET was ridiculously mindfucky). I'd like to give it another shot, maybe 15mg or so next time.


(*A few years ago, I had 26mg of what was sold as 4-AcO-DMT, but the bag said "4HM" on it, so we figure it was actually 4-ho-met; my confirmed 4-ho-met experience was only recently, so I can't compare them at all, other than that 26mg being...way, way too much).

Has anyone ever IVed 4-aCo-DMT and the rush hit so instantly it was insane. I've done it many times and this trip yesterday was nuts. Instantly I felt I had to get my sweatshirt on. Ran outside and put my animals back in the house. I felt something was after me. Usually I feel a female presence. Not this time it was something of male presence. I had to get the animals inside because he was outside. But I refused to be afraid of it. It was about 6;30 in the evening. Sun was going down. I was sitting in my back yard and the grass and bushes with small white flower looked as if they were putting on a show for me. They were colorful and dancing. I needed my earbuds. I couldn't find them. I wasn't getting up because to mesmerized by the dancing in the yard.

I had forgotten about that sinister male presence. But I started hearing things yelling at me from a far. Not saying nice things to me. But i was ignoring it. I tried to smoke a cigeratte but my hands looked like a plastic blow up dolls. 

What the fuck? The cigeratte felt so light and empty. I was having trouble holding it with my fAt looking hands. 

It wAs amazing. But the same time terrifying. I was hearing something from somewhere yelling mean things at me. Then some wonderful man who sounded like rev. Al sharpton voice came from somewhere in the trees and said "don't you listen to those evil, don't let them evil thoughts in your head!" I was like omg thank you sir. Because the mean voices were getting louder. 


Sorry if this is hard to understand but I am still trying to make sense of it all my self. I IVed and large amount. But I already had some tolerance. IVed 85mg. Holy shit. Without tolerance - I suggest no one ever do that. With tolerance I suggest no one do that. I can't say I regret it, because parts of it were beautiful. At one point after my hands stopped looking plastic. I could see the electricity in my body in my arms and hands. And it was blue and purple and greens. And I felt there was electricity all around me. I was like protected in an electric ball of color. It was amazing. I needed this experience. It goes so much deeper and I plan to write about it later. But I needed this. I showed me things I had forgotten about. Like living here on earth. I had started hating people a while ago, just from my own experiences with people who betrayed me, caused me pain. The things I have seen on the news (the reason I quit watching it) just because of the horrible things people do to one another and animals. It makes me sick that people can be so cruel and heartless. But I realized not everyone is this way. I have shut myself out from the world for so long (well like 4 years or so). The only people I really interact with is my family, my husband and my daughter. My daughter wasn't home last night that's why I decided good evening to trip.  Really wanted to see a beautiful sunset. But I saw way more than a sunset. Remember people EARBUDS!!! I think if I would of had my earbuds and music I wouldn't have heard whatever yelling nasty things at me. Even when I was walking very fast through the house trying to get my stuff to go outside. Every door I shut would say something nasty to me, I just gave it the finger and kept on moving. Trying to get away from the male presence. Never saw what he looked liked. Just know I was on a mission to get my shit and get out side. Found everything I needed but my earbuds. I had my phone. But couldn't read a word it said. 


There was an important message in this trip i can't describe. It made me feel I needed to wake up. Stop hiding and running and being so angry. And pay attention to the people who have been good to me. Make more efforts to spend time with my family or call them (they live in another state). 


All I can say is the rush of the IV was intense. Ive IVed before it's always intense but never this intense. I assumed with the large tolerance I had that it would be ok. What amazes me about 4-aco-DMT is that every trip amazes and surprises me! It's never the same. Things were like a roller coaster of nucking futts! One minutes nature was dancing and beautiful and seemed to be dancing just for me then the next something that sounded like an echo was yelling mean things at me. The Al Sharpton voice in the trees helped. I started believing that there is something real that only psychedelics allow us to experience out there. That without no one can see or hear. There is energies around us all the time. Some of them are kind and loving and helpful and protecting us. Then the others are testing our sanity and who we are. The negative energy calling me all those ugly names, was fucked up. It wasnt the male presence I sensed earlier to. He was there. He just wasn't saying anything. He was just trying to scare the shit out of me. But the dancing bushes and neon nature colors over powered his nastiness. Everything would change instantly. One minute i felt like laughing and was mesmerized by everything. The next I was like holy shit what is that. 


So crazy. But amazing. 4-aco-dmt never fails to surprise the shit out of me. But I think I am going to give it a long break and give my veins a break for a while. I never used needles in my life. But I had tried 4Aco every other way so I thought why not. And after I did it the first time a while back ago. It was almost addicting. But this trip was needed and necessary.  Because I feel no need to do it for a little while now. 


Even tho if I didn't have anyone or any animals to take care of. I think I wouldn't mind being in that state all the time. It as beautiful. And my fears from this particular trip seem to have been demolished. I'm not afraid anymore. Of life and living. It's really just a weird confusing thing. 


But I am grateful for this experience.  I really am.

When it comes to outright rush, instantaneously being ripped from sobriety to absolute serpentine psychedelia, I've never known anything like 4-ACO-DMT. However, I don't feel a desire to ever repeat my experiences again. lol

Would 5mg of 4-AcO-DMT enhance music at all?


Also, has anyone here ever combined it with MDMA?

5mg might do something depending on your tolerance and or sensitivity to the compound.

It is truly amazing combined with MDMA

Just like mushrooms and MDMA is amazing.

30mg of sticky clumpy brown 4-ACO DMT plus 100 mg MDMA at a concert and I was visited by a divine presence. Powerful combo. Also had a "Jedi flip" with 2 hits of LSD, .2-.3 MDMA and 20mg 4-ACO-DMT which was probably the deepest I've ever delved into my mind, after, of course, working out most of the MDMA on the dance floor to some dubstep (which I usually hate). 


For me psilacetin is only good in combinations, taking it alone can be very dysphoric.

5mg is probably the equivalent to about 0.5-0.7g of shrooms. Is fairly similar to shrooms combined with MDMA.

It’s more like mushrooms than anything like MDMA - but then everything gets compared to MDMA if one gets mood lift off it or enjoys it (which isn’t what really singles out MDMA) - no offense but I feel the simile is over used to the point of near pointlessness.

Equivalence to shrooms is a bit dicey since there are many sorts of shrooms and natural product vary somewhat but yeah I would guess 5mg is about 0.5g of liberty caps or potent cubes. The problem with this is although the over lap is great the difference makes direct comparison harder. I was hoping the negative unpleasant bodyfeel and drunk lethargy might be missing (something I hate about shrooms) but sadly not and I’m not a fan; I really prefer the other psilocin analogs. For my GF at least it might be a possible migraine help - experimenting around 2mg next for this.

I cant belive I havnt thought of this combo! I loved mushrooms with MDMA in the past and get too anxious on just 4aco so i may have to preload next time with some MDMA.

Wow, and do you think the MDMA would mute any potential anxiety from the 4-Aco-DMT ?

Think you misunderstood me. I was saying doing 4 aco dmt with MDMA is similar to doing mushrooms with MDMA. I find doing MDMA with 4 ACO DMT totally removes any anxious feelings.

Nope I knew that's what you meant, but I'm very glad (and not surprised) to hear MDMA removes the potential anxiety of 4-AcO-DMT ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

So what do you think that low dose (5mg - 10mg) of 4-AcO-DMT combined with, say, 125mg MDMA would feel like?

Planning to take 30mg 4-aco-dmt and 10mg 4-ho-met on Thursday. Going to do the quiet in the dark thing and meditate and see what comes up. I've had been getting pretty depressed and feeling anxious in my body. Ready to hit the reset button. I've been journaling about my intentions and really want to go into this open and hopeful.

It went pretty well ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I ended up a bit over 30mg on 4acodmt and about 16mg 4homet. Ate just a scrambled egg and dosed about an hour later. Alerts at 20 min and ++ at 45min. 


I was hoping to go a lot deeper but I just couldn't break through. OEV never really manifested but CEV were pretty intricate. I figured the hefty dose would get me there, especially since 20mg of this 4homet has been spectacular. I haven't taken this batch of 4acodmt over 10 mg though. I did bump tiny bits of 2c-e a week before but probably only 3mg total... So maybe tolerance was a facto, maybe a shitty synth (odor and taste are pretty weak and the peripheral effects were not great, I had vasoconstriction in my toes which I don't remember ever getting with tryptamines).


 I spent a good bit of the time not very comfortable and actually wanting it to be over. I got in the bath which was nice for a while but was super restless. Decided to go for a run and that dispelled a lot of tension. I spent the early part of the trip and the run trying to "go into" the fear and anxiety I've been dealing with. To be honest I think that may be the reason for the discomfort, universal love and acceptance were not the purpose of this one. I confronted some selfish decisions and self-denial that have been simmering below the surface. I did some figurative and literal throwing away of a bunch of bullshit that   I have been clinging to. I definitely felt like I was doing some honest hard work. And I can say that my physical anxious symptoms have calmed quite a bit.


One really interesting thing. I became acutely aware of how often my inner monologue consists of rehearsing how I would say something to one person or another, or how I would post a thought somewhere online. This got me in some recursive loops of rehearsing the description of the rehearsal in some other context. I feel kind of rewired to practice a different kind of empty mind in which i dismiss conceptions of external expression/judgement of my feelings and thoughts and just be with them. It is not easy.


I read the Tao Te Ching #10 (Ursula Le Guin's). It is so beautiful. "Can you keep the deep water still and clear, without blurring "


And this, as a parent, hot damn


"To give birth, to nourish, to bear and not to own, to act and not lay claim, to lead and not to rule: this is mysterious power."

So I've been relatively clean the last 60 days or so, and today, after getting all the important stuff of the week done, having been paid, and then paid my bills, and having no weed, or anything else but a plethora of 4-aco-dmt around, I found myself wanting to get high, but still too afraid IV 4ACO-DMT again. It was really such an absolute brain-melting and psych-dissolving rush that my memory serves as an effective resistance to ever trying it again. Wow.... And to think I had IV'd 50mg of it 3 days in a row. And then, when I consider the way it was IV, now I'm even a bit put off of eating the stuff. Maybe someday. In the meantime, I guess there's this bottle of Evan Williams.

^^^ It does, but it's no Brawndo. Orally, it just doesn't got what plants crave. jk (at least at the time) The whiskey was good. Ended up raking leaves for my friend across the street, whose cancer, and its treatment, has left him in a bad way, especially this week. Glad I didn't mess with the stuff today.

Yeah IV 4-Aco-DMT is a different beast all together. After my last trip, I haven't done it again since. Scared the living shit out of me. What was weird was there was a happy afterglow, which only lasted about 12 hours. But after that wore off, I started really thinking about that trip and got anxiety about things, like death and stuff. Never have I been scared of death (so I thought) 


Anyways... yeah a break from tripping was much needed. So that's about where I am now with it

I have some that I received as a sample. And it looked exactly like that. It was the HCL. The vendor always had the furmate kind, and it was usually white powder. Then sent me sample of HCL and that's what it looked like. But I have heard of psilacetin looking all kinds of ways. 

So to be safe you should send the vendor an email and ask. ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I'm interested in the 4-ACO-DMT and 4-HO-MET combo. On it's own I find 4-HO-MET far too stimulating and edgy for me but I love how visual it is even at low doses, it has the magic fairytale sparkle to it that liberty caps have and cubensis tends not to have. I wonder if the 4-ACO-DMT would take the stimulated edge out of it?

Probably. I used to do combinations with 4-AcO-DMT and 4-AcO-MET. Amazing combo. 4-AcO-MET wires you so you're not too sedated from the 4-AcO-DMT, but 4-AcO-DMT also takes the edge off of 4-AcO-MET's stimulating properties.


The visuals on this combo are to die for as well.

Definitely  one of the only substances I have actually followed my better judgement  on (how often will I experiment knowing the risks?) -- the risks really  seem ominous -- that body load... I remember reaching a higher  frequency with IV 4-aco-dmt; my perception was 256-bit, at 1200 frames  per second, and I could hear things that I'd never noticed before, and  seen things with such dynamic resolution. It upped my existence but at  the risk of leaving one kind for another...


Edit: Also...under this substance's influence, I feel like I'm turning into a lizard. Like a reptile in me is taking control.

I had to get the animals inside because he was outside.  But I refused to be afraid of it. It was about 6;30 in the evening. Sun  was going down. I was sitting in my back yard and the grass and bushes  with small white flower looked as if they were putting on a show for me.  They were colorful and dancing. I needed my earbuds. I couldn't find  them. I wasn't getting up because to mesmerized by the dancing in the  yard.

Without tolerance - I suggest no one  ever do that. With tolerance I suggest no one do that. I can't say I  regret it, because parts of it were beautiful. At one point after my  hands stopped looking plastic. I could see the electricity in my body in  my arms and hands. And it was blue and purple and greens. And I felt  there was electricity all around me. I was like protected in an electric  ball of color. It was amazing. I needed this experience. It goes so  much deeper and I plan to write about it later. But I needed this. I  showed me things I had forgotten about. Like living here on earth. I had  started hating people a while ago, just from my own experiences with  people who betrayed me, caused me pain. The things I have seen on the  news (the reason I quit watching it) just because of the horrible things  people do to one another and animals. It makes me sick that people can  be so cruel and heartless. But I realized not everyone is this way. I  have shut myself out from the world for so long (well like 4 years or  so). The only people I really interact with is my family, my husband and  my daughter. My daughter wasn't home last night that's why I decided  good evening to trip.  Really wanted to see a beautiful sunset. But I  saw way more than a sunset. Remember people EARBUDS!!! I think if I  would of had my earbuds and music I wouldn't have heard whatever yelling  nasty things at me. Even when I was walking very fast through the house  trying to get my stuff to go outside. Every door I shut would say  something nasty to me, I just gave it the finger and kept on moving.  Trying to get away from the male presence. Never saw what he looked  liked. Just know I was on a mission to get my shit and get out side.  Found everything I needed but my earbuds. I had my phone. But couldn't  read a word it said.

What amazes me about 4-aco-DMT is  that every trip amazes and surprises me! It's never the same. Things  were like a roller coaster of nucking futts! One minutes nature was  dancing and beautiful and seemed to be dancing just for me then the next  something that sounded like an echo was yelling mean things at me. The  Al Sharpton voice in the trees helped. I started believing that there is  something real that only psychedelics allow us to experience out there.  That without no one can see or hear. There is energies around us all  the time. Some of them are kind and loving and helpful and protecting  us. Then the others are testing our sanity and who we are. The negative  energy calling me all those ugly names, was fucked up. It wasnt the male  presence I sensed earlier to. He was there. He just wasn't saying  anything. He was just trying to scare the shit out of me. But the  dancing bushes and neon nature colors over powered his nastiness.  Everything would change instantly. One minute i felt like laughing and  was mesmerized by everything. The next I was like holy shit what is  that.

That was one hell of a trip report, by the way. I loved the lessons, what you were taught, and how you described it.

^^ yeah it was crazy. It was actually the next trip that scared the shit out of me - to the point I haven't touched the stuff since. I'm too scared too... and I love psilacetin. And I was so comfortable with it. I think that's what happened. I got to comfortable. I had to no fear of it, that's when I started  IVing it in normal doses.  But then started going higher with dose. The last time I did it, I was like nothing I have ever experienced. Just scary. I also think I experienced ego loss, I couldn't even make out where I was anymore. It was just strange. Very DMT like or 4-Ho-dmt like. Because the trip was so chaotic. 


IV really makes it a completely different kind of trip, vs taking it orally

Admit tried some 4-AcO-DMT last night and attempted to watch Enter The Void. 

Ended up getting down with Mazzy Star and cuddling all night instead.


My first go with this substance, and wow. There was a little anxiety coming up initially, but once that passed it was pure bliss and euphoria.

I'd be careful about straight doubling the dose. While this one can be supremely beautiful, just like mushrooms it can kick your ass.

Oh man, I tried watching Enter the Void during my first test of psilacetin, just 10mg, and got so caught up in anxiety from the film that I had to turn it off halfway through. I still haven't finished it.


I've seen people talking about combining this with other 4-subs and I was wondering, for those that have tried it, what is your favorite combo? I'm interested in maybe delving into psilacetin again but it was only dysphoric on its own but really shined in combination with MDMA or LSD.

4-AcO-DMT and 4-HO-MET seems to be a favorite, I love the combo, they really fill each other in and produce something great.  I think actually that's the only one I've combined 4-AcO-DMT with.

What was your dosage?

4-aco-DMT is such a precious gem to me. I've never felt a dash of anxiety on it. Which is not how tryptamines usually work for me. I would say it's my favorite drug, and I wouldnt be lying. It's just that I have a holy trinity of favorite drugs. It doesnt get much better than 4-aco-deemt though.

4-AcO-MET & 4-AcO-DMT is also an awesome combination.


I don't condone usage of NBOMe psychedelics but when I combined 25D-NBOMe with 4-AcO-DMT I also loved that trip, a lot.

Never seemed to play that well with LSD. LSD always overpowered it.

I always dosed about 10mg-15mg 4-AcO-DMT and 20mg-25mg of 4-AcO-MET when I've done this combination.


A few times I did 10mgish of 4-AcO-MET with like 25mg 4-AcO-DMT but the 4-AcO-DMT seemed to overpower the 4-AcO-MET at that low of a dose. 

4-AcO-DMT can be heavy on the psyche and I really just like it in lower doses combined with more euphoric drugs, like 4-AcO-MET or MDMA.

When I combined them it was 35mg of 4-AcO-DMT and 10mg of 4-HO-MET, the -MET added a nice warmth, comfort and good-natured feeling to it but it was very predominantly a deep, serious 4-AcO-DMT trip.  I normally like to take around 35-40mg of 4-sub-Ts, depending on which one.

I started by insufflating ten mgs, and eating 15 about twenty minutes later for a total of 25 mgs. One thing that needs to be taken into account is I am still physically dependent on Etizolam and Kratom, though I am on a slow taper plan which I am sticking to. Obviously throwing those two in the mix is going to result in some diminished effects for any psychedelic. I still got great CEV's and the body feeling, but I know whithout the Etizolam and Kratom OEV's would be much more prominent and mind blowing. Looking forward to exploring this compound more in depth on nothing else. 


Eating MXE is my preferred ROA and after talking to a few more experienced users, it's better to eat or IM the 4-AcO as the chemical is broken down more efficiently just like with MXE. Is this your experience? I was thinking about just eating 30 mgs right off the rip and seeing where that takes me. IM is another ROA I would like to try as it seems to be the way to go if you really want to break through.


We also just ordered some 4-HO-MET as the combo sounds stellar.


@Xorxoth:


Have you tried combining phenibut with either of these substances? I recall you posting phenibut goes well with certain psychedelics.

Phenibut goes well with everything I've tried combining it with.  I have taken phenibut with the majority of psychedelics I've tried multiple times (as in, if I have tripped on it a variety of times I've almost certainly taken phenibut with it at some point).  Phenibut just sort of provides a background light hypomania/euphoria, I haven't found it to interact directly with much of anything, but it will make anything more euphoric.  It doesn't seem to diminish trips at all unlike a benzo or alcohol, nor does it make them stronger, it just makes the backdrop for them more euphoric.

A couple years ago I ordered some 4-AcO-MET and 4-AcO-DMT from a vendor I really trusted at the time, I ended up only receiving a bag labeled 4-AcO-MET. At the time, my only previous psychedelic experience was LSD, Mushrooms, and 2C-B. Anyways, the more I think about it I think what I received may have actually been 4-AcO-DMT so I just wanted to see what everyone here thought. It really bugged me for a long time because the experience was a bit jarring since I was expecting a milder trip in line with usual 4-AcO-MET reports. My experience as follows:


I took 26mg orally with a couple friends the day after receiving it. I came up pretty quickly, and I remember being very sedated for maybe the first hour or so of the trip. Like on the floor in my own world sedated. I remember coming to probably sometime between the first 1-2 hours and my friends relatives stopped by seemingly randomly which made us all freak out as we were tripping extremely hard. I remember having this feeling of impending doom during that time, but I was able to retain composure. Perhaps a few hours in I took a shower, at which point the CEV's and OEV's became very intense and seemingly impossible. After getting out of the shower, the character of the trip began to shift completely. The visuals went from a "jeweled" or "digital" character into a more "organic" overall perception of the environment. I started to freak out a bit and called a closer friend to come pick me up, at this point I started seeing faces in everything and I lost all depth perception. It definitely began to seem more in line with my one previous mushroom experience visually. I tried to get him to find me some Alprazolam but he couldn't and we just went back to his place and it died down not long after.


In addition, the same friends convinced me to trip again the next day on the same batch, I took 36mg orally accounting for tolerance and for about 30 minutes of trip I completely forgot my name and everything about myself and I just had to sit there and accept it. I ended up tripping on the same batch a few more times but it was always lower doses so they don't really stand out in my memory but I feel like there was always some degree of mental confusion in them.


I had another batch of presumed 4-AcO-MET since and it seemed more digital, less confusing, and with a bit more of a positive push at around 20mg. I even combined some tokes of good cannabis with it and it provided an intense experience that didn't seem threatening in the least bit.


I realize that idiosyncratic reactions can happen but from all I've read it doesn't seem like 4-AcO-MET should have affected me that intensely at those dosages. Also, the subjective experience seems more in line with 4-AcO-DMT the more I read about it. I'm one of those people who really likes to know what they're taking and especially now that I'm looking to get back into psychedelics after not indulging much in the past year, I'd like to gain some more insight as those were some of my stronger trips. I see regular reports of people doing 40, even 50+ mg of 4-HO-MET which is very similar to 4-AcO-MET but more potent. I feel like if I had done 50+ mg of that first batch I had, I would've been in a sort of hyperspace for at least a few hours.

We can't do substance ID here but your description sounds exactly like 4-AcO-DMT.

4-AcO-MET is pretty stimulating. 4-AcO-DMT is one of the most sedating tryptamines that I've tried.

How do the effects differ when eaten as opposed to being insufflated? What is the preferred ROA for those besides the almighty IM? I am wondering because though it seems to work well when insufflated, I heard from a friend that eating it is the way to go? This is my preferred ROA when dosing MXE so it wouldn't surprise me, just curious on others thoughts/experience

Oral ROA is generally better for 4-AcO-DMT rather than insufflated.

That's what I was thinking. Maybe I'll just try eating 35 mgs next time then insufflating small lines later if the desire to do so arises. This stuff is amazing.

Yeah oral psychedelics are pretty much always better than nasal IMO.  Nasal produces a more rapid onset and is stronger by weight, but it always produces a trip that is less full and well-rounded.  Oral produces the most full trips for me for most things.  Rectal and IM are pretty much on par with oral, but shorter and smoother which sometimes leads to less of a full trip.

Alethia-

Sounds like an intense trip.

And I get that feeling of "impending doom" when a psilacetin trip goes south... and I always feel like I am in a very very familiar place that is not earth. And I always think "why the hell did I come back here"

Couple days ago took 4-Aco-DMT with combination of 4-Aco-MET with a friend of mine and had a really good time!


Subjects: two males, about 170Lbs each, both with extensive psychoactives research over the past 10 years. Previous trip was on 40mg 4-HO-EPT about a week ago. Empty stomach.


Set & setting: With a close friend, in the evening, at home, musical instruments are ready to use, so is painting/drawing station.


Dose (measured on a decent milligram scales with +/- 1mg): 30mg of 4-Aco-DMT and 20mg of 4-Aco-MET for each person, put in separate capsules.


Experience:


T=00:00 - We take both capsules, each of us, at the same time. Say our prayers, start meditating.


T+00:30 - Very light alerts, meditating with eyes closed, I put on sounds of nature - collection of high quality recordings of oceans, rain and so on - sounds great and very atmospheric! 


T+01:00 - Feeling some sedation, typical for 4-Aco-DMT for me. I cant say if Im hot or cold. Body feels trembling. Not too much confusion, no scary feelings at all. I tend to close my eyes for the most time. Deciding to play some music on my workstation - feels powerful - complex psychedelic pieces coming out easily. My friend drawing a very cool abstraction meanwhile, he seems preoccupied with the internal vision emerging.


T+01:30 - Starting to feel that my mind is drifting away, my mind's eye is getting filled with complex multi-colored visuals, mostly consisting of heavily distorted and modified bright mental images that were just flooding out my inner vision. Feeling a bit cold but comfortable. Switching to my acoustic guitar and my friend takes over the keyboard workstation.

Smoked some cannabis and that intensified the visuals and the overall trip intensity.


T+02:00 - Feels like we are about to peak! The trip is mostly dominated by seriousness of 4-Aco-DMT but modified in a pleasant way by 4-Aco-MET - the visuals have more variety and some sort of dreaminess to them, OEVs only consisted of some color amplification and shadow movements but CEVs - OH MY!.. Colors were predominantly greys, dark reds, dark blues, purples, complex shades of black, golden glowing colors! ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) Visuals are not like I've seen on 4-Aco-MET or 4-Aco-DMT by themselves, nothing similar to mushrooms as well, they are quite unique and definitely have hyperspace quality to them.


T+02:30 - I'm on a floor laying on my back with eyes closed, I'm hugging my guitar that is hooked up through some filters to the sound system - sounds like Jimi Hendrix himself got into me and is making me do those insanely crazy solos, Ive never played like that! ![:!](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/argh.gif) My friend is on the workstation synthesizer playing along and both of us sound so amazing and in tune! A brief thought of starting the monitoring recording while we play entered my mind but was swept away in a matter of seconds - I was simply unable to open my eyes at that moment to do anything and I was constantly being swept by the overflow of images and emotions going through me per second...8( 

Even with eyes closed I see my fingers and they look like fat multi-colored glowing sticks!

My acoustic Breedlove guitar feels like an alien woman to me screaming and whispering, making all that weird sounds it feels like I'm making love to her - such an exctatic feeling! "Impossible" states of mind, beyond comprehension, bordering with insanity...

I feel incredibly high, time is heavily dilated, my ego feels intact (maybe due to 4-Aco-MET addition), although being "observed" and "judged" by some higher authority within myself.


T+03:30?? - Found some holophonics recordings on the computer and hooked up a couple of headphones - listening to those recordings under the influence is quite a powerful experience! Especially the virtual haircut - I swear I saw the plastic bag getting over my head with just sounds triggering it. I highly recommend checking it out for those interested in sounds and music!


T+04:00 - Emotional lability, bursting into tears with realization of how cruel I am to the people who love me...![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) Very deep understanding, I am making up quite an emotional song - playing on a guitar along, asking God why are we so ignorant, asking to give us strength and wisdom to be better and cleaner in our perceptions. Cant remember both the lyrics and the chords progression I was using unfortunately...

My friend's dog (huge good looking great dane) is sleeping nearby and I'm deciding to lay next to that black and white spotted body. Simple acknowledgement of another living being, a huge one too, different than myself but wanting similar things in life, making me burst into tears again.


T+04:40 - CEVs are pretty much muted at this point so we decide to smoke cannabis and chill out, lots of cannabis - feels very nice! :D Light lingering headache is spotted at this point.

Definite psychedelic state with a nice afterglow setting in. No appetite.

A friend of mine is starting to tell me that he would need to go to the DMV and take care of his lost title soon and it sounds like it's suppose to be something serious but I cant control myself and burst into uncontrollable laughing! It was just so hilarious to hear about some car title at that moment - it seems absolutely absurd, ridiculous and stupid, and funny - so we both laugh hysterically at this for a good 20 minutes. Similar things usually happen to me when on mushrooms.


T+05:30 - Going outside now. Made some rolls with cannabis and some with tobacco. Walking at night in a wintery settings feels very nice. I feel a great calm and feeling of serenity and acceptance. My friend makes a remark that smoking tobacco when tripping is like opening your body and mind to great spirits for evaluation - I like that!


T+06:00 - Time for some food and aftertrip beer! Food tastes normal, beer feels really good! Watching Rick and Morty and still feeling quite high...


T+07:00 - A really nasty headache had developed, very similar to the one I get from a hefty dosage of 2C-P. So I take 400mg Ibuprofen, 200mg 5HTP and some activated turmeric extract to help with that. Sleep was achieved within an hour or so. Vivid dreams and feeling refreshed upon awakening.


Conclusion: This time I went for a higher dosage, the previous ones being 15 and 22mg. Addition of 20mg of 4-Aco-MET smoothed the "judging" effect of 4-Aco-DMT as I was hoping for, added to euphoria and gave another depth to visuals but could have caused a headache as well. Playing guitar with eyes closed was EPIC, better in these terms than most of my LSD trips. 

4-Aco-DMT imo is best enjoyed with eyes closed, obviously being somewhere comfortable and warm. I feel that the molecule has a "fire" spirit, especially combined with 4-Aco-MET which I think has an "air" spirit.


Overall a great combination, next time I'll be trying 40mg 4-Aco-DMT with 15mg 4-Aco-MET! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Yesterday, I took 60 mg of 4-AcO-DMT. I have not taken any drug well over a year, except my daily 8 mg suboxone maintenance which allowed me to finally make something of my life.


I went back to school, I’m currently studying analytical chemistry and I would like to push further to university to work in the field of research in chemistry. I am currently on my winter vacation. I decided to have this experience to revitalize myself, to experience profound emotions and transcendence. This is why I opted for a rather high dose.


After my room-mate left, I drank a magic orange juice and I decided to sit to meditate. The effects came on pretty fast, in about 10 minutes. As I tried to focus on my breathing, I just ended up unable to do so, but rather, I focused on the visuals. They were extremely intense. Sometimes, it just didn’t made any sense and then all of a sudden it became indescribably beautiful and kind of zoomed on some elements and took me further.


My thoughts were filled with beautiful things being said to me. I was being told not to change anything I was doing right now, that it was perfect. It also wanted  me to remember that I am a loved person. Countless times, I was remembered not to forget I was loved. It was the main message. And somehow, as the visuals got the most intense, it was like being show about that love or experiencing it. And then I was like "Is it asking too much to be shown once again?" and it would answer "You ask a lot! But since we like you, we will show you again".


After a while, I decided to lay down on my bed and I thought it was kind of over. I was wrong! I putted my headphones and decided to listen to Shpongle, the Museum of Consciousness, which I had never heard. And then it became quite crazy. The visuals were so powerful that it made no difference if my eyes were open or not. I felt like I had accessed to a multidimensional kind of reality and I was being show around and that I was at that point in reality were things are not material, from which point consciousness create our reality. If that makes any sense.


I was also told at some point about a girl I like. I was told that she was totally into me, dying for me to ask her out. It said I should just go on with my plan, get a couch for the apartment so she can sit next to you, ask her for a movie. There was also a moment I was told I would become a father. Now I am really curious to see how it turns if I date that girl? And me being a father would make me very honored.


Of course, like any profound psychedelic experience, it’s hard to seize it, but I really got what I wanted. I have no desire to take anything else, I just want to keep going with what makes my life better. I think maybe once or twice (or just none) every year or so, it can be a good idea to have a psychedelic experience.


I took it at 1pm and it lasted all afternoon and I was still having minor visuals when I went to bed at midnight. Took me a bit of time to fall asleep but slept well. I am in shape today, but maybe a little tired.

Finally got to try this last night at ~18mg. I'd read about the possibility of sedating effects, but I wasn't expecting them to be that intense! Could hardly walk straight - even getting a glass of water took quite a bit of effort. I spent most of the trip lying on my couch. Not that I found that aspect unpleasant, it just took me by surprise [edit: never yawned so much on any drug - even alcohol!]. I ended up sleeping like a rock and had a hard time getting out of bed, although I feel pretty good.


Does the sedation get more pronounced with higher doses?

For me at higher doses it gets more of a dreamy head space to it where it feels relaxing and and kind of dream/sedating type of feel. I always come up fast and hard on this. The first 2 hrs usually are intense and i feel better just laying there checking out thr CEV. Then it mellows out for the next couple hrs and is like a regular trip. I havent done it in a while but its the only psych that produces that body buzz sensation thats very euphoric in a deep way for me . ofcourse dmt does that also. Im accustom to that clean clear ald-52 body load these days. My recent 4-aco-dmt trip was uncomfortable with the intense body buzzing and dmt'ish quality.

Yeah I also find the first couple of hours to be very intense with this.  To me the first part feels like oral smoked DMT - it has the same high-frequency buzzing and discombobulating effects, and chaotic headspace, but obviously isn't nearly as fast or overwhelming as actually smoking DMT.  I find it rather uncomfortable and quite socially difficult.  Then the second half feels very much like mushrooms, it really changes gears.

It was a long time since my last time with 4-aco-dmt, but yesterday I decided to take 23mg. 


That was intense as fuck, I was in the verge of a bad trip for 2 hours because of the body load, I had stomach pain, yawning, nausea, tremors, and a lot of peeing and shitting was done. What a purge! The trip itself was very soft, without nearly visuals, and once the body load subsided I was left with a lot of thought loops, and was drifting between closed and open eyes, with a lot of body temperature fluctuations, and without beeing able to focus on anything. 


It was nice, I needed something like that as I was abusing the shit out of my stash lately and the 4-aco-dmt showed me that I need to take a break. But for recretional purposes 4-ho-met is better, and I missed combining this with a disso in order to don't give a fuck about the body load.

My only experience with this was 30 mg and it was enjoyable as fuck, very intense indeed. I had a friend next to me "trip sitting" which probably made it less intense than I wanted but yeah, I want to try this again. Preferably with a dissociative!

I have always been a big fan of this one but after taking 20mg of 4-aco-dmt with 15mg of 4-aco-met in combination I will never take either alone again. Tears of joy, euphoria and rushes like I have never experienced before on any substance in the past 15 years of experimenting. Was a perfect dose for me but as will all combos ensure you are experienced with both first. I personally can't see myself having a bad one on this but it could be overwhelming in the wrong setting. I will be try this at lower dosages at a festival.

Yeah I combined 4-AcO-DMT (35mg) and 4-HO-MET (10mg) once and it was one of the best trips ever, so enveloping and euphoric and dreamy.

It was actually your post that inspired me to try the two aco's together, I found they fit so well. It was the euphoria that made this one an unforgettable experience. I have pushed MDMA to silly levels as a naive teen and never felt like that.  I also felt slightly disassociated.


Hi I will try it with 4-HO-MET as well but I find the come up a bit more jarring with the 4-HO. Too many possible ratios, not enough time. 


I have been been trying to find a suitable way to find the best ratio for these combos but there are too many variables.

How does tolerance with this work? Can it be dosed consecutive days? Is it just a matter of needing a larger dose, or does the experience qualitatively change if you don't give your brain a chance to recalibrate between experiences?

I think you knew all the answers already ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


-Similar tolerance to those of mushrooms or acid and observed cross-tolerance to other psychedelics.

-You can dose on consecutive days but it will require upping the dosage.

-The experience will be qualitatively diminished if taking on consecutive days, especially after breakthrough trips.

I took 15mg yesterday sublingually but it felt underwhelming so I redosed +30mg insufflated three hours later, the trip was very good at that point and lasted a solid 4 hours. Is it normal that 45mg had a moderate effect on me? This is 4-AcO-DMT fumarate from **<snip>**. It felt just like mushrooms to me but I don't feel the magical afterglow today. I suppose this has to do with the other tryptamines/alkyloids in mushrooms. Oh well, at least there's no nausea.

Please, no sourcing **Hyperflux**, I suggest correcting your post ASAP!


Also, its not unusual to be a hard head for certain psychedelics, could also have something to do with what you ate that day and how your immune system was, e.t.c.


Next time I'd suggest  for you to take 30-35mg orally dissolved in acidic juice if you want effects to come in faster and stronger! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

What's the tolerance like with 4-AcO-DMT and compared with other lysergamides 7 days later? Do you simply need to take 120% of the original dose to get the same effect as per the logarithmic chart on Bluelight?

Probably something like that, but that won't guarantee "the magic", which usually just needs time to replenish.

Can someone describe the dose response curve and what's considered a low, medium, and high dose? I haven't taken more than 15mg, and I wonder how much more intense it gets? Do higher doses make the body load better or worse? I IVed 13mg and that was really fucking intense. What do you think the equivalent of that would be for an oral dose?

What do you mean by "the magic", is this just a subjective effect or is it a real objective effect? I dosed 45mg nine days ago and 72mg a couple days ago (both insufflated), I didn't perceive any loss in "magic". The 72mg dose should have felt like ~60mg, and I think that was correct based on subjective experience. It lasted longer than usual though, 7 hours even though I snorted it. I also took curcumin and noopept that day though so maybe it has something to do with it.

Of course "The magic" is a pretty subjective term. 

It is generally noted that for most people, the more often you trip the less "meaningful" the trips feel. You can up the dose and consistently get visuals, music enhancement, pleasurable body sensations, thoughtloops, mindfuck, you name it ... 

But the sense of wonder and radical perspective shifts become rarer if you keep tripping regularly. 


Most people cite a month in between  trips to keep them feeling insightful, in my personal experience even tripping once a month for an extended period ends up making the psychedelic experience feel trivial. Taking breaks here and there is adviced, I took three months off tripping and had a pretty nice comeback a few days ago.

I understand the loss of magic, but can't say i've ever acutely noticed it even with a high frequency of tripping. I've noticed it can happen easily with 'Ecstasy' but then again, if my most magical roll was on a pill with 100mg MDMA, 90mg MDA and 10mg methamp, and then i take a 200mg MDMA pill it will certainly feel less magical. 


4-aco-dmt seems to retain it's effect profile really well for me, I can theoretically dose several times a week and have great experiences, whereas with LSD the second trip in a week will provide a nasty body load trip.

Anyone experience brain zaps and or feeling like you may pass out? Iv heard that passing out on mushrooms does happen fairly often just havnt heard the same with this. I really want to push this one further (been up to 30mg) but the last time I kept getting brain zaps and extreme light headedness and dizziness. 


I love the short duration of this one and find it has given me some of the most significant trips but Im quite worried that if I push it much higher there may be a chance i could have some sort of siezure or worse. 


Incase it matters, the material I have is quite degraded and looks like black tar. Still just as potent as white powder batches I've tried.


Any info on this?

I've heard that when 4-aco-dmt turns dark, it's actually already turned into psilocin. Gonna need someone to back me up / correct me on that, though.

Years and years back I received a gram of 4-AcO-DMT from a great vendor at the time. I stupidly set the bag down on the counter where I'd just had a water cup and bam, water seeping into the bag instantly. As I freaked out I managed to isolate the 1/10 of a gram that was wet into a little paper boat container I made, followed by stashing it away in my closet, imagining it was a goner and I'd just squirrel it for science. Well a year later I ended up finding it again, weighing it to find that yes it was 95mg, and then thinking it's totally degraded insufflated the entire amount. Turns out it hadn't degraded, or at least much, and I ended up having one of the strongest trips of my life. Visual insanity followed by clarity but a total loss of sense of being human, instead running around my house on all fours, imitating animals, etc. Not that I wasn't a human or was an animal, simply that all human pre-conception had disappeared, allowing me to feel as if I was no different than an animal. It was insanity to say the least.


Edit: it was dark grey when dosed

Similarly, my degraded tarry 4-ho-met had me speaking in tongues to Mount Rushmore in my living room for several hours at least. I felt the unmistakable presence of some ancient pterodactyl-lizard dinosaur manwoman with fantastical electric beams pulsating around me in rhythm. 


It's something i'd like to repeat as soon as possible.

I tried to smoke some 4-aco-dmt fumarate last night. Total waste. Got some weird tension in my head, and a slightly altered headspace. Maybe it would've worked better if I converted it to freebase, idk. just putting this here in case any future psychonaughts google something along the lines of smoking or vaping 4-aco-dmt. don't bother, imo.


on the other hand, IVing it can be fucking intense. Do not attempt unless you are well versed in the ways of tryptamines. Later on this week, I'll report back with what IMing 4-aco-dmt is like.

I'd really like to IM the tryptamines. Unfortunately the sources aren't really pure or sterile enough for me to be comfortable putting them directly in my body like that. I hope you're using filters Dronelore!

IV is intense. It's something I tried and haven't done again in a while. After he last time I did 4-aco-dmt iv, the experience was so intense and overwhelming, beautiful, complex, and also somewhat difficult. I haven't felt any need to do it again since. 

If you are going to choose IM for ROA, you need to make sure your gear is sterile, new. Use bacteriostatic water, and you need a 0.2 filter, using cotton for filtering is really not ideal when planning an intramuscular injection.  IM is not as intense as IV, but it's a lot more risky, and you put yourself at risk for a possible abscess.

Most people really don't like the idea of plugging, but it's safer than IM and it's very similar to it as well.

Why do you prefer plugged? I use that ROA mostly to shorten the come up and/or reduce bodyload with substances that can be problematic in that regard, like AMT or 2C-E. But that doesn't really seem necessary with the 4 sub tryptamines I have tried, so I just eat them. I did try plugging 4-AcO-DMT once, I remember that it came on very fast, almost uncomfortably fast, but I guess some could see that as a positive. Or is it more about saving material that way? I don't really remember how the doses compared.

I prefer 4-sub-trypts orally to any other route, but various phenethylamines I like better plugged.  One advantage that plugging has for most things (including tryptamines) is to reduce the dose by around half.  For some reason, AMT requires around the same dose plugged though.

I wasn't so much making a declaration as to the best ROA in general but in reply to the ongoing IV/IM conversation and the mention of plugging as an alternative by MocCozmiK. It's definitely not the same brevity as either, but it still compares relative to oral dosing.


I pretty much only plug tryptamines when I'm looking for shorter experiences, usually due to dosing later in the day, or want to induce a visionary experience with a small dose and shamanic journeying.

I get the feeling that base tryptamines may not share such high bio-availability plugged as their 4 or 5 sub counterparts. DPT requires a much closer to oral than insufflated dose when plugged as well.

A couple weeks ago I went on a 3 day psychedelics bender (not advised). Towards the end my tolerance was fairly ridiculous, even adding 300ug LSD plus 25mg 2c-b at that point did very little. The final thing to come out of my stash that weekend was my 4aco-dmt. I ate 30mg expecting almost nothing due to the extremely high tolerance at this point. To my surprise I began to feel that tryptamine vibe along with that tactile DMT-esque body / buzz within about 15 minutes. Everywhere I looked seemed to be illuminated with a bright golden/orange light along with intricate, shifting fractal like holograms playing out in front of my eyes in 3D. I passed out around hour 3 into the 4aco-dmt however I had been awake for around 36 hours at this point and I find 4aco-dmt trips to be quite sedating.


Just goes to show that even after stupidly pushing the bounds of psychedelic combinations and redosing over the space of a few days, 4aco-dmt can still deliver an ass whooping!

Regarding ROA, I have not found much advantage with plugging vs oral, and actually my fastest come up and strongest trip was 30mg oral, with the gooey brown gunk variant (I recall speculation of psilacetin hydrolizing to psilocin). I knew it was no average trip just 20 minutes after ingesting it inside a capsule. It's just so much easier to eat the stuff that I see no point in plugging it.

The stuff I have used in the recent past is the same. Almost hash oil consistency but very potent. It seems to come on very fast and leave quite quickly to. Im very interested in what 4-aco-dmt degrades into and what the effects are of degraded material compared to fresh white (or off grey) 4-aco-dmt.

Does anyone else experience breathing problems with this stuff when mixing with other 4-sub tryptamines? Overall, I think psilacetin is a great drug, but I've had a few experiences now when mixing with miprocin in particular that startled me a bit.


I think it comes down to the fact that psilacetin pretty much puts me to sleep (especially taken in the evening), but miprocin keeps me awake, and they both dehydrate me after awhile. When I mix the two, I want to just lie down and close my eyes as is typical with the psilacetin. The experience is nice, as the miprocin enhances the CEVs and gives a nice body high, which creates an excellent dreamlike scenario.


I'll try to explain the breathing issue:


I'll find myself in a state where I feel like I nearly stop breathing, or maybe my heart rate slows down enough to barely notice it? It can feel like I start to astrally project in a way but I stop myself from leaving my body, wake up, and feel like I've had to catch my breath, then clear my throat, drink some water and all is good. That's while lying on my back.


While lying on my stomach, I get a similar sensation to feeling like I've stopped breathing, and find myself starting to wander mentally as if being drifted away somewhere... but I'll have enough trouble just swallowing saliva around this point that it forces me to sit up, clear my throat, and drink some water. Once or twice I've felt something like an air/gas bubble in my throat that eventually pops and allows my breathing to return to normal.


Has anyone else experienced anything like this? It did give me a bit of anxiety but after the peak wears off it becomes much less of an alarming thing, thinking about what happened. I suppose if I was on something that actually put me to sleep or caused me to blackout I would have more to worry about, but since I'm fully aware of my body and mind while this happens, I can just wake up and stop it from getting worse.


Secondly, if this is related to astral projection, and for those that have experienced that, I guess I should not be waking myself out of that state to fully experience it? It seems that if astral projection is going to happen, I need to be lying on my back for it. I do feel an intense energy above my body when this happens, almost like I'm starting to get sucked up into a vortex, which is why I liken it to astral projection. I've never actually experienced that, but have read about it, and this is probably the closest I've come to it.

Never experienced any breathing problems on this in any sort of combo including with other tryptamines, or on any tryptamine.  That's odd, I can see why you'd be concerned though.

**indigowizard**, I've had similar breathing problems on Miprocin itself and with combinations. I still cant figure out what causes it exactly, as sometimes with the same dosage I'd get completely different results. Also Miprocin causes the most stomach gas of all the tryptamines I think. Try preloading with Simethicone - antibloating agent, seems to work for me.


So I don't think the breathing issues are 4-AcO-DMT related. Although on vaporized DMT I sometimes wonder if I'm breathing at all, but thats different I guess...

Thanks Volsam. Now that I think about it, it is possible that miprocin alone causes it, I just don't remember it being very noticeable on its own. The psilacetin seems to make it worse, but probably because I lie on my stomach more after I've taken it. So if it is related to stomach gas, that makes sense to me. I used to get a lot of acid reflux and that was always at its worst when I was on my stomach.


The sensation of wondering if I'm even still breathing I believe is something different, but it's weird that they happen to sync up like that. It only happens when I've allowed myself to completely relax and mentally start drifting away. Then it's almost like the fear of dying snaps me out of that state and I feel the need to gasp for air. The rest of the time I don't experience any breathing difficulty or heart problems and have otherwise enjoyed each trip.

If anyone is interested, I wrote a trip report focused on comparing 4-AcO-DMT to the rest of the synthetic 4-substituted tryptamines, particularly 4-HO-MET:

Thanks TAC, will read. I was just thinking how my perception of 5-ACO-DMT has so drastically changed after a trip last weekend that obliterated the quality of the last material I had used. I classify it now as the most DMT-like of the 4-subs, perhaps fittingly. Super like.

^^ Absolutely, 4-AcO-DMT is very like DMT for me, much moreso than 4-HO-DMT is or mushrooms are.

Totally agree as well. I combo’d this At the weekend, 20mg 4-AcO-MET and 25mg 4-AcO-DMT and had a very nice DMT like experience, visual very similar but as someone has mentioned before here slower.


Had faint entity contact and saw a little of Hyperspace when I focussed on it, got this idea in my head that I should be able to break through on this combo. Not sure where it came from but I found myself willing it mentally. Saw those spinning geometric 3D, 4D shapes which I call the gears of the universe. 


I love this combo for euphoria, really nice. Also my recent DMT adventures had left me with very brief episodes of anxiety and the combo above has cured that. 


Feel awesome and reset this week.


going to have a little break now and integrate these amazing experiences.

This one is like DMT to me, but not completely overwhelming and immersive (well... maybe... but not quite DMT), I can still think on it at least some of the time... I like to keep my eyes open at least half the time haha. DMT I cannot do that. This one still lays me out though, I prefer to lay down for heavier trips on it. It reminds me of nothing whatsoever like shrooms, but reminiscent (still very different) of DMT. I like DMT way more haha but this stuff is nice too... I like to rail it (very lightly... it is like chalk, with no burn, but hits in 10 min... nice harsh comeup that way).

Oh my dear lord this is by far my favorite psychadelic. Took a 35mg dose and on the comedown it feels like my body has been through the ringer. I am completely exhausted. Wow

It's absolute gold, I adore the stuff. It just seems to be the perfect combination of sedation and alertness. I have had some really fun nights with low doses going to gigs and stuff. Makes me pretty sociable and makes me dance like a nutter which is always good.


The fumerate seems pretty stable. Had some in a cupboard for a few years and had a dose in my wallet for a month or so with not much drop in potency.

50mg oral


The last few times I've taken this, I've been visited by a gnome, of my own interpretation.


I reach out for psilacetin when I've been having trouble sleeping. I figure the way it rebalances my energy is more beneficial than tossing and turning for a few hours, then maybe catching a few hours of undisturbed sleep.


The gnome comes during the first hour, when I start to feel the effects of the drug. I'll be lying down with my eyes closed. Then I'll see a light, this time it had a bit of a golden hue. It's also humming a tune or something like that.


I'll feel it attach to me in the front of my body, then work it's way up and down several times. I can feel a vibration of energy as it's moving around. This lasted for not more than a minute, before it felt like it was pulled back by some ethereal tether. The light vanished, as well as the tune.


I get the impression that it comes to do a job, then leaves when the job is finished.


When it departed, my dog who was sleeping near me, seemed to be startled by something. I don't know if it felt it, or saw it, and maybe even scared it away.


There also seemed to be some commotion with the electrical system in my house when it left. There was so much going on in that moment, that it was hard to pay attention to what that was about to really go into any further detail. It may have just been a coincidence.


I wish that I could experience things like this without the drugs.

For me, I find that the effects are very consistent:

OEVs are subtle  but cool, especially when looking at things like leg hair or fabric or  stucco, which appear more patterned and shifty.

CEVs can be  controlled with some effort at lower doses but at the peak of most trips  have been completely beyond me. Sometimes they are the multicolored 2D  or 3D shapes of psychedelia but it's even more frequently the case that  they're constructed from memories of iconic things such as cartoon  characters or well-known people's faces.

Body feel is pleasantly warm and a bit tingly when staying perfectly still, but I sometimes get chilly and antsy on the come-up.

Libido  increases, but orgasms are suppressed quite a bit. Luckily, it often  causes sexual stimulation to be satisfying even without orgasm.

Anxiety  is common during the come-up, balanced out nicely by an anti-depressant  effect which extends for hours after the trip is over. Thought-loops  are frequent throughout. Philosophical thinking is frequent and easier.

At  the peak of some intense (50 mg) trips, both good and bad, I have lost  bladder control. Since then, I try to spend peaks in the shower (which  is a nice place to be while tripping).

Some time midway through the  come-up, I will notice a faint violin-like noise in the far distance.  This is variously either without a source, or "constructed" from other  ambient sounds like AC or plumbing. It lasts for hours after the other  effects of the trip, much like the anti-depressant effect. It gives the  impression of a "cinematic score", which fits well with the impression  that my trip is a scene in a film.

I am super talkative on this stuff! It's fun to describe everything that's happening, everything I'm thinking... it makes me look pretty unhinged.

This is a great drug, it shines in all dosages.


Great & easy for microdosing (2-3 mg), I also loving taking 5-10 mg for hanging out with friends or even a party, it makes me very sociable and makes for excellent and funny conversations.

From about 15mg you enter tripping territory, it reminds of quite a lot of mushrooms, but still noticeably different. I've gone up to 50 mg a couple of times which for me never was as intense as I've seen/heard other people have, but still an amazing time.


I saw someone say this one has a sinister vibe, which I don't find is the case. 4-Aco-DMT makes you face your problems right on though, so be prepared ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).

But apart from that it has a very natural, clear, emotional and euphoric feel to it.


When I find the time I'm going to combine this with my last LSD tabs ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I know of a vendor that's about to start selling 4-AcO-DMT freebase. Has anyone ever smoked 4-AcO-DMT before? I guess it might be similar to IVing it which I have read about in a few trip reports.

Anyone have a good time mixing this with Syrian rue? My regular 4-ACO-DMT dose is 40-75mg, usually split into two doses on the higher end. I took about 3.5grams syrian rue and 30 mg of 4-ACO-DMT.


I tried the same with about 40 mg of MET with little effect. I'm not sure if I have a freebase or a salt. Havent heard from the vendor. Has anyone tried this?


I am a 170lb male with a moderate and manageable tolerance to psychedelics.

Got an email from the one of the places that sells the tryptamines that the people who make the tryptamines make... they said 4-AcO-DMT will not be made again.  My guess would be concern over such a close analogue of psilocin.  I actually have long been surprised that 4-AcO-DMT hasn't been banned everywhere.  Anyway, sad news.  I suppose it could still be made by others but my guess is that most of these tryptamines are ultimately coming from one source, now that China banned most of that stuff.

Had a feeling this was going to happen eventually and it's really sad thing to see. That's one of the staples in the RC Scene and it's been around forever as you mentioned. But like you said where there's a will there is a way. I'm sure that it will be synthed again due to its popularity much like 2C-E has been despite its illegality in most locals.


But yeah concerning the comments surrounding it lately id suggest stocking up cheaply while you can. Keep the stuff on Ice and don't use it to often. There is alot of Psychedelics from my youth id like to acquire again but it's become quite difficult, not letting that happen to one of my favorites. This is some really sad stuff to hear Xorky.

4 Pro DMT got the axe as well I believe. One vendor up here even raised the price per gram of 4 aco dmt by 50% of their old price.


I find I get the same effects from 4 ho met anyways. I just have to dose high enough

Man, I've been trying to get the guts to order this stuff for YEARS now!


Honestly (and I am NOT asking for sources) the biggest reasons I haven't done it yet have mainly just to do with the fact that I don't know how to use Bitcoin or the deep web and it seems like mostly RCs like this are not sold on the clear net and it seems like it would be hard to learn how to use Bitcoin and the deep web and I'd rather just be able to quickly order this stuff easily with a credit card and not have to figure out all sorts of crap and jump through hoops to figure out how to get it.


I wonder if maybe I think it's harder to learn that stuff than it is, or maybe it is in fact available on the clear net, but again, I'm not asking anyone to tell me.


I guess I'm just venting.


I hope I can eventually get myself to just spend the time and figure out how to place an order for this stuff and figure out what all the fuss is about as it sounds like a good psychedelic, especially since it is supposed to be similar to shrooms and I love shrooms but can never find them.


Edit, although now I guess you guys are saying this stuff is hard to get suddenly.


I just need to get a new place where I can get a set up to grow my own shrooms and then have a whole bunch to enjoy myself with.

Even clearnet vendors use bitcoin only now, it's been that way a while.  But I'll just say I have a collection of about 60 psychedelic RCs and have never used the dark web.


Bitcoin is not hard to do, but it just takes sitting down and learning.  It's not intuitive, but once you know what to do, it's just following steps.


I find 4-AcO-DMT to feel like a slow release smoked DMT experience during the come-up/peak, and then it switches gears to be almost exactly like mushrooms for the plateau.  They're definitely different for me, some people find them indistinguishable.

The global producer of the (sort of legal) lysergamides in Holland has just announced it has added 4-Aco-Dmt to it's catalogue.


So it may now appear a little more widely, lots of Dutch vendors will stock it I expect. One in particular, I got some 4-Ho-Mipt from them a few months ago via bank transfer, so I'm hoping they will grab some from the Reptiles.


But yes I'm with you on the bitcoin. I know it is pretty straight forward but it's still buggles and intimidates me, large sheep though because my brain function is so heavily compromised as a result of illness and injury.  Just getting my head around really basic practical things is often too much for me.


I dont even have any ID. Fortunately I have been able to acquire all of my recent lysergamide purchases from Germany paying by bank transfer. This is still an option for me so for the meantime there is no urgent need to become bitcoin competent.


It is a fear I would like to face and overcome though, to at least have that option.


Edit- ok I just checked because I was a little uncertain that I had gotten that exactly right and it appears I may have gotten modelled one late stay and evening recently.


The Reptiles didn't actually announce anything regarding 4-aco DMT. I did receive a newsletter email from them recently regarding new products.


And then when I was looking on their website I I saw 4-aco DMT included in the products they offer.


I just checked through their catalogue now and I could not see 4-aco DMT anywhere but I could have sworn I did see it in there recently to see what prices they pass it on for but I could have imagined this.

WHAT THE FUCK !!??


Just had my second +4 experience on that compound taken rectally. There is something about this ROA with this drug. It feels like a completely different drug when taken this way. It brings me to that " place ", a very dark but very beautiful place, so beautiful it brings tears to my eyes just thinking about it. I have never smoked DMT but from what I read this seems to be a similar experience but stretched over an hour instead of a few minutes. 


The pharmacology of this drug is very puzzling because I only get this type of effect with the rectal route. Even other routes that bypass first pass metabolism like nasal or even subcutaneous injection do not get me " there ". Maybe I.V. does but I am not sure I am ready for that just yet.


Anyway, this is a truly amazing drug. To attain such levels of psychedelia, depth and ego dissolution with so little anxiety or body load is truly remarquable. The +4 experience has never been so in reach. The dosage for this experience was 30-35 mg.

Would you even think of suggesting this to someone who really dislikes the feeling of downers (opiates, weed, alcohol) and someone that really struggles to get through a couple much lighter tryptamine come-ups do to the stoning qualities of them?


It sounds great, but I just don't think I would like the stoning qualities that this possesses. Obviously, some people feel no load, but lots of people say it's the heaviest there is.

Tryptamines (and no psychedelic for that matter) is stoning to me. Maybe to some degree, but I always want to use my body, and go see or do things.

I've never touched opiates but I very much doubt the 'stoning' character is comparable to that of downers, more like you don't want to move. It's no reason not to try this gem of a drug imo ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Well when I say no bodyload I mean negative feelings in the body. 4-aco-dmt does have a very strong and very stoning body high but I find it very confortable euphoric and relaxing similar to an opioid nod in a sense. If you can't stand other tryptamines because of the stoning body buzz this one is maybe not for you. With that said I find it feels different from the other 4-X-tryptamines. It is less edgy. I guess you have to try to find out. I have yet to hear anybody say they disliked this drug because of the body effects. It is usually the mental intensity that scare people off from this one. Try a low dose it will give you an idea how it feels.

Hey guys & gals, has anyone ever heard of people fainting from 4-aco-dmt fumarate?


Had 3 friends recently take 20mg each of a new tan colored batch, smaller female, average weight male and a larger guy. They all started tripping very hard by about 90 minutes in, and after that the female started fainting in and out of consciousness. The other two felt light headed as well, and they eventually all went to the hospital to be on the safe side.


The capsules were within a milligram or two of 20mg and confirmed the scale was on point. No medications or other drugs involved. 4aco is from a reputable vendor & tested with GCMS, and additionally I've had it tested twice using FTIR. Average weight male is a veteran psychedelic user and has done 4 aco about 10 times before (of a previous, brown batch) and gotten expected results, this trip he described as vastly stronger than those experiences.


I'm totally baffled. Only possibilities I can think of are:

- smaller female was a bit anxious going into the trip. I have seen people & groups of people think they're going to trip really hard, or the opposite and lo and behold that's what happens. Perception is reality. But fainting seems like quite an extreme reaction to me, well beyond the possibility of any self induced placebo effect.

- are there differences in the isomer ratios of different 4 aco dmt batches? Perhaps certain synthesis routes produce much different 4 aco?

- I know psychedelics in general are fairly unpredictable, but is 4 aco just inherently ridiculously all over the place in terms of the strength of trip? I've personally always found it reasonably consistent and gentle in my adventures with it.


Anyone have any ideas?

I haven't fainted from it, but I do find it very sedating.  I can see being overwhelmed and falling over.  So one person fainted?  Do you know if she has blood pressure issues?  I feel lightheaded every time I do 4-AcO-DMT, it's part of the first half of the experience, it's why I always sit or lay down until the peak passes.

What was the set and setting?


What was the outcome of their hospital visits?


I also find 4-AcO-DMT sedating, and will generally take it when I can lie down. It also seems to have a bit of a reverse tolerance for me. When I first started taking it, it was recreational and tolerable. I could stay up and watch a movie, have a conversation, etc. Then it became more therapeutic, where I could feel it recharging and rebalancing my energy centers. Now it just continues to get weirder and weirder. Each new experience is like peeling back layers of an onion. Sometimes it will throw me into a trance like state where I still have control, but feel almost harassed in a way from the effects.


Sometimes it affects me more physically than other times. The more I take it, the less I want to, or anything for that matter. I don't believe this is a good one for recreation, but more of a personal journey tool.


I think 20mg can be strong for some people (especially lighter females). I think my wife liked it best around 10mg when she would take it.

Not blood related, it could be some conditions I don't deny but blackout on mushrooms it's very rarely, at least I didn't met anyone to see with my own eyes. If this happens it could be that the trip was way too hard to handle, as same as some people fall asleep when they smoke green.

I've felt definite changes in my BP on this one. I'm pretty sensitive to those things and take BP medication daily. I've gotten dizzy spells on it a pressure feeling in my head that comes and goes the first couple hours. This has happened a few times but at a point in the Peak it smoothens out and is replaced by a beautiful body high and incredibly intricate geometric paste visuals.


Really love this drug and its why i got a lifetime supply. Prefer it over Mushrooms anyday of the week. With a 3-5mg MacroDose it adds the most pleasing sparkle to your day, like its one of the best you ever had till this one.

I also got some weird physical reactions from a certain vendors product that tends to be clumpy. It seems to get worse the more the product degrades. Have never had degrading issues with batches from another vendor that was nice shiny white crystals. Very clean. Anyway what I am enperiencing when this product gets old is like a sort of allergic reaction like the product becomes irritating or something. I get slight edema all over my body (face, hands and feet a bit swollen/ retaining water). I if I take it intranasally I will get breathing difficulties. I find these effects pretty scary, especially in a psychedelic state where paranoya can set in. Made me panick a few times which sucks because it ruins what would be an amazing experience. It seems to be the product becomes caustic because I get this puffyness when I begin sweating after the peak as if it is my sweat that causes this skin reaction. One time I took some that was really poorly stored rectally and some if the liquid leaked out of my rectum and it was so caustic it caused a painful chemical burn on my buttcheek...


Anyway, can anyone with knowledge in chemistry could tell me if the compound Dimethyl-Fumarate could be forming when the product degrades ? This compound is known to be irritant and cause allergic reactions so I was thinking it could be that.

I agree it is. Other than the weird effects I described in my last post that seem to only arise when the stuff from a certain source degrades (I don't know why but it seems to degrade faster than when I got it from somewhere else).

Theoretically 4-AcO-DMT should degrade into 4-HO-DMT before it breaks down further (I think anyway).  I remember people used to worry that when they ordered 4-AcO-DMT, it would get intercepted and actually have become some part 4-HO-DMT and be schedule 1.

Personally i have had weird blood pressure rises and brief periods of anxiety on it with the same batch as I've had blissful smooth trips. The comeup is always a little jarring for me at 14mgs and above but if i wanna go there i just gotta ride it out till it switched to that sparkly tryptamine euphoria. But these days i tend to take between 7-12mgs and it just creates a beautful day and a lasting anti-deppresent effect that carries through the week.


* want to add i only have BP effects above 14mgs

It doesn't happen every time, but it's why i low-dose*

Have never had degrading issues with batches from another vendor that was nice shiny white crystals. Very clean. Anyway what I am enperiencing when this product gets old is like a sort of allergic reaction like the product becomes irritating or something. I get slight edema all over my body (face, hands and feet a bit swollen/ retaining water). I if I take it intranasally I will get breathing difficulties.

After a while typically this stuff levels out and I've had some beautiful and profound experiences on it. But I'm thinking now could this be a mild allergic reaction of a sort? I'm not sure... would like to know what the colour means though as far as degradation and whether I should be concerned...

I'm not certain color means much if it has always been that color. If it was initially white and changed color over time than yes it could mean the product has undergone some changes chemically. As for the flegm I get a bit of it on most tryptamines but not as much as with this degraded 4-aco. When it is fresh and I unsufflate it it does clog my lungs a bit if powder goes past my sinuses but when degraded it becomes much more caustic and also burns like hell giving me sinusitis sometimes. But the skin reaction only happends when the batch has degraded. I find it interesting you say you only get that from psilocin analogues because it is also the case for me. I had the exact thing I decribed earlier once on 4-pro-dmt. Both having dimethyl is what makes me wonder if the compoud dimethlyfumarate could form when 4-xx-dimethyltryptamine fumarate degrades. I will maybe get 4-aco-dmt freebase and convert it to HCL salt to verify because I have a feeling this has to do with the fumarate type of salt. I may be completely wrong also as I have limited knowledge in chemistry.

I never had blood pressure issues on that or any tryptamine. I think this is diet related because since I cleaned my diet I never get significant rises in blood pressure on any drug. Even on methamphetamine it barely goes up.

I once had dark grey 4-AcO-DMT. It was the little bit of material that had gotten wet in the baggie, been sequestered into a little paper container by me, and then left for 9-12 months. I ended up insufflating all of it - 95mg - thinking it was degraded and nope, not much if any at all. I tripped HARD that day.


I don't know what to say about product that comes that way, though.

Yeah when I talk about degraded product I do not mean it in the sens of potency loss. I guess it probably takes a really long time to get noticeable potency loss. What I mean is a qualitative change as in more side effects, body load, general experience. In fact I think of anything it seems to hit even harder/faster in the beginning of the degradation process probably because of conversion to 4-HO-DMT. I'm not sure conversion to 4-HO alone is responsible for all the reactions stated above but I have never tried pure psilocin to compare. I know I never had that with mushrooms.


Never assume potency loss even when the product has changed a lot visually or you haf it for a long time. The post from psy 997 made me think of a similar story that happened to me years ago when I was getting into psychedelics. Someone had given me sugar cubes with a strong dose of LSD which I had only tried once yet at a very low dose. I kept the sugar cubes in my room exposed to air and everything for like a year. On a random weeknight me and the girlfriend I was with at the time decided to take the cubes being sure they had almost completely degraded and we would have a light buzz... Well 45 minutes later we realised that it hadn't loss potency at all... we were scared to death when it came on !

It works very well and is about 50% stronger, faster and last half the duration of oral. It is more DMT ish this way if you dose high enough with crazy visuals and possible entities visiting you. The only thing I find annoying with that is that powder always makes it to my lungs making me cough and wheeze a bit. I would advise dosing rectally for the same king of dosage/experience but much less side effects. I also do it by subcutaneous injection when I have needles and it is similar to rectal so you can also do it this way if you are into that kind of roa. I heard i.v is the shit like a dmt breakthrough that lasts an hour instead of 5 minutes. Never had the balls to try that yet...seems INTENSE.

Here's a small report I recently wrote describing part of an experience I had around 2-3 years ago. I wrote this to compare with another's experience on Reddit, but I figured I would post it here as well, because I'm eager to hear any interpretations of what exactly was happening in my brain. I had eaten something like 120-160 mg 4-ACO-DMT, and I was holing on a hefty dose of some dissociative or other (the time period's right for it to have been diphenidine, but I'm not sure).

For me, the state comprised


- No conception of having/being a body; just point consciousness
- Visual field a uniform nondescript cream color, with alternating red/green pulses (at seizure speed)
- A low, distorted-sounding drone not entirely unlike hypnotoad
- An unyielding and unvarying sensation of severe mind-shattering pain.
- An absolute, unquestionable certainty that this scenario would remain exactly the same forever. To phrase it crudely in math terms: if *U*(*t*) is the state of the universe at time *t*, then I felt it deep inside my bones that *U*(*t* + 1) = *U*(*t*) for all *t*. The experiential system was internally static and there was no link to the universe-at-large (or even a notion of it) to provide a stimulus for perturbing the system.
It's unreal trying to remember experiencing this. My entire conscious mind was consumed by thoughts of *I can't handle this for a single second longer* over and over and over, like all my instincts were urging & begging me to make it stop, take a breath, come back to life, kill myself, do *something* to stop the pain*,* but there was absolutely no way for me to interact with any component of my experience. I don't know how long it went on subjectively, but it essentially felt unending, at least a few subjective hours to whatever degree time had meaning relative to that scenario. Realtime, I think I was holing for around 1-1.5 hours, and of course the first portion of that was occupied with the reality-disintegrating, down-the-drain death spiral narrative hallucination that actually led me to the state I was describing.


I didn't realize this until well after the experience, but from what I've described I think it could easily be framed as a manifestation of "hell", or some other Bad End afterlife. A vivid death hallucination, followed by uniform sensory torture and crippling pain that I knew to be everlasting, though that didn't allow me to resign myself to the experience and I couldn't relieve the pressure to fight to stop it.


On the bright side, in meatspace, I was just sitting down on the couch with my eyes closed and not doing anything stupid. Thanks, dissociatives!


Anyone seen anything with similarities to what I've described?

Damnnn that experience seemed HEAVY !! I had two pretty profound mystical experiences with somewhat high doses taken rectally but the dosages were nowhere as high as yours and there was no dissociatives in the mix. I can't imagine the experience you describe as anything less than totallly overwhelming !

Just had the most terrifying experience of my life....


Word of caution : when injecting I.M or sub-q, alwaus register to make sure there is no blood and you are not hitting a vein.... I should have known that and am not proud of myself to have skipped that step...


So yesterday I had an interview for a promotion at my job that went well so I decided to treat myself with a little 4-aco-dmt. Since it was getting late I decided to take it sub-q for a shorter duration.


So I load up the seringe with 15 mg which is pretty smooth taken sub-q with a potency a bit more than nasal or rectal but not by much. So I insert the seringe under my skin and press the plunger. Than I take it out and realise the shot is like way to clean. With sub-q I always get a lump under my skin after the shot but not this time. Absolutely no lump and no burn... I was like FUCK, I must have shot it directly in a vein. And from what I had read 4-aco I.V is another beast in intensity.


So I raced to my bed to lay down and turned off the lights but I was not prepared for what was about to happend. I was assaulted by the most chaotic and menacing soup of visuals I had ever had. Eyes opened or closed was the same. I could not even umderstand where I was in space, where was up, down, left or right.


So I stumbled around in my appartment to find a light switch which was very very difficult. When I finally got to the light switch I though turning on the lights would calm things down. Boy was I wrong... my appartment looked like a fucking doll house and everything looked like it was made from cheap plastic. Even my dog looked like a toy (thank god I had my dog as it was the only confirmation I was still alive.)


Then I looked in the mirror and was pupils were bigger than I have ever seen them but the scary part is I looked swollen all over, my fingers looked like water balloons ( I think it was the visuals but it looked very real at the time). I was like fuck thats it im foing to die ita a matter of time before the edema makes my brain swell and kill me. Anyway I was able to remain fairly calm and tried to find a solution to end this but had intermittent waves of total panic and had a hard time thinking straight. I was dancing in my appartment while thinking because I thought moving would get rid of the edema.


Fuck, I had no benzos left I took my last one the day before for the interview. Than in an act of god I remembered I had a few seroquels in y drawer which were very very difficult to find. Found one and munched it and it reduced the intensity but not that much bit enough that I could think straight and find the 3 other ones which I munched immediately. I slowly came back to reality over the next hour.


So yeah, this kind of dumb mistake always remind's me that harm reduction steps should never be skipped no matter how experienced you are. Today I am feeling fine and no sign of any lasting trauma so all is good. But fuck is 4-aco-dmt I.V scary as fucking hell !

Was curious and ordered 4-aco-dmt in freebase form. I was unsure how it would work smoked because I have not really found any reports on it. I am here to report that it does work.


It is not easy to handle because it becomes an oil at room temperature (it becomes hard in the freezer but you have to cut a chunk and weight it quickly before it melts). Tried a 40 mg chunk that I put in a meth pipe. It vaporises very well like you would expect with a freebase tryptamine. I did not vaporise the whole 40 mg as it began hitting very hard and fast halfway through. Pretty intense DMT-like rush and visuals. Will try again at different doses.

Finally got a chance to try this.  So naturally I went to all the big and dandy's before hand only to find I am a very late comer to this wonderful substance.


First try was with 19 mgs.  That brought me to a ++ and almost a +++.  It was enough to refresh me with an afterglow of about 2 days which was much needed. The next time was 25 mgs..and that was plenty for a +++ with a ton of insights.  I find the come up smooth.  Not harsh at all although 25. mgs jarred me a little. An hour into both trips I took a few tokes of some Mendo Breath cannabis since that only takes me two tokes for a strong high.  Smoking always kicks in a trip for me. I basically laid in a bed very comfortably with head phones on and let my mind be the playground.  (The first time my wife ever took a psychedelic was 18 mgs of 2CB and said it was like a swingset for the mind lol) 6 hours later was down and knocked myself out with 2 mgs etizolam.  Gone are the days I can get to sleep after a trip without a sedative.


I find the substance a valuable tool, very pretty visuals, like people said similar to the come up of a light DMT trip.  Also for me it was like mushrooms later on after the first 2 hours. I have not tried an RC tryptamine for well over 10 years so it was a nice treat.

Anyone noticed a long-ass tolerance to 4aco? I find if you try taking it every week the effects decrease massively. Once a month is my premium for 4aco.

[@Ismene2](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/506563/) I feel like every psych is kinda like that to me. Definitely get diminishing returns doing it weekly ime. Still believe this is one is the crown jewel and I personally only take it once every couple months. Any more would dull the novelty. Still delivers the mental refresh I need every time.

It's the undisputed kingI - nothing comes close. Only drawback I find is I sometimes feel a bit tired and sluggish on it. Have you ever tried 4-ho-met? gonna give that a go as soon as it arrives.

With the 4sub tryptamines I mostly found this one and stuck with it. Know I've tried 4-aco-met, and I believe 4-ho-mipt as well. Nothing that stood out at the time for me really. For me this one's pretty smooth in basically every fashion, physically anyway. Mentally can be wonky of course but usually a happy landing. Combines perfectly with Phenethylamines imo as well

I have found that 4-HO-MiPT combines perfectly with 2C-x (well I tried it with 2C-D and 2C-E both once) as well. It's got a little less headspace than 4-AcO-DMT, and is more flashy and euphoric, it's a really amazing drug. I'll have to try adding 4-AcO-DMT sometime, which 2C-x do you like combining it with?


A phen + 4-sub makes for quite the different experience to both compounds, but I have also found that synergy is there ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have nEver combined 2cs with 4 subs but 4acodmt combines well with both 4acomet  and 4homipt. I find they seems to round each other out... both mentally (to me 4acomet and 4homipt both seem more placid) and physically (I find 4acodmt rather sluggish physically where the others are almost stimulating)

[@Buzz Lightbeer](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/509667/) I agree 100% and will go as far as to say those good combos are consistently more therapeutic, comfortable, and enlightening trips than pretty much any other psych. To me those combos are more a "full psychedelic" than LSD. People love their cid and I've definitely had some amazing times, but I think people do a little bit of downplaying on how great the novel ones truly are. I suggest people start to learn to love em quick, cause nothings around forever. L is the standard because everyone knows it, and bwaaah orange moonshine or whatever, but in reality tryps and phens are way cooler ime (I know L has qualities of both, but it just is not selective enough for me to love)


There is both warmth and depth, in these combos. Whereas L feels cold and anxiety inducing at points.


PS: my most recent combo was 2cb-fly and 4acodmt, which was beyond chill and serene and perfect. 4acodmt was also great with Methallyescaline at one point as well.

I too this year stumbled upon this wonderful substance.  Only took it 4 times in 3 months with weeks in between so it did always work strongly.  Settled on 20 mgs as good for me for now and that is pretty strong.  But not a tolerance that I get, but I notice as I get older I almost get a tolerance to insights with any psychdelic, even DPT.  LIke I am tripping and getting insights but notice I get the same insights without tripping.  I just get the ride, which in itself is wonderful with music and all.  But the last 8 years when I trip and get an insight I know I would have had that thought anyway. So naturally that silly saying comes to mind, when you get the message hang up the phone (your favorite saying Ismene lol  not trying to stir it up I promise). But I will always check in with psychedelcs and always pick up the phone (and I don't drink! lol).  And if I only get the ride that is fine.  In my normal waking state I can have some very large thoughts too.

This timing is quite good since earlier this week I had an amazing psychedelic experience on 4-HO-MiPT & 2C-D ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) high dosages though, so to be expected.

I too have my own problems with LSD but maybe that changes with more trips on it, it's always fun but I feel that the mental hyperactivity is too much and counterproductive, along with a long long tail where I am so mentally drained and unable to relax into whatever I am doing.


I don't downplay though, I really love most of the psychedelic RCs, it's incredible how many are something that I'd qualify as a 'gem'. And yes, to anyone reading, I'd really consider throwing a (maybe just a little) 4 sub tryptamine in with the phen of choice. I'm glad you feel the same about this, because there are almost no combo reports anywhere, and I don't see anyone ever talking about it. I think if you get the dosage and setting right, the sum can be greater than it's parts, with a whole different vibe to the experience, depending on dosages ofc


I tried 2C-B-FLY once, but I didn't like it that much, it was too strong, at which point it felt like chaos and a lack of an underlying feel to the drug. I have MAL but haven't had the opportunity to try it yet, soon... I'll be experimenting with 4-AcO-DMT in combos too! Also soon ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I always naturally went for 4-HO-MiPT as I felt that would fit both 2C-D and 2C-E very well, which it did.

Well, lucky you then. MAL+4-Aco-DMT was the only worthwhile endeavor I had with MAL. One of my fav combos of all time even. Hell, 4-Aco-DMT does well in combos altogether. Most 4 subs are, I suppose. I guess it depends on the substance and what I want from my trip whether I'd go for 4-AcO-DMT or 4-HO-MiPT. Though to be honest, the two aren't too far apart and it becomes a bit more muddy once you factor in synergistic effects of doing combos.


3-Meo-PCE (and MXE even more, but I promised myself that I'd stop being sentimental over that one lol) is also one that improved a lot by adding 4-Aco-DMT IME. Don't know why I haven't entertained a threesome of those yet, but looking back that is pretty much my dream combo.

I was just saying in my last post I have sort of a tolerance for insights but the ride of the psychdelic is still very much there after some years.  Well I should not dare any substance with DMT in it's name.  Last night I took 20 mgs being my 5th in 5 months time trying 4-ACO-DMT and had my best trip yet.  I took it and 30 minutes later felt it strong so I took a bunch of hits of weed to kick off the come up.  Very strong visual come up after that. While it may not be insights I certainly reached a place of peace I had not had in a good while, and an overwhelming feeling of being craddled and nurtured by Mother Nature and Universe that everything is just fine and always was. It was so clear I burst out laughing.  Fear could not exist as I was seeing things very clearly and that dissipates fear.  This was after a few weeks of total unfocused stress, worry and tiredness.  The fact that such a place exists in me once I clear out the garbage thoughts is incredible.  And it does have that feeling of calming and stilling the water so much that things can be seen clearly in reflection without the choppiness. I took a week off of work and it was the smartest thing I did, the second smartest was taking a sacrament.


So basically I would never think psychedelics are to be a stepping stone and then not needed. That would be like saying a computer is only good for a little while. A tool is a tool. Psychedelics have endless usage and whenever I hear someone say they don't need them anymore and are beyond them my next question would be when are you going to graduate beyond the computer too? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

So if one has had 4 aco dmt that's about 3 years old and it's gone a brownish color-is this still safe to ingest? Other than that: optimal storage in a dark, sealed, under room temperature area.  Everything I'm seeing is this due to oxidation but doesn't hurt to ask.

It's safe, and it also probably has not degraded potency wise. I once used 1yr old, black, oxidized from getting wet 4-Aco-DMT and it had not degraded, at all. I, unfortunately or fortunately, snorted 100mg of it. That was a hell of a trip.

I did that once, i had a large psychedelic tolerance and was using with people who had even more, we kept doing bumps and eventually I had like 100-200mg. I remember all these "implanted memories" lifetimes that were not mine, then some very disturbed trapped spirits/souls begging for my help. I managed to fingerdip some flubromazepam and the trip ended and I entered a week long blackout. The death theme of the 4aco trip spawned into real life and I could have died crashing my car like 5 times, finally totaling it

Some of my most intense 4-AcO-DMT trips came from some stuff that started melting on me at an alarming rate. It was very hard to work with and weigh out so I ended up just carving off gooey dark brown chunks, and I tripped really intensely every night for almost a week. I learned a lot that week...


Ultimately 4-AcO-DMT has been the most reliably deep and meaningful chemical I have experienced, aside from Ayahuasca which is not nearly as easy.

A large percentage of my total psychedelic experiences are with Psilacetin. My favorite combo of all time was it with MXE. Strangely enough 4-AcO-DMT and 4-FA gave one of the most immersive trips I had ever experienced with full on molly rolls that would turn into mushroomy trip waves when they reached my brain. I gave that combo to one of my friends that liked to trip heavily and all he could say was "...what???...." over and over. I got to see his mind being blown by looking at grass and leaves n shit.


Need to get some more!

Yeah if you do give it a shot let us know.  I have a little bit of this left and I have it stored in an air tight jar in a cool dry basement.  I am leary of freezers. I know they work but I have ruined some hits of acid years ago with moisture.  And acid has held up a few years in a jar in a cool room and not a freezer.  But the 4-ACO-DMT is still white.  I actually took out 18 mgs last Jan and just put it in a parchment paper just folded up in a drawer and that is still white too and it is not stored so well.  But I also wonder if in a freezer it would still turn brown.  I will see how long it can stay in almost open air and stay white.


Even so every post I have read, including [@psy997](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/250483/) post has stated everything from white/brown powder to black goo is very active and still potent.  I don't think any of the more current versions, fumerate, would turn all the way to a black goo.  That seems to have been the HCL from some years back.  But yeah, every post on black goo shows it was potent.


One thing I never understood about the whole pro drug debate is there is a notion that 4-ACO-DMT may convert to psilocin in the body.  Or even the substance has speculated that it turned into psilocin.   But I always understood psilocin to be very unstable, so even if it did it would probably still have to convert even more as that breaks down.  But I am just pondering.  I understand the knowledge on pro drug talk is still being formulated.


Some of those doses in this thread. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Jeez, 18 mgs zoots me.  I can not imagine taking 100 mgs.

Ive had alot of different batches of this drug and it's always been really strong without tolerance even the sandy batch i had many moons ago. Then i got that really white synth and it remained that way for years on ice. If you put it in an aber vial [@JackARoe](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/121120/) and then put it in box in freezer it will be fine. Just be sure that before you open it the vial comes up to room temperature. I usually set a timer for 2 hours to be safe otherwise moisture will devolop and fuck it up. Next time i take this one i will probably go for 50mgs orally and really try and crack a hole in the universe, its a top teir psychedelic one of my favorite Tryptamines by a longshot. I've used it Intravenously before but it gave me these chest pains after, i tripped crazy hard off 25mgs tho...but i got paranoid and went the hospital and all was fine. I never shot it again tho i just eat, plug or snort it.

Thanks [@Shadow Cat](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/98703/), I think I may give that a try as far as amber viles.  I have only done it orally.  And I remember reading recently [@CreamGravy?](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/158365/) stated that 10 mgs about equals 1 1/2 grams of mushrooms and that is about right to me.  18 feels almost like 2 1/2 grams of mushrooms.

Here in the Netherlands, and Europe 4-AcO-DMT is illegal. I've finally achieved 2x25mg capsules after a long search. I find 4-HO-MET, 4-AcO-DET, 4-HO-MiPT extremely boring below 40mg. My best trip to date was 55mg 4-HO-MET + DCK. I tend to dose fairly high with tryptamines, DPT for example I explore the 125mg+ range. I'm not very prone to headspace, even 4g dried shrooms (only tried it once) I was rather clearheaded.


Since I probably wont encounter more 4-AcO-DMT than these 2x25mg capsules I have I think i'm probably safe dropping 50mg at once? For most it's high but keep in mind I find other tryptamines extremely mild below this dosage. I have hundreds of DMT experiences so I can handle some intensity.

If that's the case you should be fine. Be aware that you could possibly be tripping very hard, but it's still a manageable dose for me, quite amazing though, 4-AcO-DMT is quite different from shrooms and it makes your thoughts go crazy fast, mostly undirected and often to beautiful places ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Be aware that you could possibly be tripping very hard, but it's still a manageable dose for me, quite amazing though, 4-AcO-DMT is quite different from shrooms and it makes your thoughts go crazy fast, mostly undirected and often to beautiful places ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

##### The State of the Art of Psilacetin (4-AcO-DMT)

Psilacetin is easier and less expensive to make than psilocybin, but much of its pharmacology is unknown.

Just found this article about 4-AcO-DMT that I found interesting and wanted to share with ypu guys. Actually getting couple more grams of this soon which im really happy about, its one of my favorite psychedelic drugs. I find it's therapeutic potential to be simply staggering, its pretty much an instant cure for depressive symptoms in my experience. It has greatly helped me over come the setbacks of bipolar disorder.

So I did 50mg 4-AcO-DMT without tolerance and found it extremely boring. Had some headspace but was still easy to handle. Close to none CEV's and less OEV's than 4g shrooms. N2o was a wild ride with it tho. 50mg 4-HO-MET gives me DMT realm style visuals. I guess my brain chemistry is just not made for psilo since I also found shrooms underwhelming at 4-4,5g.

Wow that is fascnating [@hoxyz](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/528982/) even with my enormes tolerance right now I can have full on trip at 30mgs with gorgeous visuals and a body high that is so nice and relaxing. If you disnt have this problem with shrooms id say it maybe your sample isnr whst its supposed to be. Have you tried other 4-sub's and do those work?

I have done pretty much all the "decently known" psychedelics and 55mg 4-HO-MET + DCK was my best trip to date. I find <40mg 4-HO-MET extremely boring.


I've tried 4-AcO-DET at 30mg, was very boring. ++ i'd say.

I've tried 4-HO-MiPT at 35(?), same. T+2h I plugged 50mg 2C-D which only then it became somewhat fun. Tbh i'm done with expoloring the 4 subs since they are all boring, I don't see the point on trying another one since 4-HO-MET works fine. Maybe that 4-HO-DPT or something like that can bring something else, but haven't read much about that one. I think 4-PRO-DMT is maybe worthwhile but not avalaible here, but I think i've read that's is basically the same as 4-AcO-DMT, in that case I wouldn't try it.


I think i've tried one more 4-XXX-XXX but I can't remember currently. I guess my personal tolerance is just a tad bit higher. But I find it weird that I get close to DMT style CEV's on 50mg 4-HO-MET but almost zero on 50mg 4-AcO-DMT.


Not sure what my next psychedelic experience is going to be, but i'm debating on going 60-75mg of 4-HO-MET.

Damn weird, you must have a massive tolerance, 35mg 4-HO-MiPT and 50mg (!!!) of 2C-D plugged should’ve been much much more than ’somewhat fun’. 25mg 4-HO-MiPT and 40mg 2C-D orally had me tripping very very hard, top combo btw. 50mg of psilacetin was also one of my most amazing trips in terms of effects, multiple directed thought streams straight through the heart, incredible drug. I believe these doses are necessary to get the everything out of 4-AcO-DMT, I haven’t found the same to be true for 4-xxx-MET/MiPT where larger doses don’t really add all that much value, ymmv.

4-AcO-DMT really is in a place of its own among the 4 subs imo, the mental effects are so insane that I couldn’t care less about visuals.

I’m fairly sure 4-HO-DPT indeed brings something else, haven’t tried myself.

But your tolerance is for sure massive, you’re talking huge doses, 15mg often results in steady +++ for many.

Chiming in that oxidised 4-ACO-DMT, aka 4-ACO-DMT which starts going tannish, then brown then into an oil like substance from a white powder originally has no potency loss.


I've read discussions that propose the oxidization leads to at least some 4-HO-DMT in the oil. However I hope someone with more chemistry knowledge could confirm/discuss this. It appears some find the 4-ACO-DMT brown goo is more earthy in effect but I think placebo is so strong without a confirmation of 4-HO-DMT presence it's all in the mind.


Unfortunately I don't have access to any to send in for testing to confirm.


It's a real shame that good white powder of this is so hard to get now. It used to be much easier to insufflate a large dose. One of my favorite tryptamines.


4-HO-MET doesn't have much headspace at lower doses. However at higher doses (e.g. 80-100mg oral) it becomes a completely different animal and very DMT like along with feelings of entity contact that don't show their head at all in the low <=30mg oral doses. 4-ACO-DMT gets to this level on much less per mg but just gets deeper at the 80-100mg doses. Great experience if your comfortable.

I remember another Bluelighter claiming that all 4-subs, including 4-HO-MiPT become very DMT like at huge doses (also IV), and honestly all very alike at those doses. 

Interesting to hear that you have somewhat similar experience, I’m not in the mood for 100mg of either miprocin or metocin anyway, but interesting.... life was indeed good when psilacetin was everywhere.

Yes this is very true for IM anyway. I wouldn't even go near IV unless it was injected by a sitter due to how fast that would kick in given IM is instant. I love the rush of IV but always tend to prefer IM in most chemicals.


Any 4-sub or tryptamines I've tried IM'd just go up easily 5-10x in strength compared to their oral dose. Immediate comeup (comparable to sniffing 2C-E) for any I've tried, sharp rise over 5 minutes. But extremely clean since it doesn't cause any nausea.


There are certain tryptamines I would only IM now having tried it but **I highly recommend trying a range of 4-subs at 80-100mg oral first before even considering IM'ing 20-25mg**. Normally 10mg gets things going nicely even at this range in IM but at 30-35mg it goes crazy for most 4-subs. **Prepare to loose control and get naked many times. **


Note: I would not inject any Phenethylamine without being very sure of what you're doing - they are much more caustic. Also maybe avoid injecting any oxidised material and stick to fresh pure batches.

Thanks, I'd love to explore those ranges, but it sounds daunting honestly, only drug I've taken that would come close in intensity is likely DPT (since that also lasts a couple hours), and that wasn't even IM. I'd be more worried about the stimulation and nausea coming with those doses. I hope to find it all out myself sometime, I guess that's likely.

DPT insufflated is comparable in intensity. In fact similar to trying high oral doses first I would not go near IM of a tryptamine without having tried at least 150-200mg insufflated of DPT and be able to comfortably handle the experience.


I would love to IM DPT but don't have any. However it is very strong insufflated that I think it might be very easy to turn dark if the dose is wrong. Strangely I prefer DPT to DMT by far.

Noted. When going that high I'm actually more worried about something snapping and going psychotic than things just turning dark. Thanks either way, great reminder that there's lots to discover yet, I seemed to have subconsciously forgotten that I have multiple 4-sub tryptamines as well. 


Anyway, that guy was IV'ing 100mg and more of every 4 sub, he was a fucking machine, full blackout levels of intensity apparently.

I have had enough 4-AcO-DMT at this point to know there is definitely a difference between batches. The best 4-AcO-DMT I ever had turned into a gooey brown glob. I ended up eating a gram over a week because I thought it was going to melt completely into a liquid at the rate it was going. Every next dose was more comfortable physically than the last. The stuff melted so fast I was eventually just carving off goopy unweighed chunks and eating them. That stuff produced the most powerful mindfuckery and perceptual changes I have ever experienced. 

Last year I got this stuff that was completely white, usually even my nonmelty stuff was a little off white to tan, and it produced very little mental effects, but gave me really colorful rave laser type effects. 

There seems to be a spectrum of possibilies. I want to get the hcl, fumerate and freebase and do back to back tests on them.

I agree, my best way to describe it is by comparing it to ketamine. If you sniff a massive 'too much' khole line of ketamine at a bad setting, e.g. a house party. You'll have a terrifying k-hole but the mind will come back and in a few hours everything is fine.


With DPT if someone were to take too much and be in a bad setting I can see their mind being unhinged and longer lasting effects. The way the lower doses split the personality to the DPT realm and you lying down on the bed is so mind boggling in itself. Thankfully as the doses have went higher it just becomes more colourful and enjoyable. As long as you have a setting were you can be alone, lie in the dark and have some headphones DPT seems to go great. But I'd hate to be unable to do that on a high dose, the vibrations remind me of dissociatives. But on a dissociative you would just lie down, on DPT if you didn't know to lie down you'd probably get confused and not enjoy it.


That's insane about the 100mg doses. I could not imagine the intensity of such experiences. Maybe one day...

I've experimented with lots of batches of LSD and strains of mushrooms and notice a difference in effects - so I'm open to this idea. I've tried lots of batches of 4-ACO-DMT and always found it quite similar though - although it could be that these 'batches' were actually just the same batch but being stored long term. I have no evidence to back it up but even the same batch as a white powder then oxidised to a black goo seems to change effects in ways.


I have had trips that give those laser type effects like oral DMT then other trips that are more like mushrooms. I really prefer the first. Once you get over the comeup with 4-ACO-DMT which can be slightly darker compared to other 4-subs it's an incredible experience. Closing your eyes and seeing alex grey style visions for hours, music appreciation amplified to another level. Body feels like it's peaking in health and energy.


Out of all my psychedelic experiences (a few hundred) an intense experience I had on high dose 4-ACO-DMT and a k-hole after a night of MDMA and speed is probably the most life changing trip I had. It destroyed any depression for months and left an afterglow I can only compare to pre-ban MXE but it lasted for months not days. But it was also the most intense in terms of ego loss, I forgot everything, then I returned to coloured lines and slowly came to over an hour or so. Then I had an amazing stream of what felt like information. It was like 10 essays worth of information were being channeled into me in seconds at a time over and over. I felt purpose in the universe and no longer alone and lost. It wasn't intended, I just took too much accidentally at a house party. But it was life changing.

MXE and 4-AcO-DMT was reliably the best combo I ever experienced.

Those two took me places....


Dissociatives in general seem to be great diving boards for psychedelics...

DPT is one of my favourite compounds. I've done 140 + 90 nasally which was very fun. I'd like to try 4-HO-MET in the 70+ range soon. I have no problem with injecting oil IM (AAS) but i've never injected RC's/drugs. Seems a bit sketchy for me, I don't really trust myself with the filter proces.

Yep, 3-Meo-PCP was also a great launch pad for 4-AcO-DMT too, but I do recall having a very weird dysphoric experience after holing on Ketamine and being high on Psilacetin, I felt like I'd died and was in some strange purgatory for my various sins...couldn't wait to leave ![😀](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f600.png)

To be fair not all my trips were necessarily good. I had an extreme fascination with this certain dissociative psychedelic realm, even when I saw shadow people and got caught in thought loops and paradoxes I still wanted more.....

Does anyone know how the current batches of this is?

I got My hands on some very white looking fumerate salts of 4acodmt.

I got it in europe from a vendor with very Good reputation.

The same vendor also blessed me with some DOC pellets.


Probably going to try around 30mg of it tonight, after a allergy test that is.

Since the same vendor sold me doc and has several nbomes then i dont want to take 30mg of unknown powder.

Do an allergy test of less than 1mg or, use a testing kit. I have some decently white fumarate but I got it maybe a year ago now.

Yeah thats the plan, im going to take a very small amount sublingual.

That way if its a nbome then i will know.

Looks like a tryptamine though, dont ask me how i know.

But i usually see a difference in phens and trypts.

Im glad to report there is still high quality material out there!


I did a unknown amount allergy test (i used a small Blade to put 35mg in some rolling papper)

Then i just licked the blade afterwards.

I guess i got like 3-5mg.


After no more then 30mins i was sure it was the right chem.

I felt very relaxed and wanted more.


I took the ball of Rolling papper with the 35mg aswell.


The trip was quite strong, alot more dmt like then i remember this chem too be.

Maybe it was the dose but it was very Close to a +100mg dmt pharmahuasca trip.


Pleasent most of the time, however the chem did try to scare me with some weird thoughts.

To be honest i'm fairly glad that my 50mg trips ended out boring. I've been searching for 1,5 years for 4-AcO-DMT since it's banned here in the Netherlands and to know knowledge there isn't a single RC vendor in europe selling it. I've seen it listed in Canada I think but I don't want to import oversead. Althrough it's tempting tho since i'd like to have 25b-NBOH powder which they don't sell here in europe.

disappointment 4-aco-DMT, my first experience with him was 5 days ago. I took 25mg orally, it was strange, how not to feel the onset or offset, an experience Introspective without energy, without life ... Without visuals, without brightness, practically 2 / 3h writing, the words flowed continuously, was like my hand be the brain and the pen my mouth. ![🤷🏻](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f937-1f3fb.png)‍♂‍.I launched a few times 4-HO-MiPT, 30mg the onset going up was sexy, erotic, just want sex, the peak has colorful visuals, and eyes on everything like the mushies but without their cloudy aura, but clear and defined as mescaline, the bodily buzz is warm, like floating, unimpaired disposition, perfect unity. Only the fall was strange at times, seemed delusional with a certain feeling of being watched and some more annoying mild auditory hallucinations. Overall 4-HO-MiPT is a winning bet, I already did it with key and liked it, and I will launch with mescaline that I think will match perfect ![👌](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f44c.png). Is this normal ?? It shouldn't look like at least?? I will try again in a few days, I hope it changes, I would not like to put it in the drawer and forget, expected more than 4-aco-DMT.

Dont bother trying in a few days cheech - wait 3 or 4 weeks and take 75mg.


Take aco too often and you just get more sedation and next day headache - none of the good stuff.

With my first batch, of freebase from way back (which I still have a couple hundred mg frozen) i slowly worked my way up because reports made it sound so intense. 20 was mostly a body buzz with some faint colour enhancement and swirls. 25 had more visuals but nothing I’d write home about. I found it rather anxiolytic perhaps because it was so sedating, either way there wasn’t much headspace to report besides that. It wasn’t until 30 mg that things got interesting, both in terms of visuals and headspace. 37 was almost too much lol ... now friends who ordered the same batch experiences “circus type visuals” at 25 mg.


With a more recent batch of fumarate things didn’t start to get interesting until 35 mg.


Yet I read reports of ppl taking doses thatd send me into the cosmos (ie the 75 suggested above)


Tl;dr I think personal tolerances and batch variances are at play. I’d suggest giving it a couple weeks and then titrate slowly because who knows when you’ll find that spot on the curve where not enough turns into too much lol

Could it have changed something until it arrived? It took around 3 months of the post when receiving.

20-25mg is sort of the standard dose interval for 4-AcO-DMT. 

Not everyone reacts the same to it though so I'm guessing you need a higher dose.

I wouldn't personally jump right into 75mg though. Thats a big jump.

However I have taken some pretty damn big doses before. Not really physically dangerous,

you just want to make sure you are mentally prepared for those higher trips.


I have never actually known 4-AcO-DMT to lose potency like that, but I suppose its possible.

This is more of just anecdotal experience, but I have noticed that the 4-AcO-DMT I have come across more recently has been a very white powder, and it seems to lack some of the deepest mindfuckery that I was used to with my brownish batches. The white stuff seems almost recreational to me.

This is extremely poor advice. Physical consequences are neither the only nor the most dire of potential consequences from dosing too high with psychedelics.

The highest I have ever seen anyone go is 300mg and while they were physically ok it was definitely a trip that required a trip sitter's presence. 

I have taken up to about 120mg in a session, but not all at once. Its definitely something you want to make sure you are ready for.

I would hope hes over 18 and familiar with psychedelics so he should know what to do with advice like that. You aint going to get the full effects of 4aco on 25mg.

I just load up a big pile - its fantastic. Ive taken upwards of 500mg within 2-5 hours never had any negative physical or mental effects. It just gets better - certainly nothing like taking too much acid, its always euphoric and gorgeous.


But thats advice to someone like me who knows what the fuck hes doing. I wasted time on low doses, if someones clueless then they should always stick to a low dose.

Don't worry about my age ![😉](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) knowing a little bit of what psychedelics what they can do, I'm not going to make that leap at once.

Yes, well, you don't know how mature or familiar with psychedelics they are, and it's best to not assume context when it comes to potentially life damaging advice. Also, 25mg is a nice dose when it's pure and you know what's what. Being experienced with psychedelics does not mean dosing higher and higher.

25mg is not a low dose, and while I may agree with you that low dosing can be a waste of time, this is Bluelight that we are on, and harm reduction is the name of the game. Dick swinging over psychedelic dosage here is unethical, and no-one thinks you're cooler for doing high doses.

This is awful advice.  This is a harm reduction website and throwing out insane dosages like that saying that one wasted time with normal dosages, and that physical and mental effects were minimal is the type of immature dick sizing that has no places in the psychedelic community. Calling someone clueless for not taking 300mg of pure 4-AcO-DMT is a bit of the pot calling the kettle black.

It can be very very dangerous to take psychedelic drugs at doses over 10x their traditional dose to achieve a +3 on the Shulgin scale.

I still think what [@Cream Gravy?](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/313551/) said was spot on.  10 mgs as strong as about 1 1/2 grams of mushrooms.  I will use that as the standard because I did find that accurate.  Now I like 15-18 mgs and I also like about 2 1/2 -3 grams of mushrooms for a decent trip.


I did 25 mgs once and it was strong.  But stronger does not mean more insight to me.  Sometimes lower amounts work better for my purposes.  I am one that can push psychedelics too.  My trip on 28 King Tut blotters many years ago did not have more insight than 1 blotter did.  Sometimes you have to weave in and out instead of pedal to the metal.  Sometimes scenery is missed with pedal to the metal.  (is that poetic enough? lol)

Have you ever taken 4aco?  


Im not talking about "psychedelic drugs" in general im talking 4aco because it has a special effect ive never noticed with any other psychedelic - a large dose is so different to a low dose its barely recognisable as the same drug.


Also, it isnt like lsd for example where it becomes more intense the higher the dose. , 300mg of 4aco is barely any different mentally to 100mg. Its a very calm psychedelic, by far the friendliest ive ever taken.


But i get the feeling this is a central plank of a lot of peoples drug belief system so i wont push it. All i know is if id stuck to the bullshit about "take 25mg" i would never have experienced the true nature of the drug. 


Btw, i wasnt calling them clueless for not taking 300mg. I was saying if you are clueless then dont take doses you cant handle. Big difference.


And i must say that calling my advice "awful" was quite camp of you ![😀](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f600.png)

This conversation about 4-AcO-DMT doses has been had more than a couple times, I’ve only gone up to 50mg (I don’t have any anymore so....) but even then there was a definite shift in character. All doses are great and have their use imo.

5mg once ‘cured’ someones cluster headaches for like a year. 


You don’t experience much nausea [@Ismene2](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/506563/) that high?

Starts off low dose is psilocybin-ish, then take more and its dmt, then take more and its "this is 4aco" ![😁](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f601.png)

Here's my trip with my partner from yesterday: [Connection & Disconnection](https://www.bluelight.org/xf/threads/4-aco-dmt-28mg-experienced-connection-disconnection.907726/)


One thing that took me off guard was that I started coming up 10 minutes after dosing (orally). Has anyone else experienced such a quick onset?

Yeah I find that 4-AcO-DMT comes on faster than mushrooms or 4-HO-DMT (synthetic/pure).  Another reason why I believe that it has effects of its own beyond merely being a prodrug.

That's a question with a huge answer, and the question is flawed, because, like the many analogs of DMT (*strains *is not the right word, as it is represents a group of plants w/ similar characteristics, whereas *analog* is defined as "a compound with a molecular structure closely similar to another,") there are* many* analogs of LSD (like 1P-LSD), and 4-PO-HO-DMT¹ aka psilocybin--the main prodrug in shrooms "psilocybe cubensis" (like 4-AcO-DMT) and every substance out there.


Organic chemistry is one hell of a subject, and even after years of hobby study, I hardly comprehend it. lol But I think I understand enough to give you an analogy that might help make sense of this. (Like how the word *analog *is in there?)


So, let's see.


Pharmaceuticals (drugs) are usually made of organic molecules--which are made up of bonded atoms--that have an effect on the mechanisms of living creatures. Let's pretend that these drugs are balls.


Take a soccer ball, American football, baseball, and a billiards ball. They are all different sizes and shapes, some readily bounce, some are filled with air, some are round, and they behave differently when struck. The soccer ball and American football have similar mass, are both filled with air and bounce easily, and for the sake of this analogy be considered analogs, whereas the billiards ball and baseball have similar mass, are solid, don't bounce well, and behave similarly when struck, forthis example be considered analogs. But while these *analogs* share similar characteristics, and behave similarly in certain ways, they are still not the same. Each of the balls can be used in different ways, like pharmaceuticals (drugs). You can throw each of them at someone, and something's gonna happen. The structures of these balls will modify the effect on the person they are thrown at. And there are other variables, like the amount taken (velocity of the throw), route of administration (at what part of the body are you throwing), and the subject itself is a variable (how tough is the person being thrown at?), and more!


Balls A, B, C, & D, thrown at 40 mph at the same spot on a strong, muscular young person: Ouch, that football sure hurt more than the soccer ball did, but the soccer ball left a bigger bruise. Now let's throw the billiards ball and the baseball. The baseball hurt like hell, but that damn billiards ball's cracked some bones (due to it's greater inelasticity).


You'd expect the same experiment on an old, feeble person to cause much greater trauma.


Best I could come up with at the moment! Hope this helps.


Oh yeah, and some analogs have wildly different effects, or none at all.


Sorry, got carried away and ended up going beyond describing analogs to variables in cause and effect.


Outer space is cold and dark. So is the inside of your freezer. They are both cold and dark. Put a mug of warm beer in the freezer and it'll get cold, but put that same mug of beer in outer space and the shit will boil away!


¹In humans, 4-PO-HO-DMT (psilocybin) is converted into 4-HO-DMT (psilocin--which is the main psychoactive substance that provides the psychedelic experience from shrooms)--it's a prodrug, or a drug that's converted into a pharmacologically active drug. There are many prodrugs that are converted into different active substances after administration through one or more processes. Isn't that cool?

Oh yes, it doesn't even feel similar to mushrooms for me. The come-up of 4-AcO-DMT feels very close to a threshold DMT experience for me, and the rest of the trip is just its own thing.


Then again, I have to admit I haven't done mushrooms in well over 10 years... In the name of science I plan to grow some of my own soon (I've always wanted to) and test to see if this is all still true for me.

It's hard to explain, but imagine blasting off in a rocket ship of fractals into space, while your body feels like it's crystallizing into geometric patterns.  It launches you into a place where you are seeing and thinking about everything at the same time.  It all happens in seconds and is very overwhelming, and then 10-15 minutes later you're already coming down.

There is only one DMT, 4-AcO-DMT is DMT with an acetoxy group on the 4th position of the indole ring.  Mushrooms contain 4-HO-DMT, which is also called psilocin.  There is also 5-MeO-DMT, which is also another substance that some things like toad venom contain (also some plants contain it).

Yes! My trip the other day caught me by surprise. I'd say it wasn't quite 10mins, but by 15mins I was noticing those first hints of altered-ness - saturated colour and so on. I had a bit of food in my belly, so I suspect if I was fasted it would have come on in 10mins. Actually your report reminds me of a bunch of things from my own trip, I'll leave some comments in there.

Well that's probably just because it's a pure chemical and therefore can cleanly be absorbed to the bloodstream (as opposed with mushrooms which have the raw fungal matter as well)


Prodrugs also don't necessarily take effect any slower, heroin kicks faster than morphine, which it is a prodrug of. In fact the lipophilic acetyl group of both heroin and 4-AcO would allow it to kick in faster than morphine/4-HO-DMT

I could believe if the faster onset/more rapid peak plasma levels could produce a different effect.  However the fact that it feels exactly like  smoked DMT in nature, albeit less intense and slower, vs the substantially different nature of effects from mushrooms and synthetic 4-HO-DMT, suggests to me that there is more at play.

Yes, I get first alerts within 15 minutes every single time I dose psilacetin. In fact I don't think it's working if I'm not 100% into the trip by T+30min.

Well it's not that simple, ayahuasca can feel quite different from smoked DMT, even though it's the same thing, mushrooms can also feel very much like smoked DMT (atleast at high enough doses), I'd bet you couldn't tell the difference between IV DMT and IV psilocybin, besides the duration. Furthermore, even the same psychedelic can be very different at different times, I haven't had two similar trips, so to think that one could accurate discern between completely different forms (mushroom vs powder) with likely different ROAs is just silly, why not trust basic pharmacology

Ayahuasca is not just DMT, so comparing smoked DMT to it is not a good example.


What you're calling "basic pharmacology" is not so basic. Drug effects are the result of an extremely complex system of biochemical network effects.

It was synthesized, pure 4-HO-DMT actually, there was a brief time in 2006 that some was synthed and made the rounds.  I even said it was pure synthetic in my post that we're referring to.


I think it's just a bit of hubris to think that we completely understand all of what is going on with drugs in the brain, and how their interactions with our brains impacts the effects we experience.  I think we have a pretty good basic understanding, but in, say, 100 years, we'll look back at now and see all the stuff we realized we got wrong, and see how incomplete a picture we actually had.    I am pretty sure we don't have a complete picture at this point.


When you've taken psychedelics a whole lot, you notice the similarities among all of your trips on a substance, although yes, of course each trip is unique in ways, too.  When you notice the same differences happening every time with 4-AcO-DMT vs 4-HO-DMT, and so do a ton of other people, to me it isn't proof that they are definitely different in their pharmacology, but it is evidence that points to a strong possibility that they are have differences.


I'd love to get a double blind test going among a statistically significant number of people with sufficient experience with both substances, and see how many were able to correctly identify each substance, and put this matter to rest.

Anyone tried a combo of 4acodmt and 2cb?

I got these 2cb pellets that are a bit weak.

Supposed to be 20mg but i suspect they are more like 15 at most.

Thinking about taking 2 of them with 20mg 4aco.

Never done it with 2cb but timed the Aco with a mescaline peak and it’s as amazing as it sounds. Phenethylamines and tryptamines in combination is outstanding every time I’ve tried it

Sure but that's just doublespeak for "you can't say that because you don't 100% know", it's just as hubris for the other side of this debate to claim that it is different, especially when all of the (limited, yes) evidence we have points to it being merely a prodrug

Nonsense. 99.9% of what we know about these drugs comes from user experience. Our scientific understanding based on brain chemistry is in its infancy and is only considered actual knowledge if it happens to fit with our observations (i.e. user experience). Even then, it's subject to change as we get better at studying this stuff at the neurochemical level.


Reminds me of the joke about the woman who walks in on her husband in bed with someone else. The husband swears that he's not cheating on her and denies that she saw anything out of the ordinary. Indignant, he challenges her, "who are you going to believe, me or your lying eyes?"


Anyway, it's a mistake to be ignoring user observation just because, "the chemistry doesn't immediately point to the same."

Tried for the first time last week in a glass pipe. Absolutely amazed. Fully enlightened. Short duration of it smoked makes the trip kinda hard to process, but it is absolute bliss. Only downside is a real heavy chest the next day. I read somewhere this could be due to it not being stored in the freezer? Can anyone help with some info? A lot of what I've read said smoking/vaping is pointless, I'd have to fully disagree with that![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png)

70mg, around 15 mins. I lost all sense of time during that 15 mins and when I opened my eyes, I was convinced I was in a different country. My whole apartment looked like something else. It was sold to me as freebase, no real residue left in the pipe so I assume it's legit. Comes as a real tan yellow color.

I've heard sporadic accounts of people having great success vaporizing 4-aco-dmt freebase and have always wondered why it wasn't more popular. Going to give a try myself shortly.

Within about 10 seconds I'd say. 


Like I say, I really enjoyed it. Only thing is a bit of a heavy chest. First time I did it the heaviness only lasted the next day. Had a week break and this time my chest has been aching for 2 days now. If it wasn't for that I would of carried on most of the night haha.

Hi there

I recently acquired some 4-AcO-DMT freebase

The substance I received came in the form of a brown oil or liquid. The website says to store it in an environment under 4 degrees celsius

How do I convert it to a solid? Just leave it in the freezer for a few hours? I need it to be a powder so I can measure it well, and so I can pack it into my dry herb vape stem. 

Also asking for some tips on how to vaporize it correctly, and what are the dosage range for vaporizing. I have an arizer solo 2. The stems are quite small.

I assume the correct method is to sandwich the 4aco between two layers of weed, and then take as big of a hit as you can. As for the temperature, I'm assuming lower is better and I usually use 180 degrees celcius as my low temp, but the vape can go lower -- and higher, up to 220. Thank you kindly

Oil to powder i dont know but I would suppose freezer yeah.


Regarding vaping I wouldn't sandwich or use a vape. Rather use a meth/base pipe with bic lighter and vape like any chem - pyro e.g. Slowly add heath untill sufficient. Should be universal with every chemical. Sadly no 4-aco-dmt available in EU.

I’ve scoured the internet before for reports concerning the shelf life of tryptamines dissolved in solution but it can be hard to find consistent answers, so hopefully somebody find this interesting.


Last year I made a solution of 4-AcO-DMT dissolved in prophelene glycol at a concentration of 10mg/ml. I chose PG after reading reports that tryptamines were prone to oxidising and turning black when stored in solvents such as vodka or everclear. I stored the solution in the fridge for three months for microdosing. After that it was stored in the freezer for 12 months, until this week.


The solution had thickened in the freezer but returned to it’s normal consistency after reaching room temprature. The solution appears to be perfectly clear (as best I can tell looking through the amber vial) and no sediment can be seen in the bottle. The solution remains fully active 15 months after I made it, as best I can tell no potency has been lost. I took 20mg last night and had a wonderful and insightful trip with intense closed eye visuals and the usual open eyed warping, shifting and surface fractals you expect at this dose range.

I accidentally took like 6 mg my first time and was crying my eyes out for a half hour.

Anyone know if the reset time on psilacetin is 7 days, 12 days, or 14 days? I've always heard 14 days no matter the psychedelic, then I started seeing 12 days, and now specifically for psilacetin its 7 days on some sites. I took 30mg one week then a week later took 30mg again and it seemed just as strong though it took forever to kick in and lasted like twice as long which was a nice treat I suppose. I've done the same with LSD (1 tab the week before then 2 tabs) but it felt like barely half a tab. Is there some merit to this or is just placebo that it felt just as strong?

Psilacetin is my 2nd favorite substance ever, glad to hear that I can be more liberal in my usage than my favorite (LSD). Now I just have to learn how to pace myself so I don't burn through my supply lmao. Thanks for the response.

Finally I have some of this on order after not being able to get hold of it for over a year. ^ Ditto on needing to learn to pace myself lol, I wasted my last batch taking megadoses when I already had a tolerance. I hope it doesn’t drop off the map for another year this time. I can always get hold of shrooms but they just aren’t the same.

It is better than Mushrooms in many ways, tho i love both of those substances quite a bit. Find the visuals of Psilacetin to just be on a whole other level and be very similar to those of DMT. The second portion of the trip when you are about halfway it turns into some of the purest euphoria you can imagine. I always get an afterglow from it that is just magical, like the world is just the most beautiful thing ever. 


Its a remarkable antidepressant. The comeup on large doses can be really intense tho and it can rattle you a bit but that always flips around into bliss for me. Mushrooms are great to but they sometimes have a bodyload that comes with them i just dont get from 4-AcO, and i assumes that comes down to the fact you are consuming a pure compound and not the actual Mushrooms.

Its available in the US right now also, not very cheap but actually less than most of the Canadian vendors. Man do i miss the years when i was buying it in bulk from the Chinese. Id get 5g bags for less than the cost of two grams from these guys. And when me and my friend would go in together on bigger batches it was stupid cheap.


 Id had so much 4-AcO i was literally giving it away as a gift when i would do trades/etc with people for other stuff. And those batches were incredible purity also, pure white. Id had these two 5 dram amber vials in my freezer filled to the max i didnt even touch, and like three 1 dram vials i would eat and trade off.


Then when Covid happened and i lost my job and had to wait months for unemployment i sold off my entire RC Collection for the most part, all sorts of 2C-x, 4-Subs, Empathogens and Opioids. Deeply regret it to this day. Tho i have built a new one that is looking mighty fine.

Tragic stuff, but food and a roof is more important than drugs so you made the right call. Collections can always be rebuilt.


So happy to have this chemical in my possession again. Unfortunately i could only get pre-filled gelcaps which is annoying because you always lose a mg or two to the inside of the capsule when you empty them out, but I’ve set the emptied caps aside for microdosing so nothing will go to waste.

I recently tried some 4-pro-dmt I had for a while and only just barely tested before. The trip was definitely different the colors were different, not as smooth and happy as the aco. I really do think the 4-x attachment affects the experience sometimes a lot sometimes only a little of a difference.


AcO is the best, better than shrooms/HO for me. 4-Pro altered the colors which was cool, like more browns and contours of red, more plastic looking vision. Closed eye visuals were "gooey, weird" just way below AcO visuals which are happy and more beautiful. 


Also 4-pro didn't feel as "smooth" or "fluid" which is one of the best effects of 4-aco-dmt. Vision goes up like a expensive computer display.. 60hz to 144hz type of thing. Motion smoothness.

I've taken so... so damned much of this substance, due to somehow ending up with about 50g of it back in 2021. I've managed to get rid of, trade, etc. about 15g of it and eaten countless doses. Every week when I have my first night (or two) off work I'll trip on 10-30mg and I have watched 2 dram vial after vial disappear into myself over the past year. Probably ate about 3-4 grams myself just in 2023-24.


I find it a jarring substance. Maybe I'm not as happy with psychedelics ever since my spastic colon popped up in 2019 but now I have to take at least 1mg of alprazolam and a few cocktails to get through the first two hours in comfort. Which, of course, turns it rather hedonistic and likely contributed to many a night that I upped to 40-50mg doses. And now I like to throw in kratom but in my opinion the psilacetin overpowers kratom pretty heavily in the first two hours, by the time you take enough kratom to fight off the jitters, you end up almost sick from the kratom and have to force yourself to eat to shake off the nausea and it's a lot of give and take. I mean the two combine great at times, psilacetin has a strong body component and when I was still able to use cannabis and kratom both, the body high was unreal. Reminded me of doing oxycodone with lsd a lot. Sometimes it would get so sedating I couldn't keep my eyes open and I'd go into these deep, deep closed eye visual journeys and just listen to music.


It's a great drug for film viewing/analyses if you throw in the booze/benzos/kratom imo. That's mostly how I spend my trips, just watching several films and generally redosing partway through since I have no shortage.


Sometimes there's a voice/spirit that inhabits psilacetin; it has many voices, I am not sure if it is an entity or different parts of my psyche connecting. I dunno. I think there's a reason I fear taking it without booze and benzos.

This is what I should do. I've had some personal bullshit going on and the last few times I've taken 4-aco I've just ended up crying for 4 hours. Don't get me wrong it's cathartic but sometimes it would be nice to just chill but the molecule insists on turning it into therapy.


Out of curiosity if it's not too nosy how did you end up lucking into 5 grand worth of psilocetin?

Eh, when I bought it, it wasn't $5k worth. It was much cheaper and the bulk supplier was charging far less than $100 a gram. I had plans for most of that 50g but ended up not using it for said plans and changed towns and lifestyle so now I'm in a drug-testing job that pays well but most definitely comes down harsh on drug use, so I don't hang out with people who use any drugs and well... here I am, holding obscene amounts of psychedelics and using my own body to be rid of them lol. I can use alprazolam only because I have a constant prescription for my spastic colon and then I'll use less than I'm prescribed most days so once a week I can up my dose for a day or two when I decide to trip.

Oh I feel you man, it's a hardcore psych, much harsher than lsd ever was. I could be on five strong tabs of acid and some weed and never feel as introspective as psilacetin makes me. A month or two ago work was stressing me and I tripped and I spent several hours just sobbing and listening to music and while it felt healing I don't really enjoy it. The booze adds the pleasure aspect and the benzos and kratom help take away the anxiety and the "spirit" of psilacetin I'll call it. Said spirit can really throw you around, which can be good but I've had my fair share of trips in life... and after hundreds and hundreds of trips I got real sick of being a ragdoll tossed around by the psychs and I had always enjoyed a bit of booze or opioids on any psych and that turned into me figuring out that what I needed was some much required anxiety release on trips.

Mushrooms can make me cry too.  Actually had 2C-B do the same once as I was processing a few things.  One of my crying mushroom trips was a day I had off some years back.  Took them in the morning on this beautiful sunny day.  But ended up in the corner of my room crying over a few hurts.  So much for rock n roll that day.  More like therapy.


I do know 4-ACO-DMT is jarring on the come up. Just the first hour.  Feels like a rocket trying to rip out of the atmosphere.    Putting resistance to that would make it worse for me.  But I can see it smoothed out with something too.  Once past the come up it feels great as it unfolds.  But I do know CG you have done your fair share of 4-ACO over the years.  You have a lot of posts on the topic.  50 gr total?  Whew even if half was given away.


But I also get it, I need more drugs to take the drugs I take. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Not specifically those two, but I've mixed it with MDMA. That's definitely nice.

I mean in theory it sounds like a reasonably pleasant combination. Sometimes there’s a mental component of 4-aco-dmt that has a proclivity to get dark and negative, so perhaps the 5-apb can soften the rough edges out. Granted it’s been years since i’ve used 4-aco, but I definitely recall it being a bit more difficult to handle than say 4-ho-mipt/met.

Sometimes there’s a mental component of 4-aco-dmt that has a proclivity to get dark and negative, so perhaps the 5-apb can soften the rough edges out. Granted it’s been years since i’ve used 4-aco, but I definitely recall it being a bit more difficult to handle than say 4-ho-mipt/met.

Have only done 5mapb, and 6apb. In theory though, they're all good separately, no reason it shouldn't be worthwhile I guess.

I liked 5mapb more than 6apb.

I chose PG after reading reports that tryptamines were prone to oxidising and turning black when stored in solvents such as vodka or everclear. I stored the solution in the fridge for three months for microdosing. After that it was stored in the freezer for 12 months, until this week.

The solution appears to be perfectly clear (as best I can tell looking through the amber vial) and no sediment can be seen in the bottle. The solution remains fully active 15 months after I made it, as best I can tell no potency has been lost. I took 20mg last night and had a wonderful and insightful trip with intense closed eye visuals and the usual open eyed warping, shifting and surface fractals you expect at this dose range.

Update. Made a similar solution of 10mg 4-aco-dmt per 1ml PG around 4-6 months ago (I need to start date labeling my vials) and stored at room temperature in an amber vial and it has gone from being clear to dark brown/black at some point over the course of the summer. I will try to test the potency in the near future.

For what it is worth I had 20 mgs of 4-ACO-DMT powder which was white and it was just kept in a folded piece of paper.  It was forgotten about on a dresser in a cup for 5 years.  I mean that was almost open air.  It was still white and as good as new.   Freezer even better but this was forgotten about.


It appears the 4-ACO-DMT fumarate is stable for a long time even at room temp.  It would be interesting when someone says they have 40 year old fumarate.  But crazy how some other forms turned black quickly when it came out  But it was said it was very strong still.  I think that was the HCL??  Not sure.

4-AcO-DMT has been confirmed to be a psilocin prodrug in the body: [In vivo validation of psilacetin as a prodrug yielding modestly lower peripheral psilocin exposure than psilocybin](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10804612/).

Now the question is: is psilacetin psychoactive on its own? It crosses the brain blood barrier (unlike psilocybin), and despite having 10 times less affinity for the 5HT2B receptor than psilocin, it seems to have some activity. Maybe the differences that people notice between psilocybin and psilacetin are due to 4-AcO-DMT activating the 5HT receptors as both 4-AcO-DMT and its metabolite 4-HO-DMT, unlike psilocybin who can't cross the BBB so only its metabolite 4-HO-DMT binds to the 5HT receptors.

The second portion of the trip when you are about halfway it turns into some of the purest euphoria you can imagine. I always get an afterglow from it that is just magical, like the world is just the most beautiful thing ever.

Mushrooms are great to but they sometimes have a bodyload that comes with them i just dont get from 4-AcO, and i assumes that comes down to the fact you are consuming a pure compound and not the actual Mushrooms.

Just finished reading your post and i totally agree with what you’ve described! I had only one prior experience with this substance at roughly 25mg dose and with my second experience i decided to take 40mg and holy shit within the next 20mins i was off my rocker with my short term memory shot for the next hour causing i believe a delusion on me bleeding from my nose and looping thoughts but after the first hour i was able to recover and it indeed flipped into a wonderful trip still with strong visual effects for the remaining trip. But man that initial hour after the t+20m I’ve lost all sense of time completely out of it


Do want to go back to back days might dose at 30mg the tike around.

Has anybody here noticed peculiarities about psilacetin cutting through tolerance? I'm only a couple days past 3mg of DOB, I've drank maybe 70-100mg of 2C-B in the last two days, there's even carisoprodol, tapentadol, THC-P, ∆9 THC, kratom leaf, tizanidine and caffeine actively in my system but an impulsively popped capsule containing 15mg of psilacetin did work as if there was no tolerance at all. Maybe this is due to it being indolic whereas I've been predominantly using phenethylamines? I have no clue but would love to hear other peoples' subjective takes on capacities to redose this drug and especially info pertaining to cross-tolerance.

^I've noticed it doesn't build much tolerance. A few days without is enough to reset it. Redosing during the experience is worthwhile in my experience. Really crazy stuff.

Yeah it depends on your tolerance at that point. If it’s my first day tripping I five days a redoes one to three hours in is definitely felt, really helps extend the experience and sometimes intensify the trip.


If I dose multiple days in a row the dose response curve gets steep but I have so much of this stuff on hand that I pop it like candy when I’m bored with a bit of booze and kratom usually.

Ime the duration of the trip is very similar to mushrooms. 

However the bodyload is alot cleaner and similar to white DMT xtals.

Although its still a heavy bodyload but in a nice stoning way.

Same with visuals being alot more like DMT compared to mushrooms.
