**2C-T-2** (**2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylthiophenethylamine**) is a psychedelic phenethylamine of the 2C-x family. It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in his book PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story. This particular substance is part of the so-called “magical half-dozen” which refers to Shulgin’s self-rated most important phenethylamine compounds, all of which except mescaline he developed and synthesized himself. They are found within the first book of PIHKAL, and are as follows: Mescaline, DOM, 2C-B, 2C-E, **2C-T-2** and 2C-T-7.

2C-T-2 is a highly dose sensitive psychedelic known for its strong visuals and very intense body load. Many reports also indicate that the physical effects are too severe for those who are not already experienced with psychedelics or suffer from pre-existing physical conditions, as it is known to cause powerful nausea and general bodily discomfort.

In terms of its chemistry, 2C-T-2 is a synthetic, substituted phenethylamine with methoxy groups attached to carbons R2 and R5 as well as a sulfide chain attached to carbon R4. 2C-T-2 is nearly identical in structure to 2C-T-7. The two molecules differ in the length of their sulfide chain; 2C-T-7 contains a propyl thioether group while 2C-T-2 contains a ethyl thioether group.

In terms of its pharmacology, the mechanism of action that produces 2C-T-2’s hallucinogenic and entheogenic effects has not been established in scientific literature, however its primary psychedelic effects are more than likely a result from its efficacy at the 5-HT2A receptor as a partial agonist. This mechanism of action is shared by many other psychedelic phenethylamines and tryptamines.

Athough no established scientific experiments have been preformed to establish MAO-A inbihition of 2C-T-2, phenethylamine derivatives substituted with an alkylthio group at the 4 position (such as 2C-T-7, 4-MTA, and the 2,5-desmethoxy derivative of 2C-T-7) are known to act as selective monoamine oxidase A inhibitors. Therefore, this substance may likewise have MAOI effects.

The effects listed below are based upon the [subjective effects index](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index) and personal experiences of [PsychonautWiki](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki#Contributors). The listed effects will rarely if ever occur all at once but heavier dosages will increase the chances and are more likely to induce a full range of effects.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of 2C-T-2 can be broken down into eight components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **[Spontaneous tactile sensations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_tactile_sensations)** - The body high of 2C-T-2 can be described as very intense and uncomfortable in comparison to 2C-E or 2C-B. In high doses, it’s capable of causing painful cramping. It is similar yet distinct from the body high experienced on 2C-T-7, but is considered much more unpleasant. The sensation itself can be described as intense and may manifest itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves.
- **[Stimulation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, 2C-T-2 is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is quite comparable to that of other phenethylamines such as 2C-B, 2C-E and 2C-P.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)** - Although this component is capable of manifesting itself in a distinct and noticeable fashion for most users, it does not generally seem to be as apparent or intense as the same component found within LSD and 2C-B.
- **[Tactile enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Nausea](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Extreme nausea is commonly reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes once the tripper has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in. It can be described as very painful and violent in comparison to 2C-T-7 or 2C-E.
- **[Stomach cramps](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stomach_cramps)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)**
- **[Temperature regulation loss](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_loss)**

**Cognitive Effects:**

The head space of 2C-T-2 is described by many as one which is both insightful and relatively normal in its thought processes even at moderate to high dosages.

The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes:

- **[Current mind state enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Current_mind_state_enhancement)**
- **[Thought acceleration](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Feelings of fascination, importance and awe](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Feelings_of_fascination,_importance_and_awe)**
- **[Time distortion](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Analysis enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is consistent in its manifestation and is outrospection dominant.
- **[Personal bias suppression](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Ego suppression, loss and death](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_suppression,_loss_and_death)**
- **[Thought loops](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops)**
- **[Feelings of interdependent opposites](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Feelings_of_interdependent_opposites)**
- **[Delusions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**

**Visual effects:**

#### Enhancements

2C-T-2 presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally includes:

- **[Visual acuity enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**

#### Distortions

2C-T-2 presents a full and complete array of possible visual distortions which generally includes:

- **[Drifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** *([Melting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Melting), [Flowing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Flowing), [Breathing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#_morphing))* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and extremely realistic in style but with a subtle digital/cartoonish form.
- **[Tracers](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[After images](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Colour shifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Scenery slicing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**

#### Geometry

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as somewhat similar in appearance to that of Ayahuasca, Psilocin, and 4-ACO-DMT, with mystical and shamanic undertones which combine with synthetic digital undertones reminiscent of LSD or 2C-E. 2C-T-2’s geometry can be comprehensively described through its [variations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, organic but somewhat synthetic in style, structured in organization, brightly lit and multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, rounded in edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, mostly angular in corners, immersive in depth and consistent in intensity. The visuals have a contradictory “natural” and “synthetic” feel to them which is reminiscent of DOC or 2C-P. Higher dosages are more likely to result in states of [Level 8B](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) visual geometry, but may also lead into [Level 8A](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) visual geometry (as with 2C-T-7).

#### Hallucinatory states

2C-T-2 produces a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. This holds particularly true in comparison to other substances within the phenethylamine family. These effects include:

- **[Transformations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[External hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations)** - In comparison to other psychedelics such as Ayahuasca, 2C-T-2 is very high in external hallucinations. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact manifested as dense solidified geometric matter or physical objects of imagined concepts. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as external in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.
- **[Internal hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations)** - In comparison to other psychedelics such as LSD, 2C-T-2 is very high in hallucinations embedded within visual geometry. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of 2C-T-2 are more common in their occurrence than many more commonly used psychedelics and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly includes:

- **[Enhancements](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)**

**Physical Health Effects, Potential Addiction and Tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational 2C-T-2 use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 2C-T-2 is a research chemical with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried 2C-T-2 within the psychedelic community suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

There is no current data for the LD50 of 2C-T-2, but it is thought to be high.

2C-T-2 does not seem to be physically addictive and many users experience a self-regulating quality, especially due to the physical manifestations of its effects. There seems to be a tolerance build up when used consecutively multiple days in a row which requires one to double their dosage each time to achieve the same effects.

If 2C-T-2 does have MAOI effects, this could indicate that 2C-T-2 is more likely to induce serotonin syndrome, especially at high dosages, than other serotonergic hallucinogens. This may make it dangerous to combine with certain substances such as MDMA, AMT, Ayahuasca or any substance which releases neurotransmitters such serotonin or those with similar pharmacological effects.

**Legal issues:**

- **UK:** 2C-T-2 is a Class A substance making it illegal to possess, manufacture, or import.
- **USA:** 2C-T-2 is a Schedule 1 drug in the USA, making it illegal to possess, manufacture, or import.
- **Australia:** 2C-T-2 is illegal in Australia as of 2005.
- **Belgium:** 2C-T-2 was added to the list of illegal psychotropic substances on Nov 8, 2004.
- **Brazil:** 2C-T-2 is illegal in Brazil as of Feb 18, 2014.
- **Denmark:** 2C-T-2 was added to category B of the controlled substances list on August 23, 2003.
- **E.U.:** EU Council published an order on Dec 6 2003, asking all member states to control 2C-I, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, and TMA-2.
- **Germany:** The drug is on list I / highest level of control, making it unable to be prescribed, manufactured, or possessed as of Oct 7, 1998.
- **Italy:** 2C-T-2 was added to the “Tabella 1” in a Jan 11, 2005 Ministry of Health statement.
- **Japan:** 2C-T-2 is controlled as a “Designated Substance” (Shitei-Yakubutsu) by the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, making it illegal to possess or sell
- **Netherlands:** It was classified as an unregistered pharmaceutical as of April 12, 1999. Unlicensed manufacture, sale, import, trade and possession of this substance can be prosecuted.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, 2C-T-2 offers incredible depth and a full spectrum of deep psychedelic effects with a cognitive head space that’s closer to a tryptamine psychedelic than many other phenylethylamines. The nausea and physical body load is very intense in proportion to 2C-T-7 and other phenylethylamines, which may be very undesirable to some, however it is still completely worthy of its position within the magical half dozen.

Contraindications #
 
- Do not take 2C-T-2 if you are currently taking an MAOI. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorix or Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). 2C-T-2 and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination. Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI. Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. If you have a seizure or convulsive disorder or heart problems, you may be at higher risk for health problems when taking 2C-T-2. Diabetics should monitor their blood sugar closely as there have been some reports of problems. Individuals currently in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval in their everyday lives should be careful about choosing to use psychedelics such as 2C-T-2 as they can trigger even more difficulty. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because psychedelics have been known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
2C-T-2 is neither physically addicting nor likely to cause psychological dependance. Withdrawal effects following discontinuation have not been reported. As with most substances, some people will use it more frequently than they are comfortable with. There is a short period of tolerance after 2C-T-2 use. Using 2C-T-2 two days in a row is likely to lead to a diminished experience the second day, though spaced 5-7 or more days apart, this effect is nearly non-existent.

2C-T-2 was added to category B of the controlled substances list on August 23, 2003. ( [text of law](http://www.retsinfo.dk/delfin/html/b2003/0071405.htm) )
 
Estonia #
 
Estonia added a number of drugs to Schedule I in February 2011. These include MDPV, Methylone, Butylone, Methedrone, Naphyrone, CP 47496, HU-210, JWH-018, JWH-019, JWH-073, JWH-081 ,JWH-200, JWH-250, 2C-I, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, and 3-FMC. See [https://www.riigiteataja.ee/aktilisa/1090/2201/1004/109022011004Lisa1.pdf](https://www.riigiteataja.ee/aktilisa/1090/2201/1004/109022011004Lisa1.pdf) . 2C-B and Mephedrone (4-methylmethcathinone) were already controlled in Estonia. (thanks 1001) (last updated Feb 16 2011)
 
E.U. #
 
EU Council published an order on Dec 6 2003, asking all member states to control 2C-I, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, and TMA-2 within 90. See [Final Rule here](https://erowid.org/../2ci/2ci_law2.shtml) . This binding order went against a non-binding EU Commission's recommendation from earlier in 2003. The Commission did not recommend controlling these chemicals because of lack of evidence of problems: [Commission of the European Communities : Report from the Comission to the Council : TMA-2, 2C-I, 2C-T-2, and 2C-T-7](https://erowid.org/../2ci/2ci_info1.shtml) .

## SYNTHESIS
The following reaction is also a very vigorous one and must be performed in a well ventilated place. To a solution of 400 mL 25% H2SO4 (V/V) in a beaker at least 2 L in size, there was added 54 g of 2,5-dimethoxybenzenesulfonyl chloride, and the mixture was heated on a steam bath. The yellow crystals of the acid chloride floated on the surface of the aqueous layer. There should be 80 g of zinc dust at hand. A small amount of Zn dust was placed at one spot on the surface of this chapeau. With occasional stirring with a glass rod, the temperature was allowed to rise. At about 60 or 70 Â°C an exothermic reaction took place at the spot where the zinc was placed. Additional dollups of zinc were added, and each small exothermic reaction site was spread about with the glass stirring rod. Finally, the reaction spread to the entire solid surface layer, with a melting of the acid chloride and an apparent boiling at the H2O surface. The remainder of the 80 g of zinc dust was added as fast as the size of the reaction container would allow. After things subsided again, the heating was continued for 1 h on the steam bath. After the reaction mixture had cooled to room temperature, it was filtered through paper in a Buchner funnel, and the residual metal washed with 100 mL CH2Cl2. The two-phase filtrate was separated, and the lower, aqueous phase was extracted with 2Ã75 mL CH2Cl2. The addition of 2 L H2O to the aqueous phase now made it the upper phase in extraction, and this was again extracted with 2Ã75 mL CH2Cl2. The organic extracts were pooled (H2O washing is more trouble than it is worth) and the solvent removed under vacuum. The light amber residue (30.0 g) was distilled at 70â80 Â°C at 0.3 mm/Hg to yield 25.3 g 2,5-dimethoxythiophenol as a white oil. This chemical is certainly not centrally active, but it is a most valuable precursor to all members of the 2C-T family.

To a solution of 3.4 g of KOH pellets in 75 mL boiling EtOH, there was added a solution of 10.0 g 2,5-dimethoxythiophenol in 60 mL EtOH followed by 10.9 g ethyl bromide. The reaction was exothermic with the immediate deposition of white solids. This was heated on the steam bath for 1.5 h, added to 1 L H2O, acidified with HCl, and extracted with 3Ã100 mL CH2Cl2. The pooled extracts were washed with 100 mL of 5% NaOH, and the solvent removed under vacuum. The residue was 2,5-dimethoxyphenyl ethyl sulfide which was a pale amber oil, weighed about 10 g and which was sufficiently pure for use in the next reaction without a distillation step.

A mixture of 19.2 POCl3 and 18.0 g N-methylformanilide was heated briefly on the steam bath. To this claret-colored solution there was added the above 2,5-dimethoxyphenyl ethyl sulfide, and the mixture heated an additional 20 min on the steam bath. This was then added to 500 mL of well-stirred warm H2O (pre-heated to 55 Â°C) and the stirring continued for 1.5 h by which time the oily phase had completely solidified to a brown sugar-like consistency. The solids were removed by filtration, and washed with additional H2O. After being sucked as dry as possible, these solids were dissolved in 50 mL boiling MeOH which, after cooling in an ice-bath, deposited almost-white crystals of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(ethylthio)benzaldehyde. After filtration, modest washing with cold MeOH, and air drying to constant weight, there was obtained 11.0 g of product with a mp of 86â88 Â°C. Recrystallization of a small sample again from MeOH provided an analytical sample with mp 87â88 Â°C. Anal. (C11H14O3S) C,H.

To a solution of 11.0 g 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(ethylthio)benzaldehyde in 100 g of nitromethane there was added 0.5 g of anhydrous ammonium acetate, and the mixture was heated on the steam bath for 80 min (this reaction progress must be monitored by TLC, to determine the point at which the starting aldehyde has been consumed). The excess nitromethane was removed under vacuum leaving a residue that spontaneously set to orange-red crystals. These were scraped out to provide 12.9 g crude 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylthio-Î²-nitrostyrene with a mp of 152â154 Â°C. A sample recrystallized from toluene was pumpkin colored and had a mp of 148â149 Â°C. Another sample from acetone melted at 149 Â°C sharp, and was light orange. From IPA came spectacular fluorescent orange crystals, with a mp 151â152 Â°C. Anal. (C12H15NO4S) C,H.

A suspension of 12.4 g LAH in 500 mL anhydrous THF was stirred under He. To this there was added 12.4 g 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylthio-Î²-nitrostyrene in a little THF, and the mixture was held at reflux for 24 h. After the reaction mixture had returned to room temperature, the excess hydride was destroyed by the cautious addition of 60 mL IPA, followed by 20 mL of 5% NaOH followed, in turn, by sufficient H2O to give a white granular character to the oxides. The reaction mixture was filtered, and the filter cake washed first with THF and then with MeOH. Removing the solvents from the combined filtrate and washings under vacuum provided 9.5 g of a yellow oil. This was added to 1 L dilute HCl and washed with 2Ã100 mL CH2Cl2 which removed all color. After making the aqueous phase basic with 25% NaOH, it was extracted with 3Ã100 mL CH2Cl2, the extracts pooled, and the solvent removed under vacuum to provide 7.3 g of a pale amber oil. Distillation at 120â130 Â°C at 0.3 mm/Hg gave 6.17 g of a clear white oil. This was dissolved in 80 mL IPA and neutralized with concentrated HCl, forming immediate crystals of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylthiophenethylamine hydrochloride (2C-T-2). An equal volume of anhydrous Et2O was added and, after complete grinding and mixing, the salt was removed by filtration, washed with Et2O, and air dried to constant weight. The resulting white crystals weighed 6.2 g.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 20 mg) âI chose 2C-T-2 at this dose level because the lateness of getting started, and I wanted a shorter experience with my daughter and her family around. I feel, however, that I have somewhat less of a body load with 2C-T-7. Today I was badly in need of the help that might possibly come from this material, and today it was my ally. I sorely needed the type of help that it afforded. The result was to work off the heavy feeling of tiredness and lack of motivation that had been hounding me. The next day I felt that I had dropped my burden.â

(with 20 mg) âThere is a neutralness to this. I am at the maximum, and I am asking myself, âAm I enjoying this?â  And the answer is, âNo, I am experiencing it.â  Enjoyment seems beside the point. It is a rather intensely matter-of-fact +3. Is it interesting? Yes, but mostly in expectation of further developments. Is it inspiring? No. Is it negative? No. Am I glad I took it? Yes. Not glad. Satisfied and contented. This is a controlled +3. No threat. The body is all right. Not superbly healthyâbut OK. Of no interest, either way. If I were to define the bodyâs state, I would have to define it in image. The image is of a not comfortable state of being clenched. Clenched? Well, carefully bound in control.â

(with 22 mg) âA slow onset. It took an hour for a plus one, and almost another two hours to get to a +++. Very vivid fantasy images, eyes closed, but no blurring of lines between ârealityâ and fantasy. Some yellow-grey patterns a la psilocybin. Acute diarrhea at about the fourth hour but no other obvious physical problems. Erotic lovely. Good material for unknown number of possible uses. Can explore for a long time. Better try 20 milligrams next time.â

(with 25 mg) âI was at a +++ in an hour! It is most difficult to do even ordinary things. I took notes but now I canât find them. This is much too high for anything creative, such as looking at pictures or trying to read. Talking is OK. And to my surprise I was able to get to sleep, and a good sleep, at the seven hour point.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
A point of potential misidentification should be mentioned here. 2C-T-2 has occasionally been called, simply, T-2. This abbreviated nickname has also been used for T-2 Toxin, a mycotoxin of the Tricothecene group, formed mainly by the Fusarium spp. This is the infamous âwarfare agentâ in Southeast Asia, which was finally identified as bee feces rather than a Soviet military adventure. T-2 and 2C-T-2 are radically different compounds.

All three Tweetios of 2C-T-2 have been made and looked at through human eyes. The 2-EtO-homologue of 2C-T-2 is 2-ethoxy-4-ethylthio-5-methoxyphenethylamine, or 2CT2-2ETO. The benzaldehyde (2-ethoxy-4-ethylthio-5-methoxybenzaldehyde) had a melting point of 73â75 Â°C, the nitrostyrene intermediate a melting point of 122â123 Â°C, and the final hydrochloride a melting point of 202â204 Â°C. Fifty milligrams was a completely effective level. The effects were felt very quickly. Vision was blurred, and there were intense eyes-closed visuals and the generation of a pleasant, contemplative mood. Baseline was re-established in five or six hours, but sleep was restless, with weird dreams. Nasal administration showed considerable variation between individuals, but a typical dose was 10 milligrams.

The 5-EtO-homologue of 2C-T-2 is 5-ethoxy-4-ethylthio-2-methoxyphenethylamine, or 2CT2-5ETO. The benzaldehyde (5-ethoxy-4-ethylthio-2-methoxybenzaldehyde) had a melting point of 49 Â°C, but it was impure. The nitrostyrene intermediate melted at 107â108 Â°C, and the final hydrochloride had a melting point of 180 Â°C. At levels of 20 milligrams, there was a slow, gentle climb to a full effect at the third or fourth hour. The flooding of thoughts and easy conversation lasted for many hours, and on some occasion a sedative was needed at the 16 hour point. There was a feeling of being drained for the following day or two. Some intoxication was still noted in the second day. Again it is true here, as had been stated as a generality, that the 5-Tweetio analogues have potencies similar to that of the parent compound, but show a much longer duration. The nickname of âforever yoursâ had been applied. There may indeed be insight, but 24 hoursâ worth is an awful lot of insight.

The 2,5-DiEtO-homologue of 2C-T-2 is 2,5-diethoxy-4-ethylthiophenethylamine, or 2CT2-2,5DIETO. The benzaldehyde, 2,5-diethoxy-4-(ethylthio)benzaldehyde, had a melting point of 84â85 Â°C, the nitrostyrene intermediate a melting point of 123â124 Â°C, and the final hydrochloride a melting point of 220â221 Â°C. Levels that were evaluated from 10 to 50 milligrams were not particularly different in intensity, but were progressively longer in duration. At 50 milligrams there was a nervousness and edginess during the early part of the experience, but for the next several hours there was evident both energy and high attentiveness. There were few if any sensory alterations. There were no negatives on the following day. The duration was perhaps nine hours.

**2,5-Dimethoxy-4-ethylthiophenethylamine** (also known as **2C-T-2** , and **Rosy** ) is a [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) chemical class that produces psychedelic effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Route_of_administration) . It is a member of the [2C-x family](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x_family) of psychedelic phenethylamines, all of which were derived from the systematic modification of the [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) molecule.

2C-T-2 was first synthesized and tested for activity in humans by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) in 1981 and described in his 1991 book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) ("Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved"). It is a member of the so-called "magical half-dozen" which refers to Shulgin's self-rated most important [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) -derived compounds, all of which except [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) he developed and synthesized himself. They are found within the first book of [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) , and are as follows: [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [DOM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOM) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , 2C-E, 2C-T-2 and [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) .

Anecdotal reports generally characterize 2C-T-2 as a highly dose sensitive psychedelic known for its open headspace and unpredictable [body load](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Body_load) .

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 2C-T-2, and it has a relatively short history of human usage. Many reports also indicate that its physical effects may be too severe for those who are not already experienced with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) or suffer from pre-existing physical conditions. It is highly advised to approach this [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) substance with the proper amount of precaution and [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using it.

## History and culture

Following the initial positive results found by Shulgin's research group, a more formal study was carried out by psychedelic psychotherapy pioneer Myron J. Stolaroff who was interested in evaluating the potential use of 2C-T-2 in psychotherapy. Based on the experiences of forty participants in the study who took 2C-T-2, Stolaroff compared the effects favorably to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , describing it as more emotionally opening and permitting a wider exploration of feelings and thoughts.

## Chemistry

2C-T-2, or 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylthiophenethylamine, is a substituted [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain. 2C-T-2 belongs to the 2C family of phenethylamines which contain methoxy functional groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 of the benzene ring. 2C-T-2 is also substituted at R 4 with an ethyl thioether group.

2C-T-2 is a close structural analogue of [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) ; the two differ by the length of the alkane chain in their thioether functional group.

## Pharmacology

The mechanism of action that produces 2C-T-2’s [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) and [entheogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogen) effects has not been established in scientific literature; however, its primary psychedelic effects are more than likely a result of its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . This mechanism of action is shared by many other psychedelic [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) and [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) .

Athough no established scientific experiments have been performed to establish MAO-A inhibition of 2C-T-2, phenethylamine derivatives substituted with an alkylthio group at the 4 position (4-MTA, and the 2,5-desmethoxy derivative of [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) ) are known to act as selective [monoamine oxidase A inhibitors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Furthermore, many compounds of the amphetamine-analogs of the [2C-T-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-x) have been found to have highly selective MAO-A inhibition . Therefore, this substance may likewise have [MAOI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) effects.

However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - 2C-T-2 is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is quite comparable to that of other [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) such as [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) and [2C-P](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-P) .
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of 2C-T-2 can be described as very intense and uncomfortable in comparison to [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) . In high doses, it's capable of causing painful cramping. It is similar yet distinct from the "body high" experienced on [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) , but is considered much more unpleasant. The sensation itself can be described as intense and may manifest itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)** - Although this component is capable of manifesting itself in a distinct and noticeable fashion for most users, it does not generally seem to be as apparent or intense as the same component found within [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) .
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Extreme nausea is commonly reported when consumed in moderate to high doses and either passes once the tripper has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in. It can be described as very painful and violent in comparison to [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) or [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) .
- **[Stomach cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stomach_cramps)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)**
- **[Diarrhea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diarrhea)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** 
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)** ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#_morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and extremely realistic in style but with a subtle digital/cartoon-like form.
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry that is present throughout this experience can be described as somewhat similar in appearance to that of [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) , [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , and [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) with mystical and shamanic undertones which combine with synthetic digital undertones reminiscent of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) . 2C-T-2's geometry can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, organic but somewhat synthetic in style, structured in organization, brightly lit and multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, rounded in edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, mostly angular in corners, immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity. The visuals have a contradictory natural and synthetic feel to them which is reminiscent of [DOC](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOC) or [2C-P](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-P) . Higher doses are more likely to result in states of [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_geometry) visual geometry, but may also lead into [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) visual geometry (as with [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) ).
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
At common to high doses, 2C-T-2 is capable of producing a full range of high-level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. This holds particularly true in comparison to other substances within the [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) family. These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - In comparison to other psychedelics such as [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) , 2C-T-2 is very high in external hallucinations. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and [autonomous entity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entity) contact manifested as dense solidified geometric matter or physical objects of imagined concepts. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as external in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme.
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - In comparison to other psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , 2C-T-2 is very high in hallucinations embedded within visual geometry. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The head space of 2C-T-2 is described by many as one which is both insightful and relatively normal in its thought processes even at moderate to high doses. 
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is consistent in its manifestation and is [outrospection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Outrospection) dominant.
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops)**
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)**

### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: 2C-T-2](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_2CT2.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 2C-T-2 use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown.

Anecdotal reports suggest that there are no negative health effects attributed to trying this drug, but nothing can be completely guaranteed.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

2C-T-2 is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 2C-T-2 is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 2C-T-2 presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 2C-T-2 all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

If 2C-T-2 does have [MAOI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) effects as has been speculated, [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] this could indicate that 2C-T-2 is more likely to induce [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) or general [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) overload (especially at high dosages) than other [serotonergic psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelic) . This may make it dangerous to combine it with other [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs) , [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) and certain substances which promotes the release of neurotransmitters such as [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) or [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) . These substances include but are not limited to:

  "wikipedia": `# 2C-T-2
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2C-T-2*

2C-T-2, also known as 4-ethylthio-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine and 2C families. It is taken orally.
The drug acts as a serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor.
2C-T-2 was discovered by Alexander Shulgin in 1981 and was first described in the scientific literature by Myron Stolaroff in 1990.

## Use and effects

In Alexander Shulgin's book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), the dose range is listed as 12 to 25 mg orally and its duration as 6 to 8 hours. Its onset is within 1 hour and peak effects occur after 1 to 2 hours. The effects of 2C-T-2 have been described. Shulgin rated it as one of the "magical half-dozen" most important psychedelic phenethylamines, along with mescaline, 2C-B, 2C-T-7, and others.

## Toxicity

A potential risk of neurotoxicity from 2C-T-2 use (and 2C chemical series in general) has been shown in serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons, however the assay used concentrations unlikely to translate to recreational use of the compound (>50 μM). This has also been shown to be magnified in serotonergic-containing cells with combined use of 2C series drugs with alcohol, MDMA, and methamphetamine.
Severe 'intoxication' on 2C series drugs has been observed as behavior that includes: intense hallucinations, agitation, aggression, violence, dysphoria, hypertension, tachycardia, seizures, and hyperthermia.

## Interactions

2C-T-2 is metabolized by the monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes MAO-A and MAO-B. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as phenelzine, tranylcypromine, moclobemide, and selegiline may potentiate the effects of 2C-T-2. This may result in overdose and serious toxicity.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

2C-T-2 acts as a serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. The mechanism of action that produces 2C-T-2's hallucinogenic effects is shown to be most likely a result from action as a serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C serotonin receptor agonist, a mechanism of action shared by the psychedelic tryptamines and phenethylamines to varying degrees. 2C-T-2 has also shown to be a partial agonist of adrenergic receptors.

## Chemistry

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 2C-T-2 has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of 2C-T-2 include 2C-T (2C-T-1), 2C-T-4, 2C-T-7, Aleph-2, and 25T2-NBOMe, among others.

## History

2C-T-2 was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in 1981. He discovered its psychedelic effects that same year. The drug was first described in the scientific literature by Myron Stolaroff in 1990. Subsequently, it was described in greater detail in a 1991 publication by Shulgin and colleagues and in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved). Following this, 2C-T-2 emerged as a novel designer drug in the 1990s.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Argentina

2C-T-2 is also a controlled substance in Argentina as well as 2C-B and 2C-I.

#### Australia

2C-T-2 is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.

#### Canada

As of October 31, 2016, 2C-T-2 is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada.

#### China

As of October 2015 2C-T-2 is a controlled substance in China.

#### Finland

2C-T-2 is classified as a narcotic drug in Finland.

#### Netherlands

The Netherlands became the first country in the world to ban 2C-T-2, and classify it as a hard drug, by law. In April, 1999, 2C-T-2 became a list I drug of the Opium Law.

#### Sweden

Schedule I in Sweden. 2C-T-2 was first classified as "health hazard" under the act Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor (translated Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) as of April 1, 1999, under SFS 1999:58 that made it illegal to sell or possess. The Riksdag added 2C-T-2 to Narcotic Drugs Punishments Act under Swedish schedule I ("substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use") as of March 16, 2004, published by Medical Products Agency (MPA) in regulation LVFS 2004:3 listed as 2C-T-2, 2,5-dimetoxi-4-etyltiofenetylamin.

#### United Kingdom

2C-T-2 and all other compounds featured in PiHKAL are illegal drugs in the United Kingdom.

#### United States

2C-T-2 is specifically listed as a schedule I substance under SEC. 1152 of S.3187: Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012.
