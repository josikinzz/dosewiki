## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aralkylamines. These are alkylamines in which the alkyl group is substituted at one carbon atom by an aromatic hydrocarbyl group.

### Background

Trihexyphenidyl is a centrally acting muscarinic antagonist used for treatment of parkinsonism and drug-induced extrapyramidal disorders.
11
,
12
Its discovery was published in 1949 in a study looking for drugs with antispasmodic activity.
9
Trihexyphenidyl is rarely used in the treatment of parkinsonism, and is not a first line treatment due to significant adverse effects.
15
It has largely been replaced by drugs such as
levodopa
.
15
Trihexyphenidyl was granted FDA approval on 13 May 1949.
10

### Indication

Tihexyphenidyl is indicated as an adjunct in the treatment of parkinsonism, an adjuvant in the treatment of parkinsonism with levodopa, and in the control of extrapyramidal disorders caused by central nervous system drugs.
11
,
12

### Pharmacodynamics

Trihexyphenidyl is an antimuscarinic indicated as an adjunct in the treatment of parkinsonism or as a treatment for drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms.
11
,
12
It has a long duration of action as it does not need to be given every day.
13
It has a wide therapeutic window, with acute toxicity being non fatal in doses as high as 300 mg.
13
Patients should have their iridocorneal angle examined before and intraocular pressure monitored during therapy.
13
Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of anhidrosis and hyperthermia.
13

### Mechanism of Action

### Absorption

Trihexyphenidyl is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Trihexyphenidyl reaches a C
max
of 7.2 ng/mL, with a  T
max
of 1.3 hours, and an AUC of 201 ng*h/mL.

### Metabolism

Data regarding the metabolism of trihexyphenidyl are not readily available.
1
However, it is likely not heavily metabolized.
1

### Half-life

The mean elimination half life of trihexyphenidyl is 3.2 ± 0.3 hours.
7

### Toxicity

Symptoms of overdose include mydriasis, dryness of mucous membranes, red face, atonic states of bowels and bladder, and hyperthermia in high doses. Trihexyphenidyl causes agitation, confusion, and hallucinations due to its effects on the central nervous system. Untreated overdose may result in death, especially in children. Respiratory depression and cardiac arrest may be seen as premortal signs.
Patients experiencing an overdose of trihexyphenidyl may experience dry mouth, anhidrosis, mydriasis, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, hyperpyrexia, reduced gastrointestinal motility, urinary hesitancy or retention, rash, hyperthermia, confusion, restlessness, agitation, poor coordination, paranoia, psychosis, delirium, hallucinations, coma, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, and death.
1
Patients should be treated with symptomatic and supportive care which may include airway maintenance and the use of
physostigmine
.

### Mechanism of action

Trihexyphenidyl is a non-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist but binds with higher affinity to the M1 subtype.
2
In vivo studies have shown that trihexyphenidyl demonstrates higher affinity for central muscarinic receptors located in the cerebral cortex and lower affinity for those located peripherally.
2
,
3
Other studies suggest that trihexyphenidyl may modify nicotinic acetylcholine receptor neurotransmission, leading indirectly to enhanced dopamine release in the striatum.
5
Although the anticholinergic has proven to be useful in the treatment of symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease or other movement disorders, its mechanism of action has yet to be fully elucidated.

### General Function

Binds water, Ca(2+), Na(+), K(+), fatty acids, hormones, bilirubin and drugs (Probable). Its main function is the regulation of the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood (Probable). Major zinc transporter in plasma, typically binds about 80% of all plasma zinc (PubMed:19021548). Major calcium and magnesium transporter in plasma, binds approximately 45% of circulating calcium and magnesium in plasma (By similarity). Potentially has more than two calcium-binding sites and might additionally bind calcium in a non-specific manner (By similarity). The shared binding site between zinc and calcium at residue Asp-273 suggests a crosstalk between zinc and calcium transport in the blood (By similarity). The rank order of affinity is zinc > calcium > magnesium (By similarity). Binds to the bacterial siderophore enterobactin and inhibits enterobactin-mediated iron uptake of E.coli from ferric transferrin, and may thereby limit the utilization of iron and growth of enteric bacteria such as E.coli (PubMed:6234017). Does not prevent iron uptake by the bacterial siderophore aerobactin (PubMed:6234017)

**Deliriant use is associated with highly uncomfortable and/or dangerous experiences.**
 
[Deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriants) are highly unpredictable and may result in erratic behaviors, self-injury, hospitalization, or death. It should be noted that most individuals do not choose to repeat the experience due to its unpleasant nature.
 
Please use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_use) if using this substance (e.g. starting with a low dose and always having a [trip sitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Trip_sitter) ). Refer to [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriants#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) for more details.
**Trihexyphenidyl** ( **THP** , **benzhexol** , **trihex** , **Artane** , and others) is an [anticholinergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anticholinergic) substance of the [antimuscarinic](/w/index.php?title=Antimuscarinic&action=edit&redlink=1) class used to treat stiffness, tremors, spasms, and poor muscle control. In high doses, it has been reported to act as a [deliriant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriant) .

Trihexyphenidyl has been used for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease as approved by the FDA in the United States since 2003. It is also used for the treatment of drug-induced movement disorders such as essential tremors and akathisia, commonly caused by [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) .

## History and culture

Neurologist and author Dr. [Oliver Sacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Sacks) reported using the drug recreationally in the 1960s, he recalled taking "a large dose" knowing full well the drug was intended for people with Parkinson's.

During the 1970s, THP (trade name **Parkan** ) was the most popular recreational prescription drug in Hungary. In 2008, a news report mentioned that trihexyphenidyl was seen to be used for recreational purposes among Iraqi soldiers and police, stating that the drugs were taken to relieve combat stress reaction. While that was the case for some, others used it as a substitute or more intense version of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . This was especially prevalent in the 1960s, according to a report in *"The New Yorker"* . Similarly to those in Iraqi forces, some of the appeal was that the individual may retain partial control while under the influence.

Trihexyphenidyl (THP,  benzhexol, trihex, marketed as Artane and others) is an antispasmodic drug used to treat stiffness, tremors, spasms, and poor muscle control. It is an agent of the antimuscarinic class and is often used  in management of Parkinson's disease. It was approved by the FDA for the treatment of Parkinson's in the US in 1949.
Trihexyphenidyl is a therapeutic alternative on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.

## Medical uses

Trihexyphenidyl is used for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease in mono and combination therapy.
Trihexyphenidyl has also been prescribed for essential tremor and akathisia.
In pediatrics, it has been used for children with dystonia due to cerebral palsy, and to control drooling.
In organophosphate poisoning, trihexyphenidyl is a more effective antidote than atropine to counteract the cholinergic crisis, seizures, and neuropathology.

## Contraindications

Contraindications include according to the Therapeutic Goods Administration Australia from 2022:

Hypersensitivity to trihexyphenidyl
Narrow angle glaucoma
Ileus (disruption of the normal propulsive ability of the intestine)
Caution: People with obstructive diseases of the urogenital tract, people with a known history of seizures and those with potentially dangerous tachycardia

## Adverse effects

Dose-dependent side effects are frequent, but typically lessen over time as the body adapts to the medication. All of the following symptoms considered, Artane has been shown to dramatically and consistently improve neurologic defects in people aged 16–86 over the course of five years. People who are older or who have psychiatric conditions may become confused or develop delirium. Side effects include but are not limited to:

Central nervous system: drowsiness, vertigo, headache, and dizziness are frequent. With high doses nervousness, agitation, anxiety, delirium, and confusion are noted. Trihexyphenidyl may be abused due to a short acting mood-elevating and euphoric effect. The normal sleep architecture may be altered (REM sleep depression). Trihexyphenidyl may lower the seizure-threshold.
Peripheral side effects: dry mouth, impaired sweating, abdominal discomfort, nausea, and constipation are frequent. Tachycardia or heart palpitations (fast heart rate) may be noted. Allergic reactions are rare, but may occur. Many of these peripheral symptoms, especially considering an acute increase in anxiety with various physical complaints, as well as evidence of orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia are indicative of withdrawal, especially in people with psychiatric conditions 
Eyes: trihexyphenidyl causes mydriasis with or without photophobia. It may precipitate narrow angle glaucoma or cause blurred vision.
Tolerance may develop during therapy which requires dose adjustments.
Striated musculature and weight gain.

## Overdose

Trihexyphenidyl and other antiparkinsonian drugs are known to be substances of abuse. This is true both in  abusers of other substances and in chronic schizophrenics, the latter being infrequent abusers of other drugs.
Overdose mimics an atropine intoxication with dryness of mucous membranes, red face, bowel and bladder paralysis, and hyperthermia in high doses. Central nervous system consequences are agitation, confusion, and hallucinations. An untreated overdose may be fatal, particularly in children. Premortal signs are respiratory depression, arrhythmia and cardiac arrest.
A case report of 24-hour long arrhythmia was treated with verapamil.
Excessive myoclonus can be complicated by rhabdomyolysis; in one case risk  was increased due to concomitant use of risperidone.

## Interactions

Other anticholinergic drugs (e.g. spasmolytics, antihistamines, TCAs) : Side effects of trihexyphenidyl may be increased.
Quinidine : Increased anticholinergic action (particular on AV conduction).
Antipsychotics : Long term use of trihexyphenidyl  may mask or increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia.
Pethidine (meperidine) : Central effects and side effects of pethidine may be increased.
Metoclopramide : Action of metoclopramide is decreased.
Alcohol : Risk of serious intoxication.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Trihexyphenidyl is an anticholinergic. It is specifically an antimuscarinic and acts as a non-selective antagonist of all five muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. However, its antagonistic activity is much stronger at the muscarinic acetylcholine M1 and M4 receptors, and it can be described as selective for these receptors.
The exact mechanism of action in parkinsonian syndromes is not precisely understood, but it is known that trihexyphenidyl blocks efferent impulses in parasympathetically innervated structures like smooth muscles (spasmolytic activity), salivary glands, and eyes (mydriasis). In higher doses direct central inhibition of cerebral motor centers may contribute. In very high doses central toxicity as seen in atropine overdose is noted.
It possibly also binds to dopamine receptors.

### Pharmacokinetics

Trihexyphenidyl is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The onset of action is within 1 hour after oral dosing. The peak activity is noted after 2 to 3 hours. The duration of action of one single dose is 6 to 12 hours in a dose dependent manner. It is excreted in the urine, probably as unchanged drug. More precise data in animals and humans have so far not been determined.

## History

Trihexyphenidyl has been clinically relevant in trials pertaining to Parkinson's disease since 1949.
In the US, the Food and Drug Association approved Artane, or its generic form Trihexyphenidyl HCL, in June 2003, for the clinical use of all types of parkinsonism.

## Society and culture

### Recreational use

The neurologist Oliver Sacks reported using the drug recreationally in the 1960s. He recalled taking "a large dose" knowing full well the drug was intended for people with Parkinson's. More recounts of Dr. Sacks' experiences — including experimentation with mescaline, psilocybin, LSD, and probably DMT — have been compared in his book Hallucinations.
During the 1970s, trihexyphenidyl (trade name Parkan) was the most popular recreationally used prescription drug in Hungary.
In a 2008 news report, trihexyphenidyl was seen to be used for recreational purposes among Iraqi soldiers and police, among other prescription drugs. The report states that the drugs were taken to relieve combat stress reaction. Although that may be the case for some, others used Artane as a substitute or more intense version of LSD. This was especially prevalent in the 1960s, according to a report in "The New Yorker". Similarly to those in Iraqi forces, some of the appeal was that the individual may retain partial control while under the influence. It is still diverted from its primary use, in combination with other drugs, on the Réunion island (France).

## Chemistry

Trihexyphenidyl can be synthesized in two ways, one linear and one convergent synthesis.
In the first way, the initial 2-(1-piperidino)propiophenone is synthesized in turn by the aminomethylation of acetophenone using paraformaldehyde and piperidine in a Mannich reaction. In the second step the 2-(1-piperidino)propiophenone is reacted with cyclohexylmagnesium bromide in a Grignard reaction.

### Stereochemistry

Trihexyphenidyl has a chiral center and two enantiomers. Medications are racemates.
