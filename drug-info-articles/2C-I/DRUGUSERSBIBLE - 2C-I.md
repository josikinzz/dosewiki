## Subjective Experience

First synthesised by Alexander Shulgin in 1976, 2C-I began to emerge as a popular
recreational drug in the late 1990’s. Sometimes confused with 2C-I-NBOMe and
dubbed with the name Smiles by the media, it was no surprise when it was scheduled
in the United States in 2012. It had already been classified in the UK in 1998.

My sample came in the form of an 18mg pill, reputedly sourced from China and
pressed in the UK. I tested it on a swelteringly hot summer’s day; the sort of day on
which it is difficult to escape the background heat. This was one of the reasons I went
low with the dose: uncomfortable body load could well be multiplied in such
conditions.

```
T+0:00 I weigh the pill and then break it into pieces, accumulating 9mg on
the scales. I swig the crumbled debris down with spring water. The operation
isn’t particularly clean and I catch the unpleasantness of the taste and
constitution of the pill at the back of my throat. [15:20]
```

```
T+0:20 Only the mildest of mental stimulation is apparent, but I do feel a
little more comfortable with the conditions.
```
```
T+0:40 The hazy headspace has only developed a little, but there is now a
light sheen to vision.
```
```
T+1:00 There is a sweaty touchy feel to this, with the familiar dreamy 2C type
of mindset, which is quite smooth, although unexciting. Rationality is fully
maintained, although as is often the case with 2C’s, concentration upon
specific external factors or subject matter can be heightened from time to
time.
```
```
I hesitate to use the word comfortable again, but that is the general vibe as I
walk around. There are no real visuals to report.
```
```
T+1:15 This is quite a physical experience: sentient, clammy hands, with horn
available. The headspace is now more solid and the sheen on my vision has
strengthened, but not into any definable OEVs or CEVs.
```
```
It is quite pleasant at this point. I notice that my pupils are semi-dilated.
```
```
T+2:00 I have been on a plateau for some time. This will clearly go no further.
It is stable with the mild dreamy mood and the tactile body warmth.
```
```
T+3:00 I have now started to slide down the gears. The gentle psychedelic
headiness remains, as does the warmth and sensuality, but at increasingly
lower levels.
```
```
T+5:00 I bathe in the afterglow, with the dying embers of enhanced
colouration and the soft landing of the head and body high flowing down
towards base.
```
```
With certain senses enhanced and anxieties chased away a walk into suburbia
becomes a genuine pleasure.
```
```
I retire to bed at 11:30pm, eight hours after initial ingestion.
```
```
T+16:00 I drifted off fairly quickly and the night’s sleep was a good one. This
morning I feel completely normal.
```
Overall, on this dose this was a fairly mild and pleasant experience. It didn’t have the
depth of, for example, 2C-E, or indeed, a great deal of excitement, but for a gentle
afternoon sojourn it was positive and enjoyable.

For a fully engaged psychedelic ride I suspect that the consensus, of a dose of
perhaps 12-15mg, is probably about right.
