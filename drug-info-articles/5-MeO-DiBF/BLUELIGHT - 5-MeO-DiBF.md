5-MeO-DIBF is the benzofuran homologue of 5-MeO-DiPT.


![o47wNbV.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fo47wNbV.png&hash=29bf5654702f5fdd5691ae33f5cc6ab8)


The closest known substance to this is [Dimemebfe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimemebfe), which would be the benzofuran homologue of 5-MeO-DMT.


After most tryptamines were banned in the UK a while ago, this one appears to be their successor (technically not a tryptamine though).

This looks like 2C-x-hemidragonfly with the sidechain moved from position 4 to position 3. I wonder what putting a halogen on the 7 position would do.

It may remind you of that, but it should be relatively bioisosteric with tryptamines for which different rules are true for substituting them. And if I recall correctly, substituting here on 6 or 7 would not do a lot of good... I just don't think the phenyl ring is in quite the same place with phens and trypts when it binds / activates 5HT receptors - so its another ballgame.

If you got it from that shady UK vendor then you didn't get 5-MeO-BFE.

Nichols found that the indolic N-->S analogue of DMT was inactive.  I don't see any reason why this one would be any different.

But Dresden, this one has already been tested (at least in animals), they didn't invent the binding data!

The difference between sulfur and oxygen properties in both inorganic and organic compounds is actually quite prominent. In this case the most important difference is that the oxygen atom in dimemebfe can function as a hydrogen bond acceptor while the sulfur atom in the sulfur analogue can't.


I've always imagined this to be a chilled out "perception enhancer" (kind of like 2C-D) as the binding data may suggest. So no matter how disappointing it is as a psychedelic, I'd gladly try it some day.

I received 250mg of 5-MeO-DIBF on Friday and I must say was better than expected. I first tried 10-20 mg insufflated.(Smells a bit like onions/garlic.)

 You can certainly feel the effects almost instantly. Nice warm glow nowhere near AMT level, but the selling point of AMT replacement wasn't exactly false advertising. 

I didn't benefit much from higher doses at 25-50mg orally as you would do AMT, but had dilated pupils well into Monday. So sir serotonin didn't fail me there..


Actually preferred this over the 5 tabs of 1-propionyl-lysergic acid diethylamide I wasted my money on. 


So bottom line, If you prefer the lack of trippyness of 1P-LSD over the warmth of AMT/MDMA you might just like it.

^How long does an oral dose last?


Probably far too soon to ask this, but can anyone compare to 5-Meo-MiPT/DiPT, specifically the bodyload? 5-Meo-MiPT has become my drug of choice for hour-long dancing, so anything that compares sparks my interest. I hope it's more worthwhile than 5-Meo-DALT for me

I would say 8-12 hours orally for me personally, and yes its certainly more worthwhile than DALT.

Just wanted to say I think it's likely you didn't get 1p-LSD, almost every report describes it as almost identical to LSD and very strong and psychedelic.


This sounds pretty interesting though from your assessment.

How strong was your oral trip at 50mg? Duration of higher doses could be pretty damn long.

I found the effects of 5-MeO-DIBF orally not as effective, sounds strange maybe a bioavailability issue which someone may be able to elaborate on in the future.

That said the form it came in was perfect for insufflation unlike most rc's and AMT.


 For further experiments I will try smoking <5mg or even less just placed under the tongue.

No need to trip every 2 days, give it at least a week between experiments!


We don't exactly know how it works (5-HT agonism (pretty much confirmed), monoamine reuptake (likely) or release (unlikely) or even monoamine oxidase inhibition (even more unlikely)) yet, but tolerance to its psychedelic effects probably lasts about a week.

Oh trust me it was 1p-LSD and yes it was very trippy and psychedelic, just not what I like personally.. Amt isn't psychedelic in the tradition sense given the name. As you know.


So would really appreciate if the moderator/druggie policeman/commuinty support officer/hypocrite that works for free giving contradictory advice to people like himself. Would wait before trying to undermine real experiments.. 


Or in this case editing my post so his criticisms have value they don't.


Scientific method of testing?

1. Roi is not a moderator. Moderators are clearly marked out with the under-name title.

2. I edited your post. When a moderator edits a post they leave a reason for doing so. You can clearly see this at the bottom of the post along with who edited it. The reason I gave was "please don't double post" because you posted twice in a short space of time. Please use the edit feature instead of doing this, especially for novel substance threads as it makes it hard to find useful information.

3. Roi's advice is extremely pertinent. If you just want to get high that's fine but if you are trying to make a useful contribution to our collective knowledge then repeated doses through different ROAs in a short space of time is not productive and may even be dangerous.


As this is a very novel substance we will be removing off-topic and social chatter to make this a more useful resource for posterity. Please keep such conversations to private messages or the social threads.

There is nothing "counterproductive" about being careful when trying a new substance and taking one's time to make sure that the information is useful to others.


Even if your goal is just to get high then it's not counterproductive because I can assure you that corpses are not able to get high.

Might end up not being enough to really be active, I know for a fact that you need a relative shit-ton of 5-Meo-MiPT before it starts being active vaporized. But, we know absolutely zero about this compound so it's a great place to start.


And yeah, would wait 2 weeks between trials *at least*. This is a very novel compound, and you're playing with fire. In the name of science, yeah, but still. Better make sure that at least the science is right then.

Personally, I would be fairly surprised if all psychedelics exerted cross tolerance on each other.  For example, I don't think MDA and LSD do, but someone correct me if that's wrong.

I removed a couple of posts because they had nothing to do with this substance.  This isn't a social thread, it's a thread for information about a novel substance (a very novel substance).  By the way I think Dresden is commenting on people's discussion of psychedelic tolerance in this thread, not posting in the wrong thread.


Regarding waiting longer between doses, no one is being the moral police here.  It's not a moral issue.  The fact of the matter is, if you dose this substance more frequently than once a week, your results are skewed.  I mean feel free to do it if that's what you want to do (and believe me, I've dosed psychedelics far more often than once a week during periods of time), but you won't be contributing to the knowledge base in a very effective way if you do it.  That's what people are saying, and it's true.


So, let's discuss this substance.  Thanks for your input Dalai Lala, yours is the first report I've heard.

I'v never mentioned waiting between doses (not that you shouldn't) .. I love how a single comment can change the direction of a whole thread.

5-Meo-BFE seems to bind to 1/3th to 1/6th less to 5ht2a than 5-Meo-DiPT, according to the abstract from the Purdue paper, but both 1P-LSD (if it's a prodrug at least) and this should have notable activity at 5ht1a, so they definitely influence each other. More so the other way around though, the euphoria from this should come from Oxytocin release through 5HT1a binding. Regardless, I think this could influence the 1P-LSD *just* enough to make it seem less interesting, while still *feeling* active.


Take note for when you decide to indulge with 1P-LSD again, Dalai Lala, it could be that you underestimate that substance due to **hypothetical** tolerance

Seeing as no one has done a trip report on this substance yet, here is mine, probably the one of the first guinea pigs to try it this substance.


I received a free sample of a new legal Tryptamine analogue in the UK from a well known UK source. It consisting of 250 mg of 5-MeO-DIBF (or 5-methoxy-di-isopropyl-benzofuran) in a fine white powder. Subject was told this was the .HCL salt version of the compound. This compound is not available on the internet yet through any vendors that I know of but will go on sale to the public soon, depending on feedback.


5-MeO-DIBF is the benzofuran homologue of 5-MeO-DIPT (replacing the indole Nitrogen bond with a Oxygen bond). This is the same way Dimemebfe (5-MeO-BFE) is the benzofuran homologue of 5-MeO-DMT (see wikipedia). Please do not confuse this with 5-MeO-BFE, they are two separate compounds. Its like comparing 5-MeO-DMT to 5-MeO-DIPT which both have completely different effects.


Note dosages were expected to be 3-6 times higher than 5-MeO-DIPT and orally active without an MAOI (unlike 5-MeO-DMT). Subject seems to be one of the first people to write a report on this very compound on the internet and only received the sample a week ago, its early days.


**Subject Background:**


**Set:**

 - It is still morning and subject has been awake over 2 hours.

 - Subject is at home alone in his living room during this experience with a Cable TV, Laptop, Music, a Sofa Bed available and PS4 Games to use if wanted.

 - All phones put on mute before trials begin.


**Setting:**

 - Subject is feeling good mentally, with a slight ongoing backache (not to do with this experiment though, that was there for days before and completely separate).

 - Subject wanted to try this new Research Chemical today for the first time with a lower dose than thought would effect him fully (which seems to be true from his experience below).


**Sitter:**

 - Subject has enough experienced with hallucinogenics to not need sitter.

 - Subject has been taking them for over 15 years now, many and most experiences were without a sitter (which are the best kind of experiences if you are trying to looking inward).


**Last food Eaten:**

 - Subject last ate 12 hours before dosage, it was a very small meal.


**Last hallucinations taken:**

 - Subject ingested 150 mcg of 1P-LSD 1 week prior to this experiment, which is assumed to be enough time to remove any tolerance built up within 5-7 days for Tryptamine's.


**Other recent possible drug interactions:**

 - Subject took 8mg Flubromazepam 10 hours before dosing 5-MeO-DIBF for sleep the night before.

 - This may have had residual effects in his system, but is unusual with this subject to feel much at this time after ingestion and usually would not effect the experiment at all from past experiences with hallucinogenics.


**Daily drug interaction:**

 - Subject has been lately taking 16 mg of Flubromazepam (or equivalent of 30-50 mg of Diazepam) spread over 1 or 2 doses a days.

 - Subject has been using Benzodiazepines daily for over 10 years now for both GAD and as a sleep aid, both of which has helped him lead to a normal life after late teenage PTSD issues.

 - Both GAD and insomniac-ism go away completely with daily intake of Benzodiazepine's and tolerance does not build up in this subjects case like is suggested by doctors who wont prescribe it to him.

 - Subjects tolerance has ranged between 15 mg and 80 mg of Diazepam over 10 years (80 mg was when in hospital for 2 weeks trying to come off a GBL addiction which the NHS completed f**ked me up with and treated me like a low life druggie with no compassion and discharged me with an 80 mg Diazepam tolerance and only 10 x 25 mg pills of Chlordiazepoxide).

 - During this 10 year period subject averaged at around 30-40 mg of Diazepam a day for a long time.

 - Subject finds Benzodiazepines still work without too much of a tolerance build up over 10 years ranging between doses established above. In general once you get to a level you need then he can stay at that level and even lower with time if needed.

 - Subjects stability at the equivalent of 40 mg of Diazepam a day, but he could drop to 20 mg a day any time without feeling too uncomfortable for a week if needed before a proper taper plan progress ever needs to start.

 - In the case of this subject, daily Benzodiazepines use usually doesn't interfere with hallucinogenics trips (visuals or mentally) when taken this long before stated above and below, it may in fact remove some of the paranoia if anything.

 - Subject always tries to avoid any Benzodiazepines and food for a relatively long period before and after ingestion substances.

 - Subject may wait until after the peak and when in the come down ball park at least or feels he is not getting much out of it or wants to abort a too strong experiment.


**Subject Age:**

 - Late 30's.


**Subject Weight:**

 - Between 13-14 stone (not weighed for a while so an approximate).


**Subject Height:**

 - 5'8''


**Other facts:**

 - Subject has an unusually higher tolerance to both Tryptamine's and Phenethylamine's.

 - This is in compared to recommended doses specified in online sources and literature such as on Erowid, UK, EU, US and Worldwide Harm reduction Forum's and Wiki's sites.

 - Although subject believed some higher dose reports by a minority of people claimed to have taken online are insane for all RC's, even for him.


**Trip Report:**


**0 hours** - The start (10 am, 2 hours after awaking)

 - Subject ingested orally between 30-40 mg dose of 5-MeO-DIBF. This is not quite accurate as scales broke on the day so was divided from a pile of stated as 250 mg 5-MeO-DIBF dissolved in water.

 - Subject needs to buy new 1 mg accuracy scales ASAP to give accurate dosage, but the range stated does seem correct from the liquid dosing used.

 - Dosage could be +/- 5 mg (or even +/- 10 mg which is why exact dosage was not specified).

 - Due to the initial true weigh of the powder not know to be exactly 250 mg (his only scales he had left working showed it ranging between 0.2 and 0.3 g randomly fluctuating).

 - The compound dissolved in H2O (water) straight away making liquid oral dosing very easier with a syringe.

 - Unfortunately now this means only future method of ingestion of this sample will be liquid orally now.


**30-60 mins** - The come up

 - Subject starting to feel it creep up slowly between this period but cant put a his finger on what it is. Possibly a memorable Tryptamine head space is starting to be felt and starting to feel a little hot, some may say this is the "coming home" feeling, but at a very low level.

 - Subject had diarrhoea on the come up, took 4 mg Loperamide which stop any further problems by the end of the come up.


**1-2 hours** - The peak

 - Subject has a low level Trymptamine head space now (there is an effect Shulgin Scale rating: +).

 - Subject sees no real OEV (no carpets and walls waving but possibly lights seem brighter and more colourful).

 - Subject found listening to Music seemed sightly better. Listened to old music from his past on youtube especially sounded great and brought back memories and happiness.

 - Subject had slight CEV, which may have been placebo, This seemed to go after peak but there might have been something there.

 - Subject attempted smoking a few puffs from a strong JWH-018 joint to increase visuals but it did not help.

 - In general subjects mind felt like it was on a very low level dose of 4-HO-DMT/4-ACO-DMT/4-HO-MET etc without the visuals.

 - Subject did not feel any horniness associated with 5-MeO-DiPT but the dose may have been too low and no female companionship available during the experiment to attempt sex.


**2-4 hours** - The come down

 - Subject's peak was over, coming down over the next 2 hours.

 - Subject smoked 1 joint of strong JWH-018 crumbled powder on tobacco over the next 2 hours as well (split equally across 3 smokes).

 - JWH-018 seem to over power 5-MeO-DIBF at the time of each smoke, which I suspect was because the 5-MeO-DIBF was dosed too low on this first trial.

 - Subject was able to eat both a muller peach yoghurt and banana during this experience, both tasted nice and had no problem eating.


**4 hours**

 - Subject definitely seems like he is coming down at this point, only possible residue effects of JWH-018 was felt.


**5 hours**

 - Seems to have completely worn off now, not feeling much of JWH-018 residue either but something still there as an after glow, subject still feels happy.

 - Subject Took 16 mg of Codeine + 1 g paracetamol (OTC co-codamol) for backache for which subject has had for several days now (and has been using for the same dose once a day for 3 days now).


**6 hours**

 - Subject possibly is baseline now.

 - Subject is slightly craving benzo's now (well past his usual next daily dose).

 - Subject took 5 mg of Flubromazepam for any final comedown and stop benzo withdrawal symptoms creeping in.


**7 hours**

 - Subject took a further 1 mg of Etizolam for any final comedown and relaxation.


**8 hours**

 - Subject felt completely baseline now.

 - Subject resumed with the rest of the day as usual would normally with no problems interacting with people.


**10 hours**

 - Subject ate a full very large kebab with fries without any problems ingesting at this point.

 - Food tasted exceptional, although the price was very high, almost £9 for a Turkish mixed Chicken Shish and Lamb Kofte Kebab + Salad + Rice + Large fries.

 - There was a lot of food to eat but no problems eating at all at this point (saved a bit for lunch the next day).


**14 hours**

 - Subject ingested 8 mg of Flubromazepam as a sleeping aid.


**15 hours**

 - Subject ingested 50 mg of OTC DPH as a further sleeping aid.


**16 hours**

 - Subject slept fine for the next 8 hours for an insomniac (which is longer than his usual sleep pattern, but average for a weekend).


**24 hours**

 - Subjects awakes.

 - Subject is convinced he dosed too low yesterday, but titration is important and subject did take more than he was initially expecting to take for a first trip on an unknown substance.

 - Subject expects to Research a higher dose (probably in 2 weeks time) within the dose at the 60-70 mg level range next time.

 - Subject hopes to be able to get more visuals and mental stimulation out of a higher dose trying and get a better experience out of this substance and find the full range of characteristics of 5-MeO-DIBF.

 - Subject expects the trip to last longer with a higher dosage.

Considering that 5-MeO-DMT is not really much active orally and that 5-MeO-BFE has about 1/6th affinity at 5-HT2A, I don't think this is going to be much active orally either.

5-MeO-DiPT IS active orally, remember 5-MeO-BFE is NOT 5-MeO-DIBF, its like saying 5-MeO-DMT is the same as 5-MeO-DiPT (completely different effects)

Perhaps at a higher dose of 5-MeO-DIBF, we may see emerge this to be a drug classed in the same breed as:

- MDA (The original "Love Drug")

- MDMA (What Ecstasy really should be 100% of the time)

- 5-MeO-DiPT ("Foxy" or "Foxy Methoxy" - some say an aphrodisiac and a sexual enhancer)

- 5-APB, 6-APB, 5-MAPB, 6-MAPB (benzofuran class and are very close to MDA and MDMA in effects)

- bk-MDMA, bk-xxxx (a lot), 4-MMC, x-xMC, MDPV (bk- beta ketones or cathinone classes etc)

have been classed in the past.


These dont seem to be fully Hallucinogenics and more loved up and great for music, dancing and sex.


If it does kick off for that reason I dont see it lasting long on the market. UK cyber crimes and drug enforcement agencies they work well with each other are getting faster at banning individual substances now. By the end of the year they will probably have some sort of general UK analogue law which is so complicated everything will fall under it, maybe even spice's you put in your daily food!


**EDITS:**

 - Although maybe not, I did feel a little tired during my lower dose session, especially during the 2nd hour, but that may go away with a higher dosage and it may stimulate you a lot more.

 - Competing with the class of drugs listed above, rather than a full blown Hallucinogenic

5-MeO-DIBF is structurally similar to Dimemebfe (5-MeO-BFE). The structure of these substances looks like a modified version of 2C-X vs 5-MeO-D(x)T. To me, this molecule looks more like a phenethylamine than a tryptamine. 

This structure lacks psychedelic potential. If you want to correct the structure so it become psychedelic then you should remove Ethylisopropyl, and replacing ethylamine with methylamine.

Strange, I can see the picture, however. 

Here's a link: [http://postimg.org/image/mljspzmnl/full/](http://postimg.org/image/mljspzmnl/full/) (The moderator maybe able to repair the image.)

This kind of molecule can give you the basic idea for development of other structure like 2CB-IND and even TCB-2.

Thanks, that looks very interesting although I have not being educated in chemistry past A-Level's. I have tried to keep up with terminology and chemical structures in the name of research and a basic understanding of structures and terminology. Knowing what I am taking, what it could similar to and in the name of harm reduction as everyone in the RC community should do is escential and the main reason substances keep getting banned due to peoploe not educating themselves.


Itv is now sort of my hobby to understand organic chemistry and Psychedelic drugs (and others) to a decent level, rather than how I felt during school as Chemistry just being another subject I took. I have Shuglin's TIHKAL and PIHKAL books and read them all with interest and enthusiasm. The unpublished sections not on erowid are very good to read and I recommend reading both books, even if you have gone through what has been published online.

As does this, never tried any of these 2C-B-XXX-FLY substances though to comment on their effects.


**EDIT:**


To be completely honest, I have always found Phenethylamine's give a much nicer feeling than Tryptamine's. I usually find Tryptamine's are a lot more mentally darker, which I dont find at all with Phenethylamine's, even at very high dosages (60 mg of 2C-B was one of my best experiences ever). I have never had a bad experience with any Phenethylamine's but have with Tryptamine's. Especially one time when I took 50 mg of 4-HO-MET and had to lie down for 2 hours after the short come up with my eyes shut and my mind feeling quite uncomfortable and the feeling of ego death, I was questioning if I was still alive at this point, and did it really matter, etc.


Although after which I had the most intense OEV with green fractals ever seen for another 2 hours (probably the best visual trip I ever had apart from my first trip on 30 mg of 2C-E many years ago). When I was on 4-HO-MET, people I spoke to on skype that day on the computer looked like they were out of a cartoon too and had a fractal green hexagon features to their faces, as did everything else in the room.


The worst experience with a Phenethylamine was when taking 250 mg of bk-2C-B in one dose, it was not that it was scary but the problem was more than it lasted way too long and much longer than I expected from previous reports on the internet (and my pervious lower dose experiments which I thought I needd a lot more than 150 mg). If I recall it was still going strong 20 hours into the trip. To add to that, my mother kept on phoning me all day and leaving messages asking where I was and why am I not replying tp her calls for 2 days! In the end she left a message threatening to drive 4 hours to where I live to find out what has happened to me! I eventually txt her back around the 16 hour mark and told her I was tripping and leave me alone until the next day and I would be fine to talk fine then, lol (she did not approve though and never does when I take RC's, especially after my 2 week hospitalisation coming off GBL 5 years ago).


On another note, I absolutely love 1P-LSD (although I have never tried real LSD-25, but from all accounts this is almost identical from what people say) and have never had a bad experience with it yet. Its still early days though and I have not experimented past 150 mcg so far. 200 mcg will be my next trip on 1P-LSD then 250 mcg after that.

Yes, it's definitely around in the UK. 


50mg pellets have gone on sale today. 


I will be ordering on Monday and will post a TR as and when I have conducted my experiment.

I've just spotted it also, placed an order. Will have to wait before trying it for my tolerance to decrease though, due to a fair bit of 1P-LSD use.

I am currently undergoing a research on one of those 50mg pellets and an very dissapointed. I ordered 5 so after a week or two ill try taking 100mg. Its been about 3h since i took 50mg pellet and it all feels like a coming up to something great, but it never comes. Some physical effects seems similar to other psychedelics i have tried (sadly so far i have only been able to try 1p-lsd and bk-2c-b), i feel all warm, a little mood lift, pleasant feeling in legs, dont know how to describe, it just feels very pleasant when moving legs while laying in bed. And thats pretty much it. Hopefully higher dose will show better results in future, 50mg feels like a long lasting come up to nothing, like the oevs are almost there, but i got no visuals at all, not even closed eyes. My thought is it night be nice in a club setting if higher dose is stimulating, because after this 50mg i feel like i could sleep if i wanted to. Sorry may be a long post and not make much sence because its done while undergoing this "research" in my "lab" :D

Finally got round to trying this one after holding onto 10 x 50mg pellets for several years. Based on other reports I have no reason to believe they lost any potency, especially as they were stored away from light, heat and moisture.


All trials taken orally on an empty stomach, with no cross tolerance (all taken at least 1 month after previous psychedelic experience).


Regardless of dose, I found the duration to be approximately:


Onset - t0:00 - t0:45

Coming Up - t0:45 - t1:00 (very quick)

Plateau - t1:00 - t2:30

Coming Down - t2:30 - t3:30

After Effects - t3:30 - t5:00


Back to baseline by t6:00, albeit with a headache (this was stronger with higher doses).


First trial - 100mg


At this dose I found it similar to ~1g of shrooms - enough to get moderately strong negative physical effects with only mild psychedelic effects. Unfortunately I spent most of the plateau on the toilet with terrible diarrhoea, watching faint kaleidoscopic effects in the bathroom tiles. This eventually wore off, leaving me to lie down and enjoy some emotional introspection along with music enhancement.


I was still feeling a fairly strong stomach ache but around t4:00 felt sober enough to go for a walk with a joint which helped me feel a bit better. Residual stimulation wore off around the 6 hour mark, with no effect on sleep.


Second trial - 150mg


This time I preloaded with 4mg loperamide to prevent diarrhoea, which worked really well. There was still quite a bit of stomach discomfort, but I was able to appreciate the trip much better without being stuck on the toilet for most of it. Psychologically it was similarly manageable to the previous trial, though the music enhancement was much greater and I ended up spending the plateau watching live music performances and reflecting on my current life circumstances. I noticed a quite strong restless leg which I didn’t have the first time. I get this quite often with psychedelics, especially more stimulating ones like LSD, so I wasn’t particularly concerned.


Around t5:00 the discomfort had mostly subsided and I started to feel some erotic effects which I greatly enjoyed (I experience this with most tryptamines towards the come down). Again, at about t6:00 I felt back to baseline with a headache, slightly stronger this time and leading into the morning. Despite getting a good 8 hours sleep I still felt somewhat slow and hungover the following morning, though this wore off by the afternoon.


Third trial - 250mg


In addition to 4mg loperamide, I also preloaded with 8mg ondansetron to mitigate as many of the negative physical effects as possible. This did help, and despite the higher dose the stomach discomfort was reduced but still quite noticeable. As usual I started coming up around the t0:45 mark, and put on some music. I notice the restless leg much stronger this time, and by t1:00 I was feeling seriously high and needed to lie down. I could hear a familiar tryptamine ‘buzz’ which soon turned into a very pleasurable full-body vibration. I shut my eyes and felt myself leaving my body and just focusing on the increasing sensation which was becoming more and more euphoric.


At this point I am vaguely aware of my legs shaking and rubbing together which seemed to increase the pleasure to an incredible degree. Soon it felt like the most psychologically erotic experience of my life as I felt the pleasure drowning out any other stimuli, both my surroundings and any sense of self awareness. At this point I had no idea of my sex, gender, sexuality, or even humanity - all I felt was that I was being absolutely dominated by some pure primeval force and, despite not usually being particularly submissive, I was absolutely loving it. I felt like I must have transformed myself into some sort of cosmic slut (!) and was happy to leave any previous existence behind in awe of this new found power coursing through me. This went on for about 90 minutes before it started to subside and I started to remember who I was along with my surroundings.


I stay lying down in a confused but happy afterglow - how was it possible to have such intense tryptamine eroticism in such a detached, out-of-body way? I wasn’t even aware of being human, let alone a male capable of erection, yet every other sexual experience I’ve had on psychedelics has had a very strong bodily component. The closest experience I’ve had was with high doses of snorted DMT which had a similar feeling of being forced to submit to a god-like power but without any of the eroticism, and was far less immediately euphoric.


Around t4:00 I am already starting to return to normal, though with a stronger headache which again persisted into the following morning. Funnily enough I was actually far too worn out to actually masturbate, and went to sleep fairly easily at around t7:00. However, every orgasm I have had since has been greatly enhanced and comes alongside a strong memory of the intense euphoria, even two weeks later.


Summary


Overall some incredible effects which I have never experienced before with any other high dose psychedelic, or indeed any other drug. However I must emphasise that the unpleasant physical side effects are very strong, especially the diarrhoea, and that there may be better alternatives - I have never tried 5-MeO-DiPT which is closely related and is also known for both eroticism and stomach discomfort, but is much more popular. 5-MeO-MiPT also sounds like it has some similarities, I hope to be able to try both of these one day.


I should also encourage anybody considering trying 5-MeO-DiBF to titrate their doses more gradually, I only made the leap from 150mg to 250mg because I only had 250mg remaining and am unable to acquire any more. The previous highest reported dose I found was 200mg, and there are not many trip reports available on this one at all.

Thanks for sharing! Man, those doses are incredibly high compared to 5-MeO-MiPT and 5-MeO-DiPT!

Yes thank you so much for sharing. I was unsure but thought it likely that the compound was active. Your description doesnt surprise me, it seems to share some commonalities of 5-meo-dipt.


Now it makes me curious about other benzofuran tryptamine like compounds.

UK cyber crimes and drug enforcement agencies they work well with each other are getting faster at banning individual substances now.

It does seem like a very unexplored area, and those which have been made all seem to be 5-MeO analogues. You've got Dimemebfe/5-MeO-BFE (BF analogue of 5-MeO-DMT) which has [some reports](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/benzofuran-analogues-of-tryptamines-e-g-5-meo-bfe.592648/) albeit with concerns about misrepresentation. Nichols also made [Mebfap](https://isomerdesign.com/PiHKAL/explore.php?domain=tk&id=5072) (BF analogue of 5-MeO-aMT) and [5-MeO-NEBF](https://isomerdesign.com/PiHKAL/explore.php?domain=tk&id=2691) (BF analogue of 5-MeO-NET) has also been made, though I can't find any reports on either of them.

I wonder if the 5 meo analogues were chosen because of their potency. Maybe the base analogues would impotent.


I guess the next I'd like to hear about is 4-ho-DMBF analogous to psilocin.
