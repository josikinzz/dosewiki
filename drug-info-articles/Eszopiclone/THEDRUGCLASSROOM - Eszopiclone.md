# Zopiclone & Eszopiclone (Lunesta)
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/zopiclone-eszopiclone-lunesta/*

Zopiclone and Eszopiclone (Lunesta) are two very similar nonbenzodiazepine sleep drugs which provide depressant effects. They can be effective for insomnia, at least in the short-term, but they tend to reduce sleep quality.

After taking zopiclone/eszopiclone, you will generally become notably sedated and able to fall asleep. If you remain awake after the initial sleepiness, you may be presented with hallucinatory effects, including basic closed and open-eye visuals.

They also have an emotion-numbing effect and they can reduce inhibition. Sleep-walking, like what is seen with zolpidem, has been reported.

Even after hours of sleep, the drugs can continue to be impairing, so your driving and work output could be affected in the morning with a large dose.

Neither should be combined with other depressants since doing so can increase the chance of dangerous and fatal responses. Both have caused deaths before, but those deaths have occurred at very high doses.
