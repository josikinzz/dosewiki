## Subjective Experience

2C-E was first synthesised by Alexander Shulgin, and was documented in PiHKAL in

1991. He rated it as one of the most important phenethylamine compounds, which he
referred to as his magical half-dozen. For the record, these comprised mescaline,
and six of his own inventions: DOM, 2C-B, 2C-E, 2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7.

Recreationally, it became increasingly popular from the early 2000s. However, it was
classified in the UK in 2002 and scheduled in the United States in July 2012.

2C-E is often considered to invoke a deeply meaningful experience, with references
to this effect present across Internet forums and in a number of books. A good
example of the latter is Myron J. Stolaroff’s ‘Thanatos to Eros: 35 Years of
Psychedelic Exploration Ethnomedicien and the Study of Consciousness’, which can
be found on the MAPS website.

My 18mg sample was allegedly produced by a Chinese lab, and pressed into pill form
in the UK. On the face of it, this seems to be a good dose, but further research leads
me to exercise additional caution.

One factor is that for many users 2C-E produces a high body load. Another is that
reports across the harm reduction forums repeatedly stress a steep response curve
and high intensity low-dose experiences. The following comments, from respected
posters on the BlueLight forum, are fairly typical:

```
“This one has a VERY steep dose/response curve and I'd imagine every half-
milligram can produce a noticeable jump in intensity.” ~ Morninggloryseed
“I tried 12mgs of 2C-E for the first time tonite. Wow! It was really damn
intense.” ~ Piper methysticum
“The 2C-E dose-reponse curve is probably the sharpest I've ever experienced.
I have seen a full freakout on 15mg.” ~ Fizzacyst
“ Yes it can knock your socks off at 12mg or be almost irrelevant at 16mg
weird that.” ~ B9
```
In the ideal circumstance I would perhaps plump for 15mg, but today is far from
ideal, and a full freakout is out of the question. I therefore go for 9mg, but still with a
little trepidation.

```
T+0:00 I weigh the pill, break it up, and measure half. It is just over, so the
dose is somewhere between 9mg and 10mg. I swallow this with a glass of
water. [3:20pm]
```
```
T+0:20 A mild headspace is developing, with perhaps enhanced visible
colouration, but all is minimal. I wonder if I have taken enough.
```
```
T+0:35 The headiness has intensified, and a tingly body feeling has emerged,
which is particularly evident in my hands. A familiar psychedelic sheen to my
vision is also developing. In terms of mood, there may be a little elevation. All
these effects are quite mild, but are now very clear.
```
```
T+ 1:00 Little has changed. I resist the temptation to swallow the other half of
the pill largely on the basis of a couple of outlier trip reports which claimed a
two hour onset.
```
```
This is in fact reasonably agreeable. The headiness has a drifting quality, as
does vision unless I specifically focus. There is definitely an introspective edge
here, which flows quite strongly if I take that direction.
```
```
T+1:30 The effects I described on the hour mark have strengthened and
stabilised. It is a pleasant enough high, with psychedelic edges, and clear
scope for introspection. The headiness is of a slightly different nature to the
other 2C psychedelics I have experienced. It has a more hypnotic feel to it,
with a sense of falling into an internal state of reverie.
```

```
The mind play is the predominant feature, with the tingly body sensation
playing alongside. The light visual sheen is still present, but there are no real
CEVs or OEVs. Clearly, these emerge with higher doses.
```
```
T+2:00 There is no significant euphoria or mood lift. There is, however, a
great deal of thought and
