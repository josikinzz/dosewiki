## Subjective Experience

Someone, somewhere, had the dubious idea of calling this chemical Benzo Fury,
presumably for marketing purposes. It was subsequently promoted in bright orange
packets, which became instantly recognizable. Indeed, the combination was so garish
and catchy that it was bound to attract the attention of a hostile media. Indeed,
during its heyday it was to become one of the most cited research chemicals of the
media’s unremitting campaign against the spurious evils of legal highs, and was
subsequently banned in the UK via a TCDO in 2013.

I originally sampled this as a pill circa 2010. It was one of my earliest forays into the
research chemical market and as such the experience was under-documented. I recall
a really pleasant high: a definite mood-lift and a perspective that all was well with the
world.

Some years later I obtained the chemical in powder form, and was able to document
it in more detail, albeit at a lower dose.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 Given reports that this may be cardio-toxic, at least with heavy or
regular use, I elect to dose at a moderate 50mg. Another consideration here is
the anticipated duration, which in my current circumstances is on the long
side. I measure the beige coloured powder and bomb it in cigarette paper.
[2:35pm]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:25 A body warmth and a dreamy type of ataractic bliss seem to be
emerging. I sip on a glass of water to ensure appropriate hydration.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 I am warm and slightly sweaty, and the passive heady feeling is now
established. It brings with it a general mood lift and a positive empathogenic
edge. It isn’t strong, and I am entirely functional, fully able to concentrate on
tasks as I choose.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:30 This isn’t very intense, but on the other side of the coin I had a rare
alcohol session last night and was feeling fairly wretched: I now feel much
better. My impression is that this isn’t as strong as the 6apb I sampled back in
2010.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:00 Whilst this is a very light experience, I can see clear similarities to
MDMA, which hardly comes as a surprise. There appears to be no significant
stim-dick or related issues in play and horn seems to be available.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I have often seen claims that 6-APB creates a sense of well being, and I would
agree with these. At this point, the body warmth has dissipated a little, but the
headiness continues unabated.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:00 The positive contentment flows at a nice and gentle level. I am
beginning to feel the odd hunger pang, so there doesn’t appear to be any
appetite suppression in play.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+4:00 Whilst I feel that I am still on a plateau of comfort, it is at a lower level
than it was earlier.
\`\`\`
I slowly descended towards base during the rest of the evening, and retired at about
11pm. After a variable night’s sleep I awoke with no ill effects or significant hangover.

At this dose it turned what would have been quite a miserable and slightly hung over
day into a pleasant one, and didn’t seem to hinder my functionality or my general
level of competence. A negative is that for several days subsequently I felt rather
down and irritable.

A higher dose would undoubtedly have delivered the extremely pleasing high I recall
from my first experiment. However, with TripSit advising an intake of no more than
200mg per night, this isn’t something I will push. I should also stress that it is not a
chemical to make a habit of.

6-APB
 
Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**6-APB**
- REGULATED: No
- STATUS: Not Approved ForHuman Consumption
- SCHEDULE: Un-Scheduled
 
6-APB is unscheduled in the United States. It is possible that it could be considered an analog (of MDA), in which case, sales for human consumption or possession with the intent to ingest could be prosecuted under the [Federal Analogue Act](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/analog/analog.shtml) though we are unaware of any such existing cases (01/26/11).
 
U.S. STATE LAW #
 
Florida #
 
6-APB and 5-APB are now Schedule I by law as of Apr 29, 2013. Previously, 6-APB and 5-APB were added to Schedule I by emergency rule in Florida as "APB ((2-aminopropyl)benzofuran)". See [myfloridalegal.com/webfiles.nsf/WF/MMFD-92VKZ8/\$file/ER+RuleOAGRuleCertification12-11-2012.pdf](http://myfloridalegal.com/webfiles.nsf/WF/MMFD-92VKZ8/\$file/ER+RuleOAGRuleCertification12-11-2012.pdf) , but this emergency rule appears to have expired after 90 days. There is a senate bill that would control 5/6-APB along with a dozen other stimulants and cannabinoids, but it has not yet passed into law. See [http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2013/0294](http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2013/0294) . (SB 294). (thanks CM) (last updated May 14, 2013)

**6-(2-Aminopropyl)benzofuran** (also known as **6-APB** and **"Benzofury"** ) is a novel [entactogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) substance of the [benzofuran](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzofuran) class. It is structurally related to entactogens like [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) , [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [5-APB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-APB) , and [5-MAPB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MAPB) .

6-APB was first synthesized in 1993 by [David E. Nichols](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/David_E._Nichols) as a potential non-neurotoxic alternative to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . However, recreational human use was not documented until over a decade later, where it briefly entered the rave scene and global [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market. It was sold along with other novel benzofuran entactogens under the name "Benzofury" before its sale and import were subsequently banned. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) , [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . 6-APB's effects are commonly compared to those of [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) and other entactogens.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 6-APB, and it has only a brief history of human usage. It has been marketed alongside [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) like [5-MAPB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MAPB) and [5-APB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-APB) as a legal, grey-market alternative to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , and is typically commercially distributed by online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) vendors. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## History and culture

The synthesis of 6-APB was first reported by a team led by the medicinal chemist and psychedelic researcher [David E. Nichols](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/David_E._Nichols) at Purdue University. They were examining the role of the MDA dioxle ring structure in interacting with serotonergic neurons. It was also partly an effort to find an alternative to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , which was gaining recognition as a potentially useful adjunct in psychotherapy, but was also being linked to neurotoxic effects.

Human usage was not documented until 2010, when it emerged for sale on the [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market. It was particularly prominent in the UK "legal highs" market, where it was sold under the name "Benzofury". [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

On June 10, 2013 6-APB and a number of analogues were classified as Temporary Class Drugs in the UK following an ACMD recommendation. On November 28, 2013 the ACMD recommended that 6-APB and related benzofurans should become Class B, Schedule 1 substances. On March 5, 2014 the UK Home Office announced that 6-APB would be made a class B drug on 10 June 2014 alongside every other benzofuran entactogen and many structurally related drugs.

## Chemistry

6-APB, also known as 6-(2-aminopropyl)benzofuran, is a synthetic molecule of the [benzofuran](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzofuran) class. The benzofuran class of substances are members of the amphetamine and phenylethylamine classes. Molecules of this class contain a [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) core bound to an amino (NH2) group through an ethyl chain with an additional methyl substitution at R α . 6-APB does not contain a methyl substitution on R N . It is composed of an an oxygen-substituted [benzofuran](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzofuran) ring fused at R 3 and R 4 of the phenyl ring.

Notably, 6-APB shares this benzofuran ring with related compounds such as [5-APB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-APB) , [5-MAPB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MAPB) , and [6-MAPB](/w/index.php?title=6-MAPB&action=edit&redlink=1) .

Three distinct batches have been in circulation since its initial release to markets. Originally, only hydrochloride was available, and its dosage range shared characteristics most similar to that of [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) in terms of dose-response. However, succinate and fumarate batches both entered the market, and have very different effects by weight, and vastly different loose bulk densities. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Pharmacology

6-APB is a [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) – [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) – [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) (SNDRI) with Ki values of 117, 150, and 2698 nM for the norepinephrine transporter (NET), dopamine transporter (DAT), and serotonin transporter (SERT), respectively. 6-APB also possesses additional activity as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) of these [monoamine neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine_neurotransmitters) .

6-APB is a potent [full agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonists#Types_of_agonist) of the serotonin 5-HT 2B receptor (Ki = 3.7 nM) , with higher affinity for this target than any other site. Moreover, unlike MDMA, 6-APB shows 100-fold selectivity for the 5-HT 2B receptor over the 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C receptors.

Aside from the 5-HT 2B receptor, 6-APB has also been found to bind with high affinity to the α 2C -adrenergic receptor subtype (Ki = 45 nM), although the clinical significance of this action is unknown.

The potent agonism of the 5-HT 2B receptor makes it likely that 6-APB would be cardiotoxic with chronic or long-term use, as seen with other 5-HT 2B receptor agonists such as the withdrawn serotonergic anorectic [fenfluramine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenfluramine) .

The [monoamine neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine_neurotransmitters) known as [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [noradrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) are the global [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) that modulate the brain's ability to feel pleasure, motivation, reward, planning, attention, and focus. When their reuptake is inhibited or their release is promoted, these neurotransmitters accumulate in the [synaptic cleft](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaptic_cleft) (gaps between neurons) to non-ordinary levels, which makes them able to be reused. The result is neuronal activation at a multitude of brain regions which has the net result of producing a combination of stimulating, relaxing, disinhibiting and euphoric effects.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** & **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - In terms of its effects on the user's physical energy levels, 6-APB is commonly considered to have the paradoxical ability to both be stimulating as well as sedating and relaxing. Overall, it is thought to be far less energetic than [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) or [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) and tends to exert more of a pronounced "stoning" or "couch-locking" effect. The particular style of stimulation which 6-APB presents is far less forceful in a way that can be compared to psychedelics like [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) .
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of 6-APB can be described as a moderate to powerful warm, euphoric tingling sensation that radiates throughout the entire body. It is capable of becoming overwhelmingly pleasurable at higher doses to the point of immobilizing the user. This sensation maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)**
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)** - As 6-APB is a serotonin releasing agent, a rise in core body and brain temperature tends to be high and consistent throughout the experience. Caution must be taken as too high of a dose can result in the dysregulation of the brain's ability to regulate its internal core temperature. 6-APB is commonly reported to having a similar hyperthermia to [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) and [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , but slightly warmer than either. Serotonin syndrome, a potentially fatal condition, presents this effect to dangerous levels.
- **[Vibrating vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vibrating_vision)** - At common to high doses, a person's eyeballs may begin to spontaneously wiggle back and forth in a rapid motion, causing the vision to become blurry and temporarily out of focus. This is a condition known as [nystagmus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nystagmus) .
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** - Feelings of dry mouth and dehydration are a universal experience with this class of compounds; this effect is a product of an [increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and bodily metabolism. While it is important to avoid becoming dehydrated (especially when out dancing in a hot environment) there have been some notable cases of users suffering from [water intoxication](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Water_intoxication) through over-drinking (to compensate). It is therefore advised that users be mindful of their water intake and avoid over-drinking.
- **[Dry mouth](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dry_mouth)**
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)** - Higher doses of 6-APB can result in an overall difficulty when it comes to urination. This is an effect that is completely temporary and harmless. It is due to 6-APB’s promotion of the release of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH); ADH is responsible for regulating urination. This effect can be lessened by simply relaxing, but can be significantly relieved by placing a hot flannel over the genitals to warm them up and encourage blood flow to the region.
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning)**
- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This is usually only present at moderate to higher doses and is similar to what one might experience from [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) or [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) .
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - This is a rare effect but are thought to be able to occur in those who are predisposed to them, especially when taking overly strong doses or redosing while in physically taxing conditions such as being dehydrated, fatigued, undernourished, or overheated. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] ### Visual effects
 
- The visual effects of 6-APB have an occurrence rating that is more selective and less consistent than any of the traditional [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . The effects can never be guaranteed to manifest themselves, but are the most likely to occur with high doses, towards the end of the experience and particularly if the user has been smoking [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) . They are also more likely to occur if the user has prior experience with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , but also remain entirely possible for those who have never tried them as well. 
#### Enhancements
 
6-APB presents an array of visual enhancements which are mild in comparison to traditional psychedelics, but still distinctively present. These generally include:
 
- **[Color enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Color_enhancement)** - The enhancement can be described as bright and synthetic in appearance, and consistent throughout the experience.
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)** - Tracers are most similar to those found with [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) , with longer sections of continuity before a slight discontinuity.
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry of 6-APB experience can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) than [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as primarily intricate in complexity, abstract in form, organic in style, structured in organization, dimly lit in lighting, mostly monotone in color with blues and greys, glossy in shading, sharp in edges, small in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, equal in round and angular corners, non-immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity. At higher doses, they are significantly more likely to result in states of [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry over [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
At high to heavy doses, 6-APB is capable of producing a unique range of low and high-level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is significantly less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . These effects are far more common during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Duration#Offset) of the experience and commonly include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - This effect is very similar to the same experience found within [deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriant) , but does not manifest itself consistently and usually happens only at high doses. It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_External_hallucinations#Variations) as delirious in believability, autonomous in controllability and solid in style. They usually follow themes of memory replays and semi-realistic or expected events. For example, people could be casually holding objects or performing actions which one would expect them to be in real life before disappearing and dissolving under further inspection. Common examples of this include seeing people wearing glasses or hats when they are not and mistaking faces of your friends for random people, and objects as human beings or animals.
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** - The internal hallucinations which 6-APB induce are mostly only present as spontaneous breakthroughs at extremely high doses. This effect's [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) are delirious in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability and solid in appearance. The most common way in which they manifest themselves are through [hypnagogic](/w/index.php?title=Hypnagogic&action=edit&redlink=1) scenarios which the user may experience as they are drifting off to sleep after a night of use; these can usually be described as memory replay from the previous several hours. These are short and fleeting, but frequent and completely believable and convincing as they happen. In terms of the theme, they often take the form of conversations with the people who were with you or instead manifest themselves as bizarre and extremely nonsensical plots.
- **[Peripheral information misinterpretation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peripheral_information_misinterpretation)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of 6-APB can be broken down into several effects which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The general head space of 6-APB is described by many as one of moderate mental stimulation, feelings of love, openness or empathy, and a powerful sense of contentedness and euphoria. It displays a large number of typical [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) and [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) cognitive effects. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - Strong emotional euphoria and feelings of happiness are present within 6-APB and are likely a direct result of serotonin and dopamine release.
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This particular effect is more consistent, pronounced, powerful and therapeutic with 6-APB than any other known substance. It is the most obvious and noticeable effect within any 6-APB experience and dominates the head space. With time, repeated use, and improper spacing, however, this effect becomes severely diminished as the perspective it instills becomes fully imprinted, making it, so users feel merely speedy and scattered with no new found urges to communicate or bond with others.
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This effect is most effective at low to moderate doses as anything higher will usually impair concentration.
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** - This effect is thought to be mild in comparison with other substances such as [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , and classical [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , lending to a more "spaced-out" feeling, best described as episodic memory.
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Personal meaning enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_meaning_enhancement)**
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)** 
- **[Laughter fits](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Laughter_fits)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)** - Due to its potential euphoria-inducing effects, there is the potential for 6-APB to encourage compulsive redosing, much like with MDMA or MDA. Due to the length of the experience, many find this need to be less pressing. Due to its unknown toxicity profile and reports of a severely amplified [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) ("come down") and after effects, it is highly discouraged to redose this substance. It is thought to share some commonalities with [DOM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOM) and other related compounds in this sense.
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Mindfulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - Strong feelings of time compression are common within 6-APB and alter the experience of time quite noticeably, although not to the same extent as typically reported with MDMA.
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** - This effect is present, but to a noticeably lesser degree than [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . Users often report being heavily sedated or "floored" compared to typical stimulants. ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)**
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)** ### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)** - Although this effect is present, it is not quite as pronounced or as consistent when compared to other [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogen) such as [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) . Due to the relative calmness and lack of chaotic energy that 6-APB possesses relative to MDMA, however, this combined with its extended duration may make it a better therapeutic agent and can be thought of as lying closer to the spectrum of [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) than [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)** - While rare, experiences of unity, oneness and interconnectedness may occur on 6-APB. This effect most reliably manifests itself at high doses within large crowds at raves and musical events in the form of "becoming one with the crowd." ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Brain zaps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brain_zaps)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Derealization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Derealization)**
 **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)** 
- **[Sleep paralysis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis)** - Some users report a higher incidence of experiencing sleep paralysis after consuming 6-APB.
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Thought disorganization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_disorganization)**
- **[Suicidal ideation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**

## Reagent results

Exposing compounds to the reagents gives a colour change which is indicative of the compound under test.

## Toxicity and harm potential

Due to only having a short history of human use, the toxicity and harm potential is not exactly known. Due to its similarity to MDMA, it is likely that the administration of repeated or high dosages of 6-APB may be both neurotoxic and cardiotoxic in some form.

The exact toxic dosage is unknown. It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

Short-term physical health risks of 6-APB consumption include [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) , [insomnia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insomnia) , and hyperthermia (overheating). Continuous activity without sufficient rest or rehydration may cause body temperature to rise to dangerous levels, and loss of fluid via excessive sweating puts the body at further risk as the stimulating and euphoric properties of the substance may render the user oblivious to their energy expenditure for quite some time. Diuretics such as alcohol may exacerbate these risks further.

Although it has not been formally studied, small changes in ambient temperature may cause large changes in 6-APB-induced serotonergic neurotoxicity as is the case with [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .

The neurotoxicity of 6-APB is subject to ongoing debate. It was specifically designed to be less neurotoxic than MDA or MDMA by circumventing the production of certain metabolic byproducts thought to underlie their toxicity (specifically alpha-methyl-dopamine). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Although it is likely to be physically safe to try in a responsible context, it is completely possible that the administration of repeated or high dosages of 6-APB could result in neurotoxicity in some form, presenting as deficits in cognitive, affective and psychomotor function.

As with MDMA, the long-term, heavy usage of 6-APB (i.e. regular daily or weekly usage) is likely cardiotoxic and may lead to valvulopathy (heart valve issues) via its significant affinity for the 5-HT 2B receptor.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , the chronic use of 6-APB can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

As a potent releaser of serotonin, tolerance builds quickly with prolonged and repeated use to the point that the substance eventually loses any positive effects and instead leaves the user in an uncomfortable state of anxious, dysphoric stimulation. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3-4 weeks for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 6-8 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 6-APB presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of 6-APB all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with 6-APB should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - 6-APB may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.

- **[MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs)** - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , and some [antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressants) .

### Serotonin syndrome risk

Combinations with the following substances can cause dangerously high [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) levels. [Serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) requires immediate medical attention and can be fatal if left untreated.

- **MAOIs** - Such as [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , phenelzine, selegiline, and moclobemide.
- **Serotonin releasers** - Such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) , [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) and [αMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91MT) .
- **SSRIs** - Such as citalopram and sertraline
- **[SNRIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNRIs)** - Such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) and venlafaxine
- **5-HTP**

There is an increased risk of serotonin syndrome when 6-APB is taken with many antidepressants, particularly monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Additionally, if 6-APB is taken with SSRIs and SNRIs, it is likely to be significantly less effective if it produces any discernible effects at all.

## Legal status

- **Australia and New Zealand** : Certain countries contain a "substantially similar" catch-all clause in their drug law, such as New Zealand and Australia. This includes 6-APB as it is similar in chemical structure to the class A drug MDA, meaning 6-APB may be viewed as a controlled substance analogue in these jurisdictions. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Canada** : 6-APB is Schedule III in Canada as it is an analogue of MDA. The CDSA was updated as a result of the Safe Streets Act changing amphetamines from Schedule 3 to Schedule 1. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Czech Republic** : 6-APB is a Schedule I (List 4) substance. It may be used for research and restricted therapeutic purposes. (§ 1, d), 1. of *Nařízení vlády č. 463/2013 Sb.* )
- **France** : 6-APB is classified as a narcotic since May 9, 2018, alongside other substances derived from benzofuran.
- **Germany** : 6-APB is controlled under Anlage II BtMG ( *Narcotics Act, Schedule II* ) as of July 17, 2013. It is illegal to manufacture, possess, import, export, buy, sell, procure or dispense it without a license.
- **Italy** : 6-APB is illegal in Italy.
- **Japan** : 6-APB is a controlled substance in Japan effective December 17th, 2012.
- **Luxembourg:** 6-APB is not cited in the list of prohibited substances . Therefore, it is still a legal substance.
- **The Netherlands:** 6-APB is currently legal, but it is part of a substance group that may be banned soon as part of a recently passed law on New Psychoactive Substances (NPS).
- **Sweden** : 6-APB is prohibited in Sweden as a "health hazard" as of 2009. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Switzerland** : 6-APB is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis E.
- **Turkey:** 6-APB is a classed as drug and is illegal to possess, produce, supply, or import.
- **United Kingdom** : On June 10, 2013, 6-APB and some analogues were classified as Temporary Class Drugs in the U.K. following an ACMD recommendation. On March 5, 2014, the U.K. Home Office announced that 6-APB would be made a class B drug on 10 June 2014 alongside every other benzofuran entactogen and many structurally related drugs.
- **United States** : 6-APB is unscheduled in the United States, but not currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for human consumption.

*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/6-apb/*

6-APB is a stimulant and entactogen that’s similar in structure to MDA. It provides effects that are reminiscent of those provided by MDA and MDMA.

Compared to MDMA, 6-APB tends to offer more visual effects and a stronger psychedelic feel. It’s usually said to be at least as entactogenic.

Due to a lack of information about the drug, it’s hard to say how safe it is, especially with long-term use. Common doses don’t appear acutely dangerous for healthy people. Overdoses certainly can occur and they may feature paranoia, anxiety, headache, agitation, and hypertension.

6-APB has only been used since ~2010.

6-APB, also known as 6-(2-aminopropyl)benzofuran, is an entactogen of the phenethylamine, amphetamine, and benzofuran families. 6-APB and related drugs are sometimes informally called "Benzofury" in media reports. It is similar in structure to MDA, but differs in that the 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl ring system has been replaced with a benzofuran ring. 6-APB is also the unsaturated benzofuran derivative of 6-APDB. It may appear as a tan or brown grainy powder.
While the drug never became particularly popular, it briefly entered the rave and underground clubbing scene in the UK before its sale and import were banned. It falls under the category of research chemicals, sometimes called "legal highs” if uncontrolled. Because 6-APB and other substituted benzofurans have not been explicitly outlawed in some countries, they are often technically legal, contributing to its popularity.
6-APB was first described in the scientific literature in 2000 and emerged as a novel designer drug in 2010.

## Use and effects

6-APB is reported to produce entactogenic, stimulant, and mild psychedelic effects in humans.

## Side effects

Acute psychosis has been associated with recreational use of 6-APB in combination with the synthetic cannabinoid JWH-122.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

6-APB acts as a serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent (SNDRA), with EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration values for monoamine release of 36 nM for serotonin, 14 nM for norepinephrine, and 10 nM for dopamine in rat brain synaptosomes. Simultaneously, 6-APB is a serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI), with affinities (Ki) of 117 nM for the norepinephrine transporter (NET), 150 nM for the dopamine transporter (DAT), and 2,698 nM for the serotonin transporter (SERT) as well as IC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration values for monoamine reuptake inhibition of 930 nM for serotonin, 190 nM for norepinephrine, and 3,300 nM for dopamine.
In addition to actions at the monoamine transporters, 6-APB is a potent high-efficacy partial agonist or full agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor (Ki = 3.7 nM; EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration = 140 nM; EmaxTooltip maximal efficacy = 70%). It has higher affinity for this target than any other site. Moreover, unlike MDMA, 6-APB shows 100-fold selectivity for the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor over the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors in terms of affinity. It is notably both more potent and more selective as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor than the reference serotonin 5-HT2B receptor agonist, BW-723C86, which is commonly used for research into the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor. Although much more potent at the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor, 6-APB is also a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (EC50 = 5,900 nM; Emax = 43%) and shows affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor (Ki = 270 nM) and the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor (Ki = 1,500 nM). It has been reported to act as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor similarly to the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors.
Besides the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, 6-APB has been found to bind with high affinity to the α2C-adrenergic receptor (Ki = 45 nM), although the significance of this action in humans is unknown. 6-APB showed little other affinity at a wide selection of other sites, with some exceptions like the rodent trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1).
The potent agonism of the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor makes it likely that 6-APB would be cardiotoxic with chronic or long-term use, as seen with other serotonin 5-HT2B receptor agonists such as the withdrawn serotonergic anorectic fenfluramine.

### Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of 6-APB have not been studied, however, some information can be extracted from user reports. These suggest a slow onset of 40 to 120 minutes. The drugs peak effects last 7 hours, followed by a comedown phase of approximately 2 hours, and after effects for up to 24 hours.

#### Metabolism

Although limited literature is available, there is some data on metabolism of 6-APB in rats. Its Phase I metabolism involves hydroxylation of the furan ring, then cleavage of the ring, followed by a reduction of the unsaturated aldehyde from the previous step. The resulting aldehyde may then take two paths. It is either oxidized to a carboxylic acid or reduced to an alcohol, and then hydroxylated. Phase II metabolism consists of glucuronidation. The most prevalent metabolites in rats were 3-carboxymethyl-4-hydroxyamphetamine and 4-carboxymethyl-3-hydroxyamphetamine.

## Chemistry

6-APB, also known as 6-(2-aminopropyl)benzofuran, is a phenethylamine, amphetamine, and benzofuran and an analogue of 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA).

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 6-APB has been described. The synthesis by Briner and colleagues entailed refluxing 3-bromophenol with bromoacetaldehyde diethylacetal and sodium hydride to give the diethyl acetal, which then was heated with polyphosphoric acid to give a mixture of bromobenzofuran structural isomers: 4-bromo-1-benzofuran and 6-bromo-1-benzofuran. The isomers were separated by silica gel column chromatography, then converted to their respective propanone derivatives, and then reductively aminated to give 6-APB and 4-APB, both of which were converted to their HCl ion pairs for further examination.

### Reagent results

6-APB and its structural isomer 5-APB have been tested with a series of agents including: Marquis, Liebermann, Mecke, and Froehde reagents. Exposing compounds to the reagents gives a colour change which is indicative of the compound under test.

6-APB succinate is reported to be practically insoluble in CHCl3 as well as very minimally soluble in cold water. A batch seized by the DEA contained a 2:1 ratio of succinate to 6-APB.

### Analogues

Analogues of 6-APB include MDA, 6-APDB, 6-MAPB, 5-APB, 6-APBT, and 6-API, among others.

## History

6-APB, along with 5-APB, was first described in the scientific literature by Karin Briner and colleagues at Eli Lilly and Company in a patent in 2000. They were specifically studied as serotonin 5-HT2C receptor agonists for potential medical applications at this time. The description of 5-APB and 6-APB in the literature had followed the earlier work on 5-APDB and 6-APDB as serotonin releasing agents and entactogens by David E. Nichols and colleagues at Purdue University in 1993. 6-APB, along with 5-APB, emerged as a novel designer drug in 2010. 5-APB and 6-APB are often confused with 5-APDB and 6-APDB.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Canada

In 1999, amphetamines were changed from Schedule III to Schedule I as a result of the Safe Streets Act. Some have speculated that 6-APB's structure qualifies it as a Schedule I drug as an analog of MDA.
In 2014, a study funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research noted that 6-APB "may or may not be legal in Canada depending on how one interprets the current Act" and that it could be purchased for academic purposes without an exemption from Health Canada. The study also noted how, unlike the MDMA it often serves as a replacement for in countries like the US, 6-APB's benzofuran structure does not make it a direct analogue of amphetamine despite similarities in effects.

#### China

6-APB has been a controlled substance in China since 1 July 2024

#### Finland

6-APB is scheduled in government decree on narcotic substances, preparations and plants and hence is illegal.

#### France

6-APB is illegal in France.

#### Germany

6-APB is illegal in Germany since the 17th of July, 2013, when it was added to Anlage II of the Betäubungsmittelgesetz.

#### Italy

6-APB is illegal in Italy.

#### Luxembourg

In Luxembourg, 6-APB is not cited in the list of prohibited substances. Therefore, it is still a legal substance.

#### Netherlands

6-APB, as well as multiple substances based on the phenylethamine structure, like most cathinones and amphetamines, are banned under the Opium Law since July 1st, 2025, following an amendment to deal with New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) in the  Netherlands. Since this is a structural ban instead of a direct one, later substances that differ slightly but use the same skeleton will also be preemptively banned.

#### New Zealand and Australia

Certain countries contain a "substantially similar" catch-all clause in their drug law, such as New Zealand and Australia. This includes 6-APB as it is similar in chemical structure to the class A drug MDA, meaning 6-APB may be viewed as a controlled substance analogue in these jurisdictions.

#### Sweden

In Sweden, as of 27 December 2009 6-APB is classified as "health hazard" under the act Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor (translated Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health).
It is also classified as a narcotic substance since 2020.

#### United Kingdom

On June 10, 2013 6-APB and a number of analogues were classified as Temporary Class Drugs in the UK following an ACMD recommendation. This means that sale and import of the named substances are criminal offences and are treated as for class B drugs. On November 28, 2013 the ACMD recommended that 6-APB and related benzofurans should become Class B, Schedule 1 substances. On March 5, 2014 the UK Home Office announced that 6-APB would be made a class B drug on 10 June 2014 alongside every other benzofuran entactogen and many structurally related drugs.

#### United States

6-APB is not scheduled at the federal level in the United States, but it may be considered an analog of amphetamine, in which case purchase, sale, or possession could be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act.
