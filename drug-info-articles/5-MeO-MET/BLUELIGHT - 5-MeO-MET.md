**Welcome to the Big & Dandy 5-MeO-MET Thread**

[original post]


Anyone tasted this?


Did a forum search and adding 5-MeO to anything results in it pulling anything that matches 5-MeO.


I've seen it around and I'm fairly curious about it, even given the rough bodyloads of most 5-MeO's in general.

I have been waiting for some info on this one to come up as well. I have searched all over the fucking place, and cant find anything. MGS mentioned something about it quite a while ago, so there may be info somewhere, I just for the life of me cant find it![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

I've got a PDF somewhere where it mentions this (in cell studies and animal tests) as being the most potent of the 5-MeOs...and it was tested against 5MeO-DMT, DET, MiPT, DIPT, DPT, and all the others you would expect.  I'll find it later.

Any mention of 5-Meo-NMT in that document MGS?  I'm planning to assay this one in the coming months.  I haven't even seen so much as a single confirmation of activity with this substance ... not even Tihkal has info.  I'll report when I get around to trying it.  ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I don't think that one was tested in there. (5-MeO-AMT).  If I recall, the study was looking at 5-meo-N,N-dialkyltryptamines only...and perhaps a N-monoalkyl tryptamine.

I forgot to look...but it may be on my website...just look for any photo I have uploaded here, and use that to access the index...then go to PDFs.


No, it wasn't human studies Mr Magic Kat.  These were cell receptor tests.  Test tubes can't smoke 5-MeO-DMT.

Actually, that wasn't the paper I was thinking of.  It actually had in print....5-MeO-MET>5-MeO-DMT>5-MeO-something...etc.  I'll have to continue to look through my files.

Either way, seems interesting.


But something stronger than 5-MeO-DMT... I don't think I could handle that holy shit.

That doesn't necessarily mean it's stronger in effect, just more potent.


Since it looks like information is beginning to be gathered, I've changed the title of this thread and made it a "small and growing" thread.  Once/if we get some experimenters or enough information, I'll make it Big and Dandy and link to it on the best of PD page.

Do you want to smoke it? If so and it is the HCL...put 10mg or so into solution and disperse 1/10th of the solution into a vaporizer, and evaporate the water off with low heat. Then vaporize the chemical and inhale the smoke.


Oh, I want to try this chemical SO bad!! 8) 8(

which i just found odd considering that AMT is a vastly different tryptamine... i realize that is very off topic but i thought it should be brought to light.

A study I was reading about Intra-parietal injection to rats ranked 5-MeO-MET as causing WAY MORE errors in the rats finding their way through the maze (this generally correlated to increased potency). The comparison was like 79% error for the MET rats and 29% error for the -DMT rats (or something like that). MGS has the paper, its like 5-meo-DMT and 4-HO-DMT and other tryptamine analogues.


I think this one is going to be really cool. I hope to be blessed with some soon.

The only thing I have seen is what is in this thread. That is why I am so interested in seeing a trip report. I'd definitely try it if I ever come across it, unless others report bad effects from it before I try it.


Hopefully it will not be like 5-meo-det, which is very potent but sounds quite unpleasant/toxic.


I would try eating a very small amount before attempting higher doses or other methods of administration since nothing is known about its effects or potential dangers.

yeah we were planning on just cutting to the chase and smoking it. Starting off with 1mg (and being prepared for something crazy!).


If we can extrapolate the reactions mice seem to undergo, there is something intense going on....I would guess it is much more potent than 5-MeO-DMT, but really, how potent can it be? I would think a +3 dose would be at minimum 2-3mg via vaporization. But, I well could be wrong...I'll probably load 1mg and maybe take half that for the first go.

I wonder, how potent can a 5-MeO get, though. I mean, 100ugs is probably pretty clearly out of the question for a +3 dose, right?


Or, am I stupid and changing 5-MeO-DET to 5-MeO-MET could entail a 10-fold increase in potency?


As a side-topic, is it purely coincidence that when you hydroxylate AMT you get a compound that seems toxic (ie causes dizziness, headaches, etc) and when you methyoxylate its fifth position (of AMT) you get a compound that seems VERY toxic, severe nausea, cramping, headaches, tachycardia, etc.


With MET (which is supposed to be a beautiful compound) when you hydroxylate its fourth position you get a very profound and beautiful trip (nearly equivalent to psilocin in depth and intensity from reports thus far). So, should this spell good news for methoxylation of its fifth position into 5-MeO-MET or is this not how things works?

Just a guess, but it seems like a better indicator would be to look at the affects of MET relative to DMT and DET. MET is indeed a beautiful compound, IMO, as of course is DMT. DET I've never tried, but it doesn't seem to have many fans. That would lead me to think 5meo-met would be more 5meo-dmt than 5meo-det, but there's only one way to be sure.

yeah, I agree flying squirrel, a full dose of DMT is about 60mg and a full dose of 5-MeO-DMT is 10mg. A full dose of DET is 40-60mg and a full dose of 5-MeO-DET is 10mg.


I would think 5-MeO-MET works out somewhere between 3-6mg for a vaporized dose. But, who knows.

I’m interested in this one but I’m a little scared, with the power and the negative body effects of 5-meo-dmt ( in the small doses). But 5-meo-dmt is so nice; it might have the possibility to be a good one, but I’m not going to be the first to try it. So tell us how it is?

I dropped the ball on it. If I get another line on it I won't let the next fish away.


I am very curious about it, but I have a lot of dates with Lucy and Kelly before I will think about doing anything that may turn out ho-hum.

In that pdf that was linked they mention 5-aco-dmt, as undergoing similar oxidative deamination, similar to how psilocybin -> psilocin.


If bufotenine is inactive due to poor lipid solubility but 5-aco-dmt crosses the BBB and turns into bufotenine, and is active, why have I seen scarce references to it?


Also, 5-meo-* is trouble. It seems that 5-position anything, relates more to critical functions. After all serotonin is a 5-position tryptamine.

5-Meo's affect HT3, which accounts for their tendency toward gastro-intestinal distress.


5-MeO-MET should be very potent, if the cellular tests are anything to go by.

its been on the market for well over 6 months now, has NOONE out there taken it? Everyone including me was so ready to blast MET, throw a methyl group on there and everyone stays on the out skirts. WELL.... I'll telll you what, someone send me some and I'll smoke itthe only 5meos I havent liked have been AMT and DMT, DIPT/MIPT where both REALY good to me (thanks you know who on that 5meo MIPT, wouldnt have ever done more if it wasnt for your first introduction with two 7mg doses)


so yeah, if youhave some on hand and would liek someone to try it, Im all receptors over here. Im less scared of this one as I am of bromodragonfly. NOW that is a worrysom compound.

smoking doses:


threshold 1mg

common  (middle) 5-8mg (for rest)

strong more 10mg


duration common doses

onset till 1min

plato 15-30min

come down 20-30min

total till 1h


oral:


threshold 7mg

common (middle) 13-15mg 

strong more 20 mg (i guess cause never tried till the moment but going to do it)

duration common doses

onset till 15-30 min

plato 20-40min

come down 30-40min

total till 2h

This one interests me (the 5-meo-met not the bufotenine junk) I am looking forward to more reports on it. I seems like it has potential to be a nice pleasure euphoric psychedelic, I might have to give it a go.

I really, really hope that this is not "euphoric" the same way 5-MeO-DiPT is "euphoric" ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png). In any case, this is not something I'd actively pursue... I might try it if offered, but thats about it.

Welcome to Bluelight, and thanks for sharing!  I have a couple of questions for you:


Have you tried 5-MeO-MiPT?


If so, how does it compare with 5-MeO-MET?


Likewise, if you've tried 5-MeO-DiPT, how does it compare?


My "intuition" about this compound makes me feel like it would be more similar to 5-MeO-MiPT, with more mental focus and less physical.  Which would be a very good thing indeed.

I wonder how IMing it will be?  I'll prolly start with an oral dosage...at least until I read more smoking reports.  Then try IM if it just doesn't work right orally.  But other than 5-MeO-DMT....the rest seem to do well orally.

Yeah, 5-MeO-MiPT works really well orally... it's one of the few chemicals I prefer orally to other routes (other potential routes being smoked, nasal, or rectal, as I haven't ever used a needle).

Hi all


Here long stories shorts:


...at 23:00 inhaled 5-6mg. Music is playing.

Rapid onset similar to 5MeoDMT.

I lay down on sofa. 

Feelings of calmness, relaxation, some stoning drowse spread on my body. Euphoria, especially pleasant sensations under skin, like on MDMA. At one moment  toss and turn,  next one stand motionless, going through very delicious feelings. Deeply sigh as it gives more high, breathing is very steady and placid. Time goes more slowly. Visuals are present but very weak. 

23:33 coming down.

 Plato is about  20min  but effects slowly reduces till hour. 

Strange as it may seem pupils are very dry. 


17:45 Took one good inhalation of  8 mg, came in my room, a lot of fumes left inside smoking device but I did not smoke it completely as I felt stuff in my brain very distinct. Music is playing.

Rapid onset almost the same as 5MeoDMT.

I lay down on sofa. 

Fast deep in well-known   5MeoDMT-state, but more smooth, more benign, there was no loss of reality, absence of thoughts, loss of mind control.

Pronounced high,  patterns on  wallpaper became alive. When eyes closed -  tipical phosphenes. Time goes more slowely.

I was pushed from my daily life  and I could easily draw attention from the outside to piece of my life,  to analize, to feel important events that happened till the moment, look forward in future.  

18:12 action of drug coming down, visuals got weak, became drowseness, 

I would say  5MeoDMT more hallucinogen then psychedelic.   5 Мео-МEТ more psychedelic then hallucinogen.   


20:50 I drunk  13 mg of  5 Мео-МEТ with beverage. Listening of music.

Rapid onset after 20min. Noticeble moving of surfaces, traces after  hands and legs  movements. Foremost dominate strong kinesthetic high, very similar to 5meodmt, skin became very sensitive, extremely pleasant sensations passing through my body. Perception of body, music, surroundings can be compare to smoked  150mg mdma  plus “stoned” feeling. 

 I ate orange. Very tasty. 


... inhaled 9mg of meomet. unexpectedly it was quite strong intoxication. A bit scared but in next moment manage to control oneself. state of my mind was very far from adequacy but surprisingly I was able to stand up and change a song from my play list. Quite noticeable visuals, euphoria but less of calm.

3-4 mg 5-MeO-MET HCl intranasal gave a uncertain threshold, about the same dose smoked gave some light, but distinct tryptamine buzz. more info when i've tried the substance in higher doses.

Yes, please share!  Try it orally, I recommend... 5-MeO-MiPT works best orally in my experience, better than nasal oe smoked.  Actually, smoked it can be a very intense flash but the dose required is like 5 times or so the dose required orally.

yes I agree also! (although I haven't tried smoking 5-meo-mipt). oral was considerably better than taking it nasally.

but wouldn't 5-MeO-MET be much closer to MET and 5-MeO-DMT, which are not too active orally because of rapid breakdown by MAO? but well, as time goes by I'll try it orally anyways sooner or later.

I'm not sure to be honest, but you should try it orally.  I would anyway.  Putting a 5-MeO or 4-HO/AcO on a tryptamine can completely change its properties.

MET had threshold activity at 90 mg orally, so 5-MeO-MET could potentially have oral activity.  Based on the relationships of other simple tryptamines with their 5-MeO counterparts, it seems that the methoxy does not significantly affect MAO susceptibility, but does generally boost the potency by somewhere around 10x.  


So 5-MeO-MET could have some oral activity in the 10 mg range (always start lower than you expect!), but I think the effects will be most similar to 5-MeO-DET, which basically causes dizziness and vertigo with a little psychedelia on the side.  For a more familiar comparison, I expect it will resemble a drawn out low dose 5-MeO-DMT experience … which to me sounds very unpleasant.  


Thinking about it, I need to try IM MIPT.  I’ve always thought it odd that it was written off as a mediocre psychedelic, but seeing how MET was uninspiring orally and spectacular via IM, I think I may have been too quick to dismiss it.  That, and I hope I someday make an acquaintance of DET.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yeah, I'd also try taking it orally.  5-MeO-DET and 5-MeO-MiPT are very active orally, so 5-MeO-MET might be as well.  Apparently even 5-MeO-DMT has some oral activity (though I rarely ever hear of it being used that way).  That ethyl may help its orally activity quite a bit.


Either way, I'd love to hear anything more you have to say about this compound.  I'm interested in acquiring it, but would love to get some more information first.  


It's possible smoking and taking it orally might change it a lot (dosage and effects) like 5-MeO-MiPT.  Interesting stuff, haha.

Unfortunately I stopped exploration meomet as my "grandfather " have only 20mg of it and his going to take it with mdma (when he will have got it) as mix.

As i wrote in my older post Ive tried 5meomet orally. It does indeed orally active, but dose much higher then smoked and action of the stuff not so sharp and distinct. 

oral 10mg weak active dose without noticable visuals but you may have certain mind changing which may be very usable in order to solve/get answer for some   daily problems. there was no any phisiological/mental negative  side effects. 

15-16mg orally gives more pronounced psychedelic effect but still nothing especially intresting.

7mg meomet and 7mg cb gives +2 psychedelic state with neutral motor activity (usually cb makes me speedy,  after 5meomet body becomes quite heavy, want to spread on sofa)

oops.

as i know MET has oral  threshold activity about 30mg! 

(have to say its dose for me on completely empty stomach)

I  tried the dose 10 and 20 mg , and I have to say that is very strange substance.

It doesn't cause any chagnes of perception .

I was very stoned. This substance causes problems with coordination , very weak OEV,CEV.

In my opinion it is very similar to 5-MEO-DMT

I have tried 24 mg 5-MeO-MET HCl nasally today, which resulted in a nice tryptamine buzz, but nothing really worth mentioning. from this experience, I would say this is one of the least potent of the 5-MeO-N,N-dialkyltryptamines. I don't see parallels with 5-MeO-DMT (which holds a very special place in my heart) on the one side, but on the other side there was no unconftable bodyload, so I guess you can't compare it with 5-MeO-DET either (which is pure poison according to shulgin). the onset was notable slow, it took about half an hour to develop full effects, total duration was about 4-5 hours. nitrous combined well with it, as usual.

Due to several factors this compound have become interesting so i was hoping that more people have tried it by now. 


And that someone have the PDF document that is linked to in the beginning of the thread and  re-upload it?

> Click to expand...


And that is why I never truly enjoyed foxy/moxy and I find 5-MeO-DMT's body feeling to be really strange... uncomfortable and relaxed yet stimulating and a bit unsettled and comfortable. Go figure.


As for 5-MeO-MET I was just looking into possible compounds and found out about this and other rare things like 4-ho-5-MeO-DMT... lol I've had my share of psilacetin and acid and 2c's but I dont think I'd ever want to ingest that shit ![:-P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


However, I can only wonder what 5-MeO-MET is like since 5-MeO's seem to change tryptamines ALOT. DMT vs 5-MeO-DMT is very different, as is foxy vs DiPT or Iprocin. I've never tried MET but from what I hear its decently different from DMT so I wonder if it would be more of an altered 5-MeO-DMT type of thing or a foxy-like experience or maybe not even close to any of those. If it smoked like 5-MeO-DMT I only wonder what its effects would be like. I've heard great things about 4-ho-met, but then again most of those psilocin-ish 4-subs are about the same (except iprocin)

I have the opportunity to try 5-meo-met. Been meaning  to for a while, but other stuff has taken priority. Maybe I'll do a quick trial with it soon. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

From the reports in this thread it looks mostly similar to 5-meo-dmt, so it seems the trend carries over with this one as well. I think it is orally active too, which is nice. I quite enjoy 5 subbed trypts, so Im looking forward to this one, though the reports in this thread dosent make it seem all that great.

an empty evening gave me the chance to try this compound...


i havent tried 5-meo-dmt yet so i cant compare, but i have experiences with other rcs (5meo-mipt might be the closest to this one.. but that may be a bit far fetched)


I read about the experiences in this thread and decided to go with a very low dose (~4mg) vaporized, looking for a threshold experience. Effects were felt after a few minutes. No time dilation was noticed. The experience lasted under an hour, with a plateau ~20mins


Music is quite enjoyable. Along with the body sensations, this is the substance's biggest plus


Visually there seems to bo nothing of interest, perhaps a bit of the shine triptamines usually give me, like contours being brighter with the color a bit running off. Nothing too spectacular. A + only. I dont think this will improve with dose


Bodywise, it gives quite the stoned feeling, a bit like weed, but also is quite relaxing. No euphoria, but a general increase in sensitivity. I imagine sex would be great in this state.


The effects taper off after ~20mins, and i am left with increased sensitivity to previous negative aspects (such as feeling my eyes dry and my head hurting... but i was at the end of a long day and i had both these symptoms before just didnt notice them that much)


i feel the substance is interesting, but probably a lot better at (a bit) higher doses. Will go for 6mg or 8mg inhaled, as usually for me tryptamines' effects are a lot more positive at a normal full dose than at threshold level. Also, setting seems to be particulaly important with this one.


Am wondering of the tolerance/cross tolerance with other tryptamines... Wouldnt want to spoil a long waited mushroom trip for a half hour of trippy stoning. Also wondering of the redosing potential on this one, especially with the erotic in mind ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I insufflated ~12-15mg of 5-MeO-MET fumarate. It burned, but it was quite tolerable. After 10 minutes, I felt intoxicated and nauseated. Although my stomach was empty, I vomited. The experience isn't very powerful, colors seem brighter, patterns on the wall look pronunced and my mood is lifted. 


It is very similar to 5-MeO-MiPT.

Well, now I am back to the baseline. It was nice 5-MeO experience(+1.5 on the Shulgin scale), very similar to 5-MeO-DALT or 5-MeO-MIPT. So, if you like these two, you will probably like this one. 

I think 5-MeO-MET can be sexually enhancing, and hopefully I will explore it more with my girlfriend. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Also, those 5-MeO-substituted tryptamines are VERY similar for me, no real visual, not very mind-altering, but having something unique - strange feeling which is hard to put in words.

I felt like my dose was quite low - I could easily take more, so I am going to experiment with higher doses, and maybe different ROA(IM?). But this will happen after I try 5-MeO-DMT ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) 

Also, forgot to mention about experience duration: it was around 4-6 hours. And my 5-MeO-MET is brownish color. [EDIT]And it is fumarate salt.[/EDIT] 

It is kinda strange that this one so unpopular: 5-MeO-MIPT is readily available; it is more potent, but even not very potent things like 4-HO-DPT are less difficult to get.

We are probably working with the same material then. Mine is also slightly tan/brown and is a fumarate salt. I will try to make time for this stuff soon, and report back.

^ Well, you may be disappointed, although 5-MeO-MET reminds me of 5-MeO-MiPT, it is still quite different. For example, I didn't get "sweet", "sugar" feeling in my head. 


But I hope you'll like it![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Please report back.

I'll try to find some time for a trial with this one in the near future, but I can't make any promises - so many other interesting things to try. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I'd really like to see how this combines with 5-meo-dmt though - if there is any chance they might potentiate eachother, maybe throw in a bit of 2c-d as well.. hmm. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

5-meo-met is a psychedelic. And the least potent of the 5-meo-xxx (exception: 5-meo-dmt) when taken orally.

I dose it usually between 20-30mg. 

Orally is the only ROA I tried. I think the N-ethyl group isn't fully protecting against MAO and thats the reason that it's less potent than the N,N-diethyl; N-methyl,N-isopropyl; N,N-dipropyl and the N,N-diisopropyl variants. 

So it could be way more potent through other ROAs. 


There is also a big and dandy thread about this compound in the psychedelic index...

I haven't seen this one moving in the circles I frequent, perhaps soon.


4-meo-dmt has been made available recently, I wonder what the similarities/differences would be to the two. (IE: duration, spectrum of visual/physiological effects, etc.)


Has anyone vaporized either of these chemicals with successful results (ala DMT freebase)?

vaporized 10mgs 5MEOMET 45minutes ago.


very pleasant stoned state, stimulated/sedated at once, lying around is intensive as hell ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png). definetly psychedelic.

very sexual for me, bodily more so than 5meomipt. For comparison reasons, 5meodmt is also very sexual for me.

Has anyone sampled this compound recently? There are only a handful of bioassay trials, at quite low doses at that. 

I found 5-MeO-DMT to be rather underwhelming even up to 50mg vaporized and 70mg intranasally, but I seem to gave some special affinity to MET, 4- HO-MET, and 4-AcO-MET, and would jump at the opportunity to sample this one if it ever became available to me.

I haven't "broken through" on 5MeODMT, but I do like lowish doses of that compound. (eg 3-12mg snorted, over the course of 15minutes)

Main effect I would describe as hornyness..


5MeOMET is more or less the same for me, at lowish doses. I smoked it a few times (2-15mg) and I liked it. It made me more horny than 5meoDMT. Very nice bodyfeel, no true visuals or psychedelic headspace.

I didn't push higher because it seemed to be rather demanding of the body, in terms of heart rate.


I also like 4HOMET a lot. Haven't tried MET yet.

Could you go a little further in depth about the duration of your 5-MeO-MET experiences? It's DMT counter part only lasted about 45-60 minutes tops in all of my trials and I could never break through or experienced *the feat* like many others report.


MET is a much stronger psychedelic than other base tryptamines, with it's cousins being more visionary in nature. MET and it's homologs always strike me as having a feminine characteristic to them while still being incredibly serious. MET is a hard hitter, that's for sure. Hence my interest in its 5-MeO counterpart.

I have to draw this from memory so it could be off but it was generally the same as 5meodmt for me.


After smoking I was at the peak in a few minutes, stayed there for +/-30minutes and then gradually came down. Redosing was effective. 

Maybe the comedown was a bit longer than on 5meodmt. With the latter there was a short comedown and then an afterglow. Not so much with 5meomet. More of a comedown a la smoked 5MEOMIPT. 

Again, I could be mistaken because it's been a while and didn't make notes.


I don't know about the feminine chararacteristics, but I have to say I find 4HOMET very deep. This is not the general appreciation if you check the B&D's. I was never really religious but on 4HOMET I felt like Jesus was with me. This was not a one time thing. Before this I was somewhat interested in "the universe" and the way it all works, but never considered myself religious or even spiritual. Hard to explain, but the feeling 4HOMET woke in me was that of "Jesus". It "felt" like that. 15-20years before I got some religious lessons in primary school, and that was the last I heard of Jesus. I never pondered it consciously after that.

It didn't feel masculine or feminine, it just felt like Jesus ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Missed this thread.  5-MeO-MET is great (smoked, didn't try it orally)!  The only 5-MeO-'T" that is close to be as good as 5-MeO-DMT.


If I had to sum it up...I'd say it felt like a synthetic version of 5-MeO-DMT...same trip but the length is spread out over 45 min instead of 10 minutes.  There is a rush, but it's more like hitting the gas in a Lincoln as opposed to being shot out of a cannon.


I generally find 5-MeO-DMT VERY easy on my body and mind...but there have been times when I have taken it when not in the best place in my head...resulting in some unpleasant physical sensations.  5-MeO-MET seems less likely to produce those effects.


Atheists, ignore this...those who are not...5-MeO-MET was essentially a 5-MeO-DMT trip with the 'godly component' removed....that lasted a lot longer.

^ MGS I could never get much of a rush out of 5-MeO-DMT, and have never properly broken through with DMT proper yet MET is intensely psychedelic; to the point where I am nearly terrified of using it without weeks of planning.

Do you think 5-MeO-MET would be a dud for me as most 5-MeO's are?

I suspect you may like it, but only one way to find out.  Of all the synthetic 5MeO analogues, without a doubt this one is the easiest to take.  Much less rough around the edges than 5-MeO-MiPT.

I've only tried this orally so far, and I was favorably impressed by it. Surprisingly, the experience I had was actually predicted by the material's similarity to 5-MeO-MiPT and 4-AcO-MET. Perhaps it was just the power of suggestion, but I learned long ago not to expect that a structural similarities would create at all similar effects. This, though, was just what I would have imagined the hybridization of those two molecules would create.


5-MeO-MET felt much more stimulating than 5-MeO-MiPT, much like I find 4-AcO-MET to be more stimulating than 4-AcO-MiPT.

It was clean in the body and crystal clear in the headspace. Even my vision felt brighter and cleaner. 

In place of the raw and urgent eroticism of the MiPT class, it was more like an adult version of 4-AcO-MET. There was a radical openness and frankness to its eroticism, replacing intoxicating empathy with an honest examination of my feelings. 

While I think I like it about as much as I like 5-MeO-MiPT, the substitution of fantastic hedonism of frank examination probably means it won't be as widely appreciated. I think it could be a great material, but will probably tone the dose back in the future if I get the chance to revisit it. I think it's a shame it's so rare.

My only real gripe was that I found it overly stimulating, which tempers my enthusiasm for exploring vaporization. For fans of stimulating psychedelics, I could see that being quite an interesting ROA.

im ordering a gram of 5 meo met with some 4 ho met and phenibut on friday, assuming it all stays in stock. 

I was planning on smoking a small dose (for me) of about 5-10 mgs of 5 meo met while peaking on 4 ho met.

Im thinking it should help launch me to hyperspace, maybe a a bit of nitrous if i still havent blasted off.


I see such conflicting reports about the body load though, is it as present when the compound is smoked? im assuming since the dose is so low id be fine just putting the powder in a meth bubble and smoking with a jet lighter? im pretty sure i will have the fumarate salt. but with such a potent compound im sure it can be smoked anyways

I ordered 250 mgs of this. im thinking of dissolving 100 mgs in 1 ml of alcohol, then dropping 0.1 ml of the solution onto something inert like 100 mgs clove or parsley or something. let it dry and i should have 0.1 of plant material with about 10 mgs of 5 MeO MET. what do u guys think? or should i just vape it as is? I just thought it would be much easier to dose with the "pseudo-changa" then pure powder.

Bleh. So my payment for some odd reason did not go through to my vendor. I had to re order and since I had spent money only had enough for my 2 grams of 4 ho met and only 100 MG's of 5 meo met to experiment with rather than the 250 I initially wanted.  .


I will be trying it and posting trip reports here, erowid and reddit. I find it baffling and almost frustrating that this compound has been available since 2007 and this thread is literally one of the only places I could find discussing its use as a psychedelic in humans. Psychonaut wiki doesn't even have a page on it. Is it like regular wiki?if so I think we should create a Psychonaut wiki page for 5 meo met.


I plan to give my friend about 10-15 MG's vaporised as he wants to see if he can get a 5 meo DMT like trip. I myself will be trying the same dose once from baseline. And then perhaps a 10 mg smoked dose while peaking on 4 ho met


I will let you all know how it goes. I look forward to trying to add to our knowledge. Insane something like this has gone so unresearched when its so easily available. You can find trip reports on substances that are probably harder to get and more unpleasant.but nothing on 5 meo met. Also my vendor began carrying Dimethyltryptophan . apparantley its easily decarboxylated to DMT (with heat??? No idea personally) Im gonna start a thread on it

So I've got 100 MG's of this. But I'm wary to try as the 5 meo's are so potent and have a big body load.


How can I smoke this safely? My vendor carries other 5 meo tryptamines. And I'm worried of the possibility of a mix up. My 5 meo met is an off white crystalline powder. All The MET and 4 ho Met I've ever had has been brown/red. I'm paranoid of the possibility of receiving something like 5 meo amt and overdosing.


How should I go about this? Volumetric dosing and work up? Please help guys

Well this sounds about the most interesting compound ive heard about in a while! As a huge fan of both 5-MeO-DMT and 4-HO-MET, this sounds right up my alley. A very potent slower and longer drawn out 5-meo-dmt type experience with the clarity and hedonistic erotic enhancement of 4HOMET? Count me in. I will hopefully be reporting back soon

So I vaped this last night while peaking on 4 ho met. I smoked about 20 mg. It was just like DMT. After blowing out the vapor I entered some heavy visions. Very native american. I was at the big powow dance in the sky with gods love forever and ever.


It was a bit scary as the ego was obliterated but I managed

@ OntarioGuy - I want to point out that 4-HO-MET is supposed to be white, not brown/red. Ditto for all other 4-subs, 5-subs and base tryptamines, although it isn't uncommon to encounter off-white material (as you did with 5-MeO-MET), and in the case of DMT, yellow(ish). Brown/red indicates impure and/or degraded material.

Thanks. The product didn't seem to be degraded. It was on point potency wise. I'd assume its just the way it was synthed. I see a lot of brownish 4 sub's that are excellent quality

I find smoking this stuff to be pretty stimulating. My heart started pounding, I started sweating. I was wondering if maybe it shares some simalirities to AMT or something.  I was peaking on 4 ho MET when I vaped it but my heart seemed fine before vaping the 5 meo. 


After the intense visions ended I was still left with a reality shattering ego stripping high. I was sure I was dead or dying. I became twisted in a thought loop. Same moment in time over and over. Surely these are the flames of purgatory...... Then accepted it and it wasn't so bad. It gradually wore off. But throughout was the pounding heart and sweating. Or are those side effects common to all 5 meo compounds in your experience?


With my experiences with 4 ho met and MET itself I expected this to be gentler. Like I said, I'm wondering if there's some kind of stimulant action going on, like dopamine norepi or what ever....


This stuff smoked by itself really didn't do much for me at about 15 MG's. But I may have had a lingering tolerance. I seen this described as psychedelic nitrous. Not much on its own, but will totally blast you off from a platform of 4 sub's or LSD's. That seems about in line with my experience

5-MeO-DMT has often been reporting to cause a pounding heart and intense bodyload too, before it obliterates your ego.  The 5-MeO-tryptamines all seem to have a prety intense cardiovascular bodyload, it's just part of them.  This nature is not shared by most other tryptamines.  I doubt it has anything to do with similarity to AMT, as AMT is a triple monoamine releaser (it releases serotonin like MDMA does, whereas the other tryptamines just mimic serotonin in receptors).

I enjoyed it well enough orally, but after a redose I found it unpleasantly stimulating and thus slightly anxiogenic. Even though my report was glowing, all I remember from the experience was the annoying simulation, so I never revisited it

Ya my experience was quite stimulating. Fully visionary (smoked while peaking on metocin though) and full ego suppression coinciding with psychic death and thought and time loops. All in all a very psychedelic experience. But I don't think it will be reached for often when I dig in the stash for a trip

I did a first trial of this yesterday.  It was 6mg rectal.  I only have 20mg (now 14mg) and wanted to work up in 2 doses which is why I went the rectal route.  I will write an "official" trip report once I do the larger dose sometime.  


**First trial of 5-MeO-MET - 6mg orally**

Feb 12th, 2020

by Xorkoth​

**2:30pm*** (T+0:00)* - Ingested 6mg of 5-MeO-MET rectally.  It has the appearance of a tan, fine powder, reminiscent of the 5-MeO-MiPT I have.  I tasted a tiny bit of it (just a dusting elft on the weighing tray) and it tastes just about like 5-MeO-MiPT.  I'm about to run down the street and pick something up.  I wanted to work out but I don't have time.  When I get back, I have some work to do and my boss to talk to about that work.  Afterwards I will go to band practice.  I wanted to have a normal day where I had work and music in order to test what should be a fairly low dose of this.  I find it to be a good calibration setting with which to gauge a substance's effects profile.  At a later time I will take the rest in a different setting to try for a full experience.  I only have 20mg of this, which is why I opted for rectal administration, considering 20mg is in the middle of a "common" dosage in the sparse information available.  Rectal tends to double the strength, so this should get me the two experiences I am aiming for, from light to full.


**3:15pm*** (T+0:45)* - Just got back.  I wrote a single note in my phone, "T+0:08 - lightheaded euphoria".  Very quickly, I experienced a flush of physical pleasure and almost a bit of a spinny-headed feeling, but in a good way.  There was very little transition, I just suddenly began feeling good, with a light but definite emotional euphoric push.  I still feel that same way, it has increased a bit but it was remarkable how quickly it established itself.  Unlike with 5-MeO-MiPT, there is basically no unpleasant jangliness to it, it's extremely smooth.  There is no anxiety to speak of, really no come-up feelings.  The amplitude of the euphoria is less than what I tend to feel with 5-MeO-MiPT, but there is also far less of a price.  There is a faint suggestion of a visual change, but no actual change.  So far this has been entirely pleasant.  It feels slightly stimulating, in that I'm doing a bit of jaw clenching, but I feel calm.  It feels like more of an entactogen than a psychedelic at this dosage, but I can tell the psychedelia will develop more at a higher dose.  I have a bit of psychedelic social awkwardness, very manageable, but it's there.


**5:15pm*** (T+2:45)* - The last 2 hours really flew by.  I was working, so I wasn't paying a lot of attention to the effects.  I was able to work quite effectively.  I was talking on the phone with my boss and presenting some stuff I found for a good portion of that, and I had no difficulties with that except for a slight propensity for difficulty in word recall poking out here and there.  Nothing major though.  I still feel nice now, it feels past peak, but still more or less the same as before, just a little less intense.  I have the feeling this is a very light dose and that it will develop more as the dose is pushed.  I think next time, given its very unthreatening and comfortable nature, I will dose the remaioning 14mg rectally, which should (going by standard convention) be roughly equivalent to about 28mg orally, which should be a fairly strong dose.  I ate a small meal, and eating was pleasant.  I am just trying to finish up some final work tasks, and then I am off to band practice.


**The next morning**​

The rest of the night was marked by pleasantness and transparency.  I showed up at band practice and felt at ease.  One of our members didn't show up, and didn't let us know until the last minute, and the others were highly annoyed, and I was annoyed too, but still found myself in good humor and suggested we work on some other stuff.  The music was very good, we worked out a new cover for our show in a couple of days, and practiced some stuff we were rusty on.  I felt I was playing about average, but I was exceptionally into it and felt very creative.


I quit smoking cigarettes about a week ago, and my bandmates smoke, and band practice and shows are my biggest trigger, but I felt at peace not smoking.  I don't know if 5-MeO-MET aided me in that or if I just am pleased to no longer be smoking cigarettes.  It's hard to say exactly when the effects wore off, as they were very smooth and background to begin with. I kept feeling the warm glow of contentment, even at 10pm (T+7:30) when I got home, but it was most certainly an afterglow.  It was hard to differentiate the post-peak and the afterglow.  This morning I feel normal with no afterglow, hangover, or any sign that I took anything yesterday.


I find it curious that 5-MeO-MET is quite a bit less potent than the other 5-MeO-tryptamines I am aware of (5-MeO-MiPT, 5-MeO-DiPT, 5-MeO-AMT, 5-MeO-EiPT), even though 4-HO/AcO-MET and MET itself are not particularly less potent than their cousins.  Other than the potency, I can't help but draw similarities to 5-MeO-MiPT.  Both are have marked by a euphoric glow, with some psychedelia but an equal amount of empathigenic/emptactogenic loveliness.  It might not hold true at a higher dose, but I found 5-MeO-MET to be less intense, more comfortable, less euphoric, and less psychedelic. 


I look forward to trying the rest of what I have.  I kind of wish I had saved the whole 20mg for one single go, but I wanted to be cautious with something so obscure.


tl;dr - Similar to 5-MeO-MiPT, less potent, more comfortable, less intense.

I did my second trial of this, which was the last of the sample I had.  I posted a double trip report in the TR forum, here it is:

While I love 5-meo-DMT as well as 4 ho met, I do not really enjoy the 5-meo-MET. The body load at 8mg was the worst I've ever had from any tryptamine. I was shaking/trembling for the majority of the experience as well as quite a bit of nausea and then obvious bloating of my GI. It was visual in a way, but I couldnt really enjoy them, cuz I just felt too shakey. My setting could have been better tho. It was in a very small bedroom w 2 other people. I did like the duration tho

Oops, freebase in an oil burner. Total duration was about an hr. It hit just as quick as 5meodmt tho in a way more jankier and less smooth way. Peak was probably at the 20-30 minute area with a slow but steady decline. Dose was eyeballed, but minuscule, about the size of a match head, maybe a little bigger. What's crazy is me and person #2 both made it to a clear +++ and we had thought the amount we would just dip our toes in. 


Powerful stuff.

Yes it would work just fine.  I haven't done it, but judging by other tryptamines, it should increase the potency by 1.5 to 2 times.  However, IMO oral is better, as it lasts longer and seems a more full experience.  Plus these tryptamines come on fast orally.

Today I had my second trial vaporizing 5-MeO-MET freebase (converted from the fumarate via sodium carbonate).


I placed a drop of gooey freebase about the size of a match head in my Glass Vapor Genie which I had stuffed with six screens.


I have little baby lungs, so it took me a few tokes over a few minutes before I started feeling effects.


There was a sensation of rising, and my whole body was vibrating. I closed my eyes expecting a DMT-style breakthrough, but I think I didn't take enough. Instead I got open-eye visual distortions, psychedelic ideation, and the urge to yawn, stretch and gurn. After about 10 minutes, I was able to get up and retrieve some socks, because my feet were suddenly cold.


The long tail of aftereffects lasted about half an hour and consisted of a pleasant body buzz and a feeling of lightness.


Overall it was enjoyable, but very harsh on the lungs. Next time I will attempt to plug the remaining fumarate.
