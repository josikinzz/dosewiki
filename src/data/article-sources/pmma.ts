## SYNTHESIS

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS

## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
For a completely silly and romantic reason. When the MDMA story became front-page news back in mid-1985, the cartoonist-author of Doonesbury, Gary Trudeau, did a two-week feature on it, playing it humorous, and almost (but not quite) straight, in a hilarious sequence of twelve strips. On August 19, 1985 he had Duke, president of Baby Doc College, introduce the drug design team from USC in the form of two brilliant twins, Drs. Albie and Bunny Gorp. They vividly demonstrated to the enthusiastic conference that their new drug âIntensityâ was simply MDMA with one of the two oxygens removed. âVoila,â said one of them, with a molecular model in his hands, âLegal as sea salt.â And what is MDMA with one oxygen atom removed? It is 4-methoxy-N-methylamphetamine or METHYL-MA which, according to the twins, should give the illusion of substance to oneâs alter ego. So, I called it Doonesamine, or simply âDOONEâ for short. Maybe that was also a homonym for Frank Herbertâs science fiction book, âDune,â wherein the magical drug âspiceâ provided a most remarkable alteration of the userâs state of consciousness.

This comic strip presentation was the first nationally distributed allusion to the term âdesigner drugs,â and perhaps it lent unexpected support for the passage, just a year later, of the Controlled Substances Analogue Enforcement Act of 1986. This intentionally vague piece of legislation makes the giving of, or the taking of, or even the possession with the intent to take, any drug that in any way alters your state of consciousness, a felony. A shameful and desperate effort by the governmental authorities to maintain the image of control in a lost situation.

Enough editorial. Back to historic technicalities. In truth, METHYL-MA is a well studied drug, at least in animals. In both mice and rats, it is an exceptionally potent agent in creating the state of catatonia. Animal studies, prompted by the clandestine synthesis of METHYL-MA, have shown that there is indeed locomotor stimulation and some central effects, but these effects are somehow different than those of a simple amphetamine-like agent. The experimenterâs conclusions, based on its structural resemblance to 4-MA and its proclivity to produce catatonia in some animal species and the ever-present possibility that there might be unsuspected neurochemical changes to be seen with its use, are that human experimentation should be discouraged. I have come to the same conclusion, but in my case this is based on a much more succinct observation: I tried it and I didnât like it.

A brief comment on two of the N,N-dimethylhomologues of methoxyamphetamine. One was 4-methoxy-N,N-dimethylamphetamine, 4-MNNA. This material, made by the reductive amination of 4-methoxyphenylacetone with dimethylamine, was a colorless oil, which distilled at 70â85 Â°C at 0.3 mm/Hg. The corresponding 2-methoxy-N,N-dimethylamphetamine was similarly made. 2-MNNA was also a colorless oil and had the same bp. Both of them were fluorinated with 18F labelled acetyl hypofluorite (3% and 6% yields respectively) but neither of them was pursued any further in the search for a brain blood flow indicator.

## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Common: 100 - 120 mg
- Strong: Higher dosages can result in serious hyperthermia and eventually death.

**Duration:**
- Total: short
**PMMA can cause serious side effects even at moderate doses, such as [hyperthermia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature) and [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) , which can easily result in death or hospitalization.**
 
As a result, it is strongly discouraged to use this substance. Please see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PMMA#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) for more details.
**para-Methoxymethamphetamine** (also known as **4-methoxymethamphetamine** , **4-MeOMA** , inaccurately as **"4-MMA"** (which should instead be reserved for [4-MMA](/w/index.php?title=4-MMA&action=edit&redlink=1) (4-MeMA) instead) and more commonly as **PMMA** ) is a highly dangerous and toxic synthetic substance of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) class that is closely related to [PMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PMA) . Like PMA, it is known for producing extremely dangerous, life-threatening side effects. At lower dosages, its effects are somewhat different from PMA, with reduced tendency to cause severe [hyperthermia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature) while producing more [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) effects that can be mistaken for [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) (although at higher dosages it does have the same risk as PMA). Its history of use is unknown, but it has appeared more frequently in the 2000s and 2010s. It is generally less potent than PMA.

**PMMA, along with other drugs like [PMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PMA) and [PMEA](/w/index.php?title=PMEA&action=edit&redlink=1) have very little recreational value and are considered as one of the most dangerous and toxic substances known. It is strongly recommended that these two substances should be completely avoided.**

## Chemistry

PMMA (para-Methoxymethamphetamine or 4-MMA) is a molecule of the [substituted amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) class. Molecules of the amphetamine class contain a phenethylamine core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain with an additional methyl substitution at R α . It contains a methoxy (OCH 3 ) functional group bound to the R 4 carbon of the phenyl ring, as well as a methyl substitution at R N . PMMA is the N-methylated version of [PMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PMA) and the 4-Methoxy analog of [Methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) .

## Pharmacology

PMMA, like [PMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PMA) most likely acts as a [selective serotonin releasing agent](/w/index.php?title=Selective_serotonin_releasing_agent&action=edit&redlink=1) (SSRA) with weak effects on dopamine and norepinephrine transporters. However, relative to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , it is considerably less effective as a releaser of serotonin with properties more akin to a reuptake inhibitor in comparison. It evokes robust hyperthermia while producing only modest hyperactivity and serotonergic neurotoxicity, substantially lower than that caused by MDMA. Anecdotal reports suggest it is not particularly euphoric at all, perhaps even dysphoric in contrast. PMMA has also been shown to act as a potent, reversible inhibitor of the enzyme [MAO-A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) with no significant effects on MAO-B, and the combination of this property and serotonin release is likely responsible for its high lethality potential. It is likely metabolized to PMA, just like [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) is metabolized to [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) in the body.

It appears that PMMA elevates body temperatures dramatically; the cause of this property is suspected to be related to its ability to inhibit MAO-A and at the same time releasing large amounts of serotonin, effectively causing [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) . It appears that PMMA activates the hypothalamus much more strongly than MDMA and other drugs like [ephedrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ephedrine) , thereby causing rapid increases in body temperature (which is the major cause of death in PMMA mortalities). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the user's physical energy levels, PMMA is commonly regarded as moderately stimulating and energetic exclusively at lower dosages.
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)** - Accelerated and abnormal heartbeats are extremely common with PMMA.
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)** - This effect is significantly more common with PMMA than it is with [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) or [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)** - The most common cause of death from PMMA is due to severe hyperthermia.
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** and **Vomiting** - This is common at any dose.
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Rapid breathing](/w/index.php?title=Rapid_breathing&action=edit&redlink=1)** - People commonly report "not being able to breathe".

- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)**
- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)**
- **[Vibrating vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vibrating_vision)** - This effect is generally more frequent than with [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** or **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)** - This depends greatly on the dosage, as higher dosages are almost guaranteed to bring anxiety, due to all the adverse effects.
- **[Empathy, love and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_love_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This effect is only present at lower doses and its much less pronounced than with [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** or **[Cognitive dysphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysphoria)** - This depends greatly on the dosage, as higher dosages are almost guaranteed to bring dysphoria, due to all the adverse effects.
- **[Dream suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_suppression)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Visual effects
 
- At moderate to high dosages, PMMA is capable of producing typically mild or moderate visual distortions, which are usually more common and pronounced than with [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , but significantly less when compared with most [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , such as [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . 
#### Suppressions
 
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)**
 
#### Distortions

- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: PMMA](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_PMMA.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

PMMA and its relative [PMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PMA) can be considered extremely toxic when compared to other substances such as [Methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) or [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . Ingestion of PMMA has been associated with severe tachycardia (abnormally high heart rate), [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure) , [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) , [hyperthermia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature) , and death. PMMA has a relatively slow onset, causing many users to redose which causes excess toxicity.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if choosing to use this substance.

## Legal status

In February 2002, the European Council decided that PMMA shall be subjected by the Member States to control measures and criminal penalties within three months.

- **Austria** : PMMA is illegal to possess, produce and sell under the SMG (Suchtmittelgesetz Österreich). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Brazil** : Possession, production and sale is illegal as it is listed on Portaria SVS/MS nº 344.

para-Methoxymethamphetamine (PMMA), also known as 4-methoxy-N-methylamphetamine (4-MMA), is a serotonergic drug of the amphetamine family related to para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA). It is the 4-methoxy analogue of methamphetamine. Little is known about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of PMMA; because of its structural similarity to PMA, which has known toxicity in humans, it is thought to have considerable potential to cause harmful side effects or death in overdose. In the early 2010s, a number of deaths in users of the drug MDMA were linked to misrepresented tablets and capsules of PMMA.
PMMA is a serotonin–norepinephrine releasing agent (SNRA) as well as potent monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). Its effects in humans are reputedly similar to those of PMA, but slightly more empathogenic in nature. It has a reduced tendency to produce severe hyperthermia at low dosages, but at higher dosages side effects and risk of death become similar to those of PMA.
The synthesis and effects of PMMA were described by American experimental chemist Alexander Shulgin in his book PiHKAL, where it is referred to by the name "methyl-MA", as the N-methylated form of 4-MA (PMA).

## Effects

According to Alexander Shulgin in PiHKAL, the effects of PMMA at 110 mg included tachycardia, compulsive yawning, and nystagmus, among others. It was said to have some of the physical side effects of the entactogen MDMA but none of its central effects. No psychedelic-like effects were mentioned. In rodents, PMMA produces hyperlocomotion, no changes in locomotor activity, and/or catatonia, and has effects that are said to differ from those of amphetamine-like stimulants. It has been said not to have amphetamine-like properties in rodents even at high doses. Similarly, PMMA did not substitute for the psychedelic DOM. On the other hand, in contrast to PMA, PMMA fully substituted for MDMA in drug discrimination tests in rodents, despite not having MDMA-like psychoactive effects in humans. In any case, PMMA is said to lack the amphetamine- or stimulant-like properties of MDMA.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

PMMA is a monoamine releasing agent (MRA). The drug's EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration values for induction of monoamine release in rat brain synaptosomes have been reported for the individual enantiomers of PMMA. In the case of (S)-PMMA, they are 41 nM for serotonin, 147 nM for norepinephrine, and 1,000 nM for dopamine, whereas for (R)-PMMA, they are 134 nM for serotonin, >14,000 nM for norepinephrine, and 1,600 nM for dopamine. Hence, PMMA appears to be a serotonin–norepinephrine releasing agent (SNRA) with weak effects on dopamine. The drug has been found to strongly release serotonin and to weakly release dopamine in the brain in rodents in vivo.
In addition to its MRA activity, PMMA is a potent monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibitor. Its IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration for MAO-A inhibition has been reported to be 1,700 nM. This is several-fold less potent than the related agents para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA) and 4-methylthioamphetamine (4-MTA).
PMMA is said to lack affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. In one study, its affinities were >20,000 nM for the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor, 13,600 nM for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, and >13,000 nM for the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor. On the other hand, PMMA shows much higher affinities for the mouse and rat trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1).

## Recreational use

PMMA has been found in tablets and capsules of the MDMA sold as "ecstasy". A number of deaths have been attributed to tablets sold as ecstasy that contained other substances, such as PMMA's structural analog, PMA. Death can occur when an ecstasy user believes they are consuming recreational doses of MDMA, when they are in fact consuming a lethal dose of another substance with similar effects. PMA is of particular concern because it not only causes a release of serotonin but also acts as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI); if it is used in combination with MDMA or another MDMA-like substance, serotonin syndrome can result.
PMMA can be detected with reagent testing kits.

### Deaths

In January 2011, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation reported that Norway had seen 12 deaths related to PMMA over the course of six months. In March 2011, Dutch media reported that there had been four deaths in the province of Limburg since November 2010. In April 2011, Icelandic media reported the death of a young woman that may have been connected to PMMA.
In 2011, four deaths were recorded in Scotland as a result of ecstasy tablets which also contained PMMA.
In January 2012, a number of ecstasy-related deaths in Canada in the previous year were linked to PMMA overdoses.  In the single year, approximately 45 exposures occurred, resulting in 21 deaths.  Cases were centred primarily in Calgary and Vancouver.
In September 2012, the deaths of two men in County Cork, Ireland, have been linked to PMMA overdoses. In the same month, the death of a man in Queensland, Australia was attributed to PMMA.
In June 2013 a PMMA-related death occurred in the Dutch city of 's-Hertogenbosch.
Two months later, In August 2013, another possibly PMMA-related death occurred in the nearby town of Sliedrecht.
In January 2015 in the UK four people died, suspected of taking ecstasy containing PMMA. In the same month, in Sweden, another man died from ecstasy laced with PMMA.
In May 2015 a young woman died in Dublin, Ireland, after taking what is suspected to be PMMA.
In April 2016 four young Argentines and one Uruguayan died during a massive rave called "Time Warp" in Buenos Aires and five more were hospitalized. PMMA was found in their bodies.

## Legal status

### United States

On June 25, 2021, the DEA finalized a rule placing PMMA on the Controlled Substance Act federal Schedule as a Schedule I substance effective July 26, 2021.

### United Kingdom

PMMA is controlled as a Schedule 1, Class A drug in the UK.
