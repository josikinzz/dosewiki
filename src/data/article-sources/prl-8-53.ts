## Subjective Experience

PRL-8-53 is purported to improve short term memory, a claim which has been
supported via limited trial data:

\`\`\`
“A single study in humans was reported in 1978. The double-blind trial of
PRL-8-53 in 47 healthy volunteers measured its effects on a variety of
cognitive measures. 5 mg of the drug was administered orally 2–2.5 hours
before the study tasks. Overall improvements in recollection differed based
on how many words were recalled under placebo, with the poor performers
(six words or fewer) experiencing a 87.5-105% increase in recollection and
the high performers (eight or more words) a 7.9-14% increase which failed to
reach statistical significance; when controlling for subjects over the age of
30 only, a 108-152% increase was noted. No side effects were reported
during the trial.” ~ Wikipedia
\`\`\`
Short of engaging a formal testing regime it is impossible to substantiate this. There
are, however, many online reports by nootropic enthusiasts to peruse.

I can confirm that I felt no ill effects from the experiment. In terms of positive
recreational value, this was minor, and could easily have been a placebo effect.
Additional commentary is therefore not justified.

## Summary

A nootropic research chemical first synthesized in the 1970's. There is a single clinical study showing drastic improvement in mid-term memory among users, but otherwise it is severely under researched and caution should be given to any singular study. The reportedly does not have recreational value.

## Classification
- **Categories:** research-chemical, nootropic, tentative
- **Also known as:** prl853

## Dosage

### Oral
- **Common:** 5-10mg
- **Light:** 3-5mg
- **Strong:** 10-20mg+
- **Threshold:** 2-3mg

*Note:  NOTE: It is strongly recommend to start with low dosages and increase slowly.*

## Duration
- **Duration:** hours
- **After Effects:** 1-12 hours

PRL-8-53 is a nootropic substituted phenethylamine that has been shown to act as a hypermnesic drug in humans; it was first synthesized by medical chemistry professor Nikolaus Hansl at Creighton University in the 1970s as part of his work on amino ethyl meta benzoic acid esters.

## Mechanism of action

The exact mechanism of action of PRL-8-53 remains unknown. Doses up to 200 mg/kg are not observed to have stimulant properties, and a dosage of 20 mg/kg does not potentiate the effects of dextroamphetamine in rats. It displays possible cholinergic properties, and potentiates dopamine while partially inhibiting serotonin. PRL-8-53 reverses the catatonic and ptotic effects of reserpine.

## Toxicity

PRL-8-53 is relatively non-toxic, with an oral LD50 in mice of 860 mg/kg, giving the drug a high therapeutic index. Doses above 8 mg/kg have brief hypotensive effects in canines. High doses depress motor activity in the rat and mouse, with the ED50 for a 50% reduction in motor activity of mice at 160 mg/kg. PRL-8-53 displays spasmolytic effects.

## Reasons for discontinuation

PRL-8-53's development was not pursued further, despite not exhibiting side effects in human or animal trials that would warrant discontinuation. Termination of further research may have been due to factors including the retirement of Dr. Nikolaus Hansl and a lawsuit filed between Hansl and Creighton University in 1985.

### Hansl v. Creighton University

On July 1, 1985 Dr. Nikolaus Hansl entered into a settlement agreement with Creighton University. The terms of the agreement guaranteed Dr. Hansl  access to his laboratory facilities and office space at the university for a period of 2 years. Upon returning from a 4-month absence. Hansl found that the refrigerator he had used to store various experimental compounds had been unplugged, purportedly rendering the compounds unusable.

### Patent

Dr. Hansl's patent for the synthesis of PRL-8-53 has expired.
