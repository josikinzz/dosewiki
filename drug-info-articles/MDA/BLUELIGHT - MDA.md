MDA is stronger than MDMA. you get sightly higher from the same amount on MDA than on MDMA


MDA lasts longer than MDMA 6-7 hour experiences are common.


MDA is slightly more euphoric than MDMA


There is far less empathy with MDA than MDMA. you just don't feel the love/connection vibe as much with MDA or at all. I explain it as "I'm on MDA and I love myself" and "I'm on MDMA and we all love each other"


MDA is more visual throughout and much more visual on the come down than MDMA.


The differences are subtle (besides the lack of empathy..it is really noticible) unless you know what to look for you would miss them.

^What he said plus...


I find the come up of MDA very rough compared to MDMA, it makes you feel sick but once you get over that it's awesome. It's very visual and I kind of like it more than MDMA.

MDA can be quite intense. Be prepared for a good long roll, plus hours of comedown with possible visual hallucinations. The higher the dose, the more intense the roll and the harder the trip at the end. I would say to never go over 180mg... 180 would probably be enough to make most people sick (dependong on ur body weight etc). I find it much more difficult to sleep afterward compared to MDMA due to the psychedelic effects.

Great summary. I prefer MDA to MDMA, but MDMA is still better.... if that makes sense at all lol. MDMA is a lot more euphoric and loved up, while with MDA you really seem to get some "self love", or amazingly beautiful introspection on ways to improve your life.


TBH, they are best combined :D

I mostly agree with the first reply with the exception that I find MDA a lot more heart centred than MDMA.

MDMA gives a much better feeling of connection/emphaty... MDA gives a better more intense high/euphoria and is more self centered. That's all there is to say. 


MDMA = "love" drug 

MDA = party drug


Done MDA 2 times and for a party/rave setting, I prefer it compared to MDMA. MDA I actually party/get into the music (well at least, after I manage to get out of the floory state of mind), on MDMA I just want to socialize with everyone, get hugs and make bonds. MDA gives me a big boost in my sexdrive, complete opposite of MDMA.

I recently tried some MDA for the first time, supposed to be very potent..


Started with 110mg, the come up was insanely strong and quick. The comeup lasted a long time. I was peaking for longer than on MDMA, it was like it never stopped peaking..

The visuals were much stronger, I smoked about 1gram of some pretty  dank weed through the night to enhance the visuals. Patterns/faces in psychedelic art, stuff in the corner of your eye,

the tv screen picture being replaced with new images. I couldn't read for shit at the end of the trip, like on shrooms. I also felt tripped out like fuck, probably because I smoked way too much weed.


I redosed with 50mg after 5,5 hours as it felt as if I was coming down, I wouldnt reccomend it. That made the visuals alot stronger, and made it very hard to sleep later. It just wasnt worth it, for real. It was really trippy and stimulating. The come-down off the second dose sucked way more too. Felt like a total wreck. I slept really hard thanks to pot, slept for 12 hours.


You did not feel that immense godly LOVE like you do on MDMA, but you still open up totally and you feel like you can be totally honest with yourself and others.

The euphoria is strong, but I found MDMA to be have a better feel in my setting. I was at home with a friend just to chill out.


It was definetly a great experience though, you go deeply into your self, more than on MDMA, but less into others. There was less empathy.


It was pretty much like MDMA, just rougher, stronger and more psychedelic. And it lasted longer. Check it out for personal experiences, stay safe, be real.

Thge more I think about it, the more I think I have MDA right now....I never did MDMA or MDA by myself and chalked up the lack of empathy to the fact that there wasn't any one to share it with![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)


It passed the marquis but that will only show mdxx. might have to get a simons to see if I got MDA.


maybe its not the simons that I need. I can't even find how to test for MDA anymore. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

^ the Simons tests for MDA haha. It has no reaction to MDA or amphetamine and a blue reaction to MDMA/MDE and meth


I'd say a lack of empathy would be because you dosed 70mg though, lol. Try at least 100-120mg next time

yeah...I thought that was it. MDMA should show blue for simons, black for the others while MDA will show black for everything but no reaction to simons.

i am a straight guy, and I think MDA is perfect for rolling with your guy buddies, going to the club, or even home rolling with some good trance and glowstix. 


MDMA is better for rolling with girls around.


But Folley said it best, the combination of them both is really where it's at

please think of the harm reduction. this is a harm reduction website and poly drug use is frowned upon.


please dont do mdma more than four times a year but fuck it just poly drug use and you are on the way.

The first and only time I took MDA, I was completely floored at 105mg and my girlfriend got sick. This weekend we were thinking of trying some again w/ a dose of 95mg for me and 85mg for her. Think these dosages sound about right or will that be too low? This is the same MDA that we took the first time and I have tested it with my marquis and simons. We were also thinking of redosing with some methylone later on in the night but that is not a for sure thing yet.

I find MDA to be much more varying than MDMA, it can effect different people in wildly different ways. The first thing I have to ask is.. did you test this product?

Fantastic. Thank you.

What kind of doses are you talking about?

And yes now that I consider it, the mind state is very bare and not with the same empathogenic feeling. But every drug is different, so it's a bit unfair to compare it.

It is a bit lacking as an empathogen compared to MDMA, and a bit lacking as a psychedelic compared to LSD, but the fact that its both unlike any other drug is why I fell in love with it.

I too feel as though it would be great to combine with MDMA. Or also with maybe LSD. Or with marijuana to enhance all aspects. All four would be a fucking trip and a half. But then what is it on its own if you need to combine it to get what one considers 'full effect'? I guess by that its a shitty drug, but it is still something great on its own.

Those all sound great, but personally I prefer taking drugs at home. I didn't find any musical enhancement the one time I went to a concert on MDMA.

It would be helpful to say what chemicals are in each of those pills. If the MDA alone won't be enough then I would definitely take the MDMA with it.

IMO it's the *best* mixer drug out there. Yet still, if I could only take one substance for the rest of my life, it would likely be MDA just because it has such great all around effects. 


it's kind of an odd drug, but I'm in love with it. I find that anything over 250mg spread throughout the night is what gives me bad hangovers though, with MDMA I can get away with 300mg if I'm lucky


@SH, I find MDA to be best in small group environments. MDMA is probably better for dancing the night away, MDA tends to floor me the fuck out haha

Thinking about taking some MDA at a show this coming Friday. Last week I took 4-FA (Wednesday night) as well as 25B-NBOMe (Friday). Should I expect cross-tolerance? Suggested dose?

I love mda! Had an amazing trip at edc vegas last year and done a couple times with my girl at home.

My doses have ranged from 100-150mgs and its always a wild night.

I often have lingering stimulation from mda well into 10-12 hour mark.

And of courses I tested it with a kit before ingesting.


As far as the trip its hard to explain.

I get massively stimulated on the come up and floored at the same time its Sometimes overwhelming. Lacks the empathy of a good does of mdma but is great for chillin and talking. Great to combine with whippets cigarettes and marijuana.

Once when I was kissimg my girl while trippin it totally felt like I had sunglasses on and as I mentioned it to my lady she said the same thing. Lol

You get small visual distortions and light set ups are awesome. Turns into a real brain fuck for me when I come down. Makes its so I can't sleep either.


Still one of my favorite doc. Would love to mix it with some lsd mdma 2CB or ketamine.

There might be some minor cross-tolerance from the 4-FA but not much. I personally find 100mg with two 50mg boosters later on to be perfect for me. Too much higher and I don't get much more of a high but a significantly worse crash. I'm more sensitive to MDA than I am to MDMA. I usually would bomb 150mg of MDMA to start with and use 60-80mg boosters.


I greatly prefer MDA to MDMA. It feels a lot more "real" than MDMA does and the psychedelic edge is there along with visuals at the peak and the comedown and it lasts longer than MDMA as well. Its a great time, just be sure to take it easy because it is a beast if you abuse it.

^ Two boosters?


Not shooting you down but don't you physically feel your brain being almost on fire as it tries to process all of it? 


Call me tin-foil-hat-man but anything over 200mg MDA/MDMA/etc I can actually feel my whole body being overworked and my brain pretty much dissolving as the euphoria rises, and the next day especially MDA, for me the next day IS HORRIFYING. None of this Tuesday business in that scenario.


I like how you think it is more real though, I get what you mean I think the same. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Well 100mg + 50 + 50 is 200 so we are pretty much in agreeance about 200 being the threshold before the immediate cliff at 201 LOL


Most of the time, I only used one booster. MDA has a good 6 hour peak for me (usually peaks once and then tapers a bit before having a second peak about 3/4 the intensity of the first one in my experience) and it keeps me up for many hours after I come down because I'm staring at the half-delirious hallucinations along with being residually stimulated.


That's why I posted the dosage that I usually use for MDMA though. A lot of people think that 150mg is a lot of MDMA and to me, its just not. 


That said, its been about 2 years since I've had either MDMA or MDA so 150mg or 100mg of either, respectively, would have me absolutely obliterated I'm sure.


I should also note that for all but the first few months of my rolling career, I have been prescribed benzos daily which I've heard both sides of the argument on whether or not benzos blunt a roll when you have a daily tolerance to them so take that into account when viewing my usage.

Modeling career LMAO!


As for the combination... I really don't know. I can tell you that I have actually rolled HARDER than my first few times while on benzos but there was also a HUGE difference in quality as well. My first pill was a pink cupid - MDA/caff/meth - this one specifically since my buddy sent it in -> [http://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=1259](http://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=1259)


As you can see 20 caff, 10 MDA, 1 meth. I thought it had more MDA than that but in actuality, that probably explains why I needed two of them to finally start rolling the first time although my later uses I only ever needed one pill of these. Sensitization? *shrug*


All that CO really had when I started rolling were MDE/pseudoephedrine/MDA/MDMA/Caff at best: [http://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=1349](http://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=1349) (those airplanes were fucking bomb to be honest, the MDE:MDA:MDMA ratio was perfect but the comedown required copious amounts of alcohol if you wanted any sleep)


I've had much better pills and at the end I was getting moon rocks. Its really hard to draw a conclusion.


I can tell you that taking a Xanax while rolling always removed my anxiety without killing a roll that was already going on. Same with Klonopin and Valium although the effect on anxiety wasn't as profound.

Good lord that is a lot of caffeine in a pill! 


One real gem Australia miraculously had this year contained 1 part caffeine even then I thought WTF caffeine, the tests for it were coming up real strong MDA so I was happy with 9/10 MDA


[http://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=2780](http://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=2780)


Those Airplanes look freakin' *sweet.*


All I can imagine is someone sitting on a couch constantly moving their upper body in a helicopter 360 degree motion like just swaying around while the MDA & MDMA *slightly* keep the user's eyes barely open in between wiggles with a little smile on their face.


Klonopin didn't dull it as much as Xanax? Not thinking of dosages here but is it wrong to be thinking "that should not happen at all"?


Apologies for the possible hijack errybody hahahahahhaha its relevant

That's hilarious! Actually what they did to me is make me writhe around in ecstasy complete with extremely loud moaning that made people feel awkward and extremely jealous at the same time haha.


Caffeine is probably the most common pill cutting agent for pills here. We've had some really nasty pills come through back in my day and now they are all piperazine combinations of garbage. I think part of it has to do with how far we are from the ports of entry on the coast. Pills generally were cleaner the closer you were to the west or south east coastlines.

Well Klonopin doesn't have a rush to it and operates more on a steady state plasma level than Xanax does so it kind of makes sense.


It could also be that MDA just isn't susceptible to benzos. I got ahold of a small amount of pure MDA back in 2010 and I took too much and tried to kick it down with Valium and failed miserably. I wouldn't say that it made me higher but it didn't lower the high either. Alcohol did though just like it does with MDMA.

The sunglasses is a very common MDA visual. It can also sometimes happen with very large MDMA doses. I was once at a small house party and we had about 20 people seeing the glasses. It's one of the most bizarre and fascinating effects of all drugs to me. It's easy enough to mentally process color saturation, morphing and patterning as an effect but the glasses just blows my mind. The only thing that comes close is DiPT auditory disturbances. I would love to hear folks theories on what causes this very unique hallucination.

Glasses and tattoos are what I noticed the most on MDA. Very strange indeed. Nobody even told me about them before I started seeing them either.


MDA and MDMA visuals are odd anyway. They are completely unlike other phenethylamine visuals (I have no experience with non-MDO phenethylamines like DOI, DOC, etc). My buddy called it "Nicktendoland" - I kind of agree with him. I've watched cartoons on the wall, played Tetris on the windshield, observed Ms Pacman smack Pacman out of the sky with a baseball bat while on MDA and camping, and my first time rolling I observed candy blocks of rainbow colors - complete with letters on them - running on my blanket like a train. 


Those are just off the top of my head. I've seen some really intense stuff. The tattoos were the most intricate visuals I've ever had on MDA by far though.


Crazy awesome stuff.

Yeah 3 hours. Why?


MDA takes a good 45 minutes to an hour to peak for me so dropping a booster at the 3 hour mark it starts kicking in at 3:45 to 4 or so which is around the point that the peak from the first dose would be ending its first wave.

^ The sooner you take the booster the more effective it will be, after the first hour that major flood of serotonin causes a HUGE amount of tolerance. Any additional doses after that will be much, much less effective and the side effects will become more and more pronounced the longer you wait. 


MDA lasts a good 5-6 hours already, with a single redose around the first hour mark it can easily last 7-8. I see no real reason to dose so late, it seems to me like you'd just be prolonging the comedown instead of actually intensifying the peak. With MDMA or methylone, I might understand... but with MDA I just don't get that.

Meh. All that depends on circumstances to some degree. Individual preference and differences in personal nuerochemistry can play a roll. /pun intended.

I have done it this way for ages. I find that it greatly extends the duration of the peak if I time it right and for me, the 3 hour mark is perfect. It is almost unnoticeable that I redosed yet I end up with an 8 hour peak. 


Honestly, redosing isn't really necessary with MDA unless you're partying and then going to the after party and can afford to be fried for days. One dose is generally enough. As you pointed out, MDA is quite long-lived. I find redosing on MDMA to be mostly worthless after the first dose unless it is within an hour of my first drop so...

(cont) ... I think that ^ is probably applying in my case.


Although I can tell you that I have friends who taught me this dosing method (although theirs was 2 hours in, I tweaked it for my preference and found 3 hours to be my personal sweet spot). I don't know anyone who redoses so quickly on MDA unless they didn't take enough to begin with.


I have a lot more experience with MDA than MDMA just due to the pills that were going around when I was rolling every weekend so I figured out a routine and stuck to it. I was actually disappointed when I finally got MDMA the first few times.

^ Right, lol? It's honestly a bit too much but it all just comes on so smoothly that you can't help but be amazed. I certainly wouldn't do that at a rave though, but at a house party it's just yyeeeeessssssss for hours on end.


I don't doubt your method works very well, MK777... I guess I just don't consider that to be a booster haha (more of an extender ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) ). For me dosing like that only lengthens the high, doesn't really make it more intense. With your method the peaks would be one after another.. with mine they would overlap significantly, obviously causing you to look something of a mess while you rub your face on the floor. Neither way is wrong of course, it's all personal preference. 


MDA can have some** harsh** comedowns though, I find that the severity is directly tied to how much you dose and when you redose.

The gradient made the night much more memorable and tolerable, definitely recommend for first timers/people who can't handle the full on effect but yeah house party for suuuure :D


3 hour extenders on MDA would be shocking the next day I can't imagine my poor brain going through that 8( Have they been tolerable for you MK?

Much more than bombing when I started to come up on the peak. Its one of the reasons that I preferred to do it like that. I got suicidal whenever I took it too early. Like EXTREMELY suicidal crashes. My first time I was actually picturing in my head all the ways I could kill myself. None of my friends bothered to warn me about the crash. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

Was it more the unexpected drop from immediately consuming the whole amount? 


As in a 200mg full euphoria rush then finding the comedown unbearable (naturally, like no shit who doesn't find it not great) is that why you need the boost extenders that delayed? Sorry to hear you were thinking some twisted stuff.

I dunno. I found doing it the way that Folley recommended to be even harsher than just doing a straight up double drop to begin with.


Either way MDA has a murderous crash when you overdo it but I found the timing of any redosing to be very important in how severe and how long it lasted. My 3 hour spacing lead to a prolonged but less-intense crash. I would drop on Saturday night, the crash would start in on Monday morning and it would remain at a low to mid level until Wednesday night. If I dosed and then dropped another dose when I hit the first peak, I crashed on Sunday and was suicidal on Monday afternoon but mostly recovered Tuesday night.


One huge difference though with the recovery. I was FAR more likely to suffer brain zaps from a double-drop or redosing at the start of the peak. I hate brain zaps more than any other comedown effect so maybe that's why I decided after getting shocked so much to stop dropping so much so early ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

I gotta get me some MDA! I've only ever had the chance to try it mixed in with MDMA and the MDA dose was low, 80mg MDMA to 20mg MDA.


Can anyone comment on the music enhancement being better, worse or equal compared to MDMA?


Music enhancement is the first thing I look from any substance.

Since there is so much scarce information about MDA, let me tell you about the peak my second time taking it.


I was at a party in Denver... Dropped a pink cupid (I believe I posted links earlier in this thread... they were dirty bastards Caff, MDA, meth), was feeling good, decided to drop another one...


Most of this was and still is a blur, I got a lot of it from third party explanations but I remember the music experience perfectly. Like it was happening right now it is so vivid.


One of my favorite local DJs hit the decks and I happened to start dancing. I love hard trance and he was throwing the hard dance down like you wouldn't believe. I hit the dance floor and just started moving with the music. Next thing I know, I feel electricity shooting through my body and I start seeing music notes flying out of the DJ booth and into me. As each music note hit me, I felt a physical sensation like I was being blasted with infinite waves of energy and I remember that everything around me disappeared. All that existed in that universe. In that time. On that plane. Was my soul, the DJ, and the music. I continued to progressively get more and more fucked up. This whole time, people were dumping water bottles on me to keep me from collapsing. I was completely in the zone and non-responsive to anyone around me.


When his set ended and the next DJ killed the music and restarted it, I snapped out of it and spent the night answering questions about what the hell possessed me because nobody had ever seen me dance hard and even more to the point, nobody had ever seen me dance well. I always was an out of place awkward white boy on the dance floor. That night changed me in so many ways. The rest of the roll was spent breaking down social barriers. I was pretty much a total reclusive and distrusting person (for good reason but I digress) but that night, I was hugging and kissing everyone (male, female, didn't really give a shit), I made a ton of friends that night (most of them I still talked to after I came down too - something that is unique to MDA with me. MDMA relationships are pretty much over with a few exceptions when I come down) and here's the best part... I had to work at 7AM... So I was eating half a pill every few hours to keep my energy at work up - had one of my best sales days I ever had at that job. LMAO


The crash was BRUTAL though. When I got home, mind you I had been eating pills since 9PM the night before and it was now 4 in the afternoon, I had a few beers until I passed out. I don't remember much of the next two days but my friends ended up over at my place taking care of me, I know that much. 


Anyway... MDA has a magic with music that few other drugs can touch.


Sorry that was so scattered. You have to remember this happened all the way back in 2004.

Last time I did mda I started with 125mgs and then like 40mgs nasal around 3-3.5 hours in and found it increased the intensity not by a ton but definitely noticeable as well as the duration. Also mixed some racemic K and dmt with it. Was still feeling some mild effects 11-12 hours after my first dose. The time before that I did 100mgs oral+55mg oral,25mg nasal both 2 hours in and another small nasal dose around 30mg later on with lots of S-isomer K throughout the  night. The comedown for both was very smooth and I had a nice after glow the next day. I can't say the same for the come-up on my last roll though; I got extremely sick and vomited an hour in which has never happened to me on mdxx before even on very massive doses I stupidly took when I was younger. Thankfully by the 2 hour mark I was fine.


It's kinda weird that I never really got any bad depression when coming down or the next day but the same can't be said for the physical effects.


Sucks I only have 65mgs of mda left but if I plug it I know I'll get something worthwhile out of it. At first I was thinking of mixing it with the mdma pressie I have been saving but while it's an amazing combo Iv'e already done it multiple times and know what it will feel like. I think I might mix some 2c-b with it instead. Planning to plug the mda first see how that dose effects me since I've never plugged it before and then plug a low dose of 2c-b once it peaks. Of coarse I'll be adding lots of k and maybe a bit of dmt. Not planning to do it anytime soon though.

Bump, would like some more input on this poll...


if the results lean heavily towards people saying it's more energetic, I might give it a shot at a "massive" rave on New Years but being floored there would be a massive problem (pun intended ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Folley, its definitely stimulating. MDA actually has a speedy edge to it unlike MDMA which can be almost sedating.

MDA is better for dancing because of the long-lasting stimulation while MDMA is better for house parties because you just want to lie around.


I can't sit still on MDA even if I'm so fucked up that I can't focus my eyes.

^... WAT?!?!


I find the *-exact-* opposite to be true. I've taken pills tested on ecstasydata to be pure MDA and was completely floored, literally rubbing my body into a massage chair for an hour ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Okay maybe I should put it this way.


REASONABLE doses of MDA I can't sit still.


I should be a lot more specific.


MDA is stimulating in that you won't come down from an MDA pill and go to sleep. You're likely going to be up for a number of hours afterwards and its pretty much impossible to sleep while you're intoxicated and you're less likely to get tired at an event.


MDMA is much less physically stimulating. I can sleep after the peak is over and if I don't redose, I'm ready to go home after 3 to 4 hours which makes partying all night difficult.


Both of them can leave you unable to function. I'd even go on a limb and say that MDA may actually be easier to get completely floored on than MDMA at an equivalent dose (ie., 200mg of MDMA most can still keep their wits about them while 200mg of MDA its damn near impossible to even talk) **(note that I do not advocate such high doses, I am just making an example here)**, and that unlike MDMA, MDA doesn't really seem to have a ceiling which can be disastrous in the wrong situation.


Technically though, MDA is physically stimulating while MDMA tends to a lot more neutral with physical stimulation. MDA will bump my resting by 20-30BPM while MDMA is more like 10-15 and sometimes doesn't raise it at all.

I took a pretty light one compared to what I normally take though.. It was a single ~100mg pill followed by half an hour or two later.


I could understand how MDA would keep you up and partying longer but it seems for me at least the peak is much more "mongy" and is more likely to leave me floored

I guess mongy is a way to put it. That's kind of what I meant by stoning.


Its hard to characterize stimulation with regards to MDMA and MDA though because they are both stimulants that can feel quite different from any other stimulants. 


I agree that its pretty easy to get floored on MDA but its also more potent than MDMA in my experience, I was just throwing out that it has a steep dose/response curve compared to MDMA. You would never catch me taking 200mg of MDA... Ai yi yi!

From what I've read unlike MDMA which is pretty much not stimulating at all, MDA can vary sometimes it will have your floored with jelly legs or up and running around like a madman...

I recently got a hold of some crystal mda over the summer


Well having a couple rigs left over from being a heroin addict I decided to iv some

80mg iv was pretty intense, especially it being about an hour or so after the initial 100mg bombed orally and a bump of k


Santana live from the fillmore never sounded so good

In no way do I suggest anyone iv mda or mdma with out some serious bl knowledge and experience

I'm wondering what kind of doses people use when combining the two. If 120mg is an average dose of MDMA, what would it be for a combination? 60/60?

MDA is a much deeper, mental, psychedelic drug, that still has a HUGE pronounced roll. Honestly, I prefer it hands down to MDMA. If you had two equal doses, of 99% pure tested MDMA vs MDA, and could study the effect of each separately (theoretically), youd find MDA to be much more flooring. 


However, nowadays.... while a lot of "molly" isnt MDMA or MDA at all... 


    through legit sources of mine and acquaintances , Ive been coming across a lot more MDMA/MDA mix on the street. Seems to be the damn good sweet spot. Cant go wrong I personally find it the PERFECT mix for going out for a fun night. Whereas I  find MDA perfect for kicking it inside with the friends, playing games and talking about old times.  Throw in 10-15mg of amphetamine and you are set for body-gasms.

I love MDA but I find it to be a bit lacking on it's own, just a tad bit of MDMA (~50mg) will turn that all around into an intensely blissful roll. There's already a thread discussion the combo though, so we should try not to stray from the actual question at hand here.

The difference is... MDA is better lol. And both is the best.

I get plenty of empathy om MDA just not quite as much as MDMA lol.

**MDMA vs MDA**


What do you like more and why? mda or mdma? I personally think a mixture of 25% mda and 75% mdma is the best roll. Has anyone tried candyflips with both and can give a comparison? I think I need to try a candyflip with just mda next time. 


Is it safe to take syrian rue or b. caapi while candyflipping btw? Id assume not since theyre maoi's but if you could take them with a candyflip, thatd be a pretty amazing trip![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).

I moved this into the main MDMA & MDA comparison thread.


I like 25% MDA to 75% MDMA myself. It is just enough MDA to extend the duration of the MDMA and add a psychedelic kick without the MDA overpowering the MDMA entirely.


It is not safe to take any MAOI with MDMA, MDA, or other serotonin releasing agents. MAOIs + serotonin release = serotonin syndrome and death. Its a very bad idea.

MDA is more neurotoxic than MDMA, so longer breaks are required between doses.

Is MDA really worth the higher neurotoxic profile and worse comedown compared to MDMA? I admit i'm a bit curious but feel like there isn't enough difference to justify the aforementioned drawbacks.

In my opinion it is. I love MDA. Some of my best rolls that I've ever had were from MDA... 


See: [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/685771-MEGA-MDA-Discussion?p=11998040&viewfull=1#post11998040](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/685771-MEGA-MDA-Discussion?p=11998040&viewfull=1#post11998040)


The main toxicity complaint with MDA is that its a potent stimulant and it has caused cardiac failure. It has a bodyload that MDMA doesn't have which is likely in part due to its 5-HT2a effects.


That's not to say that MDA doesn't have a devastating crash. Its more potent than MDMA AND it lasts longer. It naturally is much more taxing. With that said, its a great experience, it just shouldn't be used that often (probably best to keep it for extremely special occasions which shouldn't be difficult as its not terribly common these days).


It is still less likely to cause cardiac issues than amphetamine or meth though. If you have heart problems, you should avoid it just like any other stimulant. I'd say that my pulse runs around 100-120 on a high dose of MDA.

I find that MDA becomes a lot more usable if combined with angiontensin receptor II antagonists such as Telmisartan or angiotensinogen converting enzyme inhibitors such as Lisinoprinil. Helps ease the cardiovascular strain. Also there's a study showing that PDE5 inhibitors i.e. viagra and cialis greatly reduce empathogen neurotoxicity.

Wouldn't combining MDA with these drugs add to its overall toxicity though?


I know that people have died from mixing Viagra and MDXX drugs. I assume the same would go for Cialis. And all angiotensin II receptor antagonists can cause significant tachycardia on their own so wouldn't they be contraindicated with a strong stimulant like MDA as well?

Here's my recent experience with MDA. I just wanted to share it.


I tried the MDMA/MDA combo this past weekend at a festival and I must say that I'm not a big fan of MDA. Perhaps I took a little too much MDA, but I felt very little empathy which is my favourite part of rolling. I also found that 'psychedelic speed' is a very accurate name for MDA in my experience. I'm sensitive to psychedelics so I found this combination to be very psychedelic. I had real hallucinations unlike the pseudo hallucinations you get from typical psychedelics. My headspace also felt 'psychedelic' but in its own MDA sort of way.


What I didn't enjoy about MDA is the lack of empathy, its relatively harsh comeup in comparison to MDMA, its long lasting speedy edge, and body destroying comedown. The intensity of the comeup was almost on par with a candyflip and I had to leave the crowd of people I was in during that time, though I am sensitive. I also had issues with sleeping and when I fell asleep it wasn't a very good sleep. I have no issues with sleep on MDMA. The emotional aspects of the comedown was pretty much the same as MDMA, but my body felt straight fucked for a day. I don't see myself doing MDA again.

Has anybody ever got very vivid realistic mda like hallucinations the day after rolling? Earlier this year/late last year the night after doing around 230mgs of some mda and around a gram of ketamine I was just smoking a bowl and doing some bumps of K before bed. I decided to go sit up in my bed and watch this zelda cartoon for a bit before crashing out. After a while I realized "hey this particular zelda cartoon doesn't exist" and my tv went black. Next thing I know I am standing in my kitchen facing my laundry room which leads to my back door. My mom was standing in the laundry room facing my back door which was open. Outside there was a bulky black dude in a tank top holding an ax. I go to touch my mom's back and my hand goes right through her and all my surroundings fade away and I am sitting back up in my bed again which I never left. 

This was over 24 hours after dosing the mda and while I have gotten realistic hallucinations from ketamine before but never at such low doses especially considering how high my K tolerance was back then. I had bad hppd for a bit when I was allot younger but it was always just patterns never vivid hallucinations.

I voted other because of this:


When i tried MDA, it was taken in MDMA doses because that's what i believed it to be at the time. It was the typical one dose + half of it later on. 


To compare the two,


MDMA takes me 1 hour to "feel something" and then i actually peak at the 1:30 hour mark. That's when i usually redose and the remaining duration ends at about the 3:30 hour mark. Of course afterwards some unwanted side effects remain, depending on how large the doses were, but the high never lasts longer no matter how large the dose is. 


When i took MDA, i started to "feel something" at the 0:20 mark. This really surprised me because i thought it was MDMA. However, i thought nothing of it because it was just minor dizziness and sedation. Plus i was hyped up for the rave. Come 0:40 it felt like i was drunk off alcohol, a controllable drunk (3-4 shots deep maybe). Let me clarify i didn't drink alcohol or any other drug besides MDA that night. A few songs later from the point i checked the time, the hallucinations began. My male friend looked like he was wearing black eyeliner.....all the way to his nose lOl. Now in my drugged up state, i didn't ask about it and the night went on. I noticed if i stared too long at his nose trying to decipher why the fuck he did that, it looked like Obito's kamui (Naruto reference) was centred on where i was looking at. This was solved by just looking somewhere else. 


Phone alarmed me that it was the 1:30 mark so i went ahead and redosed. Stupid stupid me. Well you can't blame me cause these emphathogens make you easily persuaded. In this case i was persuaded by phone lOl . At this point, i lost track of time. Black outs were frequent. I remember asking my friend something and then find myself instantly teleported to the dance floor, bent over standing up and hugging myself (this was freaky). I straightend back up and thought WTF and began the quest of looking for my friends. I don't remember accomplishing that quest, just that they appeared next to me eventually so they probably found me being a retard. 


The flashing lights in the rave were nightmarish. I told my friend i was having a terrible time( the only words i could make out at the time). He probably misunderstood and pointed towards the dj where all the flashing lights were. Once i looked, i was not able to look away. It was scary. By the time the lights died down to match the calm part of a song, i was able to shake out of it. Judging by the fact my friend was no longer beside me, it must have been a while.


I somehow found my friends again decided to just chill and lean over on a hand railing. My friends were tripping as well but they only took one so they were probably not going through what i was. Upon looking at them again, their face began to morph into the face of someone else that i know that held a resemblance to them. In my drugged up mind i thought it was actually them so i said "woah! what are YOU doing here?" to each of them throughout the night. i guess they were fucked up too because they didn't respond and just went into trances like i did. 


The place closed at the 4:00 hour mark and i was STILL tripping. Security kept lightly nudging everyone towards the exit so thats probably the only reason we were able to get outside. Otherwise, we'd be just standing there bobbing up and down to music that was no long playing.


One of us was able to call for a taxi and we went home. LONGEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE. The trance like state slowly faded but i was still going into trances at home (5:00 hour mark). I find myself bobbing up and down to music when its dead quiet. Looking in the mirror i still saw minor visual distortions. For some reason, as i went into a trance state after drinking some water, the way the lights reflected off the curtain made me think it was a person. I thought i was still on the dance floor and that was just a person beside me. After 10 seconds i snapped out of it and decided to just goto bed.


I somehow managed to fall asleep but woke up after only just 4 hours due to excessive teeth grinding in my sleep. 


So take from it what you will, but MDA seems to be a mixed feeling of being drunk, visual hallucinations, and some MDMA, all with the usual MDMA side effects .

MDA is indeed more stimulating than MDMA.  Ive taken very stupid high amounts before and it becomes very hallucnogenic at high doses, it also makes me want to vomit more than mdma if i start going above 200 mgs.


I get many more physical sensations from it.  In a nightclub enviroment on a dose upto about 200mgs colours seem stronger, brighter, and more intense.  Also sense of touch, smell and sound is much more pronounced, much more so for me than MDMA.


I personally prefer it but it is obvious it feels great at the time but also feels like it is potentially doing you more harm than MDMA also to me.

idk if I had MDA or MDMA when I rolled, but I did not get the whole empathy spilling guts feeling, I felt more self confident about myself, less shy, and aggressive in a way where I didn't act on it, body sensations were great, taking a piss felt like an orgasm while I was urinating and real tingly...ill b ehappy to have any form MDxx as my luck sucks getting other shit

I find this drug wonderful in a different way than mdma, regardless of the similarities.


I just had it after not touching mdma for almost 2 months. fuckin great


i find this is more sedating than mdma however.

I have some that's been sitting around for a year now waiting to be tried.


The first question I have is whether to try it in an MDMA/MDA combo first or just try MDA alone. Do you guys think it would be better to experience MDA alone before attempting the combo? If I did attempt the combo, what ratio of MDMA:MDA do you guys feels optimum? Do different ratios give different experiences and could anyone elaborate on that?


Second question I have is dose. The MDA I have I acquired from an online vendor, and seems to me to be very, very pure. It's the whitest/clearest powder/crystal I have ever seen personally (it's mostly crushed up from the way it was sent). I sent it to a lab and they didn't do purity analysis but they didn't find any active constituents other than MDA in there, and a certain user on the forums for this particular online market said they had it sent for purity analysis and it came back as being over 95%. Many many different users on those forums have trie doses between 80-100mg and claimed it was pretty intense, lasted 8hrs and was somewhat of a 'trip', which conflicts with dosage info I read on BL and the rest of the web which usually says to only dose slightly less or the same as MDMA, with people saying they do 100-200mg on here where people on this market are claiming more than 100mg would be too much and ridiculously intense. Obviously I don't wanna start off with this chemical at too high of an intensity as I hear it can be very overwhelming. Therefore I was thinking if I did go for MDA alone I would dose around 75mg, as I only weigh 63kg, does that sound about right?


Finally, how does the MDA 'world' / headspace and sensory space, differ from MDMA? Is it really as close to the experience classical psychedelics provide as some people make out online? Or is it still predominantly a 'roll' effect that's just a bit trippier

poll is interesting... i wonder if people that vote for MDA as stimulating are testing it to see if it is pure MDA.

MDA floors the fuck out of me and everybody i know. usually why most people prefer mdma ; the mda is just too raw for most people

I'm guessing similar stuff you'd use with MDMA. R-ALA, Quercetin, Grape Seed Extract, Vitamin C, Magnesium Glycinate, CoQ10, etc

Could you guys recommend me a dose for MDA?


- 1,80 m / 80kg

- Experience with Weed / MDMA (usual dose: ~ 120 + 80mg)

- definitely want a full-blown experience and those OEV's / CEV's but not too overwhelming


I thought about taking 100mg, good idea?

With MDA it is slightly more potent than MDMA, and so you would require less. I'd go for a 100mg starter and a 50mg redose at the 1 - 2 hour mark to increase duration and intensity of effects. MDA is definitely much more body load and drug like experience than MDMA, and probably more neurotoxic too. Getting some for this weekend, dropping about 200mg (130mg start, approx 70mg redose). Might add some MDMA to the mix, but would be slightly concerned that it would be too much MD in one session.

My first real empathogen was about 70mg of MDA, and it was pretty nice. Never felt anything like it before, just a bunch of good feels, and felt similar to an amphetamine with the urge to talk.

It's pretty interesting how consistent MDA experiences between individuals are. Especially as it's supposedly less predictable than MDMA (wouldn't be the first time I disagreed with pihkal). I find it very visual, but short of true hallucinations. Still very interesting and unique, never had a psychedelic cause visual snow and phosphenes like MDA. 


One thing I have noticed after a few years of semi consistent MDA use is BAD optical migraines. I abused on a weekly basis for about 2 months. I had too much confidence because I knew the purity and it was essentially reagent grade. Practically speaking, I doubt purity could be improved. 


That was 3 years ago and I have had constant optical migraines since. At least 4-5 a week. I'm fairly confident MDA played a role as 5HT depression apparently plays a significant role in cortical spreading depression. Triptans have helped with actual pain, but not visual issues. Interestingly, the visual aura very much like MDA visual effects. This stuff merits serious respect. I think dosing requires significantly more spacing than MDMA to be safe.

Mda i actually party/get into the music (well at least, after i manage to get out of the floory state of mind), on mdma i just want to socialize with everyone, get hugs and make bonds.

Goes perfect with MDMA; the best rolls I had in my life were on pills with both MDMA + MDA. It lasts much longer than MDMA IME and is much more visual. Certainly includes some euphoric psychedelia. 


I'm a big psychedelic fan, so MDA is right up my alley. As well as considering the best highs of my life were on MDA (and MDMA in combination)

I got a lot more than I expected from only 30mg of MDA. I was only expecting a slight mood lift, but I got pretty high; feelin' fine. Granted, the setting was also quite fun which helped, but I still think you don't necessarily need to dose so high (>100mg) with this one. With lower doses, you get less of those stimulating side effects and it feels more controlled.

I had a great feelings with this when combined with shrooms. Recommend to try it. I didnt have scale so i just snorted ~50mg lines every half hour until i reached desired efffects. Around 1.5hrs into experience i had pretty intense "rush" that lasted way longer than mdma id say about an hour. After this initial rush i felt it peaking and desided to eat some shrooms i had stored. around 2-3gs i dont have scale ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png). About half an hour into eating shrooms the mood shifted really hard. Bfore this i was just feeling extremely euphoric and little trippy, but when shrooms kicked in the euphoria was there but kinda took step back and i went on a massive trip. I remember when they was peaking and i closed my eyes i could see my room with all the colors you can imagine and walls moving all the time, also there were some crazy spirals floating around room. I could just stare at them morphing. But the headspace was intense. I dont know how to describe it but ill try. after the euphoria stepped back i felt this "shamanic presence" that i knew i was going to go deeeep. And i thought most complex things with massive internal hallucinations. I remember some of them but would be too hard to describe. It was like tripping with absolute clarity. Usually when you do psychedelics you just jump from one thing to next, but with this combo my thinking got really complex and deeeeep. The effects lasted about 2hours but it felt alot longer. i was still tripping hard after this but came down to lower level??? (does this make sense). And was still tripping for few hours after and after shrooms wore off i still felt the comedown on mda. Impossible to sleep etc. So i dosed some Clonazepam 4mgs. and this helped alot with the comedown and i fell asleep like 2 hours after. But the trip with this combo felt so insanely real and CLEAR. I really enjoyed it.

fwiw, i know its a few years late, but ive found that the best way to hack through the mda comedown is to take a bunch of kratom about 4-5 hours in, and when that hits, smoke a rack of good pot (hopefully a nice relaxing medical strain). 


it turns it into a smooth, relaxing ride into late sleep, while still holding onto the roll, and it turns it into another magical high altogether. 


even barring terrible comedowns, the combo is a serious winner amongst winners.
