**5,6-Methylenedioxy-2-aminoindane** (also known as **MDAI** ) is a lesser-known novel [entactogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) substance of the [aminoindane](/w/index.php?title=Aminoindane&action=edit&redlink=1) class. It acts as a putatively non-neurotoxic and highly selective [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) (SSRA) with neglible effects on [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) .

MDAI was developed by the American medicinal chemist and pharmacologist [David E. Nichols](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/David_E._Nichols) during the 1990s at Purdue University. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] in the 2010s, MDAI was marketed alongside novel [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) like [5-MAPB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MAPB) , [5-APB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-APB) , and [6-APB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/6-APB) as a legal, grey-market alternative to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) in the online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market. It is currently being investigated as a potential alternative to traditional entactogens in the treatment of mental health conditions like anxiety and depression. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement) , [anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) , [enhanced empathy and sociability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement) and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . It has been described as producing the non-stimulating effects of prototypical entactogens like [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) . It has been suggested that the lack of dopamine and norepinephrine activity limits its ability to produce overtly invigorating, prosocial or [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) effects but with the benefit of decreased neurotoxicity and side-effects. However, more research is required to validate these claims.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of MDAI, and it has a limited history of human use. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

MDAI, or 5,6-methylenedioxy-2-aminoindane, is a synthetic molecule of the [aminoindane](/w/index.php?title=Aminoindane&action=edit&redlink=1) class with structural similarity to [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamines) . It features the R 3 terminal carbon of the propane chain of amphetamine bound to the benzene ring. This creates an indane group, a bicyclic moeity containing a benzene ring fused to a pentane ring. MDAI contains an amino group NH 2 bound to R 2 of the indane ring. MDAI also contains two oxygen substitutions at R 5 and R 6 joined by a methylene bridge to form a methylenedioxy group.

MDAI is structurally related to [2-AI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-AI) , differing by a methylenedioxy ring.

## Pharmacology

MDAI has been shown to [inhibit the reuptake](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and has a selective affinity for the serotonin [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) . Studies have shown that the brains of animals treated with MDAI have greater extracellular concentrations of [monoamine neural transmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) , most significantly [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

For comparison, MDAI is similar in potency with releasing serotonin to [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) , but significantly less potent than [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . This is done by inhibiting the reuptake and reabsorption of the neurotransmitters after they have performed their function of transmitting a neural impulse, essentially allowing them to accumulate, be reused and cause [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) effects.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - The largest reported difference between MDAI and [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) is that MDAI primarily results in moderate sedation and can therefore discourage physical activities such as running, dancing or climbing.
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of MDAI can be described as a moderate to extreme euphoric, soft and warm tingling sensation that encompasses the entire body. It is capable of becoming overwhelmingly pleasurable at higher doses. This sensation maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)**
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Vibrating vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vibrating_vision)** - At high doses, a person's eyeballs may begin to spontaneously wiggle back and forth in a rapid motion, causing the vision to become blurry and temporarily out of focus. This is a condition known as [nystagmus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nystagmus) .
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** - Feelings of dry mouth and dehydration are a universal experience with MDAI. This effect is a product of an increased heart rate and an extreme motivation to engage in strenuous physical activities. While it is important to avoid becoming dehydrated (especially when out dancing in a hot environment) there have been a number of users suffering from [water intoxication](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Water_intoxication) through over-drinking, so it is advised that users simply sip at water and never over-drink.
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)** - Much like MDMA, higher doses of MDAI result in difficulty urinating. This is an effect that is completely temporary and harmless. It is most likely due to the promotion of the release of [anti-diuretic hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasopressin) (ADH), which is the mechanism responsible for this side effect within MDMA. Anti-diuretic hormone is responsible for regulating urination. Difficulty urinating can be lessened by simply relaxing, but can be significantly relieved by placing a hot flannel over the genitals to warm them up and encourage blood flow. Some have reported that simply listening to the sound of running water also helps (such as a tap/faucet).
- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)** ### Visual effects
 
- The visual effects of MDAI only occur at higher doses and are reported to be only subtly psychedelic in nature. These generally include: 
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of MDAI can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The general head space of MDAI is described by many as one of euphoria and feelings of love or empathy. It contains a number of typical [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) cognitive effects. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - Strong emotional euphoria and feelings of happiness are present within MDAI and are a direct result of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) release.
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This particular effect is not as pronounced, powerful and therapeutic as that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) . It is the most obvious and noticeable effect within any MDAI experience and dominates the head space.
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Mindfulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Enhancements](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)** ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: MDAI](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_MDAI.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

MDAI and other similar drugs have been widely used in scientific research as they are able to replicate many of the effects of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , but without causing the associated [neurotoxicity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity) . No tests have been performed on cardiovascular toxicity.

There is currently no scientific data on the lethal dose of MDAI in humans and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. Due to its action as a [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) , overdoses of this substance would likely result in [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

Although no formal studies have been conducted, MDAI can be considered somewhat habit-forming with a low potential for abuse and is unlikely to be capable of causing psychological dependence among most users. This is because unlike traditional stimulants, MDAI does not increase concentrations of [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) . If addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of MDAI develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption).

MDAI presents cross-tolerance with all [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) , meaning that after the consumption of MDAI all serotonergic [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with MDAI should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - MDAI may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - The neurotoxic effects of MDMA may be increased when combined with other stimulants.
- **[Cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine)** - This combination may increase strain on the heart to a dangerous degree.

#### Serotonin syndrome risk

Combinations with the following substances can cause dangerously high [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) levels. [Serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) requires immediate medical attention and can be fatal if left untreated.

- **MAOIs** - Such as [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , phenelzine, selegiline, and moclobemide.
- **Serotonin releasers** - Such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) , [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) and [αMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91MT) .
- **SSRIs** - Such as citalopram and sertraline
- **[SNRIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNRIs)** - Such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) and venlafaxine
