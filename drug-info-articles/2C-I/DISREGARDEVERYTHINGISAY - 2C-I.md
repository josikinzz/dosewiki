**2C-I** or **2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenethylamine** is a psychedelic phenethylamine of the 2C-x family. It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin. It was described in Shulgin’s 1991 book PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story. The drug is used recreationally for its psychedelic and entactogenic effects and is sometimes confused for the analog 25I-NBOMe. 2C-I is commonly sold in its hydrochloride salt form, which is a fluffy, sparkling, white powder, which can sometimes be pressed into tablet form. 2C-I has been explored as a potential stimulant nootropic in doses between 1-8mg.

In terms of its chemistry, 2C-I is a substituted phenethylamine with methoxy groups attached carbons R2 and R5 as well as an iodine molecule attached to carbon R4. It is thought to have efficacy at the 5-HT2A receptor as a partial agonist.

The 2C-I experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.**
**

**Physical effects:**

The physical effects of 2C-I can be broken down into five components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - The body high of 2C-I is manifested as one of the most proportionally intense in comparison to almost all of the classical psychedelics. The sensation itself can be described as an intense and slightly uncomfortable energetic pins and needles sensation that constantly encompasses a person’s entire body. It is usually felt over every square inch of the skin but occasionally manifests itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves. Alongside of this, many users commonly report that the body high can be particularly uncomfortable and sometimes accompanied by dysphoric aches and urges to shift the position of one’s body and prolonged tensing of unusual combinations of muscle groups.
- **Euphoria** - Feelings of frequent but unpredictable rushes of warm physical euphoria are extremely common and very pleasurable. These move from the top of the head downwards before envoloping ones whole body.
- **Stimulation** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, 2C-I is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is quite comparable to that of MDMA although encouraged instead of forced.
- **Increased bodily control**
- **Enhancement of touch**
- **Nausea** - Mild to extreme nausea is consistently reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes once the tripper has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **Loss of temperature regulation**
- **Head aches **- Some users report mild but uncomfortable head pressures which can occasionally intensify during the offset of the experience.

**Cognitive effects:**

The head space of 2C-I is described by many as one which is relatively normal in its thought processes even at moderate to high dosages. It is often said to lack insight when compared to that of 2C-E, 2C-B and LSD.
The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes:

- **Increased empathy, love and sociability** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as MDMA and 2C-B but still prove strong enough to provide long lasting therapeutic effects.
- **Time distortion**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Sexual arousal**
- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**
- **States of unity and interconnectedness**

**Visual effects:**

*Enhancements*

2C-I presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally includes:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colour**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

2C-I presents a full and complete array of possible visual distortions which generally includes:

- **Drifting** (*melting, flowing, breathing and morphing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as simplistic and bland in detail, slow and smooth but sometimes jittery in motion, static in appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.
- **Tracers**
- **Symmetrical texture repetition **- In comparison to other psychedelics such as LSD and 2C-E this particular effect is bland and simplistic.
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of LSD or 2C-B than that of 2C-E, psilocin, or ayahuasca although it is much more bland and less detailed. They can be comprehensively described as unstructured in their organization, algorithmic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, both soft and sharp in their edges as well as equally rounded and angular in their corners. They seem high in algorithmic visuals such as fractals and at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of Level 7A visual geometry over Level 7B.

*Hallucinatory states*

Like LSD, while 2C-I is capable of producing a full range of low and high level hallucinatory states, this is extremely rare and inconsistent at higher levels but common at lower and generally includes the following effects:

- **External hallucinations **- The experience of effects such as open eye transformations are common within 2C-I but not consistent.
- **Internal hallucinations** - Although 2C-I is technically capable producing of hallucinatory states in a fashion that is on par with psilocin or DMT in its vividness and intensity, in comparison, these effects are extremely rare and inconsistent. Whilst traditional psychedelics such as LSA, Ayahuasca and Mescaline will induce internal hallucinations near consistently at level 5 geometry and above, 2C-I hallucinations will not extend beyond imagery and higher dosages will for most will simply go straight into Level 7A visual geometry. This lack of consistently induced hallucinatory breakthroughs means that for most, 2C-I is simply not as deep of an experience as certain other psychedelics.

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of 2C-I are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- **Enhancements**
- **Distortions**
- **Hallucinations**

**Health effects, addiction potential and tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational 2C-I use does not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 2C-I is a research chemical with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried 2C-I within the psychedelic community suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

There is a short period of tolerance after 2C-I use. Using 2C-I two days in a row is likely to lead to a diminished experience the second day. However, this effect is nearly non-existent when spaced 5-7 days apart.

**Legal issues:**

- **European Union:** In December 2003, the European Council issued a binding order compelling all EU member states to ban 2C-I within three months.
- **Denmark:** It is a controlled substance.
- **Germany:** It is a controlled substance.
- **Greece:** It is a controlled substance.
- **Ireland:** The drug is a controlled substance.
- **Italy:** It is a controlled substance.
- **Netherlands:** It is a controlled substance.
- **Poland:** It is a controlled substance.
- **Sweden:** Sveriges riksdag added 2C-I to schedule I (“substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use”) as narcotics in Sweden as of March 16, 2004.
- **United Kingdom:** It is controlled as a Class A substance.
- **USA:** As of July 9, 2012, in the United States, 2C-I is a Schedule I substance under the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012, making possession, distribution and manufacture illegal.

**Conclusion:**

2C-I is a worthwhile experience but is not as deep as other drugs of the same family. It is a substance which works better for some than others. For example, while many find it to be extremely uncomfortable others find it perfect for recreational use in public and social environments.
