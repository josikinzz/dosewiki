# Benzydamine
*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB09084*

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as indazoles. These are compounds containing an indazole, which is structurally characterized by a pyrazole fused to a benzene.

### Background

Benzydamine (also known as Tantum Verde or Difflam), available as the hydrochloride salt, is a locally-acting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with local anaesthetic and analgesic properties. It is used topically for pain relief and anti-inflammatory treatment of the mouth, throat, or muscoskeletal system.
Although the indazole analogue benzydamine is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), it has various physicochemical properties and pharmacologic activities that are different from those of traditional aspirin-like NSAIDs but facilitate benzydamine's mechanism of action as an effective locally-acting NSAID with local anaesthetic and analgesic properties. Moreover, unlike aspirin-like NSAIDs which are acids or metabolised to acids, benzydamine is in fact a weak base.

### Indication

Available predominantly as a liquid mouthwash, oromucosal spray, or topical cream, benzydamine is most frequently employed as a locally acting analgesic and anti-inflammatory treatment for the relief of painful inflammatory conditions.
When formulated as a mouthwash or spray, benzydamine may be used to treat traumatic conditions like pharyngitis following tonsillectomy or the use of a naso-gastric tube, inflammatory conditions like pharyngitis, aphthous ulcers and oral ulceration due to radiation therapy, dentistry operations and procedures, or more general conditions like sore throat, sore tongue, sore gums, mouth ulcers, or discomfort caused by dentures.
6
When used as a topical cream, benzydamine may be employed to relieve symptoms associated with painful inflammatory conditions of the muscolo-skeletal system including acute inflammatory disorders such as myalgia and bursitis or traumatic conditions like sprains, strains, bruises, sore muscles, stiff joints, or even the after-effects of fractures.

### Pharmacodynamics

Benzydamine is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) designed to elicit local anesthetic and analgesic effects mainly for the mouth and throat. It specifically acts on the local mechanisms of inflammation such as pain, oedema, or granuloma. Typically applied topically, the drug demonstrates anti-inflammatory activity reducing oedema as well as exudate and granuloma formation. Moreover, benzydamine exhibits analgesic properties and local anaesthetic activity if pain is caused by an inflammatory condition. Benzydamine can be absorbed into the oral mucosa and intact skin. Once absorbed in the local area of pain or inflammation, benzydamine binds selectively to local inflamed tissues, usually allowing it to act with few adverse systemic effects. On average a period of 2 to 4 hours is necessary for the substance to reach peak plasma concentration.
5
Benzydamine can be synthesized with the reaction of the N-benzyl derivative from methyl anthranilate with nitrous acid to give N-nitoso derivative. This is next reduced by sodium thiosulfate to give transient hydrazine. This hydrazine can then undergo spontaneous internal hydrazide formation. Treating this resultant enolate with 3-chloro-1-dimethylamkino propane ultimately yields benzydamine.

### Absorption

Oral doses of benzydamine are well absorbed and plasma drug concentrations reach a peak fairly rapidly and then decline with a half-life of approximately 13 hours. When applied topically, although the local drug concentrations are relatively large, the systemic absorption of topically applied benzydamine is relatively low compared to oral doses. This low topical absorption contributes to a decreased potential for any systemic drug side-effects when benzydamine is administered in this way.

### Metabolism

Benzydamine is primarily metabolized by oxidation, dealkylation, and conjugation into hydroxy, dealkylated, and N-oxide metabolites

.
In general, however, when used at the recommended doses the levels at which benzydamine is absorbed or exposed into the body are usually not sufficient to produce systemic pharmacological effects [L

.

### Toxicity

A possible adverse reaction associated with the use of the mouthwash or oromucosal spray formulations of benzymadine is potential numbness and/or stinging in the mouth and/or throat
5
,
6
.
Some possible adverse reactions that tend to be associated more with topical cream formulations of benzymadine include increased sensitivity to sunlight, and localized itching, skin rash, redness, or swelling
7
.
The prescribing information for all formulations of benzymadine however, warn against the possibility of severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) associated with swelling of the throat and mouth, difficulty in swallowing, speaking, and breathing, or wheezing
5
,
6
,
7
.
As benzydamine is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), it is necessary to determine if a patient is allergic to NSAIDs before considering its use
5
,
6
,
7
.
Intoxication is expected as a consequence of accidental ingestion of large quantities of benzydamine (over 300 mg ingestion). Other symptoms associated with overdose of ingested benzydamine include gastrointestinal and central nervous system symptoms like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, oesophageal irritation, dizziness, hallucinations, agitation, anxiety, and irritability
6
.
The official prescribing information for benzydamine generally suggest that benzydamine mouthwashes and sprays should not be used in pregnancy
6
,
7
. Similarly, the official prescribing information for benzydamine also generally suggest that benzydamine mouthwashes and sprays should not be used during lactation unless considered essential by a physician
6
,
7
.
The prescribing information for topical cream formulations of benzydamine note that benzydamine cream should not be used in pregnancy or lactation unless considered necessary by the physician
5
.
Overall, non-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated toxicity, genotoxicity, cardiogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction
5
. Additionally, there is no evidence of teratogenic effects in animal studies

### Mechanism of action

Despite being categorized as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), benzydamine demonstrates various mechanisms of action that differ from those of traditional aspirin-like NSAIDs. In particular, benzydamine predominantly acts by inhibiting the synthesis of pro inflammatory cytokines like tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) without largely affecting other pro inflammatory cytokines (ie. such as IL-6 and IL-8) or anti-inflammatory cytokines (ie. like IL-10 or IL-1 receptor antagonist).
3
,
5
Moreover, benzydamine is largely a weak inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis as it has been shown to effectively inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase enzyme activity only at concentrations of 1mM or greater. Considering most contemporary usages of benzydamine are topical applications that are generally not well absorbed through the skin and/or non-specialized mucosae, benzydamine does not often achieve the kind of absorption or blood concentrations necessary to cause any extraneous distant systemic effects or COX inhibition, allowing it to localize its action.
3
,
5
Additionally, it is also hypothesized that benzydamine is capable of inhibiting the oxidative burst of neutrophils and membrane stabilization. These actions are exhibited by the substance’s ability to inhibit the release of granules from neutrophils and to stabilize lysosomes.
3
,
5
Furthermore, benzydamine is capable of a local anaesthetic effect that may be related to its capability for inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators like substance P and calcitonin gene related peptide from sensory nerve endings. Since substance P is capable of causing the release of histamine from mast cells, benzydamine’s prevention of substance P release further contributes to an anti-inflammatory effect.
3
,
5
Benzydamine also demonstrates a non-specific antibacterial activity against various bacterial strains that are resistant to broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline at concentrations of about 3 mmol/L. Combinatorial use of benzydamine and other antibiotics like tetracycline and chloramphenicol are also synergistic against antibiotic resistant strains of
Staphylococcus aureus
and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

### Volume of distribution

The volume of distribution of benzydamine is 10 L
1
,
3
.

### Protein binding

Benzydamine exhibits < 20% plasma protein binding after oral administration
6
,
3
.

### Route of elimination

The relatively high lipid solubility of the weak base benzydamine is thought to be associated with considerable passive resorption within the renal tubule, which suggests that only approximately 5% of benzydamine is excreted unchanged in the urine
1
. At the same time however, other studies have suggested that considerably larger amounts (50-65%) of the drug is excreted unchanged in urine
4
.
While several inactive oxidized metabolites of benzydamine are excreted in urine, the benzydamine N-oxide metabolite can remain in plasma and demonstrate a half-life that is longer than the parent benzydamine compound
1
.
Nevertheless, it is generally believed that excretion occurs mainly through urine and is mostly in the form of inactive metabolites or conjugation products

.

### Clearance

### General Function

Dual cyclooxygenase and peroxidase that plays an important role in the biosynthesis pathway of prostanoids, a class of C20 oxylipins mainly derived from arachidonate ((5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-eicosatetraenoate, AA, C20:4(n-6)), with a particular role in the inflammatory response. The cyclooxygenase activity oxygenates AA to the hydroperoxy endoperoxide prostaglandin G2 (PGG2), and the peroxidase activity reduces PGG2 to the hydroxy endoperoxide prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the precursor of all 2-series prostaglandins and thromboxanes. This complex transformation is initiated by abstraction of hydrogen at carbon 13 (with S-stereochemistry), followed by insertion of molecular O2 to form the endoperoxide bridge between carbon 9 and 11 that defines prostaglandins. The insertion of a second molecule of O2 (bis-oxygenase activity) yields a hydroperoxy group in PGG2 that is then reduced to PGH2 by two electrons (PubMed:7947975). Involved in the constitutive production of prostanoids in particular in the stomach and platelets. In gastric epithelial cells, it is a key step in the generation of prostaglandins, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which plays an important role in cytoprotection. In platelets, it is involved in the generation of thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which promotes platelet activation and aggregation, vasoconstriction and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (Probable). Can also use linoleate (LA, (9Z,12Z)-octadecadienoate, C18:2(n-6)) as substrate and produce hydroxyoctadecadienoates (HODEs) in a regio- and stereospecific manner, being (9R)-HODE ((9R)-hydroxy-(10E,12Z)-octadecadienoate) and (13S)-HODE ((13S)-hydroxy-(9Z,11E)-octadecadienoate) its major products (By similarity)
