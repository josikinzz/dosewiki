Arguably the most common synthetic cannabinoid, AB-FUBINACA was originally developed by Pfizer as an analgesic, but has since abandoned for medical use. It has since found a following in the RC community, however it's extremely high potency and inclusion in synthetic blends makes it dangerous, and it has killed in overdose. Exercise caution.
