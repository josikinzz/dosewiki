## Subjective Experience

Armodafinil is a widely available wakefulness promoting agent, and is sold under a
variety of trade names. I sampled it a couple of times, specifically on occasions on
which I was feeling drowsy and mentally tired.

A 150mg dose taken in the morning did the job, in that it fought off fatigue and
sleepiness. In this sense it did exactly what is claimed on the packet.

There was nothing particularly recreational about it: it was entirely functional.
Equally, there was nothing markedly uncomfortable either. I didn’t feel particularly
stimulated; just not tired.

I should add that it is probably wise to consume this early in the morning. On the
occasion on which I sampled it during the afternoon (2pm), I was unable to properly
sleep during the night. The following day I was even more tired and drowsy than I
had been at the onset of the experiment.
