*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proscaline*

Proscaline, also known as 4-propoxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine and scaline families related to mescaline. It is taken orally.

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved) and other publications, Alexander Shulgin reports that a dose of 30 to 60 mg orally produces effects lasting 8 to 12 hours. The onset was not described, but peak effects occurred after about 2 hours. A typical dose estimate is 45 mg. Doses as high as 80 mg have also been explored. The drug has approximately 6 or 7 times the potency of mescaline, which itself has a listed dose range of 200 to 400 mg.
The effects of proscaline have been reported to include insignificant closed-eye visuals, sharpening of the senses, hyperawareness, relaxation and feeling at ease, deep feelings of peace and contentment, euphoria, no enhanced clarity or deep realizations, feelings of uninhibited eroticism, pain relief, drowsiness, intoxication and feeling drunk, irritability, restlessness, tremors, insomnia, difficulty with dreams, long-lasting residual effects, and no next-day hangover.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Proscaline is a serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. Activation of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor is thought to be responsible for its psychedelic effects. The drug is much more potent as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor than as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A or 5-HT2B receptors.
It produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents.

## Chemistry

Proscaline, also known as 4-propoxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is a substituted phenethylamine and scaline (4-substituted 3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine) derivative related to mescaline (3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine). It is the 4-propoxy homologue of mescaline.

### Properties

Proscaline is much more lipophilic than mescaline or escaline (log P = 1.70, 0.78, and 1.11, respectively), which is expected to be more optimal and advantageous in terms of drug-like properties such as blood–brain barrier permeability.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of proscaline has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of proscaline include mescaline, escaline, isoproscaline, allylescaline, methallylescaline, cyclopropylmescaline, cycloproscaline, fluoroproscaline, and 3C-P, among others.

## History

Proscaline was first synthesized and studied by Otakar Leminger in 1972. The drug was later synthesized by Alexander Shulgin and further described in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved). It was encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe in 2013.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### United Kingdom

Proscaline is a Class A controlled substance in the United Kingdom.

#### United States

Proscaline is not directly scheduled under the Controlled Substances Act in the United States. However, due to its structural similarities with mescaline, a Schedule I drug, it could potentially be subject to the same control measures and penalties for possession and manufacture under the Federal Analogue Act.
