## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Common: 100 - 120 mg
- Strong: Higher dosages can result in serious hyperthermia and eventually death.

**Duration:**
- Total: short
**PMMA can cause serious side effects even at moderate doses, such as [hyperthermia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature) and [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) , which can easily result in death or hospitalization.**
 
As a result, it is strongly discouraged to use this substance. Please see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PMMA#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) for more details.
**para-Methoxymethamphetamine** (also known as **4-methoxymethamphetamine** , **4-MeOMA** , inaccurately as **"4-MMA"** (which should instead be reserved for [4-MMA](/w/index.php?title=4-MMA&action=edit&redlink=1) (4-MeMA) instead) and more commonly as **PMMA** ) is a highly dangerous and toxic synthetic substance of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) class that is closely related to [PMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PMA) . Like PMA, it is known for producing extremely dangerous, life-threatening side effects. At lower dosages, its effects are somewhat different from PMA, with reduced tendency to cause severe [hyperthermia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature) while producing more [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) effects that can be mistaken for [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) (although at higher dosages it does have the same risk as PMA). Its history of use is unknown, but it has appeared more frequently in the 2000s and 2010s. It is generally less potent than PMA.

**PMMA, along with other drugs like [PMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PMA) and [PMEA](/w/index.php?title=PMEA&action=edit&redlink=1) have very little recreational value and are considered as one of the most dangerous and toxic substances known. It is strongly recommended that these two substances should be completely avoided.**

## Chemistry

PMMA (para-Methoxymethamphetamine or 4-MMA) is a molecule of the [substituted amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) class. Molecules of the amphetamine class contain a phenethylamine core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain with an additional methyl substitution at R α . It contains a methoxy (OCH 3 ) functional group bound to the R 4 carbon of the phenyl ring, as well as a methyl substitution at R N . PMMA is the N-methylated version of [PMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PMA) and the 4-Methoxy analog of [Methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) .

## Pharmacology

PMMA, like [PMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PMA) most likely acts as a [selective serotonin releasing agent](/w/index.php?title=Selective_serotonin_releasing_agent&action=edit&redlink=1) (SSRA) with weak effects on dopamine and norepinephrine transporters. However, relative to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , it is considerably less effective as a releaser of serotonin with properties more akin to a reuptake inhibitor in comparison. It evokes robust hyperthermia while producing only modest hyperactivity and serotonergic neurotoxicity, substantially lower than that caused by MDMA. Anecdotal reports suggest it is not particularly euphoric at all, perhaps even dysphoric in contrast. PMMA has also been shown to act as a potent, reversible inhibitor of the enzyme [MAO-A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) with no significant effects on MAO-B, and the combination of this property and serotonin release is likely responsible for its high lethality potential. It is likely metabolized to PMA, just like [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) is metabolized to [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) in the body.

It appears that PMMA elevates body temperatures dramatically; the cause of this property is suspected to be related to its ability to inhibit MAO-A and at the same time releasing large amounts of serotonin, effectively causing [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) . It appears that PMMA activates the hypothalamus much more strongly than MDMA and other drugs like [ephedrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ephedrine) , thereby causing rapid increases in body temperature (which is the major cause of death in PMMA mortalities).

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the user's physical energy levels, PMMA is commonly regarded as moderately stimulating and energetic exclusively at lower dosages.

## Toxicity and harm potential

PMMA and its relative [PMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PMA) can be considered extremely toxic when compared to other substances such as [Methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) or [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . Ingestion of PMMA has been associated with severe tachycardia (abnormally high heart rate), [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure) , [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) , [hyperthermia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature) , and death. PMMA has a relatively slow onset, causing many users to redose which causes excess toxicity.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if choosing to use this substance.
