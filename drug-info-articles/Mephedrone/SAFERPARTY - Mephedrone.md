## Effects
The effect is similar to that of methcathinone, cocaine and MDMA. Mephedrone causes euphoria and stimulation, increased urge to talk, increased performance and altered sensory perceptions. The need for food and sleep is suppressed.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Various adverse effects may occur when consuming mephedrone: Dry mouth, mydriasis (dilated pupils), jaw grinding, increased heartbeat, increase in body temperature, anxiety or paranoia. There is a risk of dehydration due to decreased thirst and lack of fluid intake. High doses of mephedrone lead to psychotic reactions and can increase schizophrenia. There is a risk of dependence with symptoms such as restlessness, tremors, insomnia and hyperactivity.
Mephedrone is a research chemical. To date, nothing is known about the exact mechanisms of action, toxicity and possible long-term effects. The current state of knowledge is based almost exclusively on reports from users. Due to the strong craving (irresistible and uncontrollable desire to consume), especially when consumed nasally/smoked, there is a danger that one will take more too quickly and the side effects will predominate.

## Safer Use
- There is very little knowledge about legal highs, research chemicals, etc. When you use them, you are exposing yourself to unknown risks. Have the substance analysed in a drug check. If this is not possible and you still want to use the substance, try small amounts to reach the desired dose.
- Do not buy a product with a fancy name without a declaration of the ingredient. Legal does not mean harmless.
- During consumption, inform your friends about what and how much you have consumed.
- Drink enough non-alcoholic beverages and get some fresh air in between.
- Accept it when the effect runs out, don't add to it right away.
- Refrain from mixed consumption, as interactions are dangerous and unexplored.
- Take regular breaks from consumption.
- People with high blood pressure, heart problems, hyperthyroidism, liver and kidney disease or circulatory problems should not take Research Chemicals.
