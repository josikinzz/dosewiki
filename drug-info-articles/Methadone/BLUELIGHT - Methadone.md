The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

Challenge denied, and due to BLUA I can't post the reason ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) 


should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME...

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control.

I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance.

The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

Challenge denied, and due to BLUA I can't post the reason ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) 


should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.

Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.

The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

Challenge denied, and due to BLUA I can't post the reason ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) 


should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control.

> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.

> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**

> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.

> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.

> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.

> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**

> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

Challenge denied, and due to BLUA I can't post the reason ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) 


should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

**methadone**

I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.

> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.

> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.

> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

Challenge denied, and due to BLUA I can't post the reason ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) 


should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.

> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.

> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.

> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

Challenge denied, and due to BLUA I can't post the reason ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) 


should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.

> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**

> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.

> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.

> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

Challenge denied, and due to BLUA I can't post the reason ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) 


should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.

> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**

> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.

> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.

> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

Challenge denied, and due to BLUA I can't post the reason ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) 


should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.

> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.

> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

Challenge denied, and due to BLUA I can't post the reason ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) 


should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.

> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.

> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

Challenge denied, and due to BLUA I can't post the reason ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) 


should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.

> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.

> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

Challenge denied, and due to BLUA I can't post the reason ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) 


should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.

> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.

> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

Challenge denied, and due to BLUA I can't post the reason ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) 


should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

I had to use it for a few months for a chronic pain condition for lack of $ for Subutex It did take my pain away, but not until I hit the 30-40 mg. mark the third week. Then, if not quicker than other full agonists tolerance builds very quickly

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I would say yeah, methadone is probably a better bet for stronger analgesia and euphoria.  Just please read up on methadone, potential side effects, and so on.

I guess the question would.be, I miss the energy and happiness of takig the opioid that my body no longer gets. I.e. have chronic pain and will for years, and can't take opioids anymore so I want Mt my ability to be happy again too. subs don't give me that.i'm not trying to char a high rather than feel emotions again around my family while having pain relief

**antibiotics and methadone**


I had no idea methadone and antibiotics interacted with each other and after being on amoxicillin and finding it in the Red area for interactions I am now worried about yet another antibiotic,clindamycin I am supposed to take. I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

I think I have mentioned it before, but if there is such a thing as a dirty cheap buzz, thats how I would describe it, & I am not into pain meds' for the high, just the relief - I wont even describe the w/d's after 3 months of use...I am just glad I have a good pain managemant Doctor.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks

I am fairly worried and asked my doctor about interaction an expressed worry. I was also on azithromycin months back for a rather serious illness and now know why my methadone behaved funny while taking the 2. i just read on google that this sends people into acute wd syndrome and I am really bothered by having to take all these antibiotics. Can someone Please help and shed some light to wether I should ask for a different antibiotic or is clindamycin ok with methadone????

Methadone FAQ


> [sixpartseven said:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/goto/post?id=6399487)
> 
> 
> 
> *I took the FAQ portion of phrozen's buprenorphine FAQ and copied it, adjusting it to pertain to methadone, so credit goes to phrozen for the layout, questions, and some answers that went unchanged.*
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** How long after my last methadone dose can I take an opiate and feel its effects?**
> 
> **A:** With methadone, the higher the dose, the more heroin it can block. It also depends on how long you have been taking the methadone. Wait at least 24 - 36 hours before trying to dose another opiate if you want to be sure you feel the full effects from it.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone a good replacement for buprenorphine?**
> 
> **A:** Maybe. Some people with a high enough opiate tolerance may not be held by bupe at any level, even at the highest(ceiling) possible dose. Methadone does not have a ceiling dose, so your dose can be raised as high as it needs to be raised to make up for tolerance. You should research both before deciding what to go on, as they both have different positives and negatives in regards to their use.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** I'm thinking about switching from bupe to methadone. At what bupe dose should I be when I switch?**
> 
> **A:** Switching from bupe to methadone is MUCH easier than switching from methadone to bupe. The latter means you would have to taper your dose of methadone down to around 30 - 40mg before making the jump. Going bupe to methadone, you dont have to get your bupe dose down, because again, methadone does not have a ceiling and the dose can be taken as high is it needs to be taken to compensate for tolerance.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Will I still have cravings on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Its possible, but since methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, generally the cravings will be well taken care of. But, if your dose isnt at the exact place it needs to be (too low), you may experience some cravings.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone good for depression/anxiety?**
> 
> **A:** Just like any other full-agonist, it can cause depression. And again, like other full-agonists, it will help ease anxiety.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is it safe to shoot methadone?**
> 
> **A:** No. It can cause many of the same complications as shooting other pills. The best advice is to use a micron filter if you absolutely must try to shoot. If you get liquid methadone from the clinic, you should most definitely not shoot it. The sucrose and syrup contained with-in are horrible for your veins.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Is methadone recreational?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. It is a full mu-receptor agonist. Someone using methadone for maintenance purposes may not be able to get high from it unless they take a very high dose, but for someone who is not on maintenance and has a somewhat low tolerance, it is perfectly recreational.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can you overdose on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes you can. Methadone is very potent and very easy to overdose on. Be careful and always start small.
> 
> 
> 
> ****Q:** Can I still get high on other opiates if I'm on methadone?**
> 
> **A:** Yes. You can "shoot through" your dose of methadone with a larger amount of your prefered opiate than normal, but the risk of OD is huge in this scenario. Its best to wait 24 - 36 hours, that way you can feel the full effects of the opiate without risking a massive OD.

The nod isn't very present IME. It's more of a stimulating high, a bit like phenibut or GBL mixed with a good dose of amphetamine.

Methadone is a shitty option, IMHO.


Takes forever to get off, and is ridiculously powerful.  The withdrawals are shockingly long and shockingly terrible, too.


Suboxone is newer, better, and all around healthier to live on, in my view.


I've seen so many people become screwed from methadone that I am beyond ever supporting it, but it certainly is better than an addiction to heroin and other opiates.


In terms of healthiness, this is what I think:


Abstinence > Kratom > Suboxone > Methadone > Opiate addiction.

So bupe it is? I have access to both methadone and bupe (the strongest available to me), while bupe is much cheaper. good you guys saying that methadone isn't worth it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And i was actually talking about recreational value, i'm not addicted yet... basically opiate naive, almost

Methadone is far more recreational than bupe imo.  You're also only like 9000 times more likely to overdose on it.

should be: get good opioids *in a reasonable price*


But I'm going to just quit it since this looks like asking for sources. I'm not.

I've been on both MMT and SMT for relatively long periods and the full agonist methadone is much easier to abuse... especially if you're on a low dose of about 50-80 MG. IME... I also get an initial energy boost for a few hrs and then slowly wears off. I don't recommend this because it's a dangerous way to OD but I could add 40-50mg to my 80 and take a xanax and get quite a buzz and then a nod.

**methadone**


First off, hi.


I've been a, lurker for a, time and decided I can't seem to find the answer I need.


I've been on massive amounts of painkillers due to a motor.vehicle accident some years back. 


Long story short, I became addicted to my mess and it git out of control. The first  offered  me methadone but heard nothing but negativity so now they have me on suboxone and while it works for cravings sometimes, most of the time I feel numb to the world  and it makes me wish I was still.on my meds. Are methodones really the answer for me or am I going to have to feel like everything I like doing has no emotion. I understand PAWS etc but i'm really scared my life will never go back to what it was.


 Will methadone help with my pain and get back some of that happiness or euphoria I used to produce.   I still work out and eat right but its not even helping.


also I types this from my phone so if anything looks weird, disregard.  Thanks
