Preparing for approx 20mg of nexus. As well as 7mg measured of 2/e. All oral admin. Going to dose in about 30 min.  


Mainly stored in freezer. 50 percent of the time. Which would be a few weeks. Never really noticed any effect of keeping it in a dark, dry, cool area from affecting trips. 


B and E seems to combine visual aspects as well as the CEV with 2/e. Will be posting here again later more than likely. B is in press form but e is not. And percentage of press tested for most part. 2cx's are getting harder to come across unfortunately.   ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

I haven't done 2c-e in almost a year. For that kind of time commitment and recovery period, I'd rather do LSD.


But I may try it again soon. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Just done my dosage. Will be sure to put one on T reports tomorrow. 2/e has a wonderful aspect like L does but just does not have the mind fuck ability as well as the mystical/magical part to it. 


Lots of laughing like lucy produces, but not as much open eye visuals as others say. Good stuff nevertheless. Hopefully T7 is next. Next on my list that is  ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


never really had any recovery issues with rc's. Though some tolerance noted. Normally keep trips on a weekend night due to my work schedule so don't have to worry about that.

If you take a high enough dose you'll see some serious open eyed visuals   :D

Thanks for the bump ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


In my limited few experience with 2C-E it just doesn't click with me; maybe you're another one it just doesn't work for.  I got lots of body load without much euphoria.  I don't usually get intense visuals on anything so it wasn't a big factor for me with 2C-E.


About rectal dosing 8-9mg would be a good starting point.  Rectal dosing can be quite intense and unpredictable.  My one and only rectal trial at 12mg was a bit of a shit-show (somewhat literally ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif))  It hit in 5 minutes and came like a freight train.  I puked my guts out at 20 minutes and then didn't know which end to stick towards the toilet.  I also had some of the worst body feeling I've ever had on a trip.


Don't mean to scare you off; it's just a good idea to start on the low end.  Rectal dosing potency can be surprising.

When you talk about syringes and rectal admin, I guess you dissolve it and then "chute" (not "shoot") it?  Sry somewhat confused here.

Syringe without a needle on the end.  I have those 1cc "slip tip" type where it has the tip for you to slip a needle on the end of the syringe.  They work great.  If you can't get those just get an oral syringe from the pharmacy; they're all over and you wont get any suspicion in buying one.


Basically; dissolve powder in a small volume of water, suck it into the syringe, lube up the outside, insert it a bit, push on plunger.  Then try to hold it in for a while. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I also want to remind everyone about the subthreads.  The links are in the OP.  They're there to keep the discussion somewhat organized.  The main B&D thread is to be used only for things that don't fall into the subthread categories.


It takes a lot of work to divide a B&D into subthreads; let's use them eh?

**The Big and Dandy 2C-E Thread - Ethyl's a special one**


I'm looking forward to doing 2C-E soon - not done any psychs in a few months - can't wait.


Does anyone else feel that 2C-E severely dilates time when you do over a certain amount? Or could it just be that this sort of thing happens when setting has not been right?


My last experience with 2C-E was when I did 30mg oral(capsule) dose, was surprised at just how quickly it started kicking in (my friend had a  35mg capsule)...

About an hour later, my friend (different friend) sniffed a pile (which must have been at least 25mg) after drinking a fair amount, and he went off on one...

I think it was a case of severe ego loss etc and he couldn't handle it...and I couldn't handle him being like that as I've never seen him like that.


He decided he wanted to be alone, so I went home after this slight buzzkill, and went and sat on the sofa listening to QI on TV, and when I opened my eyes after listening to 2 episodes, I got abit confused (**and** amazed at the sheer volume of visuals from top to bottom of my vision ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) ) and a bit spun out -  had to ask my brother what day it was, after pacing around the living room. 

Fucking amazing visuals though!


So yeah - setting and all that, or dose giving me the really mad time dilation?

Hell yeah one of the major effects with any high dose 2 ce trip is time dilation. Sometimes I wont even notice my surroundings because im so deep in thought and then theres the moment of my god I must of been zoned out for an hour and then i ll look at the clock and its only been 5 minutes.

It has been about two years since I've dosed 2c-e. However, I remember declaring that it may very well be my favorite long acting psychedelic, and I was doing lots of psychedelics (among other not so good things) at the time. I took a break from psychedelia, save for a few mushroom and LSD experiences, while I got my shit together from some other drug issues. Now that I am clear headed and in a good place, I plan on taking 2c-e any day now. I have a dose weighed out and everything. I'm just waiting until my set is in the right place and until I have a day off work.


I'm super excited to be back and to be myself, ready to kick into the high gear of my soul ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).

mmmm 2C-E is my favourite hallucinogen... add a strobe light and some disco lights and you got balls of fire like the sun shooting up into the air... people "speaking colors", everyone has theyre own aura around them... i frigin love the stuff... problem is i usually binge and kill a gram in a week, and by the end of the week i have maad tolerance....

I tripped on 2C-E a couple days ago. Strongest trip I've ever had that's for sure. For the first half of the experience once it peaked i was only seemed to take in 1/2 of the sensory information available, that is I listened to conversations but they sounded like grunts and groans of words which I could somewhat make out. Then after the peak I dont know when but I got this rush of all the missing information at once, it felt like I was shifting through space and time. One thing I found most strange was after the peak, the remaining trip was EXACTLY like 4-AcO-DMT....in terms of visuals, body sensation, relaxatiion/drowsiness. I had taken some MDAI that day, but it had easily worn off by the time I took the 2C-E. I dosed orally at 8:30pm and went to sleep at 8am still tripping.

I have used 2c-e about 10 times. The chemical has taught me so much! I have changed by using this and it has changed my outlook on life.


The body stimulation is usually very uncomfortable for me and marijuana is usually needed, yet cannabis gives the trip a whole different vibe. Usually a more recreational feel but sometimes it goes into depth.


Visuals I cant say are as good as LSD. I just live how everything comes alive on LSD and it has a warm side to it. THe sinister sort of vibe in visuals I get from acid are also very cool. ![8-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f60e.png) 2C-E has a passionate visual field. Something that has brought me to tears. It is beautiful in its own way... not like LSD but more real. This is the best I can compare visuals:


LSD: Swirly, Gives me that alice and wonderland vibe. Also, i notice trees and stuff grow! I love this... so cool! OH NO HERE IS A BETTER WAY TO EXPLAIN IT. 


--- You know when it is hot and you lay on the ground and there is a heat wave ~~~

well everything seems to be under this heat wave... like the heatwave now extends through the air instead of just 6 inches from the ground.


2c-e has a design... it is mechanical looking. Closed eye visuals I can see this design. Trees dont grow, they just vibrate rapidly. sadly I havent been able to just trip and enjoy, body load has been horrible at times. I recall being an idiot and dosing an unknown dose that i accidently spilled in a cup... long story how it was accidental and how it got in there, but the visuals were very intense... and so was the body load. I couldnt tell if i closed my eyes or if they were open. Id forget sometimes. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


All in all I want to try this jewel again, but I must first meet the sibling 2c-i. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Thanks im pretty excited because I also have a couple grams of dmt and some nitrous so im sure ill be in for a wild ride. Also i like your description of 2 ce. I also love 2 ce at first it was in the lower ranks of pyschs for me but it shot up the ladder rather quickly and its only in second place behind good old lsd.

So how did that trip go?  I'm waiting on my order of 2c-e right now.  If it's as fast as the JWH took, it should be here tomorrow.  


I definitely wanna test a little out right away, would 10mg be enough/to much to still trip but be able to remain sober enough around people?

10mg oral has been perfect for me...visuals were always still quite pronounced but no mental shifts really...felt sober-headed

2ce is definitely one of my faves, easily my favorite of the 2c's.  2ct2 is probably a relatively close second, at least partially due to the lesser time commitment. I find it pretty highly visual, even at doses in the 10-15mg range.  The higher doses get pretty weird & wacky, but I've always enjoyed them

When I dosed this orally I didn't like the body load/nausea...thats pretty much the only body load I got from it oral...when i insufflated it however, and lay down on my bed - these describe it best - 


*it felt like I was getting massaged

*it felt like I was on the brink of orgasmic pleasure - not quite tipping over

* it felt like I was getting hugged

* it felt like MDMA tingles and rushes up and down my body

* it felt like this big ball of chi was rising from my diaphragm up and into my upper chest and arms/hands - felt like it was a potential energy I could release and I was very excited by this divine feeling.

That's interesting.  To me 2c-e is almost completely body neutral.  T2 on the other hand is quite physically euphoric to me.

I just tried it for the first time a week ago (at 16mg) and had a great trip, but it was totally devoid of euphoria or emotional alterations


I found it extremely neutral and clear-headed, and very mentally productive as far as self analysis and insights. Plan to try 18mg this weekend ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hmmm, never gone above 10mg's rectal but the 4 times I've done it (8mg, 8mg, 9mg, 10mg) I have had the best body feeling going on. My next time when I try a higher dose, maybe 12mg's rectal I'll let the thread know how it went as far as the body changing, I hope it doesn't as I love it and I would just hope that more substance would = more euphoric body. One thing that I have found affects this, is the absorbtion rate of 2c-e I.E. if I do seperate pluggings (which I do now), starting out with a small amount, usually 4-5mg's prepares my body for the oncoming dose of 2c-e and makes the come-up a lot less tense anxious. So like last time I plugged 4mg's first and then a half hour later I plugged the other 6mg's and had an almost oral come-up without having to eat 20mg's and deal with the stomach discomfort that I experienced. If I was going to recommend anything to people that have found that 2c-e has too much body load to be worth it, try out rectal admin. and spacing doses out to 2 or 3 smaller doses, works like a charm.

Nice report Nib !  Yeah 2C-E is a real heavy duty trip.  It's one of my all time favorites hands down though.  The come up takes a long time and can be rough, but overall it's one of the best feeling psychedelics as far as body buzz goes.  I find if I do it in the day, and get enough sleep at night, it has very little day after effects that I would call deleterious.  I had to develop a relationship with 2C-E, and learn how to work with it before I started consistently having "enjoyable" trips, if you know what i mean.  You gotta give it a lot of room.  Approach 14+ mg doses with the same attitude you would have if you were going to eat 400 ug+ of LSD.  I've done like 4-5 mgs of 2C-E before, and I would say was tripping off that small a dose.  That's like half of what Shulgin states as a minimum dose.   2C-E delivers though, that much is for sure.

aww it's cool man cheers - I'm relatively experienced when it comes to 2C-E (& 2C-B), having gone from insufflated doses of 8-15mg to oral doses of 25-30mg... it's a wild one sure enough.


is that 4-5mg an oral dose? ^ or a plugged/insufflated one, chemical wizard?

Man I took a 5mg dose earlier today and i'm still tripping.  Took it at 5:30am actually.  Its 11:30am and its still going a bit.  This was oral to.  I didn't really bug the fuck out, but I was definitely tripping out. 


Though yea I did fucking do about 200mg of Meph before it.  Never will I do that combo again.  Hopefully I scared myself straight this time.

never tried any of the 2c family before, but if all goes right may get to try some 2c-e in the near future.  i find it interesting that some report euphoria while others report terrible body load.  i'm hoping i will be one of the former.  in case i'm not, has anyone found ways to lighten the load?  would taking a benzo or some vicodin help or just ruin the trip.  i know that benzos can easily kill a roll and stuff like that, so would that apply to 2c-e?

I don't have the kind of access to a benzo that most of you lucky ones seem to have, but I find that Phenibut (easy and legal to find) does a fine job of taking the edge off 2C-E when 2C-E gets angry and decides to have its way with you ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

As I'm presently coming off of my 2nd bad "body load" 2C-E experience, I can confirm that taking Phenibut effectively took the edge off of 2C-E. 


I was getting some nasty heart-related effects from the 2C-E + MAO-B combo, so believe you me I was pretty damn relieved when I finally felt the Phenibut kick in ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


This probably should already go without saying, but it deserves repeating:

2C-E (even a dose as low as 1-2 mg) + MAO-B inhibitor = automatically bad body load. 


I thought the low dose would prevent the negative effects, but it does not.


Damn I wish my MAO-B inhibitor (l-deprenyl) didn't take 2 complete weeks to flush out of one's system & restore enzyme levels back to normal ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif) It messes with basically everything.

Yup. You need to be uber-careful combining anything with MAOIs of any description, I'd say. Check out the [B&D Medication Interactions Thread](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=362749) for more info ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I can also imagine that phenibut would help with the heebie-jeebies cos I use GBL (pretty similar to phenibut in many ways and legal in the UK... just) rather than benzos generally. I find it makes the trip slightly less clear-headed (unsurprisingly) but it's short-acting so handy if you just need to get over a lil bump without taking the edge off the whole trip.

I find that anti-histamines effectively kill the body load if you experience a negative one... diphenhydramine or promethazine do the trick pretty well... be careful with the latter if it causes drowsiness in you... I ended up bed locked like crazy with the promethazine.... still enjoyable.. but it wasn't purely psychedelic at that point. I don't think that diphenhydramine should interfere that much.

i don't think this is a question that is not allowed b/c i'm not asking about where to get stuff or anything.  i was just wondering what the chances are of customs agents seizing small amounts 2ce coming in2 the US.  is that very common?  like if they know what it is will they confiscate it even though it technically remains unscheduled?


and thankyou for the advice about benadryl!

If they go through your package, they will probably seize any bag of white powder. If you really want (which I wouldn't advise), about 6 months later when you get your love letter from them... you can tell them what it is and say "Yes, this was for me"...  if they want... they'll send it back... more than likely... they'll come arrest you. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

lol are there any legitimate excuses that could be used to explain the purchase of the substance?  would it be better to not say anything and just ask for a lawyer?  i know this is extremely rare, but just in case

You use it to clean your computer monitor?


I don't know...


 If you get a love letter, you just don't reply. Someone could have easily sent you something illegal in order to frame you, after all. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) The first time they confiscate, you just get a letter... From what I understand, after that your address and the senders address are on a watch list. They may not come the second time... or third... or fourth.. or fifth... but if you continue to have packages seized, don't expect to use the "But I didn't order it! I swear!" argument.

I've never heard of anyone's 2c-x getting seized by customs.  As dogs can't smell it and its not "technically" illegal, its probably pretty low on the list of shit they're looking for.  I wouldn't stress too much about it.  and yes, 2c-e gets my monitor spotless!

Whilst it's true it's not technically illegal in the US that's not the case everywhere. All of the 2Cs (in fact virtually every substance named in PIHKAL/TIHKAL) is Class A in the UK, for example. As the fella asking the question is in the US that's not really relevant but would advise people outside of the US to check the legal status of anything they may or may not order. I agree it's unlikely that LE would be especially interested in small quantities of obscure chems... but they do decide to get interested every now and again so caution is wise.


I also think we should probably get back to discussing 2C-E itself rather than ordering and delivery of it. How you get your drugs is up to you - BL is more for what to do once you have those drugs to use them as safely as possible.

I believe SNRIs are generally considered to reduce the effect of psyches. Having said that, I'm on tramadol (also an SNRI amongst other things) and have noticed a slight *increase* in the effects of 2C-x if anything. Seems to bring out a slightly more manic side in the trip for me but not excessively so, thankfully.


The intensity seems to jump up suddenly once you go above 15mg - the extra mg or two makes a *big* difference - so I'd advise going up carefully from now on. I generally feel very clear-headed and get few visuals on 2C-E (or 2C-I for that matter) but many find it extremely visual. Visuals aren't really a very useful way of judging the strength of a trip, in my experience.

Some discussion of the effects of mirtazapine on psyches and MDMA in that there thread - especially towards the end. Seems to be less of a shitter than some SSRI/SNRI meds. I'd definitely advise caution and start with a few low-dose testers to work up to a full psychedelic dose to see how you react if you choose to use 2C-E on top of it though.

I have a chance to get 2c-e and i'm very much interested in trying it. the only problem is that i have a bad anxiety problem and from what i've read about this drug, it has a dark side to it and bad trips are fairly common. I was wondering if I could maybe take like .5 mg's or 1 mg's of alprazolam (because i have somewhat of a tolerance to benzos) to prevent a bad trip or should i just keep that on the side in case things get too intense?

.5mg of alprazolam isn't too much, if you do have some tolerance. I personally prefer diazepam in combination with psychedelics if I feel that I need it.... Alprazolam is too short acting for me. But my general recommendation is to wait and see how it effects you before taking a benzodiazepine. You can always take it later if you start feeling too anxious.

I've know of a number of people using mirtazapine to abort trips, so my guess would be not really.  You'll likely experience extremely diminished effects.

^ It seems that may be different for some daily users of mirtazapine cos a few EADD folks report no significant reduction in the effects of acid, a few 2C-x and other surprises - was pretty amazed myself but presume it maybe has more of an effect in those without tolerance to mirtazapine. Some even trip just fine whilst on long-term anti-psychotics. MDMA seems to be blunted for sure though.

Someone recommended using diphenhydramine (Benadryl) to cancel out the negative body load of 2C-E.


Does this actually work? If it does, any idea WHY it works?


I have had my 2c-e for a while and other than a few initial trials I haven't really dove in yet. It is fantastically visual for me especially with CEVs but the body load and nausea was not very enjoyable so this possibility of using Benadryl intrigues me.


I really wanna start experimenting with this one as it seems to have a lot of potential.


I find the visuals from 2c-e to be MUCH more colorful and a greater variety in texture than LSD. Metallic fluorescent :D

8mg of 2c-e was taken rectally to test dose response. previously have tried 12mg oral with manageable nausea and amazing trip.


with 8mg rectally (the day after halloween, so some hangover was present and may be to blame), moderate to heavy nausea was noted about 1 hour after injestion, including heavy body load (cold sweat, tremors, muscle tension). was able to safely get to toilet before puking up guts. felt very cleansing and began to trip fairly well (++) for the next 5-6 hours.


one week later, 4mg was taken rectally, 30 mins after 75mg oral diphenhydramine. mild nausea was noted, but controllable. no open eye visuals, mild color enhancement, and slight stimulation noted. tv was interesting yet annoying during ads. was not able to test music appreciation. four hours after injestion, a bowl of weed was smoked, causing typical thc effects. one hour later sleep was difficult due to sudden appearance of swooping neon closed eye visuals, auditory pulsing, and heavy tactile stimulation. face was felt to melt into the pillow.

i consumed 50mg of 2ce


I had some slight visuals when i concentrated on the walls or ceilings


I was buzzing somewhat chronic and couldnt really sit still and relax, had no stomach discomfort.

I couldnt stop laughing for about 10-12 hours when it finally started to wear off and left me mentally exhausted.

No comedown the next day, and fell asleep fine.


Overall it was a good experience but no where near as powerful as people make out it to be, if this is the closest thing to LSD then LSD must be pretty tame tbh.

Was expecting alot more visuals.

^bighooter, didn't you already report that you're on some kind of medication that negates the effects of psychedelics... which is why you didn't get much from 2C-I? If you're still on those meds, why would you expect anything different from another 2C?


2C-E *is* as powerful as made out to be, and more. 50 mg would be a potentially traumatic dose for most people.


And it's not all about the visuals. 2C-E is a rather serious psych best utilized in the committed unraveling of difficult psychic knots, and tends to resent being used for entertainment. Sorry if that wasn't your intention, but that's how it comes across.

Yup. If you're on mirtazapine you probably won't get much from any psyches. Some still get decent effects but very few. Acid will be just the same. I'd save what you have until you're off the meds cos trying to trip on anti-depressants is pretty pointless, to be honest. I get very few visuals from 2C-E or any psyches and am on no AD meds - tripping and hallucinating are not the same things. 50mg is a ridiculously high dose. 20mg (or less) would seriously take your breath away without the meds.

2c-e is a seratonergic psychedelic, ketamine is a dissociative anasthetic that works on NMDA receptor sites, as well as Mu Opoid & sigma's.  These are all very different systems in the brain, thus ketamine is relatively unaffected by SNRI's & 5ht antagonists, but things such as 2c-e & other "classical" psychedelics are.

Hooter: I see you are also using testosterone and 'roids. Have no idea how they interact with psyches but I'd do some research on that too cos interactions can be very bad news even if they don't ruin the high.

**Mirtazapine 

Mechanism of Action

Mirtazapine is an antagonist of presynaptic alpha 2-adrenergic autoreceptors and heteroreceptors on both norepinephrine and serotonin presynaptic axons. It is also is a potent antagonist of 5HT2 and 5HT3 receptors. As a result, there is increased NE and 5HT activity, especially increased 5HT activitity at the 5HT1A receptors.**Common Side Effects

Sedation, increased appetite, dizziness, and weight gain.


Metabolism

CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of mirtazapine.


Recreational Drug Interactions

Alcohol, GHB (and related substances), Benzos (Xanax, Valium, Klonopin etc), Opiates (Heroin, Codeine, Vicodin, Oxy etc), Barbituates: The effects of these drugs will be stronger than normal, as they will add to the sedative effects of mirtazapine. CAREFUL and go easy on these drugs and stick to low doses until you are sure how they interact with the mirtazapine. 


Ketamine: The effects of this drug should not be altered by mirtazapine and the combination is not known to be dangerous.


DXM (Dextromethorphan, Robotussin): Because mirtazapine and DXM are metabolized by some of the same enzymes, this combination is most likely quite dangerous. Avoid taking DXM and mirtazapine together!


MDMA/Ecstasy (includes MDA, MDEA etc): Rolling on mirtazapine is relatively safe. Some people find that they do not roll quite as hard as they usually would, and that they need to take about 1/2 an extra pill to obtain normal effects.


Amphetamines (Methamphetamine, Adderall, Dexedrine), Ritalin (methylphenidate), Cocaine, 4-MAR (4-methylaminorex): Using stimulants while on mirtazapine seems to be relatively safe as well. The mirtazapine does not appear to affect the recreational effects of the stimulant (i.e. you will get just as high as you always did).


**Hallucinogens (LSD/Acid, psilocybin/Shrooms, Tryptamines, 2-ct-2,DPT, DMT etc, Salvia) Hallucinogens seem to be MUCH stronger in combination with mirtazapine, so please be VERY CAREFUL! A dangerous interaction with shrooms has been observed in one person taking mirtazapine. Please avoid hallucinogens while taking mirtazapine or dose very carefully.**


so according to this (which i got off a bluelight post) I should be able to come up off 2ce and for it to have remarkably stronger effects?

and lsd should work aswell

I've never heard of that being the case before. People on mirtazapine seem to mostly report *decreased* effects if anything. Some people even use it to try to abort trips with some success, I think. 50mg of 2C-E is a shitload - very few people would ever take such a high dose. Something appears to be reducing it's effects in you unless you have cut or low purity 2C-E (unlikely, I'd think, but possible). I'd still be looking at mirtazapine myself.


Where was that post from? Is it actual research or a subjective opinion? Seems odd to me from what I've read of mirtazapine interactions so would be good to know.

Interesting. That FAQ is quite old now and I wonder if any more research has been done since. The're's been some talk recently that some of the FAQs may need updating as most of them are getting on a bit now and there are a few possible inaccuracies therin. Wiki (yeah, I know it's only wiki) says the opposite and just about all the user reports of using MDMA/psyches on mirtazapine seem to suggest the same: reduced effects. Odd. Any of the more knowledgeable folks got any light to shed?

ye i know bud it definatly affected my experience


I mean from what ive read 50mg is a incredibly stupid dose, however I must add that I feel ok considering the hefty amount I took.


Ive heard of some people never feeling the same after doses close to 50mg region

why are you on the mirtazapine? if i were on a prescribed neuromodifying drug, i would reconsider my 'need to trip' until finishing the course of medication. i assume there's a reason your doc wants to antagonize your 5ht receptors

5-6mgs oral should give threshold effects, which would be good if its your first experience with a psychedelic, or just your first experience with 2c-e.  You can always take more, however, you can't really untake a psychedelic

if you have a small amount like 100 mg or something just eye out one 10th and do that.  if it happens to be a bit more, you should still be just fine.  i eyed out a fifth of 125mg.. no problem.  nice trip though hehe

dont listen to the above information.


(in case you cant work it out, if they send you 125 mg and u take a 1/5th of it, but instead of 125 mg its 150 mg which is super common, youre gettin a 30mg dose instead. sometimes they are quite a bit out. get a scale)

Yeah it's pretty easy to eyeball a safe dose of 2ce once you're used to it, people exaggerate how small the amount of powder is. Sure it's hard to be real exact, but you can get it between 10 and 20 mg every time pretty easily. If you're aiming for 25mg and you're starting with an unknown quantity and no scales and you havent even tested it, you have a problem though.

^you beat me to it.


Its always best to use a scale or a solution (2c-e is a pretty stable compound even in solution).


You never know if a vendor sends you the amount you actually. There have been mix ups in the past, and what you may think is 100mg could be 500mg or more ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)


Always best to be as safe as possible when taking rc's.

I've also noticed the consistency of 2c-e to vary greatly. Where sometimes 10mgs will look really minuscule. And other times it's really quite fluffy and 10mgs looks like 25mgs to my eying out eye. Get a scale.

yeah i just got my scales delivered a week or so ago, cant stop playing with them. i think ive weighed these 2ce caps about 500 times now. get a scale! its a financially sound decision, as well as being a million times safer than eyeballing random powders, and pretty fun imo. i must admit i feel a lot safer about dosing now, even though i was quite blase about the whole thing previously.


and yeah, i find 6-12mg of 2ce to be extremely euphoric and great for goin out and things like that, not too intense at all. and being clear headed when you need to be is a definite bonus. once im hitting 15+ mgs i start losing my interest in socialising in that fashion.


on another note altogether, i notice that theres not much of anything on 2ce + MDMA combo. i tried it a couple of days ago and it was amazing. considering doing it again in the not too distant future and wondering if anyone would be interested in a trip report as i generally cant be bothered documenting anything. as it stands, im incapable of comprehending exactly what actually happened to me that night other than that i know it was totally different to anything ive ever experienced before, so it would be nice to have some motivation to document it as it goes.

10-25 mgs is small dosages of 2c-e? I feel like if you pay 2c-e the respect it deserves even at low doses it can be incredibly revealing.

Depends on the person, and 10-25 is too huge a range to classify for 2c-e. For me 14mg was a very weak dose, and 20mg was seriously intense.

I find no difference between 25 and 40 mg.

Maybe the bodyload is slightly worse but I've never experienced vomiting, just muscle twitching, overall dezorientation and discomfort.

The experience itself is quite difficult and not necesarly pleasant for me.

QFT


2c-e has a very steap dose response curve IME.


The difference between 16mg and 18mg was huge when i tried them.

(though perhaps set ans setting played a role, as they usually do)

**2ce:  Melting Rainbows**


personal opinions:  i feel like shulgin was definitely right when he called it a "difficult yet worth-while substance".  I don't like speedy drugs to begin with, so the body load for me is veeerrry hard to deal with.  I've been taking it about once every week to two weeks for a month.  This time I tried taking a lighter dose of 8mg.  I originally started by eyeballing it (not this time, in the past), which I must've done a pretty good job of b/c the experience was what I expected.  i feel very clear headed just overwhelmed by the intensity of the body load and visuals, so that it becomes a chore to open my mouth to talk to my friends.  it's also very hard to put my finger on what the visuals are that i'm seeing (b/c smaller amount this time).  they look holographic.  in the past i've seen huge floating molecules of DNA and skulls with spinal chords attached.  I've also experienced some hard core synesthesia on this stuff.  generally everything begins to melt in intense rainbow colors with holographs of rainbow everywhere and i feel cracked out.


this is a great way of showing how i feel right now:

it's like there's this edge of insanity to everyday household objects that suddenly become sinister.

HarryHaller,


My one and only experience with 2CE was very similar. I was in a time where I'd take anything I could get my hands on, and it was my first experience with any hallucinogen. I snorted 20mg (big mistake). I had a 15 mile drive from my work parking lot to my apartment, and I remember within four minutes of leaving my work I began do see long streaming "melting rainbows" being drug along behind the road signs. The body load was pretty intense, too, as it was hard for me to keep my head up for very long. I was leaned over my steering wheel the last five miles. When I parked my car in front of my apartment, I saw my neighbor come out his front door, grab a pack of smokes from his car, and then walk back and forth along his walkway as he smoked. I had "freezeframes" of him from his door, to the car, back to his porch. By the time I got inside my place, the visuals were in full force. I sat on my couch for eight hours and watched as black, skeletal arms reached out of the floor as if they were trying to come out from underground. These were holographic, as I remember. Because I took such a heavy dose nasally, my trip last a near twenty-four hours. I haven't tried it since, but I know next time I'd measure out my dose. I've heard having others around while they're on it makes the whole experience better. Nice review!

Holy hell, this was your first hallucinogen and you snorted 20mg (!!) and drove (!!!). I'm impressed you survived, but not cool.

Yeah I am going to set the 2ce aside for awhile.  It is just far too difficult for me to have fun on.  I don't experience any sort of spiritual experiences with it either.  I just came across someone with access to many things I want, including LSD, molly, shrooms, and 2cb; so, i will be focusing on those instead.

I just tried 2ce for the first time this weekend.  I took 16mg and held it under my tongue (sublingual seemed to speed the onset of 2ci for me) but it started to hurt my tongue a bit so I swallowed after only a couple minutes.  It was really fun at first, but it quickly became uncomfortable both physically and emotionally.  2ce seems to be really good at getting deep into your subconscious, which at times can be uncomfortable.  I think some of the issues I had were due to bad timing; I had just gotten back from a long and stressful law school admissions test and I knew I had a lot of work ahead of me.  A lot of anxiety was probably manifesting in physical discomfort.


I also had the very strange feeling that there was a disconnect between my brain and parts of my body, especially the hands.  It was almost as if there was a delay when I tried to move them, and sometimes it felt like they were being controlled by some kind of external influence.  All in all it was a very confusing experience, but I didn't find it profound or constructive like mescaline.  Maybe I would get more from a lower dose?  I'd like to give it another shot eventually, but the thought of doing so makes me nervous.  Of the psychedelic phenethylamines I've tried so far, I would choose 2ci or mescaline over 2ce any day.

2CE is almost completely devoid of introspection for me, its mental effects are so neutral that i often could mistake my condition for sober save the intricate visuals.  among the other phens i've done are 2CT7 & 2CB and 2CE seemed the most agreeable with my bipolar nature strangely enough.  Granted I never took T7 orally and B basically made me bored after the initial 30 minutes or so.  2CE seems to have a unique bipartisan characteristic lol

Yeah, I only use 2ce for pure introspection when I want to write the most blunt and honest thing i possibly can, in a way that I can tear it apart and reuse it when I'm sober. Works wonders for me like that. Beyond that, I would say low doses (~10mg) are very useful in terms of recreation. 


The higher doses you NEED to be willing to think about things IME, intrigue and discovery need to be satisfied or the bodyload and anxiety of trying to ignore things that are interesting your brain gets quite intense. I made the mistake of doing it while already a bit sleepy or generally not in the right mind set, and it wasn't much good at all. And visuals on 2ce dont really interest me beyond the fact that they let me know what im not quite understanding properly and need to inspect further. Once you start understanding the thing, the visuals get more intense, and when you figure out whatever it is deep down that is intriguing you it explodes into a magical thing. That moment is the only reason i take 2ce.

Try smoking some weed with it. I find that Marijuana makes the expierience more recreational, and if you enjoy 2c-i, than I am guesing you like the recreational part of it! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I have yet to try nitrous with it though.


I find that 2c-e alone it way theraputic, it is like I am in a therapy session. Marijuana creates a mind fuck and reminded me abit of LSD. (LSD for me has been purely recreational).

Just took 18mg of this last night after dropping LSD on friday and saturday and still tripped hard...had my ass kicked at some points.  Kinda strange that I tripped harder off 18mg with tolerance than I did off 20mg a few weeks ago without tolerance.


This is a tricky one for sure, but I love it all in all ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

A friend of mine, who is somewhat of a psychedelic hardhead (or rather likes his trips to be quite strong) had a full blown trip from 6mg. Ive seen him take 20mg and you couldnt tell that he was tripping, he handled it just fine. But 6mg gave him a full blown trip.


So yeh, its definately tricky.


Kind of makes me reconsider it. I havent tripped on 2ce in ~4-5 years.

I staggered my doses up.

14mg was not very interesting.

16mg was okay but i could have easily taken it farther.

18mg shredded my ego to bits. It was a very beautiful trip, just as deep as LSD and mushrooms can be. But its abrassive, cold nature has kept me away for all these years.

You should never underestimate how powerful this chemical can be.


Maybe ill revisit it one of these days, but ill definately be starting low again. Probably around 10-12mg for my first go at it again.

^ill have to ask him and get back to you on those questions.


edit: 

So i asked him. 

The set and setting were different.

His previous experiences were 10mg insufflated and 20mg oral.

He said the 20mg experience was clouded by using ketamine through out the trip.

And the snorted 10mg experience was a few days after taking 8mg of DOI.


He said the 6mg trip was very strong psychologically and physically.

It's strange, because his experiences should be clouded from other drugs, and certainly from other doses, like 10mg insufflated and 20mg oral, or 20mg + ketamine, not just 6mg.

Well his 20mg trip wsa clouded by ketamine

his 10mg isufflated trip might have still had some residual tolerance from the DOI a few days prior.


But to have a full blown trip from 6mg is still quite surprising.

He is no light weight when it comes to psychs (like i said earlier, he took 8mg of DOI, which is a pretty hefty dose)


I think 2ce is just pretty eratic with its dosing the way 2ct7 is.

With t7 some people trip fully from 25mg while others need twice as much.

And ive seen the same variation from 2c-e.


Some psychs are a bit more predictable with their dosing. 2c-e doesnt seem to be one of those.

2c-e is a very stable compound even at room temperature.

I'm just coming down from sampling 2C-E for my first time last night. Since it was my first time, I sampled a modest 5 mg, and was fortunately surprised. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

low dose oral i assume? Yes. I did 11 mg in a mall with a friend. I still wouldnt call that a trip either. I dont think its very trippy until 13-15. Its got a bit of a strange dose curve. The effects dont increase much per MG until you hit like 19, and then it seems every mg is a lot more. 


No body load is noticed on low doses. I have not thrown up with a dose under 20mg.


Euphoria is common in social settings IMO. I find when you are alone you become a cynical objective person but when with other people, or out in the open, you find yourself laughing your ass off and being happy as shit. 


Also: Can anybody recommend a solid snorted dose, say something that would ballpark be similar to low 20's oral?  I've only got like 190mg here in Peru and wanna stretch it. I can measure accurately. I've never snorted it before. 


And 3rd. I'm probably gonna try mixing this with some bromo-dragonfly since I have tons of that on hand. Keep an eye out for a report later this week.

Delsym: Halve your oral dose for the nasal equivalent but be prepared for pain beyond you've ever felt and a vicious bodyload. Plug the same amount for a similar effect sans bodyload.


Look forward to your TR but be a lil careful with the BDFLY combo - doesn't sound too great to me but have never had BDFLY so may just be me being a silly goose.

I'm gonna try a sublingual tonight to see how it effects body load. there's one erowid report on how the guy felt no load but the trip was slightly less intense. i'll try 16mg as a start and dissolve it in a bit of water and keep it under my tongue for like 30 mins then spit it out.

the first time i did this drug it was a mind fuck [not a rave drug] the second time was 2 days later [intense visuals] and the third time i did wayyyy too much but had an intense 12 hour visual adventure, it blew my mind in a good way. every time i have done it afterwords has been fun. I hate trying to talk when everyone is on 2c-e conversation is out the window completely.

Nasal pain i can handle... I'm curious to see the bodyload factor though. I usually throw up on 20+mg oral doses, and not much else negative. But it might be worth a single attempt at like 10mg. 


As far as the BDF combo, I have to say so far my experiments with BDF show really lovely mental effects, great mood lift, nice thinking ability, overall just very nice in that regard. But it lacks some visual element. Hence I'd like to try to get the visuals of 2c-e with the pleasurable other effects of the bromo. Plus, I have so much BDF (498mg) on hand that I might as well experiment with it. 


I'm thinking doing 750mcg of BDF, I've done 600 and it was nice but needed more. And then doing like 8-10mg of the 2C-E nasally near the 7-8 hour mark of the Bromo. This will be my christmas treat methinks.

I find that it opens me up more personally , me and some of my friends have had some serious heart to hearts while we were tripping on it. It sets me onto a thought process where I can help figure out the reasons why I perform some of my OCD rituals and what not. For instance after tripping on 2ce the other day Im no longer scarred to touch butter and that has been a problem for me for years. I know its a pretty weird and not so severe but the problems gone none the less. Was the drug a contributing  factor , I don't know but I like to think it was

Surprising but not unlikely, IMO. 2C-E is a surprising little guy; I've had 12mg blow me out of this realm into a state of full ego dissolution, and on another occasion 16mg had me tripping face but with my ego still comfortably intact (enough so to interact with the pizza delivery guy). 


Not to mention 2C-E's weird neutral character, I personally find similar to my sober mindset, so there are times that I second-guess how hard I'm actually tripping, even though I'm tripping extreme amounts of face.

All this talk of irregular dose response is making me second guess myself. I have taken 2c-e a couple times. 14mg was a pretty decent trip. Amazing visuals but some pretty bad nausea. Surprisingly little mind fuck. Since then I haven't taken it orally and only once through RA at around 7mg which definitely helped with the nausea.


I plan on taking 16mg sometime soon with 4mg Zofran to kill any nausea (worked really well for 2c-i but it isn't as volatile on my GA tract as 2c-e so we'll see).  I'm wondering if I should start lower because I haven't taken it in a long time.


Also, on an unrelated note, is ketamine any good with 2c-e?

Ive had 3 trips on it. Ranging from ~15mg-18-20mg.

The 18-20mg trip destroyed my ego and was not neutral at all.

Very aggressive the way mushrooms can be.


Well i havent touched it since but i think sometime soon ill take it out of the stash box and try ~10mg to start with and work my way from there.

If you have enough to experiment with different dosages , there is nothiong wrong about starting low and working up to higher doses.

Does nitrous tend to create a better headspace for the trip? I have noticed more positive push when taking nitrous with other psyches.

2c-e and nitrous is one of the most intense combos I have ever tried. 2c-x and nitrous seems to be more powerful and longer that lasting than LSD and nitrous which is no slouch in itself as far as intensity goes.


I think I will start out with ~14mg and work my way up. I wanna have a fairly intense experience but nothing too ego shredding.

just a quickie report. I did 19mg with a friend who did 15. It was his first time on 2ce, but not first time on psychs, hes had lots of acid and shrooms. 


We walked the waterfront in Lima Peru for the day and had a great time. The visuals on the ocean were amazing and honestly Ive never seen anything so epic before. That was incredible. I also noted that there are parasailing guides who take you up and fly you around, i didnt have the money at the time, but will most definitely be doing some 2CE and parasailing over the coast of Lima.


Good day though, probably will investigate the stuff some more over the coming week. Hopefully to try that BDF combo with the 2ce.

I pushed my second dose of 2C-E from 5 mg to 10 mg on christmas day. My girlfriend did 10 mg too. It was a fun trip but I was surprised it wasn't a little stronger. 5 mg gave me a moderate ++ and so I thought 10 mg would push into +++ territory but it was a strong ++ and maybe a weak +++ during the peak. Someone mentioned the dose response curve doesn't start until you push past 10 mg so I'm going to titrate 2 mg at a time and see how it goes. It was a great trip though, me and my girlfriend had a really fun time, lots of laughter. She noticed some bodyload, felt a little "off", but I was fine. It's really good stuff, can't wait to push these doses!

After trying 2ce numerous times in the past 6 months I think I have somewhat of an understanding to it. tell me if you agree that its definately a very serious/dark psychedelic with no humor, but incredible visuals. 4-aco-dmt on the other hand was very silly, with little to no mindfuck. I recently dosed the same group of friends with 4-aco as I had with the 2ce the past 6 months. And everyone seemed to like the 4-aco more. Just my 2 cents.

**combo**


Honestly 2C-I and 2C-E was one of my favorite combos. Very synergistic especially in the visual department. It was a beautiful match and you could see them distinctively influencing you as well as merging.


Ideal for me was 20mg 2C-E and 40mg of 2C-I. Im a hard head so dont go thinking thats a good idea for most.  Usually a strong +++ for me but I was used to it enough I could function even at low ++++ experiences.

Idk how everybody finds it so dark... I mean its maybe more serious, less playful sure. But not morose. 


I find with another person its quite humorous, it seems it just amplifies the surroundings quite a bit.

I'd like to hear more about low-dose experiences.  16mg seemed like too much for me, with a mindfuck second only to extremely high-dose mescaline.


What's the lowest dose you've taken and what was the trip like at that dose?


Since I still have plenty left, I think I'm going to try around 3-5mg and work up from there.  I think it has a lot of potential but for me 16mg was far too confusing to get anything out of the trip.


On a side note, has anyone combined 2ce and hydroxyzine (Vistaril)?  It's an anxiolytic antihistamine, and I'm hoping it can reduce the bodyload (at least the nausea, as it's known to be a good antiemetic).  At higher doses I'm hoping it might help me take the edge off unpleasant trips.

22yo male, 6'1" 160lb


i've had good results with 50mg diphenhydramine for reducing nausea without clouding the trip too much. fresh-grated ginger/lemon/honey tea is also a wonderful flavor experience that soothes the tummy (pretty much any tea will help; it's partly the teamaking ritual that grounds my body)


oral 2ce seems to have much more nausea than rectal 2ce for me


because of the long duration, i'm a big fan of lower doses (8-10mg oral or 4-5mg rectal) to allow functioning during the day if need be. at these doses the headspace is quite clear and most activities are easy and fun. movies on HBO are great, but commercials on tv are loud and obnoxious. the mild stimulation allows me to perform chores like cleaning or cooking without too much problem, yet i am still able to lay back and enjoy gentle CEVs.


at an even lower dose of ~1-2mg rectal, public activity and conversation are only slightly 'off', and i was able to participate in discussion in a literature class with little problem, just slight mood lift. maybe some attention span modification, but i can't say if it was improved or reduced. thoughts and ideas came easily to mind, but i had some difficulty arranging words in the proper order for sentence formation.


as others have stated, it also appears that bodyload/nausea can be reduced by dividing the dose into two parts (slowing the onset). so maybe try 5mg oral first, then at t+1 another 5-10mg.


edit: the low-dose experiences are alone by myself, at home for the most part, with comfortable things around me (warm shower, cat to pet, tea, etc). my higher-dose experiences (12mg, 15mg) were in a group-dose setting, which can really improve the mood lift if you are able to shoot the shit with your friends instead of silently exploring your own mindfuck. was your 16mg trip alone or with others dosing?


edit again: the best cure for nausea is to have a simple activity to take your mind off your stomach during the come-up. play a card game with friends (UNO is great, keep the rules simple for obvious reasons) or a multi-player video game. in our circle of friends, super smash brothers or mario kart are top choices, followed by dr mario or tetris. seriously, colorful blocks will help you trip ballz!


edit again again: also, if you have a significant other, try to convince them to play in the bedroom with you. 2ce provides amazing tactile stimulation even at the lower doses, and allows me to maintain an erection with multiple orgasms for hours on end. and each orgasm feels like my brain is exploding with fractal colors. if you don't have a SO, try exploring masturbation cuz it's pretty fun too

2c-e reminds me of LSD very much except the fact that it has no euphoria, and other small differences. But IMO very comparable to acid

I find oral 2c-e to have an annoying electric buzzing feel, kind of like a nervous energy that makes it hard to focus and relax(and get comfortable). Possible to ignore when I'm doing something, but on the come down it practically makes me crazy(especially if Im trying to go to sleep). 


Last night, I took some piracetam, phenibut, and snorted a decent amount of 2c-e. After the burning sensation in my nose went away I felt a constant strong euphoria. It was a great experience, getting high made it even more euphoric.

I would say that combination is a winner, particularly the phenibut, but somehow I also feel that snorting it has less of a body load(for me at least).

I just started my trials with 2C-E and started at 5 mg and 10 mg. From what I hear the dose-response curve doesn't go practically vertical until after 10 mg so both doses were somewhat comparable and extremely manageable. 10 mg was a little stronger, but not as much stronger as I expected. Both doses I noticed euphoria, a lot of laughter and noticeable visuals. Everything had a shine or glow to it and the room seemed to ripple in movement. No intense visuals, but both open and closed eye visuals were noticeable. Both 5 and 10 mg were fun museum level doses. I'd say if you are contemplating starting at 3-5 mg and working your way up, you should contemplate starting with at least 5 mg because even 10 mg was a low dose. I have a feeling this stuff starts to get really potent really fast once you push the dose past 15 mg, but between 5-10 mg there was not much difference for me.

also, while everyone is different in metabolism and response, i must say that i personally noticed acute tolerance if trials were closer than one week apart. both visual effects and bodyload were significantly reduced for the same low dose if taken 2-3 days after the previous trial. also set/setting appears to play a big role here, including when during the day you choose to dose.

Well since you guys are on the low end of the spectrum allow me to infer my take on the high end.

tripped 3 times recently on 2C-E

30mg oral- long come up and steady plateau with nice CEVs. very vivid imagery and a little spastic on my muscles the gi and body load were light. The end was fantastic. very introspective and thought evoking throughout as I was talking to many people. THe last few hours I turned on Neurosis- The Eye of Every Storm. The music is perfect for creating some wild imagery in your mind and put me on a wild ride through the inner space of my minds eye.


45mg oral- A little bit heavier body load and notable tolerance but still a very good ride. VIsuals were not the most intense. I went and laid on the couch in the living room with the lights off and just drifted away through time and space. Exploring the outer spheres of consciousness through the minds eye. I often feel like I can project myself into the world (like remote viewing) and I was watching a lot of my friends in distant places enjoy the evening (it was new years) then rocketing into space and drifting into a psychedelic sleep. Dreaming sweet madness in a half conscious yet fully asleep state. A wonderful way to end the evening.


30mg insufflated: Reached the peak of the experience within an hour and it was absolutely stunning. Visuals were intense and it was all I could do to just sit there and be for a few hours. An absolutely stunning experience filled with revelation and introspect Connecting me to deepest concerns and absolute faith in the divine. Only a slight bit of paranoia but a good relaxing experience overall. It was very much what I needed. the visuals and mental pictures painted were dazzling and mindblowing. This is truly where I was looking to go with the substance as it pushed me to the limits of perception without dissolving the ego and allowing me to project myself into the void. A highly thoughtful and deeply symbolic trip that brought me back to the roots of why I trip in the first place. It truly is a tool for the experienced but used properly it can leave you with some unbelievable memories amazing insights into your inner workings and supreme hope that you will learn and grow to become a better person from such an awe inspiring experience.  Not the most intense experience ever by far but still enough to satisfy me to the point I wont need to trip again for at least 5 or 6 months so as to fully integrate the trip. I am just glad I have had all the experiences I have previously otherwise this trip would have been a lot more difficult. Not recommended for the faint of heart. This is one of those rides that can be very hard for the inexperienced to manage properly. The body load was intense but not uncomfortable. GI distress was a little bad towards the end.


Tread carefully people. Hopefully all of your experiences with this compound will be as rewarding as mine have been.

Thanks for the advice, greenmeanies.  My 16mg trip was alone, although I started off smoking weed with a friend.  I've gotten some friends to try 2ci, but they're all pretty wary of 2ce.  Unfortunately I have yet to find a SO that enjoys psychedelics as I do, but I love doing things like taking a shower or going swimming when I'm tripping balls (also taking a shower at the end of a long, sweaty trip feels incredible).


I think this time I'm going to try ~3mg insufflated, simply because I can't afford to be tripping for 12 hours tonight.  Hopefully it won't drastically increase the bodyload.  I've never actually had problems with nausea when taking phenethylamines, except for full spectrum cactus extracts (which may have been more due to the plant material than the chemicals).  My problem has been a certain kind of muscular stimulation, which feels almost like currents of electricity flowing through my muscles and joints.  It's hard to describe the feeling, the best I can come up with is uncomfortable peripheral stimulation.  It's pretty uncomfortable, but I had a long, productive workout today which will hopefully help me deal with any excess energy. 


I prefer tripping in group settings, but it can't always be done.  I also can't in good conscience encourage my friends to try a drug unless I've had a good time on it myself.  Hopefully I'll be able to find my sweet spot.


On a side note, just in case anyone's jumping in at this point, 30mg is an extremely high dose for most people.  I regretted starting as high as 16mg.  Psychicpsycho, I'm a little jealous of your ability to tolerate crazy doses...More power to you, but no first timers should try anything near that much until they're experienced and have worked their way up carefully.

the muscle tension is indeed the most annoying side effect i've noticed of 2c-e. this is why i think it is well-suited for physical activities like sex, working out, and showers. the body high improves immensely when you activate those muscles that are aching to be used. just be sure to have enough water on hand

youll notice ive made sure to slap warning labels on most of my posts. Ive got built in tolerances for nearly everything. and honestly its nothing to be jealous about. Just means I have to use more material to achieve equal effects that most others achieve on less. There are many points where I push well beyond what most people can handle but I have tripped hundreds of times and after years of experience I can handle the intensity (or at least know how to let go and let the trip take me where I need to go).

You will never see me recommending my doses to anyone I  try to make it very clear that I am an abnormality and most peoples minds couldnt handle (or if they could it would be a lot more than they bargained for) what im doing. I just hope that through my writings and experience some people can understand a side of psychedelics that they might not be able to reach or tolerate. Only do what is comfortable to you. Even I have pushed too far and payed dearly for it. Its all about finding what is best for you not how far you can push it. Sooner or later it might push back and when it does it can be truly maddening. With these substances its always best to remember that you are not in control you are just along for the ride.

Yeah, I can understand that.  I'm the same way with LSD, for some reason I have to take at least three times more than my friends to get the same effects, which is why I've become partial to phenethylamines.  I know you weren't recommending it to anyone; I just think those kind of warnings can't be overstated.  Just out of curiosity, do you find yourself more sensitive to tryptamine-based psychedelics, or do you take large doses of those as well?


I'm about to try 3mg insufflated.  I'll let everyone know how it goes...

no im pretty insensitive all around. Usually ill eat 7g+ of shrooms for a decent trip and as far as the RC versions I like them and their intensity but im still taking ludicrous amounts by most standards to achieve the desired high end trips. Honestly it doesnt even end with psychedelics . Im very tolerant to any form of drug even alcohol.  In fact im almost completely immune to painkillers. Which is a major pain in the ass. No matter how much pain im in ive pretty much got no saving grace. Every filling ive got in my head ive had to take raw.


Im sure someone out there would take it as im bragging about my doses or something but rest assured its a double edged sword.

Just to add to this, dropped 2c-e with 15 other people on new years day at about 3am and it was up there in the incredibly fun stakes with acid.


It's lovely when people don't have to go crossing that horrible speech barrier acid places upon you, so I noticed a lot more avid discussion and holding of general thought patterns. As far as getting to the actual point you were trying to make though...


Let's just say ezekial the orange salamandar didn't make it any easier on us.

I want to rectally dose 2c-e but I have no syringe. Would it be a good idea to put my dose in a gel cap, add a small amount of water, then cap and plug?


I tested this without plugging and the water breaks down the gel cap in about 5 - 10min so it should do the same up my ass. I think I'll try it tomorrow. I'm hoping to gain a nice, clean, strong trip. I will report back

when i am rectally dosing 2c-e, my liquid is 10mg/ml so I only need to use 0.5ml of liquid at most. this amount easily absorbs onto a square of toilet paper, which can be folded up, coated in lube, and inserted easily.

I figured since I have all of these gel caps I may as well use them. I guess either or would work. It might be more of a pain in the ass to cap some water than to dab a bit on a paper towel. The only thing is, does the paper towel degrade thoroughly? The gel cap turned to mush in a couple of minutes

it doesn't need to degrade completely, the 2c-e is effectively absorbed assuming you're clean. it's a really tiny saturated parachute

if that was the case wouldnt you expect it from nasal route too? its fairly sensitive up there. but the feeling goes away with no negatives besides a little sniffling.

Why do you think that?  Lots of drugs are administered sublingually.  If it's the free base, it would be caustic, but as a salt it is not corrosive.  I have read a report where mescaline hydrochloride (150 mg) was taken sublingually, and no mouth damage resulted.

i dont think it would cause any serious damage.


But i think you may experience a burning sensation where you are holding it in your mouth.


I only assume this due to reports of how much it burns snorted and occasionally plugged.

because we are hardcore like that charlie duh. no because it is more powerful via alternative methods of administration than it is orally. and no Vine of Sodom it is really tame compared to 2C-T-2. It stung just a little over time and the taste is actually not bad in comparison to T2. Easily manageable. Hardly even feel the need to vomit.

Did 11mg 2c-e (oral) yesterday, and had a really deep and profound experience. This compound never cease to amaze me. A wonderfuld compound if treated right. I can see people getting bad experience from taking this compound, but treat it right, and you're in for quite a ride! 


But 2c-e really wears me out psychically compared to other 2c-x's. Not in a MDMA way, but more like you have to realx and digest the experience.


Already looking forward to another experience!

I've actually felt that burning (faintly, and beneath heaps of nausea) in my stomach from 2C-E; it feels like a general irritant. Even handling it gives me pseuso-burning ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**2-ce**


hey, so i have a capsule of 2ce, im not sure how many mg(maybe 5 or 8?), but its one capsule, its not competely full i dont think, anyways, people i know have snorted one of these and tripped hard, hit em in like 2 minutes, but i was wondering if theres possibilities of like a perma trip or anything, after a friend got stuck in an acid trip ive been a little skeptical about physcadelics, even though i know that RARELY happens, so can someone fill me in on what you know about 2ce? the negative effects and all? and how long does it last if i just snort one? thanks

matt

First thing you should do is find out how much is in that capsule. You dont want to go snorting an unknown amount of 2c-e.


As for getting stuck in a trip. That doesnt happen. Some people go insane after taking psychedelics, but that is not the same as tripping, and is caused by them having pre-existing underlying mental conditions (known or unknown).


Whether that will happen to you, no one knows.


Also snorting the 2c-e will burn your nose extremely from everything ive read, i've only tried it orally.

Orally it lasted around 10 hours for me. Snorting takes it down to about 6 hours.


Again find out what dose you have in the capsule. If its 10-20mg than you would be fine taking that orally.


Also im going to merge this with [The Big & Dandy 2C-E Thread (Second Edition)](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=458571).

Yeah, nobody gets "stuck" in a trip. Long term or high doses of psychedelics can cause HPPD, which is when you experience perceptual effects similar to being under the influence of psychedelics. In most individuals, this only occurs after repeated use (ex: tripping every weekend+ for months) or large (>10x a normal dose) overdoses, and the effects generally go away over time. 


Most people experience it lasting more like 6-8 hours orally. I am able to sleep 7 hours after taking it, being effectively down by 6 hrs, and snorting it should make it somewhat shorter.

Been taking low ~3-5mg morning doses of 2C-E recently mostly as an exercise / weight-training companion.


Highly recommended. 


A little Theobromine and Creatine Ethyl Esther for energy, low doses of Phenibut and Diphenhydramine as recommended here to reduce general Phenethylamine discomfort, add some Whey Protein, and I've been making some pretty good progress.


I find low-dose 2C-E to be a smooth, almost trance-inducing way to ensure lasting motivation during physical exertion. 


About a million times more useful/safe than real stimulants.

liquid just means it's been dissolved in water for accurate measurement. it's a great way to handle substances that are active at the 5-20mg level, especially because filling a hundred little gelcaps one at a time on a scale is extremely boring compared to squirting out a measured dose from a calibrated oral syringe.

What you're doing at the time surely will have the biggest effect on how useful low-dose psychs are. 


BUT.


LSD probably beats out all the competition in positive results from low-dose use. I think Bluelight even has a thread devoted just to low-dose LSD. 


For a couple years, I used to take LSD 2-3 times a week for that purpose back when I was first studying computer programming/AI/physiology/neuroscience, and have dear memories of the benefits I got out of the deal. So that's the #1 substance I'd recommend for the job.


-


The threshold-effect is all about keeping you in control of the bulk of your emotions/actions/thoughts, but to always have that subtle humming of energy potential beneath your perceptions which you can learn to draw from and use to make your activities feel more playful as you find appropriate. I've always found a playful mind to be best suited for learning and creative tasks like writing/programming/engineering.


-


As for your 2C-I question...


Unfortunately, 2C-I and I get along very poorly together, so I can't answer. 2C-E is the only Phenethylamine that I've had positive results from. 


For some reason whenever I take 2C-I, I get a frog in my throat (some kind of inflammation I'm guessing) that's as bad as the quantity of 2C-I I took. 


I used to think it was just a general Phenethylamine intolerance, but since 2C-E has turned out to be so physically benign, this must not be the case. I know Iodine and the thyroid/throat system have a very close relationship, and have also heard of other people who have had strange throat-related problems with Phenethylamines (I'm guessing the Bromine and Iodine analogues).


I have a feeling 2C-P would be even better than 2C-E as a low-dose tool.


Will find out soon, hopefully.

I know someone who's found threshold doses of 2C-I to be useful for energy, motivation, etc.  I guess different drugs work for different people.

It's not unusual to dissolve 2C-X's in water if one doesn't have a scale good enough to measure individual doses (that's what my friends and I do for low-dose research chems). That said, you can't readilly verify how much 2C-E is in it, or even what chemical it is. I'd proceed with great caution, if at all, considering that both you and your friend don't sound very knowledgeable. It's not a drug to be taken lightly.

I bet it has less to do with the psychedelic in question, and more to do with the individual's gag response and whether their body decides to trigger it (with the involuntary intention of expelling the naughty substance) as a means of coping with the experience.


Doesn't serotonin play a significant role in the gut? 


Having to do with the gag/puking response, and the euphoria of post-expulsion. DMT in particular tends to activate such a mechanism (though not really in people like me who've gotten very used to having DMT flowing through their veins ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) ).


Or perhaps whenever a psychedelic user gets that frog-in-the-throat reaction, it's from the serotonin-like structure of the substance they took having an affinity for receptors that incite just the 1st half of the gag/puke response and then just keep "pressing that button" until the chemical's been metabolized? 


So they feel as if they're sort of gagging indefinitely. 


Boy does that not sound pleasant ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)


I'm feeling lucky 2C-E/LSD/DMT have all been physically benign for me. 


Choose your poison, eh?

@LunarSylph

I have yet to try LSD in such low doses, this however did reopen my intrest in using the 2C's in low doses.![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


@Allaround

2CI gave me some energie wich i found difficould to channel in certain tasks, so the extra energie was actually interfering with me, but its certainly true that differend drugs work for differend ppl.

1 gram of phenibut, 1 gram piracetam


**keep the 2c-e dose low**, I tried again with a higher dose and felt like I was going to faint constantly. I'm not sure what the cause was, but I had to stay standing or the fainting feeling would increase. Possibly I was overheating or high blood pressure... I don't know. All I know is for me, the constant feeling of being about to faint is one of the worst especially when it goes on for hours. Coupled with the obvious "paranoia" that I could die it was one of my worst experiences.

<20mg oral, the time I felt faint I took ~25mg. I would start even lower though or maybe its just a personal reaction.. not something I'd want anyone to go through either way.


the fainting feeling would get worse and then better in waves, exactly like how 2c-e's intensity has peaks, leading me to believe it definitely occurred because of too much 2c-e. I wish I knew why phenibut reacted with 2c-e like this, maybe something to do with how it supposedly antagonizes phenethylamine

Well for me immediate consumpsation of food after I take a few certain chems almost always results in me puking my brains out for 30 minutes. I mean the earliest I ever really eat when tripping would be at the 2 hour mark(especially on 2c-e since at 2 hours the coming up portion is ending). I would recommend if you were to eat something soon after dosing it be something small like fruit.

Has anybody gotten the eagles eye vision from 2-CE?I have 3 experiences with this beautiful drug, and one time a color blind friend who wore reading glasses claimed he could see perfectly for the first time in his life. I swear I get what I call "museum vision" from this compound, but not from 2-CI or 2-CC(the sex phenethylamine). Any input?

^ the *mall*?! What a terrible idea. I feel nauseous just thinking about it 8(


Look, 2C-E is a very serious, very intense psychedelic. It is likely that you will be incapable of acting 'normal' around other people, and even if you could, why would you want to? Malls are ugly places, filled with dense, soul-oppressing energies and the stink of human cattle...


The ideal setting for a 2C-E experience is a beautiful skyblue day on a long, winding trail through the forest, with no possibility of other people intruding. This can be difficult to find, but it provides an idea of what to aim for...


Secluded nature is by far the superior setting for 2C-E, imo.

Well, I thought I was getting some 2C-I, but it turns out I will be getting -E instead.  I've used -I fairly extensively and find it a fun, fairly mild psychedelic.  I know -E has a reputation for being more of a 'serious' trip in terms of mindfuck, potential for ego death or other extreme peak experiences, etc. and more neutral/analytic in feel, but does anyone who's tried both have some more specific comparisons?  Given how enjoyable I've found low dose 2C-I to be, I think I will start low (5mg-ish) with -E to get used to its body load and general feel before diving off the deep end.  Eventually, I hope to try the combination of -I and -E, which I hear a lot of good things about.


Given that most people I know who like psychedelics in general and have tried both prefer -E to -I, I'm cautiously optimistic about this unexpected diversion in my experiment.  Time will tell.

Tried 2C-E for the first time yesterday and wow what a ride.  I was stuck home from work for the day and after finishing my tasks decided I wanted to try a small amount.  I tested about 4 mg orally two week ago to ensure no issues with allergies, etc.


Earlier in the day I had taken a 2 mg Klonopin so my recollection of the experience is not all there.


Since I couldn't have a 12 hr trip, I decided to insufflate despite everyone's warning here.  Maybe it is because I have done a ton of coke, but didn't burn all that bad.  I started off with 2 mg and a bit later begin to get some light visuals.  From here i decided to double the dose and at that point started getting serious OEVs and CEVs.


I actually enjoyed the body rush, was like being in a warm womb of pleasure with everything I looked at having fantastic visual patterns.  I then did one last bump of between 3-5 mg which launched me to a +++.  I was laying in my bed surrounded by a pulsating visual and acoustic warmth exploring the world within my head.  After enjoying this for a long while (maybe, no idea about time dilation at this point) I decided to take it to the deepest part of the rabbit hole be bumping 80 mg of Ket.


At this point I felt I was approaching a ++++ when my roommate came home and came in, got all worried about me and threw me into a thought loop.  I have no recollection of this but I apparently reiterated 10+ times that I was fine, they had just disturbed me, etc.  Kinda knocked me out of wack for a bit, but never turned the experience negative.


Still trying to integrate this experience and not sure if I ever fully will be able to.  The Klonopin along with the disruption threw my mental path out of whack in a way it is hard for me to piece it back together in retrospect.


This is definitely a chemical I want to experience again when I have the ability to ensure pristine set and setting.


Edit:  I also never got nauseous but I have a hard stomach with regards to drugs.  I get heartburn like no ones business and puke easily with alcohol but despite taking some strong opiates for surgery have never gotten the slightly bit of a sick feeling in  those scenarios.

I have exactly the same thing with 2C-E myself - stomach feels bit knotted occasionally but it's mostly in the mouth, get a horrible taste in my mouth reminiscent of past times when I've puked within minutes of this feeling...but I never puke with 2C-E (thank fuck).


I find that on about 25-30mg oral dose I got some pretty prominent "alerts" after about half hour, so did my friend who did 35mg.


Hungry ghost - a mall or a place which is crowded on your first time is REALLY a bad idea - waaaay too unpredictable...

This molecule is like LSD, in the sense that you should build yourself up to being comfortable with it, otherwise you could have an unnecessarily bad time on this (trust me I know!).

I got some 2c-e last week, and I'm really liking it so far.  The visuals are very fluid for me.  Looking at some fast moving clouds late at night was very nice.


I also get really heightened music appreciation.  I did some nitrous at the peak of my trip, and I lost my sense of reality, thinking that I was in high school or something (I thought that the people I was with where high school friends, but I didn't know most of these people and none of them went to high school with me), only to come back to reality, thinking "what the fuck, how am I back at this party?" 


I am in love

Eep, horribly bad plan, due to various reasons: 1. You don't know the bodyload, which for some people can be VERY taxing even on low doses, pretty much requiring them to lay down with quiet, relaxing music for first few hours. 2. For any outsider, your moving might resemble that of a person in the depths of an ether binge while simultaneously on meth. At least, I still can't just walk bloody straight unless I really, reaaaaally try even after a dozen trips ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif) 3. I've noticed many people - including myself - to get quite uncomforable with unknown people when on 2C-E. It's not partially social drug except with close friends, in my opinion. Or, my personal favorite, mixing it with cannabis and jwh-018 and alcohol and then partying. Which also put me to a steady ++++ with pretty much zero connection to the real world at times. Was fun, albeit I'm glad no one actually saw me in that state - and, err, definitely not a combo for mall.


Though, I've also found out that in the end, after loads of experiments, 2C-E does become quite controllable, in a way that holds little surprises unlike acid for example. We've chatted with random ex-hippie bums in downton midday head full of 2C-E, but that wasn't the first experience for any of us. Interestingly, almost all of them noticed we were tripping and became chatty, throwing jokes like "Did you know the clouds aren't coming... 'cuz the clouds are already here!"


It does occasionally give me a gentle backslap when used uncautiously, like today when deciding to dose just in order to stay up to fix my sleeping pattern. But, so far, the 2C-E backslaps have been gentle reminders of how important it is to work towards a sincere mind rather than lesser goals.

The vomiting reminds me of the one time of dosing heavy amounts of 2C-E in an awful hangover. Less than surprisingly, vomited - but it didn't feel bad, in fact, it felt quite euphoric.. What was odd though, is how the poop lines in the bottom of toiled morphed around and climbed up the toilet on my body. Eek.

If you live in the US, it's not surprising that B is unavailable; it's been Schedule I for a few years now.  Unfortunately, it is among the rarest compounds to find these days, as it is just as illegal as more popular compounds like LSD and quite similar in effect to the still pseudo-legal 2C-*s.  I've never tried it, but I hear a lot of good things...  A shame.

^ It makes it's way around, just like the other scheduled research chems. (I'm sure it still exists on the internet and in the mail like AMT and T7 do in lesser amounts.)


That being said, I have met tons of people that claim to sell 2C-B and only a few selling 2C-I, 2C-E, etc. My guess is most of them are selling a "legal" 2C-X, especially the ones who didn't even know how many mg were in their doses.

While thats possible, there is plenty of 2c-b going around.  For many people thats probably the one their most likely to run into.

Oh, I'm sure it's still around - scheduling a drug has never been a very good way to eradicate it completely.  However, I also think you're right on the money that many so-called 2c-b doses sold on the black market are probably another 2c sold as -b at a higher price.  That said, I'm sure there are still very healthy distribution channels out there if you know the right people, and I'm sure there are people with consistent -b hookups who don't even know a legit RC vendor.  It's always who you know.

Well, got my hands on some -E finally... Just tripped on -I last night so I think I'm gonna try to wait a couple days before jumping in.  I'm backtracking on my 'try a tiny dose first' idea and tempted to set my first experiment around 12-15mg - that seems like a range that should be potent enough to give me a decent feel for the material while being unlikely to turn out to be way too much.


Any final words of wisdom for a relatively experienced -i head trying -e for the first time?  I'm prepared for the possibility of a more intellectually and/or emotionally overwhelming experience compared to -i, and possibly worse nausea issues although I've never vomited on -i and not everyone seems to have any more trouble with -e on that front, so hopefully not.  Is there anything particular any of you wish you had known before your first -e dose?

Just railed a tiny dot that stuck to the baggie when I dumped the rest into EtOH.  Yeah, yeah, insufflating unknown doses isn't the brightest thing to do, but I wouldn't be surprised if that was less than 2mg and I think I lost some of it sneezing.


On another note, I'm not super experienced with insufflating, but god damn that stuff burns.  I took what I would barely qualify as a bump if it were blow, and a few minutes later I can still feel the burn, although it's much more bearable now.  Definitely a lot less pleasant than coke or the handful of pharmies I've railed.  Given the reports I've heard of insufflation - much lower required dose, stronger peak, shorter comedown, less body load - I can certainly see the appeal, though.  I'll probably stick with oral doses of 2Cs as my preferred ROA, but at some point in the future if I get a really good scale I could see keeping a more significant amount dry for insufflation.


This is probably way more effort than it's worth, but in theory, if I took a solution of 2C-E in everclear and let it evaporate, would it be possible to insufflate the remaining residue?  I'm thinking pour a few mg worth of soln. in a shallow pyrex container, then scrape the residue and chop it in case it forms larger crystals...  Would that work?


If the insufflated dose is not detectable in a couple hours, I may go ahead and try an oral dose later tonight.


edit: 40 minutes later and still at +/-, I decided to take 12mg orally.  That was 10 minutes ago.  Wish me luck ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

unfortunately since you tripped 2c-i last night, you'll probably have a bit of tolerance.


with no tolerance, 12mg oral 2c-e was a perfect first-time introduction. flowing visuals, slight mental stimulation, very little nausea (supplemented with herb)

I've noticed very little tolerance with repeated use of -i.  Having not tried -e before I don't know if I'm muting the headspace of the peak due to tolerance (seems entirely possible that to get the most intense peak I'd need a few days of relative sobriety) but 12mg is already more visually active than 20 of -i, with a similar but distinct body high.  If this early experience with my first dose is at all indicative of my future with this material, I think I just fell in love ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

i actually have no direct experience with 2c-i tolerance, but i definitely noticed a 'muted headspace' from 2c-e if i tried to space the trips too closely. don't get overzealous just because you have a ton of the stuff, it's a very special material ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Oh, definitely.  I plan to take a full week off of all drugs stronger than caffeine and pot to prepare for an intense, higher dose -E experience, possibly after a few more lowish dose experiments.  


So far, I've noticed ZERO bodyload despite dosing literally minutes after eating a burrito.  Even on low dose -I I've felt a little queasy on the come up, but I've had no issues whatsoever with 12mg oral -E.  The visual intensity is picking up, the body high is an interesting stimulation with a unique feeling quite similar to 2C-I (very natural feeling, a much 'cleaner' energy than, say, amphetamine).


So far, the visuals are similar to -I but a bit more forceful.  I think it would take higher doses for reality to start melting in front of me, but color distortions, subtle patterning and wavy/fractal images are pretty common, with vivid CEVs especially to music.

usually it gives me a deep hunger for good food.

Having tried -E only twice now, I have some initial observations:


1. -E feels very much like -I but significantly more potent.  12mg of -E feels much like 20+mg of -I to me.  I haven't been able to put my finger on any unique effect -I provides that -E does not.  The general nature of the visuals seems identical to me.  I don't think I could tell a moderate dose of -I from a light-ish dose of -E if I were given one without knowing which.  

2. Whatever tolerance effect either drug has on its own and/or whatever cross tolerance exists between the two, similar doses on concurrent nights seem to produce similar effects for as long as I've cared to extend the experiment.  Time dilation and some of the weirder peak experiences may be subject to tolerance, and I certainly intend to give -E a proper try with a high dose and 5HT2a receptors that have had a week or two with no chemical bombardment, but the body high and visuals, the altered thought patterns I associate with sub-ego death level tripping, don't seem prone to any tolerance effect whatsoever for me.  I can have a long lasting, enjoyable, thought provoking +3 multiple nights in a row with these compounds.

3. Combining -E and -I doesn't feel particularly different from either on its own.  This is my first experiment with the combination, and I'm currently trying to decide if it's worthwhile to acquire further -I for my future 2C trips or if -E alone will suffice.  I'm not convinced the combination will offer anything -E alone cannot; that said, this combo is the strongest 2C trip I've had so far, although I suspect that's because it's the most -E I've taken (18mg) more so than the 10mg of -I I added to it.

4. Reading about 2Cs convinced me to treat them like mushrooms or acid and fast before and avoid eating during the trip.  I probably wouldn't want to eat while coming up but other than that, 2Cs seem to go just fine with food.  Surprisingly, my oral doses haven't seemed to take much longer if I ate before taking them like acid would - within an hour I'm solidly on the way up even if I just ate a big meal.  YMMV, so please don't be mad at me if you take 2Cs after a nice meal and puke it all up, but in my experience I've often regretted not eating because I'm tripping and can't drive to get food and never once regretted having eaten before or during my trip.

I did 2c-e for the first time Thursday night. 


It was my first psychedelic experience ever and let's just say wow.


I starting insufflating small bump, probably 8mg over an hour. Colors got a little brighter and things were getting slightly wavy, but I wanted a better experience, so I kinda got in junkie mode and railed about 15mg. My nose burned like a mother and immediately there were crazy trails and waves.


I got scared, close to panic cause I was sure I had taken too much and this would be a bad, bad trip, but luckily, I was chatting with a friend online and got ahold of him on the phone and he talked me down.


The first thing that happened was I was looking in the mirror and my face morphed into Buddha and the world became purple and there were sphinxes on either side of me. The Smashing Pumpkins' "Mayonnaise" was on the radio, which was pretty rad. I wish I had let myself really go, but I was still pretty terrified, so I tried to control the trip and come back down to earth. The rest of the night the visuals were just very colorful and bright. I remember trying to look for my phone by the light of the glow above my head.


There was no real introspective quality to it, and the body high sucked in my opinion. I was freezing, and the comedown was pretty physically painful. When I walked, it felt like my bones were rubbing against each other.


I'm going to try again tonight though to see if the trip is better now that I'm not so scared.

I was considering choosing 2c-e as my first psychedelic phen to try out, but now its probably ending up to be 2c-b anyway; I'm not certain though, my biggest concern is the potential physical side effects and harm it can have, the effect itself as its described sounds like something I'm definatly in for; so basically what I'm wondering; any people who accidently took heroic doses, and what was the result, and anyone ever experienced (lasting) side effects?

azgaza: I know at least one fellow BLer who has pushed 2c-e much further than I have, if I remember I'll tell him he should post about it...  I've gone as far as 28mg -E and 10mg -I, both ingested orally with the -I a few hours later, with no significant negative effects, just a little transient nausea on the way up but nothing close to actual vomiting - at worst maybe like the sketchy feeling I might get an hour or two after scarfing down a fast food burger.  At any rate, my own experiences with 2C-E in particular have been extremely positive so far.  I certainly can't guarantee you will have similar results, but based on the only experience I have (my own), I recommend 2C-E to anyone interested in trying a 2C in general.  I was a little apprehensive at first; I tried -I which gives me minor dose-dependent nausea, and read that -E was more 'difficult/neutral' and nauseating.  I found it to be quite the opposite - more euphoric in addition to seeming intellectually 'deeper', and it seems less nauseating than -I although it's a minor side effect for me in both instances.

I dosed 2C-E orally last night. I can't be sure how much because I don't have a scale, but looking at what I have left, I would say it was at least 25mg.


The visuals were nowhere near as intense as when I insufflated it, but it still felt stronger overall somehow.


It took a long time to kick in...about 2 hours before I had full-blown visuals. It was slightly more introspective than with the insufflated dose, but it wasn't the deep therapy tool I have been told it could be. The body high still sucked, and my joints were very painful.


Overall, I just really don't like -E that much, and if I were to do it again, I would probably insufflate it because the visuals were really the amazing part about it to me.


One good thing about the oral dose though was that the come down was easy, and I was able to fall asleep faster.

There has been over 150mg nasal doses been taken with no noticeable side-effects, other than whatever revelations the trip itself held.


[http://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_2CE.shtml](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_2CE.shtml) - the 150-250mg dose.


Erowid also has reports from people who've summarized their experiences with doses as high as 80 orally. In that perspective, 2C-E should be rather safe. I don't remember any of them noting long lasting side-effects either.


However, there are a few adverse effect reports (check the rest from Erowid):


[http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=42793](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=42793)


Few single time uses should be perfectly safe. I also read somewhere of a guy who developed a habit for 2C-E and had 100mg of it daily and when he quit, the "general disconnection from one's digestal tract" -feeling remained with focusing eyes being difficult.


In any case; No known cases of single time damage (and very, very few on habitual usage even) or deaths are reported for 2C-E.


From my own experience, both are good for starting. 2C-E can be more intense and might bear much worse bodyload and more easily triggered paranoia, anxiety and so. However, it is, in my opinion, much closer to "true psychedelia" that does make the general feeling of "tripping" quite familiar. At least it did for me. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

My top doses are the same, first took 25mg orally and 4-5 hours later sniffed 10-20mg (eyeballing.. bad, bad!). And it indeed gets a bit too wild, I got stucked into this loop of eternal déjà vu and couldn't move. One suggestion made was that I in fact fell asleep for a very short moment and immediatelly woke up to a sleep paralysis. Was crazy stuff, in any case, and doesn't teach that much to be honest. Except to keep the heroic doses infrequent.


EDIT: Oh, I definitely recommend 2C-E over 2C-B if you've got the possibility to try out on lower doses; It wasn't my preferred method and I tend to often think that divin' straight into psychedelic can be a lot more rewarding than slowly working one's way up. But it works wonders for those who are worried about the well-being of their mind and body. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

^ I would say the same thing, I have jumped into psychedelics in the same way - teh second time I did 2C-E (my first phen) I snorted 15mg and it had me weeping for my family - worked out alot that night, whilst seeing the most intense visuals.


I like to dive into the deep end with a new substance on my own or with people that I feel pretty much completley comfortable with (or think I am), then the next coupla times I take them I take it down a notch, ya know? Find out the merits of low dosing.


I found low dosing 2C-E to be very sensual - my tactile senses were heightened a nice amount, I was a lot more aware of my reaction to touching things, and I remember wishing that I could have some lengthy sexy sessions, not just fucking though - proper love making. Also noticed the rise in body temperature, which caused me to walk around with few clothes on, always a plus as it was not a uncomfortable temp rise.


Finally low dosing didn't give me "the horn" as such, like 12-15mg insufflated did, which I found cool, as my first 2 doses with 2C-E made me intensely hot N bothered ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I notice a body temperature increase as well - reminds me of a much milder version of the pleasant body warmth I feel on MDMA.  I don't seem to sweat a lot or anything like that - I just feel like I've been active and my muscles are nice and warmed up, more or less.

Mmm! I would have to agree ^ on the likeness to a mild body warmth of MDMA, been so long since I had any but yeah thinking about it I would agree.


I think it would be very good for yoga/meditation too, at this low dose (roughly 4mg dabbed).

Hi guys,


I've never done 2-ce before. I've only done 2-cc and 2-ci as psychedelic.

For 2-ci I only need 15 mg to trip hard. I'm very sensitive for psychedelics and easily get negative thought loops. So I'm a bit affraid of 2-CE.

I'm planning to take a 5mg dose. Would I be feeling anything out of this dose??


Thanks

I have more experience with psychedelics in general and a much higher natural tolerance to 2Cs compared to you, but I've used 2C-I and -E both a fair amount.  I find 2C-E to be similar but *much* more intense at similar doses compared to 2C-I.  Again, I don't get any negative mental effects off 2Cs in general, so I don't know how that aspect would differ, but the visuals and the degree to which my mental processes are altered relative to dose are both much more pronounced.


That being said, 5mg is a small enough dose that it should be a gentle introduction until you have a better sense of how 2C-E affects you.  I think most people who are not super insensitive would certainly feel a 5mg dose, although it may not be intense enough for you to consider it a 'trip' per se.  If you want to try out 2C-E I think 5mg sounds great for a safe starting point.  Depending on how that goes, if you decide you want to try upping the dose, do so in no more than 5mg increments, preferably less unless at least as long as you still have worries about the potential for a bad trip.


You may want to check the PD Index thread for threads relating to new psychedelics users and/or avoiding bad trips.  There are a lot of common techniques and discussion that may help you, whether with 2Cs or just psychedelics in general, with negative thought loops.  Once you're familiar enough with tripping that you can tell you're falling into a negative thought loop, it becomes much easier to break free of them.  Some negative thought loops are just random silly fears or paranoid thoughts but often the ones that are particularly stubborn about going away once I tell myself that have some deeper unconscious meaning.  In those cases, if you can figure out what unpleasant experience or memory, for example, may be involved, and work through any unresolved hangups relating to that, it can turn a bad experience into a very productive one.


BTW, I'm assuming you're talking about oral doses for all of this.  Insufflated, it's no surprised 15mg of -I would be excessive and 5mg of insufflated -E would probably be enough for a proper trip for most first timers.

As mentioned, I find 2C-E to be very neutral and void of any strong emotions. While on say, psilocybin, it may be easy for the anxiety and sporadic thought processes to combine into a negative thought loop, on 2C-E, you'll simply be left dumbfounded at the mesmerizing beauty of what's developing around you, both open and closed eye. Personally, I have a terrible fear of aliens. Stupid as it may be, its about the only thing I'm genuinely afraid of. With that said, while on 2C-E once, I heard a bit in a song that made me think of aliens and I started visualizing them coming to get me. When that happened, I simply relaxed and just changed it into something else.


As others have mentioned, it is a drug that you can manipulate. If you want to be flying a car through space, will it to be and it will be so. Climbing a mountain? Again, just will it to be and it will be so. Many find the drug difficult for this reason, as compared to say, psilocybin, the drug doesn't necessarily carry you through a trip, it simply makes your imagination much, much more vivid, to the point where YOU are in control and YOU can turn things around. Compared to other psychedelics, while tripping on 2C-E, you will retain a sense of "you," and even though there may be periods of time where you don't know what "you" are, where you are, what you're doing, etc., you realize that you are still "you" and thus are in control of your trip. For this reason, the drug is also listed as being "clear minded." You will retain a sense of self, and therefore, can reposition yourself into a good mindset, and continue tripping well.


YMMV, of course.

First time I did 2C-E I tried out 5 mg and definitely got something out of it. A lot more than I expected, but it was in no way intense. It should be a good introductory dose for someone more sensitive to 2C-I, but you'll probably want to titrate the dose up to 8-10 mg next time and then take it slower from there.

Yeah, some aspects of 2Cs (stimulation, much of the body high in general, some basic elements of the visuals like brighter colors) seem remarkably consistent between doses - they definitely scale to some extent with higher doses but there seems to be a diminishing return based on how powerful they can remain at very low doses.  The headspace is the part that scales most obviously, along with the more complex and engaging visuals and the... overtness of both OEVs and CEVs (the visuals you would be unsure to say if you saw or just vividly imagined on low doses will be unambiguously OEVs on higher doses, at least in my experience for the most part).  The length also increases from a few hours to 12+ hours - I had one visually active trip that lasted about 18 hours before I finally decided to sleep - I was still at a lightly visual +2 when I went to bed and fell asleep while exploring the CEVs to music.  That was on over 30mg, though, so don't expect an 18 hour trip on anything in the pihkal range if you have a relatively typical response.

I discovered on my most recent trip that any negative body high tends to be attributed to food, at least for me. I hadn't eaten most of the day but ate on the come up, for a while it was the smoothest trip so far with practically no body load but as I started digesting I got those infamous gut pains and muscle clenches, so my advice is to fast or eat very lightly prior to tripping

I've not had a psychedelic in over a year and am thinking of getting back into it with 2c-e, I think my last trip was actually a fairly high dose of 2c-e.  I was doing them too much briefly before this, for the wrong reasons and wasting the experiences.  2-ce is all I actually have so is partly why I chose it but also the potential depth would be a good opportunity I think.


I'd like to reset my old pysch experiences/habits with something new.  I don't want it to turn into another night of staying awake just trying to watch TV (I tend to keep the TV on as some kind of crutch, being afraid to completely be on my own) and then feeling depressed as daylight breaks at the end of the trip, bringing with it the realisation that the real world does exist and I am back in it.  I'd like to do it early in the evening so there is still some night time to sleep through at the end.  Not during the day or outside (even though I'd like to do that a lot more in the future) as I want to still be alone with just myself with this one.


I want to properly let go and not fight delving into new spaces, I never really intend to fight but it happens anyway. 


I'm just thinking out loud really, rather than asking for advice. I want this year to be a spiritual, insightful year like 2004 was to me. Most of the years since then have been difficult, and not in the good way that challenges are.

Hmm, music tends to send me very nostalgic as I associate certain songs with the times I was listening to them the most.  Being thrown back into the past during a trip could turn it negative right now.


It also might be another distraction from just being alone with myself, I even avoid that for going to sleep.  Maybe I could use the trip to deal with my avoidance of being truely alone.

Well I took some 2c-e the other night, I hadn't been planning to venture into pyschs quite this soon but something about the day said it was the right time.


I may write a trip report on it actually, but in brief, it was a lot more fun than I was expecting.  I was looking to use it to work some things out but it ended up being a lot more recreational than that, probably playing music played a part in that.  It didn't leave me any worse or better off afterwards than I am at the moment but I did really enjoy it. Maybe it decided I needed a break rather than a breaththrough.

My scales probably arn't the most accurate but I weighed several times so say it was between 18mg and 20mg.  I was worried that might be too strong since I have never taken a psych while on tricyclics before but it wasn't at all.

last night I took a very low dose of 2C-E + a very low dose of 2C-I.


- I would hazard a guess at about 3mg -E & 4mg -1 (I licked the residue off the cut open baggies I've had for about 2/3 months) - was nice: odd shifts in sounds, the tv was warping a lil and people seemed to be fatter in parts of their body like faces and stomachs, colours seemed brighter but for once I didnt get any change in colours, the flashing effect of 2C-I was happening which was nice, and I got the increased body temperature of 2C-E mixed with the strange stimulations of 2C-I which made me get chills every now and then...


I got some nice neon blue CEVs too.


Low dosing is strange!! All in all the experience lasted about 4.5 hours, but I had nausea the whole way through ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

I pushed my oral dose up to 40mg the other night.  While I still don't find 2C-E 'difficult' the way I remember some mushroom and, to a lesser extent, acid trips as being psychologically hard to get through (although that may be at least as much because of changes in myself since my earlier psychedelic experiences as it is any difference in the compounds used), it was intense and VERY long lasting.  I dosed around midnight and was still at around a +2 at 8pm the next day when I called it a night and went to sleep.  As with previous higher dose experiences, I vomited once.  I felt much better afterward, although by the later period of the trip my stomach was bothering me again, probably because I didn't plan a very appropriate trip-diet in advance and ate little beyond junk food for the whole 20 hour experience.


I definitely needed a couple intense trips like this to relearn 'the fear' in the context of 2Cs.  I've gone from being tempted to trip every single day I choose not to, to delaying planned trips a couple extra nights because the moment just doesn't feel right.  At any rate, I think I'm done with 2C-E for at least a couple weeks.

Could you please tell me when, during all of this, did you puked? Also, after what milligramage do you get the urge to do as such? I'm asking because I've also puked from 35-37mg of -E with only 2 bottles of beer previously(aprox 30 minutes after i ingested the gelcap) and a friend at 35mg on an empty stomach. Also got the stomach cramps +9 hours in the trip even though I didn't ate anything.

I usually puke around when I start to peak, 2-3 hours in.  Once it took till more like 5 hours.  


Until my last few >30mg doses, I pretty much dosed more and more each time with little interest in lower doses most of the time.  I don't think I'll go much higher than 40 oral anytime soon and may head back down to the 25-30mg range.

I have done 40 mgs of 2C-E also, however, it was at a multi day music festival, and it was my 3rd or 4th day tripping in a row.  I had done acid, MDMA, k, 4-aco-dmt, in different amounts/proportions on the days prior.  


So, i guess i don't have a lot to add about my experience.  But, I can say that I still tripped out, it was a nice trip, and my body was TOTALLY at ease the whole time.  2C-E is an all time favorite.

I said that once, but I came back to it properly equipped with downers. And now I can enjoy it without downers.


Those symptoms are almost assuredely psychosomatic. I've had horrible psychosomatic pain and heart palipations with this drug. Even knowing I was doing it to myself couldn't stop it. But having a few successful and fun experiences by using a downer to keep me anxiety free (the anxiety causes the body pain) has really brought this substance to life for me.


You gotta trust the 2C-E. Once you learn that, the body buzz is awesome, and actually somewhat "controllable."

Hello, this is my first post here and I've been reading quite a bit. 


Would you consider 2C-E to be a good psychedelic for a first timer who has only done marijuana? A small dose would be taken, 10 or 12mg weighed with accurate scale. After researching fairly extensively 2C-E has been chosen because of its availability and alleged ease on the mind. 


Could anyone share their opinions?

2C-E is actually pretty mentally intense and can have a pretty significant body load with lots of nausea. It would be one of the last psychs I would give to a beginner to be honest.


That said, I don't think it's a horrible idea, there are just a lot of other chemicals that are better for a first timer.

I'm not sure how you arrived at the conclusion that it's easy on the mind... though it can be, many people report extreme mental intensity.  I definitely do not recommend it as a first-time psychedelic.  2C-I or 2C-B would be much better.  2C-E is likely to be much too intense for a first time.

I like 2C-E but would not at all recommend it as a psychedelic introduction - it can be quite heavy on the psyche, in a challenging way that is way more easy to appreciate if one has taken mushrooms, 2C-B or even LSD before. Also one can become very conscious of the bodyload. While it doesn't feature an extremely long duration compared to much other stuff around right now, I think it's not optimal compared to 2C-B or mushrooms or 4-HO-MET or something.


Hope it helps out and enjoy your trip whatever it turns out to be

2C-I would probably be the best bet for a beginner, in my opinion.  I've never seen anyone have problems with thought loops, confusion, or anxiety the way 2C-E can sometimes cause.  2C-E can be extremely difficult for even very experienced trippers, so tread carefully.

Exactly, a beginner should NEVER take any RC their first time. Why scare someone from psychedelics, plus RC's are generally considered inferior to LSD and mushrooms by hippies and smart drug users.

Not to get off-topic, but while I agree that mushrooms are superior to any and all synthetics, this is a very silly way to characterize the situation. 


"hippies" and "smart drug users" are often at opposite ends of the spectrum. In fact, all of the most appalling psychedelic abuse I've witnessed has been perpetrated by self-described "hippies".


In any case, 2C-E is (for me) every bit as quality as LSD, in some ways superior (aesthetically), in some ways inferior (emotionally), but in the end neither attains precedence ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

^Agreed. 2C-E is in many ways on par with LSD (particularly in the visual department) or even superior (Color, texture).


It's just that it has rough edges that LSD does not which is why LSD is a much better choice for a beginner.

See, to me psychedelics need everything in the "spectrum" to be a true psychedelic.


Mushrooms and LSD both are intellectual, emotional, spiritual, visual, creative trips.


2c-x and DOx to me are purely for "fun", I know what you mean by more "aesthetic". I even find that while LSD is more trippy, far out ect. I find RC's visuals are pleasing in their own way.


LSD's visuals are harder to fully appreciate cause you're constantly going on a rollercoaster, while on DOx I can fully take in the visuals even though they are extremely intricate and beautiful at times they are also very "static" and don't really go anywhere like LSD.


I've had better trips on DOx whenever I took them not expecting a psychedelic trip. Whenever I take them expecting a psychedelic trip, I always get let down and end up feeling depressed and worthless/stupid during the trip cause I expected something on the lines of LSD/mushies/LSA and all I got was stimulation, creative thoughts, euphoria BUT also a lack of true emotion.


I want to feel alive!

Yea but if you've never tried LSD before then 2c-e might be a bad choice regardless if it has "rougher edges" or not. It's like, 2c-e has visuals that are different but psychedelic doesn't = visual.


Psychedelics go far beyond just sensory experiences, and that's what people report 2c-e and ect. mostly as.


LSD trips can take you far beyond your own mind. That right there is more mind blowing than watching cliche RC-style fractals move on a surface.


Lol, I always liked LSD visuals because instead of feeling "cliche" or "like I've seen this before". It is always like "well this is being created from my mind, there's nothing cliche about this. It's pure creativity".

YMMV. 2C-E is quite unique for me and is nothing like the other 2C-X I have tried (I and C) which I found to be somewhat shallow and uninteresting comparatively. They are fun though for sure. 2C-E on the other hand is less recreational and more "serious". LSD can be both, it's very versatile like that.


Edit: Anyway, I would suggest 4-Aco-DMT for a beginner if you can obtain it. Shorter duration, very little body load and extremely impressive mentally and visually (IME).

That's funny, I've always felt the opposite.  LSD for me is repetitive and dull, and I always need at least 4-5 hits to get any visuals at all.  It might be my brain chemistry, my friends often take similar doses from the same batch and flip out.


2ce, on the other hand, is probably the most intense and unpredictable psychedelic I've tried, except for DMT and mescaline.

Dull?


Damn, you must be getting weak LSD? I would hope at least you're getting a mindfuck, without that the LSD visuals wouldn't be that interesting because part of the LSD sensory experience is synethsia.


Higher doses produce such profound synethesia, no other drug can do this except RC's but they aren't true psychedelics.


Mushies and mescaline synethsia is nowhere near LSD's.

^ getting REALLY offtopic.


I found 2C-E to be pretty consistent in what you get off it - 


Insight, mad ass visuals, raised body temperature and with higher/insufflated doses - orgasmlike energy surges.

^^^


That general description sounds about right.  I, too, am surprised at just how consistent the intensity of effects from a given dose of either 2C-E or -I feels to me; with most psychedelics, while there's a clear general trend of higher dose leading to more subjective intensity, the intensity of any given trip is much harder for me to predict with, say, mushrooms or acid, and the intensity of the various effects is much more unpredictable and varying even once the peak has set in - I'll go from "I wonder if that was even acid, what a weak dose" to talking nonsense and seeing crazy OEVs over and over again on some trips.  With 2C-E, it feels more like most other drugs - it has a clear chronology and I have a good sense of what any specific dose will be like, tolerance and other complications aside.  


After my 30mg insufflated dose experience, which was wonderful after the horrific first hour or so, I don't think I'll ever snort the stuff again.  Nothing I've ever put up my nose and few things I've experienced at all can compare to the pain of railing 2C-E.  I can't help but think it must be doing _some_ kind of damage or general nastiness if it hurts that bad.  It's nothing like snorting a poorly chopped line and having physical irritation - it feels more like a chemical burn, awful piercing pain.  I spent the first hour or so sneezing, blowing my nose and desperately trying to numb the pain (I've never wanted blow so much in my life, just for the numbing effect).  Then, I vomited, forcefully and repeatedly, for a good 10 minutes.  After that nightmare, I had a lovely, intense trip...  But it wasn't worth it, given that I could have had none of it but the nausea and probably less of that by simply eating/drinking enough of it.

Weee getting a good amount of 2c-e, 2c-d, and 2c-t-2 tomorrow. I am most excited about 2c-e since I know 2c-d is mild and probably more similar to 2c-c and we'll see about t-2. 


So I have had absolutely insane IM injected 2c-c trips with insane visuals and effects that you don't normall hear about with 2c-c (I injected 40mg over the course of several hours the other day). Now with 2c-e I definitely want to start with an oral dose. Would 15mg be a good starting point for me? What have been people's experiences IMing it?

i've only got experience with oral and rectal 2c-e, but 15mg sounds like a good starter dose. you might be disappointed, but it's pretty impossible to boost an oral dose of 2c (by the time you realize you're not where you want, it's been three hours and any boosters will take another 3 hours to kick in)


personally i'm at a milder phase of my life, so haven't gone beyond 15mg oral. since you seem to be looking for super-powerful times, i might suggest 18mg oral. the come-up is a little uncomfortable (stimulating and cold-feeling) but i definitely like the mental clarity and body high once they develop fully. sounds like you plan on being a case study in the cross-tolerance of these 2c's in the coming months... good luck ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

that's not true about the booster taking "another 3 hours"(?!?!) to kick in -


I took a dose of 2C-E at 25-30mg and was feeling it start to kick in properly after about 30 mins.


Also, if you do realize the dose isn't going to be a mental one as you've almost hit your peak, any booster you do take won't take the same amount of time to kick in as you already have the substance in your system and your tolerance won't be there yet.


I would agree though that 15mg would be a good starting dose - my first dose with the chemical was 8mg insufflated - wild times.

I'd say 15mg is a medium dose, if you are experienced with phenethylamines. You could take 15mg rectal or 20-25mg oral and that will surely get you going pretty hard. IM-ing more than 10mg is a bad ideea, the onset will be too great (for me, at least), but you could IM 10mg and then another 5. or 5 with 10, but it's risky.

I just had my second experience with 2c-e on Sunday (Spunday) and I noticed a couple things I found very interesting.


First of all, during the come up I kept feeling like I was going to puke which is pretty normal. I felt like this for about an hour but then I sat down and instantly felt a thousand times better. It was like I was covered by some warming blanket that cures all ailments. I continued to feel this warmth for at least two hours but then, as soon as my friend lit a cigarette I had a yak attack. It was really odd and made my never want another cigarette ever again.


Secondly, my first experience was with 20mg oral and during the entire duration of the trip I felt neither "good" nor "bad." My second time around I tried 15mg because I felt the smaller dose would allow me to be more mobile, which I needed to be as I planned to spend my entire trip in the woods. This was a great idea. I felt not only like I wanted to adventure but at random times during the trip i would feel an intense euphoria similar to taking a decent bump of molly.


Has anybody else noticed this kind of euphoria at such a small dose?


Oh yeah, one more thing. During the trip I felt as if I had an almost super-human sense of smell....and I still do.

Yes, 2c-e is stimulant even at low-doses. I took 5-7mg once to test the batch, because I didn't trust the vendor then, and even though I didn't have any visuals (few, actually, I did), the stimulant phase kicked-in and I felt the urge to sit on two legs and start moving.


At 20-22mg, oral, gelcap, I tried to see if I could sleep on the onset(yeah, I know.., but I was a little tired) and instantly, at  t+01:00, I felt very stimulated and started running and dancing around the room.


At 6-9mg IM the same.


Only at 25+mg oral the rush and onset is big and the stimulant part is less obvious.

I also noticed enhanced sense of smell on 2c-e. at first it almost made me want to puke, but i learned how to embrace it and enjoy the scents.


as for cigarettes, i know some people who can't get enough cigs normally, and when tripping they just burn a whole pack. i don't enjoy cigs that much (unless drunk), and stay away while tripping. they can be very pretty to watch though, and they last longer when you don't smoke them ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

2C-E is one of my favorite psychedelics along with mushrooms, 4-pro-dipt and lsd. I agree that it is not very recreational at doses above 12 mg, but for me that is solely because of the bodyload. My legs especially are tense to the point of pain, and generally I can't get comfortable. This is especially later on in the trip.

At smaller doses, I find 2c-e CAN be recreational, it makes alot of my thoughts very humorous and I get mad laughs off it, and I don't feel the overstimulation like with bigger doses. I usually take either 2-3 mg snorted or 5-6 mg oral for a nice buzz, mild stimulation, lovely color saturation along with unusual trails of thought, in a comfortable tempo.


Anyone got ideas for reducing the uncomfortable overstimulation with higher doses?

I've tried diphenhydramine, which helped a bit, but not enough.

I have no idea about reducing the uncomfortable stimulation on higher doses, as I've always enjoyed the stimulation to the max - first time I did it I thought it was the best drug ever - designer drug - insane visuals, intense body feelings, and the horny effect...


I think it's like marmite - you either love the "over"stimulation or you hate it.

^^

Although it is a lil painful the resulting trip is sooo great, its worth 20 mins of pain. I say this because I've had nothing but lacking experiences with oral ROA. For example I've dosed 50 mg's 4 different times, and have found 15 mg's snorted to be more intense the my oral experiments.

Yeah..but it hurts ridiculously bad. when i snorted, it burned a tiny bit like speed (right after snorting.) and i thought, "shit, this isnt bad at all". Within 10 seconds of that, my nose was on fucking fire. and the drip BURNS.

hmm...it's not that bad - I find it better if you just dab it from your cd case/wrap/baggie up your nose into the upper part of your septum...not sniffing it - otherwise it's quite easy to get an instant dripp with such a small amount of powder(what happened the second time I did it)..which is not the idea at all

As I was coming down off a few bowls of JWH-018 last night I impulsively dosed 16mg 2C-E, expecting nothing more than a gentle introduction to a new psychedelic.


Instead what I got was the most profoundly shocking, beautiful and humbling experience in my life. At the peak I wept from the sheer intensity of it all. I am still in a state of utter amazement and wonder as I write this.


2C-E means serious business. This is every bit as good as acid and DMT, no joke.

I hear you on this - had EXACTLY the same reaction on my second dose after I got past the sexual side of the trip, was literally weeping because of how much it showed me, gave me the equal of what 3 months of therapy had given me, in the space of about 3 hours.

Hello fellow BL's.

I had a question if there was an easy way to potentiate a 2ce trip? I have much experience with 2ce (~60+ trips ranging from 10-50mg oral + various insufflated from 10-20 mg). I'm not sure as to the reason but when taken oraly I seem to need a lot more material. I.e. I was able to get further with 15mg snorted then 50mg oral. It just seems like a waste of material to be dosing this high. So again, my question, is there some way I could potentiate these oral doses as to not need as much material?

Rectal administration seems to be the way to go (provided you can get over the social stigmas of doing so).


PROS:

40-50% of material needed for same effect

Lessened stomach/nausea discomfort

Faster/immediate come-up


CONS:

Slightly shorter duration

Faster/immediate come-up

....sticking a syringe up your bum (mild discomfort lasting ~15 minutes)

took 25mg dose a couple weeks ago. Some pretty powerful stuff I gotta say. I know my trips are gettin good and heavy when im sitting there and start seeing aztec shapes crawl up textured surfaces. Lost my ego for 3 hours or so (not quite ego death). Didn't know that it had the same capabilities of LSD. Awesome stuff all around

Haha, I know what ya mean.  I have no conscious objections to the idea of rectal administration, but whether it's social conditioning on an unconscious level and/or just my biology, the very thought of sticking anything up there seems so physically unpleasant I can't imagine doing it willingly anytime soon.  It's kind of like vividly imagining a stubbed toe or other sharp pain - it almost hurts just to think about.  It's a bummer (pun intended ; ), since it seems to be a very effective ROA for many drugs.

Hmm..I still have yet to try rectal dosing..very intrigued by it.


Think I might try it with the 2C-I, not sure I'd start off with 2C-E - it's really intense, wouldn't wanna overdo it hahaha....although it is the more sexual of the 2 from the experiences I have had so far. However, never having been in a actual sexual situation, I wouldn't know.

Also, after attempting insufflation of several 2c-x's, I can't help but think its going to feel pretty much like that no matter what membrane its coming into contact with.... eek!  And some people do mention a burning sensation after dosing rectally.... I really don't want to start a trip with a burning sensation in my ass.

I can't imagine any reason to go over 20mg...my first experience was with 16mg oral and even that felt like too much.

I would like to try over 20mg, someday...I've done 2 doses with this chemical - one was 20-25mg and the other was low, like 4 mg, which surprisingly still had some of the effects I love like the strobing, and the chills and rush sorta things

I've not plugged 2c-e, but I've had 2C-B/C/D/I and none of them burned when taking rectally, you don't need more than a couple ml of water really.

Heh not yet. IV 2c-c duration for a high dose was 1.5 hours maybe 2 then after 2.5-3 it is over. My 15mg oral 2c-e trip lasted a solid 12 hours of hard tripping. It was a little much for me, the only reason I would inject it is to shorten the duration to 3-4 hours if that would work and maybe IM 3-4mg. I would try snorting it but I keep reading it is painful however the shorter duration and lower dose is preferable for me. I got burnt out after 7-8 hours of solid tripping and it was not letting down when I smoked a bunch of JWH-018 (which was a great combo) and got rid of my negative side effects and let me pass out an hour or so later. I would wake up every hour or two and as soon as I opened my eyes more visuals and tripping. It was only like 16 hours later when the visuals subsided enough to not be too distracting and I could get up.

16 hours is a long time to still be having visuals with 15 mg. Erowid's range is 6 - 10 hours, then after effects.  For me, IMing reduces the time of "solid tripping" by 30 or 40 percent (to around 5 hours), however, Captain.Heroin strangely reported that IMing half my dose lasted around the same time as oral for him (I think he said 8 hours).  If you try it be warned that the first half hour of onset is pretty harrowing in terms of stimulation.  Be able to lie down.

...and prior "professional cleaning" of colon is recommended.


with 2c-i in a 20%ethanol-solution it is uncomfortable for just a few minutes. comeup starts nearly immediately and is shorter. all in all effects are better too imo.


will try plugging 2c-e soon. does anyone have experience regarding dose? is it like 50% oral?(I think of 6.5mg rect. for my first encounter with 2c-e...)

gonna go for the 6.5mg plugged this night. it's pretty late where I am but I feel fresh. slight muscle soreness from mountainbiking today - but that ride had a lot of life in it and I'm in kind of an afterglow. :D


took 500mg of paracetamol and had some poppy tea (more available) to fight body load.*


I'm alone, have no sitter and not enough benzos to knock myself out so I'm just preparing myself for a serious/maybe rough experience. (thank you bluelight for being alway there! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) )


* and some N2o to get things started.

Have fun with that, kreisler!  I find a combination of paracetamol (tylenol) and ibuprofen (advil) works pretty well as far as OTCs go for soreness/etc. on 2Cs.  Well, that and lots of cannabis ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

when i dose 2ce i usually eat a vitamin C around time 0, as well as some ginger if i can (to combat free radicals and nausea, respectively)


i do try to stay hydrated throughout the trip

and end up taking some ibuprofen the next morning for my headache.  it does little to nothing.  maybe i need to take it during the comedown?

wow. this is barely a ++ and I've been working for 4 hours now to finally get some peace out of this material. a little bit of beer, energetic music and especially yoga in combination(!) with n2o make this really enjoyable right now.

n2o feels like inhaling pure spiritual energy (not exhaling this btw ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) ).

did this 3 times. don't feel any "hippie-crack attitude". comforting.

I tried 2c-e for the first time a few days ago. It was with 14 mg orally. I found it very malleable. I could bring on visuals when i wanted, close my eyes and drift a bit, or snap into a state of relative sobriety. I'm now excited to try it in higher doses.

I'm interested in the auditory hallucinations experienced using this phenethylamine. I've had an weird and freaky experience on a high dose(~40mg, oral), when I started hearing a voice in my ear yelling at a high frequency. It was mine. I was laughing evilly, cursing myself and others I hold dear and yelling horrible stuff. Has anyone else experienced such things?

this has probably been asked before but im curious about what small doses of 2c-e feel like.  ive heard 2c-i can be enjoyable in small doses (if your just looking for a buzz), does 2c-e hold  the same qualities?

Well, I find that small doses of 2C-E are quite enjoyable, especially rectally (I find rectal absorption to decrease bodyload and increase pleasant feelings, personally, especially for phenethylamines).  But when I was inexperienced, I took a small dose of 2C-E and it was pretty rough.  But then again, it was 12mg, which was not really too small (and it was an oral dose).  And it was in a hotel room by myself during a week in Dallas for training for my job and I was lonely.  So... yeah. :D


I miss 2C-E... I'd like to find some again.

ah, thanks xorkoth.  unfortunetly my retarded inhibitions will probably keep me from rectally administering.  dunno though, maybe ill try it.


im inexperienced with 2C-E but very experienced with shrooms, lsd and dmt, so im sure im not too worried about the experience.

i've also been interested in small doses of 2ce, like 6 or 8 mg to enhance the day.  the smallest dose i've ever taken was 12 mg though.  it feels pretty similar to 20 mg IMO, just less intense.  i've taken 12-20 mg and really to me it seems that the trip i get is only HALF due to the actual amount i take.

Well I just had my first 2c-e trip the other day, I think about 15 mg. Very pretty OEVs. My body felt heavy, but standing up and moving around was actually easier than normal, so that's kinda weird. I did get nausea at the one hour mark and puked. After purging, though, I immediately felt better. Overall, it wasn't an entirely pleasant or unpleasant experience. There were a few moments when it tried to turn bad. This is a drug that definitely doesn't care about my feelings, lol.

I'm looking forward to trying new psychedelics especially after my first trip on 2C-E this past Friday. I should have only taken 10mg, but my buddy convinced me to take 20mg because he didn't think 10mg was enough from this batch. Turns out he was wrong. I was thrown into a 10 hour pixalated journey, it was beautiful. Acid is still better in my opinion, but I lost complete control of myself after dosing the 2C-E. Nothing mattered whatsoever to me, it was great . Next time I will try a lower dosage because I was completely out if due to the body load the entire next day. I thought I would die before I ran across any kind of RC.

4-5mg is quite nice...not **much** visually  except for peripheral vision changes and shimmering edges and colour intensification...maybe a few neon trails popping up every now & then...the real magic is the body feeling in my opinion at such low doses.


I too would be interested to push it up just a little though - 8mg oral next time most prob.

**Wondering about 2C-E..**


Hello. I was wondering about the research chemical 2C-E.  I am pretty sure that it is legal in the United States. Can someone confirm this?

Also, how does this chemical compare with other psychedelics?

What is a good first time dose?

Is it a good idea to put the desired amount in capsules and take them orally?

No, its technically not legal because of the analouge act. I find 2c-e to be similar to LSD in certain aspects and not like anything else in others. A good first dose would be 15 mgs or maybe a couple less if your not that experienced with psyches. Yes I would put it in a capsule and orally consume it. Last but not least this should be in PD and you should head over there and check out the Big and Dandy 2c-e thread for a wealth of information.

It's illegal if intended for human consumption, due to the analog act, but it is not in and of itself illegal. Just like all the other 2C's except 2C-B and 2C-T-7, both of which are explicitly scheduled. 


I would start with a 5mg dose to test the waters (it's definitely active at that level), though the dose that most people go for is around 15-20mg for a full experience. 


Most people prepare liquid solutions, to improve accuracy of dosing (like, measure 100mg into 100ml of water (or better, vodka or diluted vodka, to prevent anything from growing in it) and dosing by volume, based on 1ml = 1mg). Phens are quite stable in solution.

This should go in Psychedelic Drugs.


I like 2C-E, it's a lot different to the other psychedelics I have used... I experienced fantastic open eye hallucinations, but the experience was not as... emotional as other trips. I felt somewhat detached from it, as in I wouldn't be carried away with it overboard.

I would describe 2C-E as a mix between the hallucinogenic properties of LSD, allthough the visuals are subtly different, and the empathy off MDMA, not quite the "love" of MDMA, but i certainly feel like opening up to people and talking when on 2C-E... 


a good starting dose would be 10mg IM, 15mg intranasally or 20mg orally for a reasonably heavy trip... but thats how i like my trips, you know, get the full 2C-Experience...


2C-E is my DOC... can't wait for my next escapade.. combined with 4-FMP, should be interesting

I am a huge fan of 2c-e, and highly recommend it to anyone who likes that sort of thing. Just be as careful as possible when measuring your dose.


However, Other Drugs is not the place to discuss psychedelic drugs - we have a forum titled Psychedelic Drugs. I am conflicted about what I should do with this thread, so I'm going to move this with an attached apology to the PD mods if it should have just been closed.

Its a nice substance for sure. Very colourfu and visual. Can be pretty deep as well. Fairly easy riding despite a bit of stomach cramping, however people react very differently to this stuff. Its been described to be as emotionally stable, thoug hI found it to be kind of acid'esque (if thats a word) in terms of emotions.

A misfire on the dose and it would definately put you off tripping for a long time. One of my favorite chemicals though or was aha ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) i got my eyes more in the mesc direction now, more difficult to be greedy or foolish and take a tad too much.

Although I don't have a huge amount of experience, I would describe 2C-E as "malleable" emotionally. It will tend to be neutral, but it will respond to your thoughts and moods as well. But where it really shines is in combinations. 2C-E with cannabis is freaking miraculous.

i love the 2c-e.  I'd recommend 10~12mg for a starter dose, after you've dosed lower to check for safety of course.  Its not explicitly illegal, but a likely analogue of 2c-b and/or 2c-t-7.  That's federal law however, many states do not have analogue laws, though some do.

I tried 2CE for the first time last night. snorted approx 15mg. felt like it was burning my nostrils for about 10 minutes, but that passed and it started to kick in. Not much for visuals. At first I just felt strange, didn't really want to be around my friends and went and hid in the closet.


After about an hour or so I calmed down and then started to feel like an COMPLETE PRICK. I'm really laid-back and easy to get along with normally, whether I'm sober or on E or even coke. But the 2CE brought out a side of myself I've never seen before. Think of a stereotypical drunk asshole who wants to get in a fight, and then fuck something, with who it doesn't really matter. That was me on 2CE. I wasn't mad though. I was enjoying every second of being an asshole like I've never enjoyed anything else in the world. I fucking loved it. I have no idea why it had this effect on me, and none of my friends that did it with me felt anything similar.


As much as I enjoyed it, I'm not sure that 2CE is a good drug for me. I don't like to lose control and it made me feel dangerously self-destructive. Not to mention that if I keep doing it I think I will eventually make all my friends hate me.


I'll try it again for sure, but if it has the same effect again I don't think I will do it any more, the consequences just aren't worth it.

Well snorting 15 mgs is equivalent to eating 30 which with properly potent 2c-e is a large dose. Try eating it next time and using a lower dose instead. You shouldn't really do such a large dose for your first go at a substance. Also snorting it wouldn't be the kindest way to be introduced to 2c-e considering you go from 0 to 60 in a few minutes instead of gradually over a couple hours.

Rake, I think what may have happened to you, as Help said, is that you took too much. I'm guessing that this massive dose triggered an adrenaline release because you couldn't properly cope. This adrenaline would then cause fight-or-flight behaviours, such as hiding in a closet or acting like an asshole.

^ word.


my friend (who is a lightweight girl, affected strongly by any and all psychoactive substances) took 17-18mg 2c-e orally. after the come-up, she became nonresponsive to external stimuli. her eyes were open but drowsy-looking, and her facial expressions indicated wonder, amazement, and happiness, but she could not speak or really acknowledge the presence of other people in the room. when she finally snapped out of it a few hours later, she said she was immersed in a fantastical world and couldn't recall very much of her visions.


2c-e is very powerful, and often less is more if you want to get something useful out of it.

I've seen a similar thing happen with LSD. One of my friends went into a basically catatonic state and was completely non-responsive. Happened twice actually. He didn't seem to have enjoyed it and doesn't seem to handle LSD very well. It's a little weird and kinda scary. You couldn't tell what was going on with him mentally at all.

I've done mushrooms a few times but other than that, not really. I've never had any other 2C-x or even acid.


To be honest I don't have any real interest in psychedelics. I don't have any desire to do mushrooms again. I will probably try acid eventually just to say I did it. But they just don't appeal to me like stimulants do. I pretty much only take drugs at raves, and then it's either E or coke. I don't even smoke weed. 2C-E was interesting to me as a stimulant, not a psychedelic.


Did I overdo it my first time? Maybe, but it was a hell of a ride and I loved every minute of it.


If I don't do it again, it won't be because I won't enjoy it, it will be because my friends won't enjoy my trip nearly as much as I do.

Sounds like you just overdid it to me, Rake. Psyches don't really work like many other drugs - more isn't always better or even desirable - you need to find your own personal sweet-spot with each and every one. If you're looking for a stim-type psyche that's easy on the head and good for raves then 2C-I may be more what you are looking for... but as you noted, psyches have their charms too ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

this past friday night i mixed 15 mg of 2C-E with 3 cc of water and drank it, after about an hour or twoi started to get a weird body feeling and i started to see a few lights in the sky that kept moving in circles. it did give me a bit of nausea though. about 30 mins later the visuals started to get a lot more active and i got the feeling of a strong and speedy yet dirty ecstacy roll. thats also about when it peaked but the peak didnt last as long as i wished it would. the visuals were about as intense as three hits of lucy that we normally get but there was no where near as much of a head-fuck as lucy and my head=space was much clearer. the 2C-E did fuck with my internal body temperature so parts of me were hot and some were cold. once i leveled out, the effects started to wear off rather quickly. overall it was a good trip but short. i took it around 6 or 7 pm and by 11pm, it was pretty much gone with only slight residuals.


this is kinda hard to explain but i do have to say that during the experience, i could really feel the chemical-ness runnin in my body

Anarchist, in case you haven't, you should really try smoking some cannabis during, or shortly after, the peak. That really makes the visual effects explode.

![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) wow that is an INCREDIBLY short experience with 2C-E!!! The shortest experience I've had when I did a proper dose of this was 7-8 hours, and that was insufflated.


Not tried smoking up with any of the psychs apart from mushrooms yet...I'm sure I'm missing out on a great deal of fun...next time ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

That is extraordinarily short for 2C-E. It's a solid 12 hours or so for me baseline to baseline. Definitely something amiss at only 4-5 hours. You positive it was 2C-E, Anarchist?

after tripping on 2ce ten or so times, i feel like the duration of the experience has shortened.  i'd say it lasted maybe 10 hours max at first.  now it's more like 7 or 8, with a hard time going to sleep

^I've done it around 30 times and with this chemical duration really seems to depend on the dosage for me. With 15-20 mgs it lasts around 8 hours and with 25-30 mgs it lasts around 10-12 hours.

Yeah I would agree on the duration changing...


I've also read reports by some people doing like 50mg and not reaching baseline again til T+24, so yeah, it definitely seems a pretty mad chemical. 


We should see if we can plot a dose-duration graph or something! (or am I just getting too nerdy now? ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif))

10-12 hours for me at any dose I've had. But it does kinda depend on that perennial issue: when does the trip end and the afterglow begin?

Nope, actually, the psychedelic use survey that's been the community project for a couple of years now will be able to accomplish this and much more.  The survey is live and reading this post reminded me that I left out an important part of the survey, which is the duration of various parts of the effects.  Then I'll be able to use the dose that is one of the other answers and graph it with the duration.


You should go to the thread stickied to the top of the forum and follow the link to the survey and take it for as many substances as you can, including 2C-E.  This will help get the project moving.  We only have 13 responses so far and we need hundreds if not thousands to really be able to get meaningful results.  So please, everyone, do this!  Nothing of this magnitude has ever been done before to my knowledge and you can help PD be the first to generate this kind of information! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**very big dose needed**


Me and a friend decided to take some 2-ce yesterday. Both took 20mgs.

I was tripping pretty hard but my friend didn't. He ended up taking 70mgs of 2-ce

After that he only had a very mild trip..


How can that be possible?

Some people just have really high natural tolerances to psychedelics. This happened when I gave my friend about 30mg 2C-I to try when me & him bought some - I did 25mg and had a really great trip - he didn't think it was that spectacular at all.

Also, do you know if he takes any medications?  Many antidepressants, namely SSRIs, are well-known for dramatically reducing the effectiveness of serotonergic drugs like psychedelics.  If he's on any antipsychotics, then it's a wonder he even had a light trip because they pretty much completely block psychedelics... they give them to people who need to come down because they're in danger.


Given the tremendously high dose, my guess is your friend is on some sort of medication.  But it's true that some people have a very high natural tolerance.  Or he could have had another similar psychedelic recently, or a lot of them recently.  But I think the medication is the most likely... that is a LOT of 2C-E.

I know of someone who also took around 70mg of (not messed about with) 2C-E and only had a moderate trip. After asking him about  it afterwards turns out he was on an SSRI and hadn't thought to mention it. Sounds like something similar went on here to me too.

Thanks for the response...

My friend is not on any medication, he only took 100mgs of oxazepam that day, and we both smoked some crack cocaine before the trip. For me that caused some paranoia during the trip. So I think it's really strange that 2-CE effects him so little, while a couple of weeks ago he tripped hard on 30mg of 2-CI. Maybe he's just not sensitive to 2-CE. Also for other drugs like MDMA,  he needs a much higher dose (250mg) to feel full effects. In a couple of weeks we wil give 2-c-t-7 a try. Maybe T7 does te trick for him... sorry for my bad english, I'm from the Netherlands....

I recently came in to contact with this substance. My first experience was actually quite awful. I ingested 10mg orally and only had mild, bland visuals with a complete lack of color. And the experience was rough due to severe stomach pain. I just felt very repulsed by how my body felt during the ordeal.


On my second trial, I took another 10mg but this time insufflated it. Wow! I cannot even describe in words how incredible this chemical made me feel. Amazing OEV and CEV's with a very euphoric body high. By far the best aspect of 2c-e for me was listening to music as every sound became rich and vibrant. I also feel that 2c-e has great therapeutic potential given the fact that my mind didn't feel muddled like with other psychs. The only regret I had with this experience was that I didn't have any cannabis to blaze during the peak.


Overall, I have to say I am very impressed and look forward to future trials.

2C-E is actually the only psychedelic I've tried that doesn't give me the urge to blaze - I feel like adding anything on top would sully it, so to speak, it's such serious intense stuff.

How is the stimulation on 2C-E? I'll be trying it for the first time within the next day or so and I'll be tripping  at home where there isnt alot to do. I plan on taking 15-20mg towards the late evening (10-11pm) while just surfing the web, playing the guitar or maybe floating around in the pool. 


I bring it up because I have quite a bit of experience with 2C-I and find it to be a tad overly stimulating. I'd rather not take 2C-I at home anymore because I get very bored and cant relax. 


Also how does the nausea compare to that of mescaline or mushrooms?

i've had several trips in which i was just lounging around browsing the net, and kickin' back without becoming bored or restless. 20-30 mg doses, no problem. i like watching some music dvd's like A Perfect Circle's aMOTION, or just whatever..... but i never felt bored. you should really enjoy it. 

also i sometimes get a little queasy around 30 mgs, but haven't thrown up yet, however my wife took 15-17mgs and was puking within 40 minutes. an empty stomach would probably be advisable.

have a good experience bro.... it's one of my favorites....

^^In my opinion 2C-E is great for a tripping at home. 


I've had trips on 2C-E where I have justed lounged and listen to records and doing whatever. It's great in that way and not at all like 2C-I, where i've had similar experiences like you and easily got over stimulated and bored.

There's no known lethal overdose level for 2Cs,  30mg is definitely quite a high dose for 2C-E but you'll be fine tomorrow, so hang on tight and try to enjoy yourself for the time being ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


edit: when I feel a little overwhelmed by 2CE especially in terms of nausea/bodyload, I find it very helpful to have something to watch or listen to that is familiar and enjoyable to distract myself.  It's easy to get stuck in a bit of a 'feeling loop' almost where you let the unpleasant symptoms take over your trip, but all it takes is one thing that works to pull you out of it and then you can enjoy trippin' balls ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

oh thank god yea my mind is all good like im enjoying the trip but just the thought of an overdose actually happening to me was disturbing for a second and kind of had me super worried as you can imagine but now that i heard from someone that its not going to happen that eases everything...an yea the puking sucks but it actually hasnt taken away from the trip a whole lot. an to be honest for actually thinking i was going to overdose i was not as freaked out as i should have been which isnt a bad thing i guess. but holy shit thats as about as intense as it gets...i just kinda want it to be over now and i think i might go to sleep now that i kno ill wake up

Yeah, someone has taken I think 100mg or maybe it was 200 or 250mg of this (and of 2C-I also, a different person) and they were fine, but it lasted a long time.  30mg is a lot, and not a great idea to do for the first time with a compound, but you will be just fine. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  It'll just be intense.  It'll probably end up being perfect though. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

^Wow that dosage would really be unbearable imo. I find the come up to be quite a bit more difficult than 2c-i or mescaline but the trip itself is so much more calm.

it was fine i just rode it out, once i found out i was fine i was able to calm down an enjoy the trip once again, an luckily i didnt have the thought of overdose till six hours into it...its crazy tho it was basically just as intense from beginning to end unlike all the other psycs ive done.

I tried it last night for the first time and noticed the plateau was really very short. For the first three hours it kept building and building then it leveled off for an hour maybe then the effects started to dwindle. 


Even mushrooms which tend to last a short time for me level out for atleast 2-3 hours before the effects start to decrease. But they also come on alot quicker than 2ce.

I had a friend who accidentally dosed 250mg about a week ago... Shattered him really really good... Only thing that got broken was his phone... (granted, upon realizing his mistake, he ate 20mg Xanax) so that may have played a factor in it... But 250 was not immediately dangerous to his body.

I have exceeded 100mg of 2C-I in a day and 60 mg of 2C-E on another occasion. I really enjoyed both of them, but I don't mind bearing the DXM side effects really and I love tons of stimulation.

I have also pushed myself quite deep into the 2CE, on several occasions I have taken heroic doses of 30-45mg. Each time I say i'll never do that ever ever again but as time progresses the trip becomes hard to recall and then i'm left wondering "why did I never want to do this if I had such a good trip?" Point to the story is i'm always stupid enough to relive the trip and have a similar earth shattering experience. 


This drug is very unique but it feels like it lacks a percentage of eurphoria, there is no warm fuzzy blanket of kindness like LSD or Mushrooms. IME I have loved 2CE visuals and the trips, but they have gotten me into some dark places in my mind by being in the wrong location while tripping balls. And I have never laughed so much about not being able to complete a sentence in my life.

Tis indeed - I experimented with this one for quite a while (after sniffing 14mg my second time ooops) before pushing it up to 30mg - still wasn't ready for it hahaha, had to go and lie down, it was a mad one...would like to try it again.

I have managed to consume approx 230mg in 2 days.


6 or so doses taken in that length of time, insufflation and oral.  I was only eyeballing the mg's so it's a give or take with the 230mg...but my eyeballing has usually been pretty good.


Trip Report is coming soon....it's not an easy one to write, as it's not an easy trip to explain in detail as I don't understand a lot for what happened.

i took 17 mg last night before a Minus the Bear concert.  it was as expected - a pretty awesome trip with sparkles, trails, color enhancement and of COURSE enhanced musical appreciation.  but honestly, i might be done with 2ce.  ok, maybe that's a stretch, but i'm at least putting it away for AWHILE.  i just don't like the way it makes my gut and head feel on the comedown.  feels kinda bad for the body.  maybe i'm not cut out for RCs

You are doing the right thing by starting low.

That is the best way to insure not having an intense experience.

After trying 10mg you can see how you like that and then work your dose up slowly (2-4mg at a time) on successive trips.

also sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this but is there anywhere on here that defines + ++ +++etc. ? i tried looking and couldnt really find it. i know its the intensity, but is there actually a boundary that separates a ++ trip from a +++ trip? cause everyone intereprets stuff differently so i guess its just hard to know what everyone is talking about

Hey kinda mildly urgent.... Been a while since I've poasted. Obviously I'm getting stupider.. see following


Anyway my friend sent me some 2c-e.. and i being the moron that I am foolishly considered it to be an 1/8th gram when its really a 1/4th. 


Snorted what I'm calculating to be 18mg now. It was suspended in water. I snorted the water... sorta did it shot outta the syringe style (no needle). Seemed like a lot hit the back of my throat. Sneezed about a zillion times. Now its starting to get spacey.


I've got a lot of experience, probably can handle it. Just curious if anybody can give me an idea what to expect. I got a lot of xanax on hand as well. 18mg snorted... albeit not in powder so probably not full absorption there.

^^ Never ventured nearly that far in the 2C-E realm, but from what I can gather, and what you probably already know, snorting 2C's is about twice as intense as orally injesting a similar dose. So you're looking at around a 36 mg oral trip. I've read many reports of people dosing in that range, and although it was intense with their entire field of vision taken over by psychedelia, many people enjoyed the experience. 


Seems like it's gonna be an intense experience. I would just get comfortable and not plan on moving for quite some time!


Report back how it goes and stay safe!

Yeah thats what it seems so far...


So far nothing overboard but definitely already coming on strong.


I dont know if I'm completely off base here, but is it more or less true if you snorted liquid not all of it gets absorbed? Thats something I'm tryin to read about. Because it was about 1ml of liquid but i really felt a good spatter on the back of the throat. 


Just tryin to gauge how much REALLY got put up the nose and how much is sittin on a pile of chinese food.


For the record although nearly an hour after dosing I'm actually a lot more comfortable body-load wise than normal... which is odd given its a nasal and as mentioned above, I indulged on chinese immediately before. Peruvian Chinese.

Are you saying you are more comfortable body-load wise compared to when you normally snort 2C-E? Cuz I can understand that you'd be more comfortable body-load wise compared to when you take 2C-E orally. But if you are talking about insufflation that is interesting.


I'm not sure about snorting liquids, but it seems like a full 1 ml would be a lot and probably not all of it would absorb. Might not make a huge difference, but I'm sure some of it didn't make it. Hard to say how much, but I could imagine only around 75% of it being absorbed, so that might explain why it's not as intense as you would think. Probably a gods send! I couldn't imagine accidentally diving into that intense of a trip.


If you are already an hour into it and you can type on bluelight, seems like you're doing good!


Enjoy the trip ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Snorting hurts like fuck and is much more potent.  I snorted a dose of between 25 and 30mg (it was 30 but I lost a few flecks in the process of prepping my line), had intense shaking, vomiting, and all those other negative symptoms for maybe an hour, then the negatives faded off and it felt like a very high oral dose that didn't last as long.  Very visual, the stimulation effect seemed stronger tapered off much quicker once I started coming down.


For someone with little to no 2CE experience but experience with psychs in general - expect to be tripping BALLS, maybe harder than you ever have.  I hate comparing doses between such different things but that dose is along the lines of eating over a quarter of shrooms or taking a 10strip of acid - not dangerously high, but DEFINITELY on the high end of normal peoples' dosage range


For the record, I have VERY non-typical responses with this drug.  That's why I said I snorted 25-30 and it didn't get too crazy but told you to brace for a rocket ride on 18mg - I have a tolerance to 2CE unlike that of anyone else I've met.  20mg to me is a mild +++ and I've passed the 40mg threshold without ego death or any other ++++ type experience.... It just produces a very consistent, visual +++ with altered thoughts but no tendency whatsoever toward ego death and the like.   15-20 to me is low enough I might be stuck at that ++/+++ threshold where I'm not sober enough to go about my day but not tripping enough to find it that engaging or enjoyable.  I know that for most people, 15-20mg orally is enough for a very strong experience.  I guess I just have a weird brain chemistry, though; I need about double the dose of most psychedelics, but a single sip of alcohol hits me instantly like a hammer to the head.  As always, YMMV.

Hey Delsymfan, how bad was snorting the 2C-E suspended in luqid suspension?

I snorted 2C-I and vowed "Never again!"

I wonder how snorting liquid 2C's would be compared to powdered.

Deslymfan, have you snorted 2C-E as a powder and could you compare how it is different than snorting it as a liquid?

Keep us updated how the trip is going.

am the liquid wasnt fantastic like i said im not convinced it was particularly well absorbed. I'm still trippin great but just enjoying some nice conversation in spanish btw with some friends down here. Completely comfortable. Really seems almost what i'd exactly expect from a normal 18mg trip... Except it just hurt more to begin with and seemed to start by the time i finished sneezing.


that was the first time putting any 2c-e up my schnozz but i was basically too lazy to let it dry out and chalk up... so i simply stuffed the 1ml up the nose. Never mind not having a good place to let it dry out from its liquid suspension. I just moved into a new apartment and literally cant find a suitable piece of glass. 


I laid back to let it stay in the sinus region... it burned. Not as bad as people say. Honestly I just sneezed like a goddamn bajillion times... i kept holding my nose though during it cause i didnt wanna sneeze the juice out. pain was gone in 10 minutes... Hell i'm thinkin bout a bump.

Full theory as of right now:


Compared to my probably 15 doses of 2c-e before. I have no desire to barf up any of my largely full stomach contents...


I think personally probably a bit got sucked up in the nose which led to a quick startup. And the rest landed on top of a pile of chinese food... probably like 50/50...


My experience in this regard with 2c-e on a full stomach is typically a weaker trip for about the same time as normal.


So far its really nothing out of the ordinary so thats what I'm thinkin happened. A nice fast startup... too much liquid really... needs to be less. I'd have to evaporate it out or just take it straight next time. And maybe if it were on an empty stomach i'da gotten a more strong start but in reality its just nothing unusual right now. Kinda mild honestly.


So thats probably a good thing... 18 in the nose straight woulda been a serious bitch IMO.

Glad it is working out. One ml definitely seems like a lot to stick up the nose, but it would be interesting to make a more concentrated liquid to use for insuflation. 


Enjoy the 2C-E. I think I'm going to try out 2C-T-2 next. Any similarities?

I'm in peru! 


My goal is to trip machu picchu. I'm going in August for my second time.


And yeah everything worked out just fine and dandy. Although i gotta admit when trippin i started typing half my words in spanish before realizing it. Kinda happens. But yeah i've been down here for a year.


I think I probably could shoot for like 1/2 a ml which would carry 9 MG. that would be more likely to stay up there. And of course if not just put more on the other side. I need to get some dishes for the house so i can let it chalk up.

^ Sorry for the late reply Delsymfan.


Keep us posted about your Machu Picchu endeavours. Are you planning on taking a trip to Machu Picchu, or actually tripping AT Machu Picchu? I'm sure regardless it will be intensely mystical. I've always wanted to check it out. :D

Found this to be a complete waste of time,no effects tried 5mgs tried 25 mgs.Nothing! 

My source is trusted and only sells active substances all the others are fine, so it must be me.

I'll keep trying coz I've got loads left lol.

^ I say at least try some from a different supplier. I've never heard of anyone who didn't notice effects from 15 mg nevermind 25! What does your sample look like? I know we can't identify it based on that, but it could help.


Is your sample crystally, or powdery? Is it fluffy or dense? White or tan?


You could miss out on an amazing psychedelic by dismissing it after one batch. I'd at least get a friend to try some from the same batch. You say you have loads left! If 15 mg (after a 1 mg allergy test) doesn't provide decent effects then it is undoubtedly something other than 2C-E. My first trial with a 5 mg dose was surprisingly strong actually! It's a very potent RC.


This is one of my faves, don't give up!

Undoubtedly is a strong word to use with RCs, but it's very unusual indeed that you could take 25mg and not notice it.  Most people would find this to be an excessively high dose.

Are you by any chance eyeballing? My first few trials with 2C-E were relatively unsuccessful because I was eyeballing and taking a much lower amount than I thought (20mg of 2C-E looks like 40mg of 4-AcO-DMT for example) - I only really realised how low my actual doses were recently when I realised how much of my first 250mg bag I have left even after ~15 trips.


---


Out of speculation, I think the nausea on 2C-E is a psychosomatic thing, almost all of the people I know who experience nausea on this chemical read up lots of reports that mentioned nausea, and were very worried about it.


I personally have yet to experience proper nausea on it. At times I feel a little queasy for say 15 seconds but that's the worst it's gotten really. Even when snorting very large doses. The only reason for even getting that queasy feeling is that I do not like the taste, but it quickly dissipates, things like Ketamine (which is relatively easy-going until higher doses nausea wise) are much worse for nausea for me.


As an experiment, when giving my friend some 2C-E, I told him nausea was "extremely rare" - he ended up having no nausea whatsoever, so I suspect it is a psychological thing.


Anyone agree/disagree?


---


Also, a question, do you guys (who have had a fair experience of both ROAs) prefer snorting or oral 2C-E? So far I prefer snorting, it seems much deeper and more spiritual to me, plus I get more bang for my buck, as I take half/less than half the oral dose for the same intensity - and the duration is almost as long (give or take 1-3 hours) - however I'm thinking about giving oral another try next Monday with a bigger dose.

^ I never get nausea on 2C-E but others get nausea like clockwork every time they drop, regardless of whether it is a low or higher dose. Everyone reacts differently, simple as that, but this one tends to cause nausea and GI disturbances mre frequently than others.

In my experience, nausea seems to be worst with insufflated doses.  I find that the best way to avoid nausea on any 2c-x is to dissolve the dose in a bottle of water and sip it slowly.  It makes for a very gentle and forgiving come-up.

Rectal administation 100% completely eliminates all nausea and bodyload for me with 2C-E.  It dramatically reduces bodyload and nausea for pretty much everything, but the difference between rectal and oral/nasal administration with 2C-E is the most dramatic.

have anyone on here been spiritually vivisected by the stuff.


I mean fundamentally, i have been through alot as a person.


I was adopted, told i was adopted alot, 

just alot of childhood bullshit which works it's way out itself it seems.

sometimes when i'm tripping, i don't want to relive the darkness that happened.


Psilocin, MDMA, LSD, those never really brought any attention to it.

2c-e was one that definitely was spiritually intense to my ego and made me cry and wonder why a few times.

But it always gave me answers. 


First i'd say 7-8 times i did it were magnificent, just glorious displays of heavenly wonder

a strong euphoria and this sense of synchroncity as if all of the events of my life were building to this point, this very point and i would feel like i was god, and i could shoot color out of my finger tips.


I had one bad trip, which was directly correlated to my girlfriend having an anxiety attack. in correlation to being unable to get ahold of her mother.


this was about a year and a half ago and i have been nervous about doing it ever sense. 

Basically because i know her so well, multiply that by the fact  i was so very high, her anxiety rubbed off into the psychic field if you will and i experienced what she was experiencing. 

Only Psychedelically. My roommate who was tripping with me also experienced the same phenomena. 


He got very anxious and the rainbow colors melted into dark coils and they would bend and 

twist and we couldn't sit still and we just felt very uneasy....


After talking her down//her getting ahold of her mom, there was some residual anxiety in us, and it kind of astounded us that it happened.


I never once before had a bad experience on 2c-e before that day.

But it was horrifying. More horrifying than when i transcended LIFE on DPT. 


i snorted a VERY LARGE amount of DPT. Somewhere between 150-175 foolishly my first time, expecting more of dmtesque experience. i had a very strong out of this earth psychedelic experience where i was swept up into the sky by rainbow horsemen who chained me up there, my perspective with my "souleyes" open was of that of me being up in the sky looking down at myself on the ground.

my perspective with my eyes open on the ground was that of infinite color and waves of just unlimited visual.


my perspective with my eyes in the sky closed was that of myself living out multiple lives all synchronistically in different points in history. Kind of like 


I was a Pirate and all of the people that i know, and knew, were different people aboard my vessel. 


I was an Indian in a Tribe looking after my family who was sick and dying and feeling hopeless.


there was something like 8-12 20 minutes movies that played out for 3 hours and the 4 hour was just intense spiritual and physical correlations with my backyard.


a Cicada flew by my head and i felt like it was the strongest most intelligent being on the planet.


Now, i only SMOKE DPT ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

i had one unpleasant experience on 2ce, which was remedied by a change of scenery.  i turned down the dark music i was listening to and went to a different room.  if that hadn't worked, i may have stepped outside.

^ I'd have to agree. While I haven't plugged 2C-E as I'm comfortable with snorting it and don't get nausea, some of my friends who *do* get nausea have said that plugging it got rid of it for them - so definitely give it a try if nausea is putting you off this chemical.


As for the guy asking about bad trips. I've had one bad experience with 2C-E, I watched Donnie Darko while tripping (had never seen it before) - up til the end it was great if a little creepy, but then at the end I suddenly thought the movie was real - got really freaked out, upset, etc.. After laying in bed for 30-60 mins and just thinking about my life I cheered up and the trip ended great though, so it didn't put me off tripping again 3 days later.


My tip is to just change your scenery as porkstock suggested. Put on some nice happy music, turn on the lights if you're in the dark, talk to a friend if you're alone - go be by yourself if you're with friends. etc..

Well either you've got bunk product or it's the eyeballing that's the cause. I remember thinking I was snorting like 40mg the first times I snorted it, when really it was more like 5-10mg - that's a BIG difference, but one that's easy to make when eyeballing. That's why it's always best to stay on the low side if you must eyeball - it would have been far worse if I'd aimed for 5-10mg and ended up with 40mg.

Yea, but also question yourself as to why the anxiety is so bad. As Help?! said, some of the greatest potential of these drugs is to let you experience truth about yourself. You can't undo the trip with the girl who introduced this anxiety. The anxiety is a truth about **you**, even if it was triggered by another person. Learn from it by striving to accept it and by being curious about it.


BTW, I'm not saying that it's abnormal to be scared of reliving such darkness. It's totally normal of course. But you can also choose to accept that fear and do the best that you can, affected by the fear, but not influenced by it. Soon you will learn from it, and one day it may transform from fear into something wonderful.

2c-e engenders an amazing creative and spiritually edged energy in me. It also always lifts my mood. I am blessed to not experience any nausea from 2c-e, and the body load to me seems like body glow...the only thing I get is a little bit of face ache sometimes from smiling too much all night ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


My usual roa lately is insufflation, starting off with around 8-10 mg, usually bumping that a few more times throughout the night/morning. It can get incredibly visual sometimes, but if I am concentrating on say making some music or a collage or something, then the visuals get a bit suppressed, but if I lay in bed and stare around the room, I will gat that sort of cascading phosphene outline of whatever I happened to look at. Lots of infinite feedback like visuals too. 


Interesting about 2c-e also is that the last time I did it, I had been experiencing some bad lower back pain. I had been hobbling around like Frankenstein monster for a few days before taking 2c-e, but to my amazement, the 2c-e released all of the tension in my lower back,  leaving me with an almost pain free back the next morning. Pretty amazing relief actually. The next time I have a back issue like that, which unfortunately is often enough, I will try it again and see if it still relieves the pain...


one of my top tier chems for sure...

Props to you for describing it like that, I've been trying to find a way to accurately describe those kind of visuals for a long time now with little/no luck.


I get them a lot with 2C-E in the dark (as long as there is *some* light obviously).

I have a feeling MDPV would send you down a dark hole, heh. Super increased heart rate, the anxious/paranoid feelings that PV tends to give people coupled with the intense visuals and length of the 2C-E

I know a person who is doing the same thing before drinking larger amounts of alcohol. Adding 5-7mg of 2CE to it.

Another thing: When being totally drunken, snorting a small line of 2C-X (E,I,B) can be very entertaining.


The last few months I ended up doing phens every weekend. Not in large doses... sometimes just 8-10mg of 2CB before meditating or listening to music. There is little cross tolerance between 2CE and 2CB/2CI as far as my eperience goes. 


I have observerd great differences between different batches of 2CE in the last two years. In january 2009, I got some 2CE wich was rather easy and calm on my mind. I could to it up to 30mg and did not experience any major difficulties. Well, when my stash went out, I ordered new 2CE from a different source and this one is mind blowing as hell. Between these two batches i started to meditate a lot (2-3 hours a day) and got some kind of idea of how to practice introperspection without using any drugs. But... I believe that the 'old' batch either was not 2CE at all or it was cut. I still got 300mg left of this. Last weekend I snorted a small line, like 5mg. Usually 2CE makes me very unstable and full of anxiety and energy, but after this line I felt very comfortable and stable, but the body feeling and the optical distortion did indeed remind me of 2CE. Is there any way to find out what substance this is?

This is the truth for me fundamentally.

i'm adopted. i was told virtually everyday by unloving parents.

i was adopted. didn't really know my place in the world for a very long time i was extremely heinously depressed. 

Once upon meeting my real mother, and realizing that she has only 13 years of age difference... meaning that she gave birth to me , at 13 years old.. was kind of distressing all in its own right. I'm 24 she's 37


Basically 2c-e takes me out of this sort of disassociation i have with family. I know who i am, trust me, but when i think of home or of ... just like you know that place. Where you'd like to go into your mind to relax... i don't really have one of those.


4-aco-dmt, at an 80mg dose made me relive this amazing experience i had when my parents rented an R.V. and we drove across Canada that shit was amazing i like experienced the whole thing with close eyes and i had never been happier. It was like watching a movie about your life in the 3rd person.  


2c-e just leaves me with this scary hollow feeling that nothing can fill.


like i said, i have had 1 bad trip which was brought on by an outside influence.

i've dealt with all of these things before. like i said i've taken 2c-e 10+ times.


LSD, never really made me care, about what my parents did or how my life, is i mean LSD was always just laughter and visuals.


Mushrooms were always intimate bonding experiences between a couple of friends.


2c-e just has this way, of nullifying that which i think i have filled the void up with.

I know that, there really isn't too much else...


I'd assume on here not everyone has had stable family lives, but i was told from 5 years old on, that i wasn't theirs and not a goddamn thing i ever did was good enough.


I guess you could say, 2c-e takes me up high enough to feel like god, but if i start to think too much about my life, too much just about things that i have happened....


I mean i watched my dog, my First dog, get Run over by a COMBINE, yes a Corn Thresher, while it was Threshing corn. Most people have their family dog their whole life.


These are this discernable lines. But if you think that is just a sip from the cup. lol i'm tellin you theres some pretty brackish water in these swamps.


But, every time no matter what i had to deal with through any of my 2c-e trips the moments of heavenly godliness and one with the universe were astounding, i've felt things from that substance that cannot be explained using traditional language. I feel as if 2c-e visions are what the DMT Elves dream about.


I won't touch 2c-p ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

i cant say ive ever done anything like 120 mg like some of the shit ive seen on the net but but i can boast a 70 mg trip.  30 mg of which was insufflated.  so maybe it was comparable in intensity to a 100+ trip.  either way, totally insane

anyones thoughts on 1-3 mg orally for a threshold experience?


is it euphoric, visual...nauseating...


2 hours in now...and, after smoking, i feel as though i have taken 1 hit of some mediocre quality acid...


had some tingles going, time has been warping a bit, a general brightening of color...all of this followed a somewhat anxious comeup, surprising considering the dose...


The nausea is present....but not really posing any problem...


just jamming out to some miles davis...hell ya i downloaded his 9 gb discography

I done 2C-E about 50mg i think , I know is alittle to much, but only found out after I took it, did it Last Sunday, and I had the best experience ever, this stuff is better than LSD and DOC, which I tried before.


Visuals amazing, tracers, colors, and everything comes to life, I was watching a Porn, and I felt like I was inside of the Porn Movie, being the director and talking to the Porn stars.


Also when I was putting different tunes, I Put Ferry Corsten, somehow took me to year 2345 in japan, and I was having vision of the Culture there, throught the tune that vibed around me.


also everything I looked at, had a completely different meaning, more profound, and did meant everything to me, also have alot of visions of the future, and epiphanies, about where we come from and Men VS Women, and how the Planet and everything else Co-exist in a Random state of Chaos to find Order.


It really is an amazing substance, with no comedown whatsoever, and this weekend I will be going to Newport to try it with some girls for their first time, they only have experience with shrooms, so this will definetly be so cool.


this time I will make sure I video myself on this, cause at one time, I was a student of Bruce Lee, and was using the exact techniques that bruce lee used to imobilize the adversary, plus I was feeling like Rocky and did several pushups, like 100 maybe.


and ate lots of bananas and orange and mango tropicana juice.


the visuals were pretty intense

Make sure to give them, at least, a much lower dose.  Many, probably most people would have way too much bodyload and stimulation at that dose, not to mention tripping really hard for a really long time.

On the subject of first time doses for people not too familiar with psychs. What would be a good dose for someone to enjoy the trip and have a good time but that it would be very easy on the mind. A guess would be about 10mg, any better ideas?

2C-E and "very easy on the mind" don't really go hand in hand.  10mg would probably be quite tame but might not really give them much of a feel for tripping, either.  15mg would be enough for many people (although not me) to have a decently powerful trip, but it could also get a bit challenging mentally.  A first timer starting with 2C-E should be prepared for a powerful/difficult experience.

Thinking of taking 40-60mg either orally or, yes, I'm crazy, nasally tonight. I have a bit of a tolerance so take off 10-15mg and you'll get the "no tolerance" dosage I'll be taking.


I'm going to be at a concert where Chemical Brothers will be playing, I haven't arranged transport or anything so will have to try get a taxi to a friend's house after the concert.


Reckon it'll be difficult sorting everything out when the concert ends and I'm still tripping? Haha.

^ I think that intranasal 2C's are painful for a reason. Stuff's gotta be damaging to your poor sinuses...


2C-E to me seems neither inherently positive nor negative. It leaves my thought process seemingly totally intact, but simply enhances my awareness of the process itself. Of course this increased awareness can lead to euphoric states as a result of the joy of self-discovery, but it doesn't have the positive push that a lot of other psyches do.


Also, 2C-E puts on a very strange and interesting sort of internal "show" that I haven't seen the likes of anywhere else. It's a sort of play of emotions and images that comes across as an odd form of art. Anyone know what I'm talking about?

So many people keep saying this and it surprises me, because of all the drugs I've done, 2C-E has the MOST euphoric push to it for me.


However, I nearly always snort my 2C-E, and when taking it orally I found what you found - it seemed neutral, no real euphoria unless I forced it. I wonder if the ROA is behind this..

Most probably, it is most definitely worth it though. I find nasal is 2-3x the intensity of a similar oral dose, lasts 60-75% as long, and is extremely euphoric, overwhelmingly visual, and overall much deeper than an oral experience.

Never tried plugging it, but I'm guessing it'd be an equivalent experience minus the roasting-your-face-off aspect. I'd suggest giving that a go.

I don't mind the burn from snorting it, I think it's exaggerated, I've snorted up to 30mg with no real trouble. Yeah it hurts for a bit but I actually kind of like it, because when the pain fades after 5-15 minutes I'm suddenly swept up in the most beautiful amazing euphoria, and it feels so great. Much better than if I didn't feel the pain initially. 


The only thing that I find difficult with nasal 2C-E is the end of the experience, as I often end up spending the entire period between 3 and 5am trying to unblock my nose ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) - but it could be a psychosomatic effect as usually I just open my window and a minute later my nose is unblocked.


-- Anyway, so has anyone experienced a very large dose out at a concert or a similar event - how hard was it to communicate etc? I've only tripped on 2C-E alone except for once with a friend, I'd like to be able to communicate freely with people as I'm going to this event alone and it'd suck not to meet anyone there.

I think it depends on the person really. I actually gave my friend 15mg nasally - this was his first ever trip, and aside from the initial burn he loved it and is now experimenting with various other psychedelics.

A lot of people find 10-12mg perfectly adequate for their tastes.  Especially in a concert type environment.  I personally like to take a bit more.  I have had a bit of conversational awkwardness, but nothing too bad, just a feeling of "i'd rather not be talking"

Honestly, I'd recommend somewhere in the 15-20 range, as this really isnt overpowering by any means, and will give you a proper idea of what the 2C-E trip is all about.  IMO, a 10mg oral trip will be enjoyable, but not very indicative of the true power of the compound.  The dosage curve for 2C-E is very steep, 2 mg, in this range, can make a very big difference.  so go with 18 or 20 mg and enjoy the ride, as this is where serious open eye visuals and other such psychedelia seem to start for me.  ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I love the stuff!   I recomend mixing with glucose if anyones is planning to put it up their hooter.   1:10 ratio of 2c-e - glucose.  Will take the dunt out but will block your nose a little.  5-10mg is plentyful ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I do not have experience with a "very large dose" at a concert but i have mixed an avg dose with molly at a concert. The molly was completely overpowered by the 2ce but worked to potentiate it. I found myself analyzing the crowd most of the time, seeing everybodies intentions and roles. Since the concert was just a big drunk-fest i didnt have a very good view on it. I had a hard time talking with people as all i wanted to do was shut my eyes and listen to the music.


For a concert i would recommend a smaller dosage (12-14 mg) or if you are mixing it with ecstasy ~6 mg does really well at adding visuals to your roll without overpowering it. 6 mg 2ce with molly at a concert was one of the best nights of my life tbh.

**Measuring 10mg 2CE**


So my boyfriend recently got 30 doses of 2CE. The thing is, it's all in one bag. The girl didn't separate it for us and we have to split it up amongst a lot of people.


I was curious if there was any way to measure out 10 mg. I don't have a very good scale. I know someone who does, but I wanted to see if there was any other way to measure it out. 


Are there such things as 10mg capsules?  Any advice?


Thanks

Is the bag a KNOWN amount?  Or do you just know it's "30 doses"?


There is no way to measure out 10mg without a good scale, unless you use liquid measurement, which you would only want to use with a known amount.

If you know HOW MUCH you have in mg, I believe you can water-dose it. Put a known amount in a known amount of water, calculate the ratio. Voila.


If you don't have much experience with psychedelics, or 2ce, use the friends scale. Really, it won't take that long.


Personally, I always just kind of wing it, ahaha... I figure if it's between 20-30 I'm set.


Speaking of which, I personally think 10mg is a little low... mayhaps 15?

The girl separated it by eye using a cut up straw. She started with 100 doses total and then scooped 30 bits in the other bag. I wasn't there at the time, but my boyfriend was. I just have no idea what I'm supposed to do with it.

Alright. You DEFINITELY need to, at the least, measure the entire bag.


And fyi, you probably should've made her do something a little more accurate, wouldn't be surprised if she ripped you off..

I've seen 10mg kick people's asses before... Just because its not the starter dose for one person doesn't mean it is the same for everyone else.


I generally do agree that it is a small dose but some people have a strong sensitivity to phens.

You have no idea how much you have or what a dose is.

You need a scale.


Or if you atleast knew how much you had you could use liquid measurement for dosing.

Yeah, she said apparently she'd done it so many times she could eyeball it. If I'd been there I would have asked for her to be more accurate. :/

At least you have access to a scale - who knows you may be pleasantly surprised and find out she gave you a lot more than she meant to - which would be good in both ways. First, you benefited from her irresponsibility and second, you benefited from your own responsibility. Win-win. Either way you score at least one win. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

a pile that is 20mg can easily look like a 10mg pile if there is a little clump in it.

your friend definitely didnt do the wise thing.

Yeah I was in a hurry one time and tried to eyeball a dose of the non-fluffy 2C-E and I quickly put it in a capsule and tossed it on the scale... what I thought was 25mg was actually 57! ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) Thank god I checked it on the scale.

Oh lord ^ that's not good...


The only time I've ever eyeballed this is when I got a batch, then split it into 100mg piles if I wanted 10 doses from each...those 10 doses lasted a long time if sniffed, or just put 2 or 3 in a capsule for a really mad time... technically eyeballing, but not just grabbing a bit out the bag completely blind - the only 2C-x I would ever eyeball COMPLETELY is 2C-B, fuck eyeballing anything else.

I had two different batches. One was fluffy, the other was crystalline shards. They were equi-potent but HIGHLY different in weight on the scale. The latter had to actually be crushed in order for an experienced friend to snort them. Walgreens' pill crushers/splitters/holders ftw. Did it nicely. Still had to be weighed.

I would agree, I NEVER eyeball 2ce, and I went through about 300mg of the stuff.


It can look like more than it is, or, in most occasions, look like less.

i am guilty of eyeballing 2ce a few times.  but never quite as reckless as eyeballing 1/3rd of a gram? and then the doses from that.  

i eyed ~20 mg, based on what 20 mg had previously looked like in the same tube, from the same batch.  still very inaccurate though, and it was probably my most intense trip on 2ce

^^^

I think the 'wing it' quote was about picking what dose to take, not eyeballing rather than measuring.  He's saying he doesn't have one set dose, he just picks one between 20 and 30.  I could be wrong, don't feel like looking for the original for context.


I would never eyeball 2CE.  I get pretty 'mild' effects from it compared to many (it's like a much more intense/potent version of 2CI to me), but the length, degree of stimulation and intensity of bodyload and other side effects are all extremely dose-dependent.  The gut rot and nausea alone from a really excessive dose would make it a pretty miserable experience for me.  I also prefer doses around the 20-30 range flarestar cited, and if I go higher I definitely want to know it beforehand.  For people who find the dose-response curve extremely steep and aim at or below 20mg, eyeballing seems like a completely terrible idea.  I'm a hardhead to the stuff and I'd still rather not trip than take an eyeballed dose from a large supply that could be way more than expected.

Ive taken 25 mg with only slight visuals and a crappy body load, but had friends take 20 mg of the same batch and blew their minds...


i was wondering if low doses of this stuff would brighten a day perhaps...and avoid the nausea...


im looking for an alternative to low dose LSD basically, and am considering between this and 4-aco-dmt

It can be smoked as far as I'm aware, but I'm not sure what the dosage for smoking it is, or whether it's safe or not, so don't try it until you get some more information.


Oral, nasal and plugging are all good ROAs for 2C-E. I personally like nasal best but if you get nausea or have too big a problem with the burn (if you think anything else you've snorted burns, 2C-E will knock you on your ass) - then plugging would be a good way of getting more from a single dose.

Snorting does last allot shorter. Orall last longer; Ive tripped for around 9-10 hours on orral administration before.


Do not smoke it in its powder form. I would think its possible to turn it into a freebase since I read about 2c-t2 being turned into a freebase; but I heard it doesn't work very well.

I prefer 4-aco-dmt to 2C-E by FAR for low 'brighten your day' type doses.  4-aco-dmt works astonishingly well for this, whereas low dose 2CE just feels like a weird mild stimulant to me.  If you get limited effects that aren't that good from a high dose, I doubt you'll find such low doses very interesting.  Not to get too off topic but low dose 4-aco reminds me a looooot more of low dose LSD than low dose 2C-E does.  Very slight visual distortions / brightened colors, a mood lift, an altered perspective without being too out of your head....  I tend to go through 4-aco pretty fast, not because I trip balls on it all that regularly, but because I end up taking a ton of low doses.

Yes.  Half as long maybe?  I've snorted it once, and you would have to offer me a friggin' fortune to do it again.  It's up there on my list of most unpleasant experiences ever - not the whole trip, but the first hour of burning pain and massively magnified bodyload and side effects made it absolutely not at all worth it.  Snorting 2C-E is very much a love-it-or-hate-it thing; some people rave about it and don't find the burn that bad, while the rest of us think it feels kind of like slashing open your nostrils and pouring salt in the wound.

It's illegal in the UK, Denmark and Sweden.  Maybe a couple other countries by now.  I'm not aware of anywhere else it's illegal.  It's still legal in the US, Canada and most of Europe, at least.

Iv snorted it and ya it sure burns but i dont believe its that bad. i kinda actually enjoy the pain a little. Iv snorted small, 1-4 mg doses and as much as ~10mg at a time. If your interested in trying to snort it just start out real small to test your pain tolerance.

I'm planning to fill some 2c-x powder into capsules (around 20mg maximum) and was wondering what size capsule would be best for this. Also can this all be carried out by hand?

I use 0's but you could use even smaller ones, tho it would be a pain in the ass to fill. To fill the caps, i cut a hole in a gatorade lid just big enough to support a cap upright then i scrape the powder off my measuring tray into it using a piece of thick paper cut into a mini spatula (chemistry spatula not cooking). Its a slow process for making caps and thats one of the reasons why so many people use liquid measurements with RC's.

Thanks a lot! I plan to use capsules as I find it easier to carry around etc rather than liquid, I also find it easier to consume than my previous experiences of viles and oral syringes. Have you any idea how many mg of 2c-e a 0 capsule could hold?

It's easiest just to use a small straw cut diagonally on one end so it has a bit of a scoop on the end. Weigh the gel. I usually use single O gels which way between 88 and 102 mg (average 95 mg) so I weigh the gel a couple times to ensure I have consistent readings. If the gel consistently weighs 98 mg and I want a 17 mg dose of 2C-E I simply add 17 (the desired amount of 2C-E in mg) to 98, (the weight of the gel in mg) and use the straw to scoop a few small scoops of 2C-E until the gel consistently reads 115 (98 mg wight of the gel plus 17 mg weight of the 2C-E equals 115 mg).


A straw that is smaller in diameter than the single O gel is ideal, so the straw actually fits into the gel and decreases the chance of spillage. The material should be dosed on a clean dark surface so if there is minimal spillage, the spillage can be easily detected and retrieved.

An O capsule could hold over 250 mg of 2C-E probably. A regular dose only fills the bottom of the gel, but using smaller gel capsules becomes very tricky to handle, so I agree in recommending using a single O capsule. You could probably use a size smaller, but the smaller they get the harder they are to handle and you risk dropping gels in the middle of dosing them and losing powder.


I recommend weighing the gel and adding the amount of 2C-E you want to the weight of the gel rather than only weighing the powder as scales are usually more accurate when weighing larger amounts. I use a GemPro-250 and have had really good success with it so far. I don't know how reliable the really cheap e-bay scales are, but if you are using a cheaper scale I would definitely weigh the gel capsule and the material together, as they are even less accurate with weighing small amounts.

Faster onset, stronger effects, shorter duration - appealing to some people, for me more so than plugging especially.

Another great way to hold capsules... Take off one of your door stoppers... any size capsule fits in it and it can be angled.. as for getting the powder in there, I use a small flathead screwdriver...

Are the 2c-x's a sticky powder? I'm just curious as I plan to most likely move the doses into the capsules using a piece of folded paper and want to know if I'm going to lose much of say a 10mg dose when transferring it via paper.

I don't think you would lose more than maybe a mg. Its not a sticky powder and can be scrapped off quite easily.

I don't think it's necessary. I think its unlikely one mg would have any noticeable effect on your trip anyway.

The reason I ask this is because I'm basing it on 2c-p (although this is a 2c-e thread), with this specific 2c compound 1-2mg can make a dramatic difference on the potency of your trip. I think I will just stick with the 10mg dose however due to the suspected overdose at 16mg myth.

2C-E can be just as sensitive as 2C-P... I don't know why people don't take more precautions with it.

Ok with 2c-p it would probably make a big difference. Im just a little skeptical believing that 2 mg doubles the intensity of a 2c-e trip, like iv read a few times.

2C-E can be very dose-sensitive for some people (although 2C-P is a good 2-3 times more potent, it seems, so 2C-E is almost certainly *less* dose-sensitive).  That said, adding an extra mg doesn't make you any more certain of how much powder has been lost transferring to pill form.  It seems like a silly 'solution' to me.  Speaking of solutions, though - liquid measuring is soooooo much easier than fucking with gelcaps.

2C's aren't particularly sticky, but they do clump. I've tried and witnessed many ways to fill gel capsules, including using folded paper and figure I should repeat the method that I find the easiest, as it is way easier than using folded paper or any other method I know of. Here is a "Filling Gel Capsules For Dummies" style step-by-step process for dosing out chems like 2C-E.


Cut a straw in half so it is about 4 inches long, or however long feels most comfortable (make sure it is long enough to reach the bottom of your baggie!). Cut one tip of the straw diagonally, so there is a scoop on one end. Either do this in your head if you can trust your math and memory, or write it down, just make sure you add correctly!


When dosing the 2C-E, first weigh out the capsule a few times. Once the weight of the capsule is confirmed, add the weight of the capsule to the weight of the intended dose of powder to calculate how much the capsule should weigh once the correct dose has been added. 


Take the shorter top off of the capsule and place the shorter end on the table right side up and the longer part of the capsule upside down (so the rounded ends of both sides of the capsule are facing up so they don't roll off your surface). 


With the bag of 2C-E laying on the surface (I don't waste a hand picking the baggie up), with one hand squeeze the sides of the bag to widen the opening of the bag and with the other hand use your straw to scoop out a bit of 2C-E and take the straw out of the bag, careful not to tip it or spill any powder (not hard to keep it steady actually). 


With the other hand let go of the sides of the bag and pick up the larger end of the capsule and flip it so the opening end of the capsule is facing up. Hold the capsule with the open end facing upwards diagonally towards your hand that has the scoop of 2C-E in it. Put the scoop end of the straw all the way down into the capsule and once the scoop end is completely in the capsule dump the scoop. Hold on to the gel capsule, don't let it tip as it has 2C-E in it! 


With your other hand put the straw down and pick up the smaller end of the capsule and connect the two ends of the capsule. Weigh it, and if there is a little too much, tap the gel capsule lightly into the baggie, and re-weigh it. If there is not enough add another scoop until the desired weight is found. Once the desired dose is found, re-weigh the capsule a few times to confirm the accurate dose shows up on your scale consitently.


It's fairly easy, sounds like a long process doing it step-by-step for dummies, but you get a good idea of the density of your 2C-E, or any other powder, pretty quickly. I can often get the desired amount in 2 scoops, and sometimes get it right on the first scoop, although sometimes a dose wants to either be 1 mg too much or too little, and when more is added or taken out it ends up being 1 mg too little or too much. Can get a bit frustrating when that happends, but this is definitely the fastest method for gelling out doses that I know of.

It's more so for harm reduction due to lower doses (better safe than sorry) rather than because of the potency difference.

Sounds like a lot of work when insufflating it brings the effects on almost immediately.  I did very small amounts about 30 minutes apart when i first did it, and it worked well and i had no burn at all.  A small amount of discomfort maybe.


By the way, i'm tripping on it now, so it was nice to find this thread ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I guess i'm spoiled because i've had this tray forever which easily fits into the gelcap. Plus I hate drinking solutions.

**This is the now**


The fucking tv behind me has the sound phasing and flanging and it is hardcore as shit. I haven't had distance influenced perceptual disturbances like this until now. Man this shit is so weird compared to acid. WTF is alteril yellow shit on tv. 2C-E is weird I don't know how to deal with only like half assed psychadelics. I mean I know this is strong but I am still able to function. I know perfectly well what is going on but man, frizzied. Very weird. When I take LSD and live, its like always there, this is functionable. Jk I am tripping. I guess this is the peak. So weird. I snorted atleast 5 mg if not upwards of 10, I just don't understand why this isn't kicking my ass like everyone says it will. Not really wanting too, just would like to be immersed without my consent and it won't do it. Maybe I have to do it. Sigh.


I just want someone to be tripping and read this. Call it loneliness, I am watching this weird ass pitball show on tv behind me. Not really because it sucks and I hate pitbulls. Anyway. Time to watch guppies fight over female. 


Certainly sounds like I am tripping reading this. Must think about it more I guess.

Man you must be tripping, your post sounds like a rant overheard from a locked rubber room at the asylum.


And what the fuck are you doing exposing yourself to PITBULL FIGHTS !!?? while tripping?  Are you TRYING to deliberately induce PTSD in yourself? 


Get the hell out of wherever you are, put on some good tunes - NOT wanky tweaky techno... though *good* techno like Orbital can be cool... spacey ambient or epic trippy psychedelic or something else** skillfully composed** on the headphones, lie down and close your eyes for a couple hours.

Hah dude you can do no worse than watching green mile on mescaline. It wasn't pitbull fights though it was like some shit where I think it was called pitbulls and parolees or something. Great idea for a show. Not.


Anyways, I am railing electricity basically right now and I can still type and change channels and probably do everything reasonable (will not drive, etc) but damn I just want to go open eye visuals to the max. I pulled an all nighter last night and should be tripping real hard now. But darkness and music soon.

2C-E visuals I noted:  moderate tracers, intensified colors, wiggly outlines, shifting colors... the best visuals came from staring totally fixed at one point on some object or any where really for a minute or two then quickly looking at a blank wall or if none around a blank piece of paper or whatever and seeing a VERY vivid afterimage that then would start color shifting like crazy and the shapes would last FAR longer than normal afterimages then start to morph and transform not to random stuff but into other recognizable objects in some cases multiple times.


Another of the unique effects it has on me is "fractal, involuted though-chains" in which I am thinking about A, which branches off to an aside about B, which branches off to an aside about C, etc etc many more times... then it unwinds in reverse ...C finishes, then B then A.  It all felt like an hour had gone by, but the clock said only 10minutes.  Wild and pretty damn fun.


But I don't think you're gonna get classic psychedelic open-eye visuals like pulsating neon patterns covering everything, or undulating walls and floors, or sudden floating angry Tiki Heads.  Only LSD and shrooms ever did that stuff to me.   That's why they're "classic"... and I done LOTS of RC (though always pretty reasonable doses, and nothing from the DOx class yet, and not yet smoked nnDMT).

Pulsating neon patterns are *exactly* how I'd describe 2c-e's visuals. I guess it's true, YMMV.

Wow you get those from 2C-E?  Open-eyes?  Man I'm really jealous.  My brain must be fried or something.  At what dose?  Are you also smoking weed?  Perhaps that was the missing ingredient for me... weed has a major multiplier effect on all psychedeliocs (but also muddying unfortunately).

its strange, for me mushrooms are the only time weed effects me. it doesnt touch me on lsd or 2c-e. took approx 24mg 2ce weekend before last alone (though i talked with my roommates for a bit). i had no real desire to smoke but i did anyway because i had no cigarettes and it didnt do anything.

I wish the body load and time till sleep is possible didnt increase so exponentially for me, because that was the first time ive had visuals involve things going monochromatic (on tv watching my roommate play a video game). went really far into my head and got some serious thinking done but it was not fun at all other than watching the clouds. at this dose, it took close to 16 hours before i could go to sleep after ingesting. acid i can fall asleep in 10 hours after a decent dose and wake up in less than 2 hours and move out of my apartment, 2ce takes a much higher toll on me.

fuck yeeaaah!!! 2C-E was the most visual thing I've tried besides LSD - the activity was INSANE - there were parts of my trip were if I had my eyes closed it was the same as having my eyes open - truly truly amazing this one was.


EDIT: on dosage for me - 8-10mg sniffed, and 28mg oral. I'm pretty sensitive to psychs as I keep my tolerance to everything but ganja down, and even there it's only because I'm familiar with the effects, physical tolerance is still zero.

Hmm... I never sniffed it, and never went as high as 28mg oral... most was 20 I think.  Maybe I ought to try those amounts.


Thanks for the info, man!

I've dosed 3 times around the 15 mg range and I haven't had intense visuals.  There is a lot of light/shadow morphing type of stuff but not a whole lot of colorful stuff taking up my entire visual field.  I get some patterns once in a while and everything is really vivid but if I keep moving my field of vision everything is pretty stable.  Some amazing moments happened just looking at shadows, wood furniture, tiles, rugs, my thigh, shower curtain but never so intense that I see colorful patterns everywhere.  Oddly enough, nature does not bring out the visuals too much but the sun does give me an amazing body high on the substance.  It's mostly a mental experience but even that is pretty coherent.  Maybe I need to explore around the 20 mg range but I'm kind of worried I can't handle the mental stuff around there.

I never used to get much in the way of visuals from 2C-E (mostly plugged it at the time) but the last few times the visuals have been insane. My stomach seems to cope much better with 2C-x now so I've switched to oral dosing and it seems to be way more effective than plugging or snorting (fuckin' ow!!!) for some reason. I find it rather strange as plugging usually gives me the most intense experience but oral 2C-E just seems to have way more intense action - especially visually.


My doses are also getting lower to get effects comparable - often more intense - than I used to get from higher doses. I'm thinking that must be down to tolerance as I've dramatically cut the frequency of 2C-x trips. I can highly recommend it - less seems to be more, for me at least. 17mg absolutely kicked my arse the other night - by far the most intense 2C-E trip I've had from any dose or ROA. The visuals were so intense for the first few hours it was difficult to walk for fear of tripping over them :D

At 20 my "involuted rewinding fractal though-chains" were pretty intense, which I would think would mean they'd be disabling up at 28 which is why I never went there, where Jblazingphoenix100 says he got the pulsating neon patterns covering stuff..


But I havent had those since my virginal shroom trip 30 years ago *(3g strong ones, it was fuckin'intense! thanks and honors to my late guide TT btw ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) )* and I wanna see that shit again before I die (maybe I need to try 4-ho-met, said to be incredibly visual).


I am glad I had found out about using 25mg Benedryl (diphenhydramine) to quash the nausea and discomfortable pyramidal body aches before going from 15 up to 20.  *(It worked wonders for those and might have even intensified the whole trip.)*

Dude on 26-28mg dose of 2C-E, I saw my friend's carpet turn into a bed of roses. Could smell and taste them... 2C-E can be intensely visual... My friend took 20 and saw Shakira walk out of a poster... And I always got really nice visuals from 2C-E though it wasn't as neon as LSD or MDA - more purples and blues... but I rather enjoy those colors anyway.

I feel like a lot of what I experienced may have been barely scratching the surface(though mentally during the trips I always felt like "Where do I go from here?") so it's hard to share and contribute comfortably with such little experience but I do have a couple of other things worth noting.


The body load was actually pretty comfortable(I don't usually get sick unless it's something like DXM), not much jaw tension or loss of appetite and the come down and ability to sleep were pretty good(compared to say AMT)  The worst aspect of it for me was the come up, which felt like 3-4 hours of extreme edginess.   A lot of this got better with the subsequent trips though, as well as the other detail I noticed.


The come up and come down were a bit strange in my experience, as they seemed to consume a fair amount of time each.  Maybe I'm just equating the jitteryness to the come up as a whole but it just felt like by the time the experience mellows out it also starts coming down slowly so the peak experience itself never felt longer than an hour.  This does make it feel like there is still some juice to squeeze out of the trip during the tail end though.  And again I'm contrasting this to AMT which always felt like one long peak mostly.

Dwayne - you might want to try slightly higher dose in the snorted region if 8mg doesn't give you intense visuals - I'm pretty sensitive to psychs, as I don't push my 5-h** receptors too often, every time I trip is special.

From what I understand, 2C-E hurts like a motherbitch when snorted, and is the most painful drug to snort.

I made the desicion to not snort 2Cx anymore after snorting 2C-I (my first 2Cx). The pain wasnt even worth the faster onset and smaller dose requirement. And I hear 2C-E is even worse.

I've only done it a few times, all oral other than a single disappointing experience nasally. I found it very visual as low as 10 mg. Mushrooms for me, however, are barely visual at all. 


I think everyone just reacts to substances differently and its not an issue of dose.

I cried a few times my 2nd time with it.  I can't remember the specifics of this as much, but it was a bond between me and my girlfriend.

The 3rd time I dosed, I was coming down and I read a poem (reads positive backwards and negative forwards) and I read it the positive way and just cried my eyes out.. Was the most intense cry I've had in a very long time.  I'm just surprised it hit me so hard during the end of the trip.  It really felt like a purging experience.

^ **Cress**, I'm so glad to hear that - really great - I'd like it if you could write a trip report as I love reading about humbling experiences a lot more than reading about "tripping balls" in trip reports - we've all done that!! So happy you were gifted with insight by this particular chemical - it's one of my top 5.

For me, IMing reduces the time of "solid tripping" by 30 or 40 percent (to around 5 hours), however, Captain.Heroin strangely reported that IMing half my dose lasted around the same time as oral for him (I think he said 8 hours).  If you try it be warned that the first half hour of onset is pretty harrowing in terms of stimulation.  Be able to lie down.

Oh yeah, when I IM'd just 5mg of 2c-E, I was tripping for 6 to 8 hours minimum.  The peak was 2-3 hours but I wasn't back to baseline until 8 hours +.

WOw...I have to try this.


I have never IM'ed (or IV'ed...never will) anything, and think I would love to try 2c-x - how quick was the comeup, because for me I go from sober to tripping in 2-3 minutes when sniffing this chemical.

I always hear everyone claiming they find it real hard to sleep on 2C-E, am I the only one who finds it really easy? Seriously I have no real difficulty at all getting to sleep regardless of my dose, what stage of the trip I'm at, or my ROA. Whereas with plenty of other things like 4-AcO-DMT sleep is absolutely not an option.


However, on the flipside, while I can't sleep on 4-AcO-DMT, it makes me very worn out and tired if I dose at night, while on 2C-E I'm stimulated enough to be happy to stay up however long I need to in order to get the most out of the trip.

I get these fractalized icy crystal-lattices overlaid over everything...they have a predominately blue tint...


Also, colors bleed for me, they get these....auras...


on 2c-e, this aura is mostly blue...leaning towards purple, with a red background...


its a contradictory set of colors...its really weird...its like my color perception starts to melt into itself...the differences fade...


at one point, peaking on 2c-e...all colors and sensations blended and melded into a divine moment of synesthesia....DIVINE

I agree about the color bleeding, and the auras.


One really fun thing I like to do on 2C-E is to explore persistent afterimages, which kind of become 'HIGHLY DYNAMIC" afterimages for me.


Stare more or less continuously at one thing, moving your eyes around as little as you possibly can, preferably not at all for 30 seconds to a full minute if you can.


Then quickly switch your gaze over to a blank wall preferably with a light color, and I see the most amazing afterimages in these wild day-glo colors, that start to cycle and/or change.  AND the after image of the thing I was looking at will take on an entire life of its own, morphing and changing continuously, but not like random jelly, but through a series of other KNOWN objects, often related in some conceptual way to the original object.  Wicked!  (I can't believe I just used that term, hehe!)

It works better on other things tbh...4-aco-dmt and mushrooms, lsd even...


For 2c-e I found staring at a blank bright white piece of computer paper was more fun...

So I'm probably going to get hell for this... I've never done less than 20mg of 2C-E (I was a serious phen hard head though)


If I want to do this tonight, would 10mg plugged be too intense? I want a shorter duration and (hopefully) less of a "flu" come up... and a faster one... But I still wanna see those purty colors. LOL!

10mg plugged should be roughly equivalent to a 20mg oral dose, with about half the come-up time.

I am not a visual person as you can tell from some of my posts. I don't see many if any visuals, but it is a very social drug for me. I don't care what people think, and I enjoy it very much. I read somewhere that everything can be turned into an advantage, so thats what I attempted to do, turn my non-visual experiences into something useful. I can do everything I did before, such as drive, take tests and whatnot. This is a very good drug, I would definitely use it as my DoC if it didn't make it so much less useful.

Nie CEV's - OEVs.


CEV's I got a blueish white light in the corner of my bedroom - it appeared to me as a divine light...but for a few hours when I had my eyes shut - it didn't make any difference if I had my eyes open or closed - the visuals were more or less the same, like HD graphics swirling quickly and morphing etc.


THis is pretty cool that a fair number of us get the same colours!! This could be an intrinsic quality of "Ethyl", na?

Agreed...I do think color can be said to be intrinsic to the drug to a degree though...I mean...


As much as the types of visual effects (afterimages, trailing, blending/blurring, overlaid images...etc) can be said to be fairly consistent to the drug (allowing for lower significant percentages of users in light of the high subjectivity of the experience)...


I wonder if perhaps color's strong association with emotion has anything to do with it...as in the drug produces a consistent 'mindset' (weird use of the word, don't take it literally) 


And I have no clue what a steiner school is...


From my brief foray over to the land of searches and engines I have drawn the connection to Waldorf Steiner...


I'd never heard of him before this...but I'm a philosophy major, and i quite liked what I saw...


I'll have to come up with my own educational and developmental theories and then model a curriculum around it...


If its not that guy, weird...

Dosed around ~50-60mg orally last night (I know I know.. But I've gone higher before so I wasn't too worried about dosing wrong) and vaped some JWH-081 on the peak. Sent me right off this planet hah, I wrote a trip report on another forum so I'll probably copy-paste it here later, but if anyone's never smoked weed/JWH on 2C-E before, try it. Absolutely amazing, most euphoric drug experience I've ever had.

Sent me right off this planet hah, I wrote a trip report on another forum so I'll probably copy-paste it here later, but if anyone's never smoked weed/JWH on 2C-E before, try it. Absolutely amazing, most euphoric drug experience I've ever had.

Let us know how it goes, i wanna see what kind of coloring 5 mg gives to the experience...I wonder if visuals will manifest or if the nausea will be present...


Ive never really tried this stuff at low doses...and from the experiences I have had, i feel like it would just be that uncomfortable comeup feeling for like 8 hours

ROA?


It was...neutral...for me...


Almost emotionally confusing...


There were moments of MDMA-like euphoria coupled with crippling synesthesia though...maybe given a better setting and or mind-set...Iv just been nervous to try it again haha

Great report man...


Ya, MDMA times 4, 5 or 6 is right!!!


Ive never had anything close to the rushes i got off this...AHHH just thinking back makes me wanna take a 25 mg voyage...


But they weren't...euphoric, for me...I couldn't get into the blatant chemical flood...(I also don't find MDMA euphoric)


I think thats just me though...still enjoyable and an absurd experience, but not much tied to euphoria

Honestly it really just depends on the day... Rolling almost always causes that exact same euphoria that the 2C-E did but on a MUCH larger scale... like we're talking 4 or 5 hours of me moaning at the top of my lungs every time a "roll" of euphoria would come over me... 


I haven't taken 2C-E since that last time though.

I agree, I find it very euphoric, I always assume someone dosed too low if they found it neutral. 


One thing I will say though is the euphoria doesn't feel forced as such, say with Mephedrone (and I assume MDMA, though I've never tried it) I just feel happy and amazing whatever happens, with 2C-E it really depends on what I'm doing, if I'm listening to nice music, enjoying myself, talking to friends etc then it's really euphoric, but if I just sit there idle and do nothing I can sometimes even feel dysphoric.


Though pretty much all my experiences that felt "neutral" with no euphoria were around the ~15mg oral mark, seems a bit low for my liking.

^ I have always though that too (about people dosing too low if they don't find it euphoric) - I found it to be the most euphoric chemical I've ever done besides MDMA.


Tactile senses went through the roof. Need to get some more and fuck on this one. FORSRS.

Hey,


This past weekend I decided to use some 2ce. I had been feeling the urge to trip so when I awoke on Sunday I decided it was time to go for it. I had weighed out a couple of doses a few weeks ago. I had given one to a friend I hadn't seen in a while earlier in the week... that was the stronger one at 18mg (hope she has fun with that), and the other one was around 12 or 13... I can't quite remember. 


I took the dose... and my roommate and friend were also interested... but my friend had to run some errands that day... there would be a lot of driving... and visits to family members and such. I was excited about going on the journey and I convinced my roommate to come... as well as eat 2ce. I didn't have my scale at the time... I used some eyeballing as well as a .01g scale.... There was about 80mg in the bag... so I weighed out substance with bag... took a small amount out... and the bag weight didn't seem to change. The amount looked to be about 15mg or so... My friend took probably about 4-6 since she was driving... and my roommate probably took 8-10.... They looked pretty good and close to said amount... I've eyeballed similar amounts and have had mellow experiences. 


All in all the trips were fun... driving around was good... we were very safe about it and made sure to be careful. friend who was on 5 or so was the driver. She was at a very comfortable level... but still mentioned seeing a special glow to the world... everything looked a little bit pretty, and she seemed more intrigued by things. My roommate got pretty high into his trip. I also got very tripped out on my dose... and was having some pretty wild visual effects. I would not shut up when we were talking with my friends grandma... I'm pretty sure I may have seemed a bit foolish... too many topics that shouldn't be talked about.... societal and cultural issues... ah! 


So on and so forth.....


The reason I am really posting though is... about 6 hours after dosing my friends had mentioned a head ache forming... The friend who took 5 or so milligrams... it was her first time with the substance... and she said the next day she had a headache that was far different from any headache she had previously had. My roommate also mentioned having a strong headache the next day... I seemed fine... I've always experienced headaches quite frequently since I was a child.... so I think I have a tendency to ignore them most days.... I'm not so sure... I felt fine the next day... 2 days later I was a bit depressed... I'm not sure if it was chemical related or stress related.


I talked to another friend who has eaten it a couple times now in dosages between 5 and 10 mg... and he also has reported a headache.... He tends to trip hard on small amounts of any substance though... I tend to be a hardhead.... but still mostly use moderate doses... I save the big trips for the right moments, but continually trip monthly or biweekly in moderate doses.


Does anyone else experience headaches while on this material or after having used this material? How do you think this compares with the toxicity of other 2c chemicals? 


This one feels more toxic, to me, than 2cb.... and based on what others have said I am questionable... When snorting the burn is worse than other 2cs in my opinion... and it generally gives me a strange feeling in my stomach for a few hours... I find 2cb to be more gentle throughout.


Any thoughts?


Thanks.

Has been mentioned before, but bears repeating: if icky body load, pervasive aches and pains and hard to identify discomfort afflict you on 2C-E, take 25mg Benedryl (diphenhydramine) 20-30 mins beforehand [no-script in the US med for allergies as well as gently inducing sleep].  It seems for some reason 2C-E, unique among the 2Cs, induces extra large release of Serotonin all over the body (and I presume in the brain as well), which irritates the hell out of, well, just about everything, hence the "strange aches," also sometimes called "pyramidal side effects" for reasons that seem mysterious to me.


But Benedryl (actually a rather complex drug with a fascinating history and probably numerous undiscovered uses) seems to somehow either block the release of the serotonin, or it blocks the irritation that it causes, or both.


For me it turned what had been a really "flu-like" trip, as MK777 calls it, into a smooth, flowing really easy to handle glide ride.  It also kinda seemed to slightly intensify the already rather substantial and at times interestingly complex visuals.  


Sweet!

Sorry to be a **nattering nabob of negativism** ([http://www.answers.com/topic/nattering-nabobs-of-negativism](http://www.answers.com/topic/nattering-nabobs-of-negativism)) (haha, actually as I'm sure you all know by now, I rather enjoy it ![:X](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/mad.gif)  ) but someone's gotta say it: man that was really really idiotic to go out and drive with 15mg 2C-E swirling around inside your head.   Irresponsible toward your fellow humans, no matter how careful you felt you were.


Please no one ever do that.

I have driven on 15mg of 2ce. It really didn't seem idiotic at all. I think people make too big a deal out of these things..... It can be dangerous in some situations... but in others it can be rather safe. I was very comfortable in the car. I have driven before on psyches.... during some crazy shroom trips and acid trips. I've driven home after dosing hard at raves. It is only as reckless as you make it.... sometimes, for me, it was a bit reckless.... but I think now that there is a certain level where I know I can... and a certain level where I can't.... just to note I am very conscious of how much a particular drug effects me... I have a decent amount of psychedelic experience. I don't try to trip balls everytime.. lots of times I just enjoy the buzz... I've had scarier experiences driving on weed than I have had driving on psyches... just the same I have had awesome driving experiences while smoking weed. Cars can be dangerous any time you use them... you don't need to be on drugs to be in a dangerious car situation... I know of many people who have gotten into accidents because they were stressed or not paying attention to the road.... they were on no drugs..... So cars are dangerous... basically its silly to say a particular situation will end the same way every time.... sometimes driving on psyches can be stupid.... and sometimes it doesn't really matter.... it is awesome and gets you to a new place which can be fun and exciting.


... in the scenario I mentioned... the driver was on 5mg or so... enough to make her day a little brighter with a gentle push of stimulation. 


Probably shouldn't post about driving on psyches I guess... I may give people some bad ideas or influence.... eh. But honestly I think I have been in more dangerous situations with sober people driving than with tripping people.... Anytime I have been in a car with tripping people we all tap into an ultra awareness... and pay close attention and help one another.... it can be very exciting... cause you can realize how very important driving is.... and sometimes when I trip and I realize the importance of things it becomes my goal to do those things the best I can and to find the best methods while I'm doing them.


Blah blah blah... I'm ranting because I'm stoned.... Sorry if I am in the wrong with the whole driving thing.... I'm not trying to encourage people to get "fucked up" and drive..... I just think getting "fucked up" and using drugs are 2 different things even though they can involve one another.


But yeah 2ce.... headaches?

Your Benedryl idea sounds interesting. I may read into it a little bit. Thanks.


Seriously... Peace!

DH you've convinced me... I'll pick up some generic DPH at Walgreens when I fill my valium script (I can't take the name brand due to a red 40 allergy) and I'll dose a single 25mg pill then take my 2C-E about 20-30 minutes later.


And yes, driving on 2C-E is wreckless as hell. I've had trips on the stuff where I'm just seeing some nice magenta patterns and then suddenly everything around me is morphing and melting. Had I been driving I certainly would have crashed.

25mg orally in 6oz of soda taken today.  It was amazing.  The visuals were pretty incomparable, and I've done some decent cid in my day.  I in no way could drive while peaking fyi, but was able to do so no problem about 6:30 in.


Very happy to know I've got a  bunch of doses left ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

but yeah, i feel that when one is on psychedelics, it is typically possible to tell if you are okay to drive or not.  there have been situations where i've driven whilst tripping, knew i would be okay, and i ended up being okay.  there have also been situations where i knew there was no way i could drive.  there are mannnny factors involved here.  but i do not believe that there should be a hard rule about not driving while tripping.  you just gotta know your capabilities!

I could drive on 5-MeO-AMT - but that was because once I hit the plateau, I knew I wasn't going any higher - 2C-E comes in waves with me and many I know where one minute you're feeling totally fine and next minute you are borderline ego death... Very dangerous.

well of course you shouldn't drive on something until you know how it effects you.  if 2C-E effects you in a way that you don't feel you can drive, then don't.  it does different things to different people though.  but yeah, if you're on a manageable dose of a substance that you're pretty familiar with, i think that driving can be in the cards.  we're adults here.  of course, no one WANTS to drive when they're intoxicated... but sometimes it needs to happen.  just make damn sure you'll be fine.... and i do believe that it is possible to make damn sure that you will be fine if you take the proper precautions.


don't be fool hardy though.  if you have any reasonable doubts, don't do it...

From a harm reduction standpoint, you should NEVER drive under the influence of anything. I suppose if you literally have no other choice (which has happened to me before) then you do it but 2C-E is not the chemical to do it on.

Do report back on what, if anything, you felt the difference was.  I sear, it really did help me.  


Perhaps we ought to start a special thread just on this topic "2C-E + Benedryl help with side effects", as advice/info/discussion on it is really scattered about in all sorts of various 2C and 2C-E threads.

I've mentioned this before, but bears repeating: Don't dose the benedryl too high. When I had tried this with 2c-e, I foolishly took 2 benedryl (50mg) instead of 1 (25mg) and it totally knocked me out - I actually fell asleep for a bit at the beginning of the trip! I was really surprised about this because 2c-e feels so stimulatory by itself that I thought it would overpower the benedryl. D'oh. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

This batch of 2c-e i got looks real flaky and shiny compared to the previous pure white powder, anyone else notice diffrences in their batches?

2112acid: the only 2C-E I've encountered since '01 has always been really flaky, but fluffy at the same time. Perhaps shiny too, depends if you mean crystal-like shiny? Because it hasn't been like shiny like that at least. Anyhow, that's how 99,98% pure 2c-e has looked in scandinavia. Hope it helps.

Hung out with a really good friend of mine about a week ago and he had some people over who were tripping on 2C-E, so I decided to indulge as well. They were already tripping so I snorted my 2C-E to catch up... I put 15mg in my nose and tripped **HARD**. I expected the pain to be much worse from what I remembered, but it was pretty tolerable. After about 10-15 minutes I was fine.


At the height of the experience I was standing outside and stared up at the stars. All the stars were leaving gorgeous neon colored trails and auras with pink, blue, and green being the dominant colors, shimmering and pulsating . When I stopped and focused on certain areas/stars I could see the sky being one giant web of energy and light, all the stars being connected by the neon colored energy. I went inside, packed a bowl, and sat there staring at the sky, smoking the bowl. Eventually, before I went inside (it was cold as fuck outside) the energy connecting the stars formed a huge grid which then stared to do a kaleidoscopic/fractal dance. To say it was fucking amazing would do it zero justice...

^ glad you had such a great time


15-20mg is a typically strong ***oral*** dose of 2c-e.  So no wonder you had a potent experience snorting it, though in general that is **NOT** advisable.


Just re-emphasizing that snorting 2C's is widely considered putting yourself at enhanced risk for bad cardio side effects, though you obviously felt OK.


Oh well, I guess it's pissing into the wind... if its a powder, especially as tiny an amount as this, people are going to try snorting it no matter what anyone says.  Well whatever.

How do you guys measure this shit its so fucking fluffy and compact and everything is wrong with the texture at the same time!

My scale doesn't register it, and I don't want it in a liquid formation since I have no idea how much I have left.


Do you guys have any cross tolerance with amphetamines? I rarely get visual on this in the intensity described.

Yeah, the miligram scale i use bounces around within +/-2 that i use, but we seem to get it about accurate in the end.

I can vouch for this. This weekend I took 25mg Benedryl about 40 mins prior to ingesting 15mg 2C-E and experienced zero body discomfort. I had a very lovely evening.


By the way, be aware that in the US and Canada, Benedryl contains diphenhydramine but, according to Wikipedia, in the UK Benadryl products contain either acrivastine or cetirizine.

Because you've been dosing so often. I assumed 2C-E was a lot less potent than people said for a long time, then I stopped taking it for 3 weeks or so, took it again and was blown away by the visuals and the intensity of it all.


There shouldn't be much, if any cross-tolerance with amphetamines that don't bind to 5ht2a receptors, but if you're dosing any more than once every 2 weeks you'll have some tolerance - and if you're dosing more than once a week the tolerance will be substantial.

The first time I did it again it wasn't intensely visual either. I think they have a high cross tolerance, or there are other factors that play a huge role that I haven't quite thought up of yet.

What scale do you have?  Does it weigh in .001g (mg) increments, or .01, or .1?


My scale is a cheap $30 digital milligram scale and it definitely registers 2C-E beyond like 4 or 5mg, which it has trouble with.  You should be able to measure the whole amount left if you have a .001 scale or even a .002 scale, and use liquid measurement.


Dosing very frequently as you're doing leads to an insane tolerance that lasts a LONG time.  I should know because for 2006-2007 I dosed psychedelics like 4-5 times per week, into really big dosages.  I trip a lot less these days but still regularly, and to this day I have a massive tolerance and rarely ever get visuals are a complete head change with psychedelics... I mostly use them for art and writing now though so that's fine.  But you cannot underestimate how much less intense psychedelics become when you overuse them for extended periods of time.  I would reconsider... I wish I hadn't done that because it's been 3 years now and I still can hardly ever properly trip like I used to back in a day before that.

I was underwhelmed my first few trips too, I think some people have a bit of a breakthrough tolerance when first taking certain drugs, they need to get used to the effects to experience them properly - but not so used to them that the effects are lessened further.

Anyone have opinions on taking Soma before/during the trip to help reduce muscle tension at higher doses? 


At 30mg+ I'm full of energy but I want to lay down and close my eyes and I just cant get comfortable. 


I'm just concerned with Soma adding to the uncomfortable body load rather than helping it.

Read post #629. I would try Diph if you haven't, I've had the same great results with it. It also helps for sleeping after the trip wears off and you have some stimulation left.

I've dosed 10-15 times on 2c-e now, up to 25+mg. It's always been very visual to me. Mostly in the way of pulsating shapes/colors, still images appearing to be moving all over the place, vines--those sort of OEVs. The CEVs are usually about the same.


Recently I took between 14-17mg (started with a 20mg bomb, but lost some material transferring it to a gelcap). I was getting over a sickness so I think that may have potentiated it. At about T+3h, I decided to lay down in darkness with some nice music playing. 


The visuals from here on absolutely blew me away. Instead of the usual patterns and structures I was seeing everything from words to scenery to cultural icons. The two things I remember most disctinctly are a giant heart with the word 'LOVEHEART' scrawled across it, and a very detailed lifesize model of spongebob squarepants. Dunno what dark twisted corner of my mind those came from :lol:


At some point I remembered an old forum post I read where someone mentioned they could control the 2c-e visuals somewhat, even pick them up and move them with their hand. I tried both with success. It wouldn't work if I tried to rush things, but if I took my time and focused I could manipulate the visual static into shapes and images, and even colors [before this trip, the only colors I saw in 2c-e visuals were green and purple] of my choosing. Kind of hard to put into words. With this kind of control I started to see how people could start believing themselves to be god after a heroic dose.


Wild trip. Gonna try to get a full report written up. Only time I've had visuals that rivalled that were during an ego-loss/deathandrebirth type experience on about 5g of mushroom aborts.

Thanks alot for directing me. I've read alot of reports of DPH completely eliminating unwanted side effects, but I'm skeptical that it would still work as well with higher doses. 


I think this Friday when I eat my dose (35mg) I'll have a few Somas on hand, but give the DPH a shot 30min before the trip. 


At the very least I'll have the Soma to help with excess stimulation and sleep after the trip.

The doses you guys seem to require for 2C-E are way less than I require, strangely.  10mg 2C-E is a full-blown trip for me, about the intensity of 2g dried mushrooms (though a different feeling altogether)...


I finally tried 2C-E after sitting on it for a year or so, because I tried 2C-T-2 and 2C-C and found them to be really lacking in depth.  2C-E doesn't seem to have this problem for me, and I have to agree with everyone that says it is very LSD-esque.  I would also say that is seems more "pushy" towards a positive mood than LSD is, kind of like mescaline, IME.

I can trip off of 15-25mg just fine.


But IME, at 30mg+ is when 2c-e gets REALLY fun.

Oh yeah ^ 30mg is too overwhelming for me in social environments, though...maybe at home with friends, or outside.

Hell yeah! 10mg oral though yeah? Coz that's fullblown tripping, but light for this substance.


Definitely feel the push is positive, analytically, but wouldn't say it's more than LSD ime - hence why I stopped doing LSD for a while, but mostly coz all the times I was offered it/happened to have some (LSD), it was a a social environment - party etc.

^Yeah, 10mg orally.  I am insensitive compared to the dose range for most drugs, but I seem to be well under the normal dose range on this particular drug.  Like I said, it is around the same strength as 2-2.5g dried mushrooms.  What would it take for you (or anyone that requires larger doses than me) to get around this level of effect?

I really couldn't ay - I don't have much experience with Cubensis mushrooms (I'm assuming you're talking about these), we generally take Liberty Caps over here.


I will test this out - see if I can get hold of more 2C-E than compare it with 2-2.5g of my friend's homecultivated Cubes.

Last night (Tuesday night), a friend and I took weighed 17mg doses of 2ce in gel caps. we ended up playing video games and watching tv. We got really giddy after about an hour and a half as it came on.


 A few hours of talk and laughter (about 3), and then we retired to our rooms for personal trips. I laid in bed thinking about my present life and my future, and what I should do and what I shouldn't do with / in my life.


I think this period of self reflection was therapeutic, and it was also physically enjoyable because as the trip went on it gave way to a feeling that for me is much like rolling that I usually get on 2ce. It makes my mouth and saliva feel different and just physically I feel very good all over and kind of suck on my teeth as if my brain is sucking on tasty psych candy.


I wormed around all night in bed thinking about things and kind of gurning like that feeling great and occasionally having some visions. I smoked some jdub (018) the next morning which intensified the visions and helped me to finally feal asleep, I slept until about 3pm.


Felt fine the next day as usual, after a few years of sporadic use I'm still impressed with 2ce. I have a few opportunities to trip lately (more than usual, have finally found a good time to do it), and so I am going to take advantage and probably dose some 4-aco-dmt tomorrow night or the next.

I'm gonna plug some 2C-E tonight... and maybe do some K bumps at the peak... I haven't done a phenethylamine psychedelic in at least a month (other than MDMA which I did two weeks ago) - think I will be okay with 12-15mg?


Hoping rectal dosing is less stimulating than oral... its the main reason I don't usually fuck with phens.

30mg is a bit overwhelming, im still playing around with the 25mg dose and it is a gorgeous trip for me, trees bending down to me, vines erupting from the ground as were driving 40mph all around me. I think this might be my new favorite psychadelic... VERY insightful, thought provoking, mental, euphoric, visual pretty much everything i am looking for, and its so cheap!

Hypothetically, if I used a kava/passion flower mix to smooth out the edges, would this be safe?  I’ve read that passion flower is a mild maoi, and that mixing maoi’s with 2c-x’s is a big no-no.  I’ve also read that the maoi properties of passion flower aren’t nearly powerful enough to worry about.  


The kava/passion flower makes me feel calm/grounded and comfortable in my own skin so I think it could be helpful if I became anxious.  I’d wait to see how the trip developed rather than just take it automatically.  I’d also take some Ibuprofen during the onset (automatically).  


I know I know… Benadryl, but I don't like taking Benadryl until the come down.  Would the kava/passion flower be safe to combine with 2c-e and Ibuprofen?  I’d only be taking 2 capsules of kava root and 2 capsules of kava/passion flower mix so nothing too excessive

12.4mg rectal was a near death experience and I'm not quite sure it was 2C-E. My heart beat got so fast and I hit the peak so fast that it had to be something else - not to mention I'm still having phenethylamine visual distortions, its been over 24 hours, and I took 20mg of Valium and 15mg of remeron and it didn't put a dent in the stimulation or the hallucinations - first time that has ever happened - usually remeron will completely kill a trip for me due to its 5-HT2a antagonism.

^^^ Ugh that sounds terrible, my condolences. 12.4 mg rectal is a MAMMOTH dose, at least for me. And 2C-E rectally I dont particularly like, comes up too fast, way too physical. and easily twice as strong as oral, which considering 2C-E's absurdly steep dose response curve, owwwww. What makes you not sure of its identity?(besides your stated anachronistic effetcs, which btw, for me, when I have a severe phen OD the effects ARE unstoppable, and do last for ages). Did this come to you via untrustworthies? That alone gives me a bad trip ;D


Hope you feel better

Yes.


From Wiki:


> 0 mg dimenhydrinate contains 27.2 mg of diphenhydramine, so it is less potent at equal doses. Also, dimenhydrinate must dissociate into diphenhydramine and its counterion in the body before it is active, so it produces effects more slowly than diphenhydramine.

Might need more than you do with diphenhydramine, but other than that, should work the same - or possibly better, as slower action = longer action.

My 1st trip was on 12mg 2C-I, and it was a mindfuck. Difficult trip, but I liked it. 


Few days ago(and exactly one year after this experience - nice coincidence) I had my 11th trip, I took 18 mg 2C-E. The experience was pretty enjoyable, and manageable. 


Too manageable for me. I feel like I developed something like a tolerance to psychedelics or like I become hardheaded. What can I do to get an intense trip? Take high dose, say, 25-28mg of 2C-E or 30-35mg of 2C-T-2?  Try other compounds? I think about getting some 5-MeO-DMT and about smoking/IVing it. 


What do you guys do when you want an intense experience?

Take a break, try tripping in a different setting, etc.


sometimes the biggest swing in psychedelia will be noted when you are in a momentous change in your life-- nearing the end of a school career, or nearing the start of a long-term loving relationship, etc


there's only so far you can go in terms of "pretty colors". the real power of these drugs comes in their ability to manifest your subconscious desires or demons.

My first 2C-E trip was on 16 mg, and I was hardly able to remember my name and who I am.

I would like my trip more like it,  more intense. I would like to control my trip less.


> Like, could your describe your trip - the visual, sensual and emotional qualities of the trip?
> 		
> Click to expand...
English is not my native language, so it is quite hard to describe trips in it. But I will try.

Visuals were usual 2C-E visuals, they were a mess of colors and all visual field was distorting. When I looked out of the window in my room, trees and reflection of the room formed interior of an alien organism(but this is not an uncommon thing for me). And unfortunately, I didn't notice synesthesia.


As for the emotional part, right after taking the dose I was quite excited. However when I really started tripping, I became really anxious for ~40 minutes, and then I get into calm, somewhat euphoric, state, which lasted till the end of the trip. 

Also, during the trip I remember the thing I read here, on BL, to think about bodyload as about energy flowing through your body. And it really felt like energy! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


As you can see, the trip wasn't really deep and intense.  

Just few words about my first 2C-E trip(I mentioned it in the beginning of this post)

It was really amazing, it was like a dream, and it felt like a cycle - I "woke up" few times during the trip with the same thought. I didn't remember this trip well, so I can't say what were this thought![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) My mental activity was very suppressed, so there weren't much thoughts in my head, however they all were really deep and useful. As for the visuals, I barely could see something behind them and synesthesia was very strong. 


And what I really like 2C-E for: it pushed me into really, really unusual and strange states. I felt boundaries between my body and other world, and, moreover, I felt boundaries between "me"(my ego) and my body, I sensed my body "foreign". Could it be called "disconnection from body"?

I don't trip often, because I don't usually have good set'n'setting, and I didn't trip for 3 months before this trip.

I know it, but such significant events happen rarely. Everyday life is quite boring, actually.

>

I am thinking about it. But what does "different setting" mean? I never tripped outside rooms. I now have an idea to trip on God Is An Astronaut concert, because I often listen to their music while tripping, but it will happen only in February. I also think about walking outside, but not sure if it is a good thought - I don't like winter. What settings do you prefer?

I totally agree with you, but it seems that my subconscious is alright.

if you're wanting a more intense trip there are several ways to go about it, the most obvious is to take more, but this is really a small part of the whole experience, and i'd recommend other methods first, or in conjunction with increasing dosage.  


If you're going to be in your house, the old-school LSD psychotherapy method works great.  Its basically just putting on some headphones with some good music.  Traditionally they go with classical, but there are plenty of other routes to take in that regard.  And wear eyeshades & just lay back on your couch.  Or to quote John Lennon, "turn off your mind, relax, & float downstream" ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Perhaps you would be open to a different method of ingestion, allium? Rectal administration or insufflation could provide a more intense experience.

Yeah, I would suggest sniffing 12mg snuggled up in bed, with some chill music- insanely quick comeup - blasting you into the chaotic mess of visuals and explosions of pre-orgasmic sensation coupled with an energy that feels like it needs to be released.


Once you've been peaking for a few hours *I* find it start to smack you with things you need to sort out - things you've been procrastinating with, things you've been suppressing, hitting you with different ways of looking at situations both past and present - seriously useful material, whilst still tripping your nut off.


If you've only done it in rooms, though, I would suggest taking this outside!! Trees, stars - I watched a shooting star storm for hours laying on my deck...well it was a shooting star storm to ME! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I couldn't agree more. There was a moment I felt I was becoming addicted to Heroin. Although it was not an issue at the moment I could not get myself to stop doing it, yet, I could not figure out why I still was. And so, I turned to 2C-E. Although this was not exactly a "pleasant" trip, I was able to really asses what I was doing, realize that nothing but bad would come from continued use of heroin. I destroyed the last of what I had, told myself I would never go near it again and that I should come clean to those who are close to me that could help me make sure I didn't go back to it.


And I never have! it has now been over a year since this experience.

^ Thats really good to hear. 2c-e has helped me get over being hung-up on a failed relationship and understand the girls point of view on it. I'v also found myself thinking, "Why are you tripping right now? You should be studying." Ahh, fuck school. Just 2-5 more years.

Thank you for your responses

That's how I spend my first 2C-E trip, I listened to math-rock and post-metal.

My eyes were closing automatically even if tried to keep it open![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


However it didn't work this time, maybe because I used not headphones but stereosystem - not a great difference.

Sounds like a good idea. I am going to try rectal administration. Also, I always wondered, why do nobody consider it gayish here?

Well, I don't own a scale, and I use liquid measuring for dosing. One time I tried dropping ~2ml of my 2C-I solution in my nose, and it was really painful for nostrils and throat. 

So how does compare plugging to sniffing?

hmmmm so after 8-10 trips with 2c-e over the past few months I think I can safely say it is just not for me. Mainly its the nausea, I just cant get past it. I mean the first 2-3 trips I had on 2c-e were great, no nausea, some of the strongest phenethylamine visuals I've ever had, great introspective head space for getting some down and dirty work done. But over the past few months the negative side effects have been growing in intensity and regularity with every new trip I take on it. Started as just throwing up once and being done with it, but as I kept going back (and there were days if not weeks inbetween each trip) I found myself getting worse nausea each time. The second to last time I took it I vomitted 8 times before the nausea finally became manageable at around 3 hours in. Now I'm not uncomfterable with vomitting but I mean the level of nausea this compound produces is just ridiculous. Makes it totally not worth it IMO. And its not like I'm taking huge doses or anything, never less then 15 mg but never more then 30 in all my trips.


My latest ride on 2c-e I took the advice I've seen in this thread to try dramamine to reduce the nausea, and it did not work at all accept to say that I threw up only 3 times instead of 8... And maybe if it was just normal phenthylamine nausea, you know, feel sick for a few minutes, throw up and get it over with, that I could deal with all day, but its so much worse then that. I mean I legitmately feel like I've been poisoned the first two or three hours on 2c-e. Maybe if there was a euphoric push during the come up it would make it worth it, but theres not. I'll try rectal admin within the next few weeks to see if that helps but I really think thats my last shot at becoming friends with 2c-e. Which is a shame because it produces one of the most unique and interesting psychedelic states I've ever been apart of, but nothing is worth the nausea it produces.

Has anyone ever used 2C-E as a straight stimulant? I remember low nasal doses being very stimulating and not very psychedelic at all, so I definitely think this would be possible - and I was wondering if anyone had any experience with it, and if so, what kind of dosage did you use, and what ROA?


I'd just like to have a second use for it since I have like 750mg still and I'm not tripping very often, so I might as well have a secondary use for it.

VERY good advice.  Closed eyes (or even better, open eyes looking out into  100% utterly dark room) with music... I prefer loudish music over big speakers, bass boost... the vibrations I feel with entire body seem to trigger more visuals and intense psychedelic mental processes... but headphones are great too but different, more "inward".  Speakers feel more "in the world" and epic, and peak moments of psychedelic rock like YES those bass vibes can feel nearly orgasmic!!!


Another way for more intense trip is to try mushrooms with the temporary MAO-A inhibitor Syrian Rue seed, which gives a much more intense, more genuinely spiritual experience than shrooms alone... less of the shoom anxiety as well at least for most people.  There is the sensation of an otherworldy "guide" in the air around you as well I and others find.


ON A TOTALLY EMPTY STOMACH: Take 3g (1 slightly heaping table teaspoon) Syrian Rue seeds, grind to a fine powder (using a coffee bean grinder is super easy... find em for 10-15$), ingest (powder on back of tongue in small 1/4tsp increments followed  by a strong sweet juice chaser, OR mix with honey or peanut butter).  Wait about 45 minutes till you fell a pleasant little buzz (the MAOI has taken effect) and then swallow 2g dried cubensis shroom powder.  Enjoy.

^ Hey bro, good advice, but this is the 2CE thread, not the 'shroom thread. I don't know if the MAOIs are going to be exactly the same effect, but I assume it would play a similar role.

Yes, I've stated that it is my favorite ADD drug. It adds a desire to learn and the ability to learn without a normal 'grind' that amphetamines have.

I seem to have come across the same nausea issues with 2Cs, I used to take fairly large doses, 40mg of 2C-E being my largest dose. I was just fine the whole trip, too. I tried various methods of ingestion to try to get around the nausea. after some trail an error with dosage levels and method of administration I found one that works! 


if you want to try 2C-E again, this is what worked for me: 15mg dissolved into a 20oz drink (I have used both green tea and OJ) drink evenly over the course of about 30 minutes (maybe try over an hour if you want to play it safe). This will allow your stomach to more throughly breakdown and absorb the substance gradually, which in turn allows your body to easier adjust to the new state in which you will be in for the next few hours. not only did this help combat the nausea, but it also mellowed out the anxiety on the come up.

Moe, you do know about benedryl right?


I've used 5mg-10mg for ADD. It works wonders. It is always taken orally. A bit of magic is given to my activities, I never get as good visuals as everyone else, but I do get them a little bit. It doesn't bother me, and I've driven tripping, crashed once when I was coming down from it, due to being stupid, not the drug itself.

I forgot to add, 2C-E doesn't give me nausea anyway, so that won't be an issue for me. The thing is I want to get the perfect dosage so that the stimulation is there but so that there are no signs of a trip, as I think while 2C-E is usually clearheaded, it can still interfere a little if you're looking for straight stimulation.

try starting around 5mg and working up from there, 10mg was a light trip where I was fully functional, easily able to go about my day (aside from eating), but I still experienced time dilation which sometimes made me have to double think what i was in the process of doing when i would move from room to room.

I've done up to around 50-55mg myself and I very much prefer the higher doses, I also actually notice less negative side effects and more of the enjoyable effects the higher I dose. Admittedly those doses were with a bit of tolerance so I assume this trip will be even stronger, but I'm all for crazy experiences.


Edit: In the end I snorted ~5mg around 3 hours ago, I'm still extremely stimulated and it did get a little trippy, I think the 6 week break from all drugs definitely threw my tolerance out the window. In the end I didn't dose more, but just enjoyed the stimulation, which I'm still doing now.

**2c-e solubility**


So a friend on mine recently came across 5 grams of 2c-e and wanted to break it down to a really low ratio of distilled water of alcohol. He wants to mix 1000mg or 1 gram of 2c-e to 2.5 ml. Which would break it down to one drop of a sweet breath vial to 10mg of 2c-e. WHat would break it down best and would such a low ratio work? I have had drops of 2c-b that where 20mg a drop in liquid form so i thought this would work also? thanks

2C-E HCl is soluble at roughly 20mg/ml.  Be sure you use distilled water at room temperature.

Which would break it down to one drop of a sweet breath vial to 10mg of 2c-e. WHat would break it down best and would such a low ratio work? I have had drops of 2c-b that where 20mg a drop in liquid form so i thought this would work also? thanks

doubt you could get it to go into solution at that concentration, but i'm not sure.  Also, to really use liquid dosing accurately you would need to use a metered dropper & a concentration more like 20-40mg/mL.  Also, for basic questions like this, please use the Big & Dandy Thread

I feel like I don't hear enough about 2ce doses below the oral 10 mg range. I have had a few experiences between 5 - 12 mg. Most of them have been stronger than expected. I'd like to hear other people's opinions on the smaller doses. I think 5 isn't really enough, doesn't get you anywhere besides feeling weird. And 12 is where things start to get crazy, and somewhat visual for me.


8 mg of 2ce eaten with my friend the other night. It was a do nothing day. We dosed around 4 in the afternoon and made dinner. The come-up was long and drawn out. We were feeling alerts probably 45 minutes into it, but it didn't reach its peak until about 2.5 hours in. Then we stayed at a real awesome level for at least 5 more hours... and then there was a gradual come down very similar to the come up. 


The peak was great. This material has been extremely introspective in most of my experiences with it. I have went to parties with it, but mostly I think it is better as an introspective tool. It doesn't include a lot of paranoia. My mind was able to journey through different thoughts, memories, and emotions... and with that journey of the mind, I felt at peace with a lot of things. There are still a few things I'm waiting to play out in life, but for all the things that have happened, I am happy for them. 


My friend described our plateau as the most epic conversation ever... which in many ways it was. We hit on all the valuable aspects of life, and all the things that need to get done. The trip was great for the both of us... I'm pretty sure I would have had a wasted day had I not eaten the 2ce. It was good to communicate with my friend about our pasts and futures and what being stuck in the middle feels like.


The come-up / come-down was kind of shitty. There was a small headache that began 30 minutes after dosing... It didn't progress very far, but my head did have a lot of strange tension. Felt like it was buzzing/tingling. I felt like I was going to puke for a while... but it never got anywhere bad enough where I would actually have to puke. My stomach just felt really funky, like it had something for me to puke up... I was calm enough that the sensation wasn't able to overwhelm me. The nasty body feelings a less confusing than some other chems (2ct2, 5meoamt, foxy). The plateau was a break from the nasty feelings, but after 5-6 hours I was on the come down and the shitty effects started to really take hold. The headache I had during the come-up came back and it was much worse... I felt very sickly, and just wanted to go to bed. I waited probably another hour and was in bed sometime before 2. I fell asleep minutes after laying down... which is usually difficult for me...


the next day I had a lot of stuff to do... I woke up early after only having 5-6 hours of sleep, which is a decent amount for me. I had a decent breakfast that morning, and I lingering headache. I debated smoking some weed, but decided against it. Things went pretty well throughout the day, and the headache was just background noise. It didn't distract me too much, but it didn't make me feel happy... I guess the laughs during the plateau made up for it.


Overall, it was a real good experience. 8 mg is definitely enough to produce a psychedelic state of mind, and in my experience 2ce is one of the more potent 2cs. It builds more character at the higher levels, but I don't think it is necessary to eat it at the higher levels... I'd rather go with 2cb if i want the beautiful visuals... 2cb with an acid combo gives me some of my favorite visual displays. 2ce has never really intrigued me in a visual way. I have eaten it up to 20 mg. My higher dosed oral trips never produced great visuals (with the exception of a 12-13mg dose I had taken).  However, snorting the material gave me pretty incredible rainbow type visuals. Everyone had halos and rainbows swarming around them. It was pretty interesting. 


I think that I will probably mostly stick to the lower level with this chem (12mg seems to be my sweet spot).... although I am somewhat interested in trying a 25 mg dose. It probably won't be for a while.... months at least.... maybe weeks though. We'll see how life play out. 


Peace!

I did up to 30 in an oral dose, anal dose around the same. I would say that the lower doses are better if you want to get insight, higher doses just stimulate you more. I enjoy the profile of side effects, but not everyone does.

I find this to be such a versatile substance...  depending on the dosage, ROA, and any other 'secondary' drugs, it can be used for a variety of purposes.  It takes some trial and error to figure out what works in what situation.  For me, I have found the following to be useful:


A small dose of 10-12mg taken all at once is good for introspection and the potential to see ones life and the people in it from different perspectives while carrying out normal daily affairs.  


A moderate dose of 15-18mg taken all at once is good for introspection in a setting that will allow you to experience some discomfort and work through it without distraction.


A higher dose of around 25mg consumed gradually over a period of one hour allows for intense introspection and the ability bring up and determine the source of repressed feelings.  This one is great for uncovering and confronting the proverabial "800 pound gorilla in the room" that no one is talking about.  I've taken a dose like this in the company of my wife and she was amazed at how not only was I able to identify my own repressed thoughts, but hers as well.  She said it was as though I knew her better than she knew herself, which was shocking to me.  How 2C-Exquisite that moment was....


Lastly and least importantly, I've found this substance can be incredibly recreational when combined with synthetic cannabinoids (I have never combined it with natural cannabis because of testing, but what I'm about to write seems to apply as I've watched others do so, and they seem to have the time of their life).  It's as though the somatic feelings that are this substances hallmark are manifested as visuals instead.  These visuals can be difficult to interpret, although it is clear that the darker visuals seem to coincide with internal unrest.  Sometimes it is better to simply marval at them and save the real "work" for another day.  It's tempting to push the dosage very high and just have a feel-good experience.  In my opinion, anything that makes 2C-E more comfortable, greatly reduces its utility - but there is nothing wrong with that.  Just realize that while taking, say, 35mg and smoking JWH-250 throughout the experience might give you insane visuals, some interesting thoughts, and waves of euphoria reminiscent of MDMA, the true beauty of this compound in which it could actually improve your life is when it is taken in a manageable dose all by itself - at least it's like that for me.

On a random note, I'm wondering if anyone here could clarify what exactly it is about 2C-E that causes nausea. Because while I've had some light body discomfort with very large doses (40-50mg) I've never had more than a couple of seconds of nausea on this chemical. 4-AcO-DMT on the other hand, which most people say is free from nausea, produces nausea for me every time on the come up.


I seem to remember reading that high levels of Serotonin produce nausea, so is it possible that I just have naturally low levels of Serotonin, or that less is produced in me than in other people when taking something like 2C-E?

i wouldn't say it's serotonin itself that causes the nausea-- it's some combination of 5HT3 receptors in the gut, with psychosomatic links in the mind.


perhaps your personal 5HT3 receptors are more sensitive to 4-AcO-DMT than 2C-E.


i know that even when the gut is bypassed entirely (rectal or insufflated dosing) some people still report strong nausea from 2C compounds.

I'd tend to think its just a personal variance.  Typically tryptamines give me worse nausea than phens, but for most people i know its the other way around.  I doubt it has anything to do with serotonin, just different things irritate different people's stomaches.


And a fair amount of the time it is probably somewhat psychosomatic

Dunno about it not having anything to do with serotonin. I would agree that 5HT3 activity has quite a bit to do with it. Compounds known for their nausea (mescaline, 2C-E, aMT, 2C-t-7, etc) are often combined with ondansetron, a 5HT3 antagonist, and*lot* of the nausea and malaise goes away. Whether this 5HT3 action is due to "spillover serotonin" or these compounds having a higher affinity I believe is unknown.  And irritating the stomach has a bit to do with it (see differences between oral and plugging) but not everything (see differences between oral and plugging). 


But I *would* agree that a fair bit of the time it is indeed psychosomatic.

I'm currently doing some experimentation with piracetam as a potentiator and I'm happy to report a strong ++ with just 7.5mg of 2c-e.  I preloaded with 5g of piracetam and 520mg DAME.  Nice controlled visuals, amazing headspace and no bodyload at all... this is exquisite.

About 15-16mg I would say... but not with the same clarity or lack of a somatic feeling.    This was quite a unique feeling.  I think the DMAE might be a significant factor as well.  For the sake of science I'm going to try preloading with the same dose of DMAE and 1/4 the dose of piracetam as well as with no piracetam at all.  I've preloaded with piracetam before and it seems like the degree of potentiation has a lot more to do with the dose of DMAE than of the piracetam (DMAE, which is thought to act as a choline precursor by penetrating the BBB and being methylated in the brain to form choline and ultimately ACh).   Incidentally this was the highest dose of DMAE I have ever taken before taking 2C-E...  I usually just take it so I don't get a headache from the piracetam, but I had a strange feeling that more might be.... MORE in this situation, and I was right.  Needs to be explored further.... by me... LOL.

**2C-E lets me down. any help?**


I had alot of high hopes for this drug when i ordered it. after the three trips ive had since all i can think of is how disgusted I am.


2Ce is an imposter. it wishes it was lsd. its feels like a dirty synthetic lsd. the body high it comes with makes you feel like you snorted a bump of meth. and sometimes can bring terrible body load comedowns. Not even the visuals seem natural. Things dont "flow" like lsd or mescaline. 


That being said I'll still give it a chance. At least one more time. Whats everyones personal opinion on dosing? Ive been snorting 20-30 mg. I love how it hits you when you snort it. Eating is too slow and gradual it seems. Not reallly into plugging, not something Ive ever explored haha. I wish the shit wouldnt burn so bad ![:!](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/argh.gif)  not the worst thing ive put up the ol nostril but damn she aint pleasant

2C-E has a character all it's own, that's for sure.  It really doesn't feel like anything other than 2C-E to me.  It does feel somewhat like a tryptamine.... like a techno-synthetic tryptamine if you will, in that I feel that buzzing sensation through my hearing and through my body that I do with tryptamines, but it's at a higher frequency and there's something about the buzz that feels... "otherworldly" if that makes sense...  as if rather than coming from the terra firma like it does on 4-HO-MET or a stiff dose of AMT, it originates from somewhere up in the sky.  In any event, it's difficult to describe, but it's so pronounced that it begs to be analyzed... I feel like the intensity of that buzzing is one of the main differences between a ++ and a +++ on 2C-E.


But back to your original question - You may have a cut or impure product if you need to snort piles of it.  My first batch of 2C-E was crap, and I had no idea how strong this stuff was until I got better stuff from a different source, and then better stuff from the source that sent me the crap the first time.  The "crap" worked fine, but I had to take at least three times the dose as I did of the pure product.  I was in for a rude, rude awakening when I took 30mg of the pure product after getting used to what 30mg of the weak stuff did...

FYI, the 2C-Xs and most phenethylamines are volatile oils as freebases, not crystalline like tryptamine freebases.  You would never receive 2C-E in this form.  If it's crystalline or a powder, it's a salt, most likely the HCl.

When I had only done 2C-E a few times, I foudn it to have a nasty bodyload, but now when I use it it feels great, mescaline-like sort of but not THAT great ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I find the bodyload psychosomatic... if you're feeling anxiety, it feels toxic, but if you're feeling happiness it feels warm and comfy.


Too bad you're not willing to try rectal because it's exceptionally smooth and bodyload-free that way, FAR better effects than snorting it in my opinion, for about the same dosage as snorted.   IM is apparently also very smooth and a great way to take it, but I've never done it.

I hear you, yet I still love it for it's synthetic qualities - it's fucking hardcore - plus that' the point isn't it?? There will generally not be any synthetic compounds which feel natural or organic...especially phenethylamines from my experience - 4-AcO-DMT was the only one I've done which felt anything like the natural feeling of 4-HO-DMT, or the super crazy feeling off LSD (not done mescaline, couldn't speculate).


This *could* be because you're consciously digesting a totally synthesized drug and the *feeling* is psychosomatic - you're thinking about the fact it's synthetic ergo it "feels" this way...OR it *could* be some intrinsic quality of this particular phen.


I'd go with the first - if someone spiked your drink with a low dose of this, and said it was mushrooms, I doubt you'd feel like you'd been dosed with something unnatural.

re; the techno-synthetic qualities comment - this is a really good way of putting it -  remember when I did it the first time, and I thought to myself "now THIS is a designer drug, fuck me this is".


I also heard the buzzing - due to ROA (insufflation), I didn't really have time to turn any music on, so listened to the undulation of the fan on my PC.


Still rocked my world lol.

I just plugged 5mg of this stuff and it was the most unpleasant come up i've had in some time, with plenty of nausea, vomiting and then dry heaving.  The only thing I had in my stomach was Coca Cola.  I appear to be getting some visuals now.  The come up was the most unpleasant thing I'd experienced and so far I wouldn't describe any of these feelings as being "good" in any way.


Yeah screw this I have no reason to touch this stuff

This is not universal.  I just spent a while in the bathroom from rectal administration puking my guts out.  This stuff makes me feel sick.

Jwh-250 is my Cannabinomimetic of choice these days.  I've heard that it's a full agonist but I'm not sure that it is -its much more forgiving at high doses than say Jwh018 If that is any indication of its intrinsic activity....

Well, for me, rectal admin eliminates all the bodyload.  2C-E is kind of a rough come-up in general, or it can be.  Anxiety really leads to strong physical reactions with this, and those inexperienced can get pretty anxious on the come-up.  


Of course, it might just not agree with you, like any chemical.  We're all different and drugs affect us all differently.

I had a good trip once the physical reactions subsided.  It was a bit on the long side, and I hadn't taken enough to be fully "tripping" but enough to get a feel for the substance.  I'll probably try it again, but next orally.  It won't be a "go-to" substance for me, I think 2c-d takes the crown for that.

Well, looks like the stuff I got was bunk. All it did after I ate it was give me stomach cramps. Been 3 hours now and still no visuals, don't even feel high.


Shit sucks, but I didn't spend a whole lot so I guess I got off easy. Probably flushing the rest down the toilet though.

seagal26: I dont like oral. it takes too long to hit and you dont trip as hard. I havent plugged it yet but i enjoy nasal ROA. It has a bit of a comeup but once you get past the twenty minutes of comeup its enjoyable. 2C-E still not my drug of choice though. Ill keep it around to dose a lil bit on when i have some lsd, mushrooms, or some other trip. I think it makes for some nice visuals when mixed with other hallucinogens

I got a new batch of 2ce and decided to have a lazy Sunday. Definitely a good day after dosing 16-17mg. I was EXTREMELY surprised at the lack of body load and nausea after ingesting 25mg of DPH. It was amazing, just 25mg almost completely elimimated any side effects.


Lasted longer than I anticipated, but overall it was great.

when did you take the DPH, 2C-E would be perfect is not for the nausea and bodyload during the come up. It's almost beginning to seem not worth it sometimes.

Yeah I completely understand. A lot of times when I would like to trip I hold back because of the bodyload

/nausea. I took the DPH 30mins before I orally ingested ~17mg. I've done 2ce many times before  so I know what to expect. With the DPH I was surprised there was ZERO nausea. The bodyload was present but not prominent and didn't bother me at all.


I have a feeling I'll he tripping a lot more after this discovery.

Wow, did you try DPH with other 2Cs? I think DPH should work well for them too, but anyway it would be nice to hear real people experience. 


I hoped to try 2C-E with DPH today, but unfortunately I din't found it in the drugstores near my home. But I am sure, for the next 2C trip I will have DPH. 

Anyway, I tripped today(16 mg), and it was really wonderfull experience. As for the bodyload, there wasn't much it, and, what is awesome, I noticed some synaesthesia between muscle tension and music.

dph is the same thing as benadryl which should be very easy to find at a drugstore.

^ Yep, but I live in Russia, so the situation here is quite different ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I know the brand name of DPH(it is different here), I visited 6 drugstores, five of them weren't selling it. In another one, I was asked for a prescription, and of course, I didn't had it. 


I still consider it is not a problem to buy it, I am going to check few more drugstores. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**Looking forward to a 2ce Weekend**


Hi guys!


This is my first actual post apart from introducing myself in the relevant thread!


As I mentioned in that thread a friend of mine is very interested in, you might say studying chemistry. He often sends me new substances to try that he thinks I might like (he does not make them himself)


A while back he sent me some 2ce which I was saving for the right moment. That moment came when I had just finished dj'ing in a late night cocktail bar, got home to my humble abode and received a call from a friend who asked if i wanted to go round for a few beers. I did, and brought the stuff. 


I had read that it was a difficult substance, I did not find it so. Not sure if it was because I was drunk but I thought it was completely awesome. Kinda like my experience with 2ci. I think that's what it most resembled based on my experiences. No head fuck, lots of laughing and loads of wobbly visuals. The only thing I guess was I think I did a few runny shits, but that's all good!!!


Anyway, he sent me some more, I have 40mg this time to share with me and one friend, which is a few mg more than we did last time.


Looking forward to an awesome time!!


report to follow!! (in the correct thread of course)


Take it easy folks!

what was your dose?  Sounds like 17-18mg?  Hard to tell from your post.  I'm glad you had an enjoyable time with this substance.  I plugged 5mg and could sense the difficulty of the substance, but I do look forward to a 10mg oral dose.

yea my friend said each vial had about 17-18mg in it. We ate it.


Really good!! So far my favourite of the 2c's, although didn't get any actual seeing stuff that's not there visuals, just crazy distortions of what was already there, finding everything really funny, also coming up with some what I thought at the time, was really clever stuff!!! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hmmm, I would definitely call 2C-D the least interesting of all psychedelics I have as of yet laid my hands on.

There's just no substance to it - for me. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

Can you give us some thoughts on relative dosages of 2c-e and 2c-i (relative to each other and themselves consumed alone)?  I'm interested in this.

Of course! I'd be happy to give some thoughts on the relative dosages.

That's what this forum is all about, right? Helping eachother etc...


Anyway, depending on the variant with which you get more bodyload issues (would be 2C-E for most I guess) I would either start with:

14-16 mg 2C-I and 8-10 mg 2C-E

or

12-14 mg 2C-E and 12 mg 2C-I


For reference:

I normally take 18-20 mg 2C-I for a casual trip (techno party).

My preferred dosage for 2C-E is 15-16 mg.


If you'd like some additional advise, feel free to PM.

When you list your normal dosages etc, I could have some more thoughts about an appropriate ratio. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I can't PM yet.  2c-i doesn't thrill me, i'd much rather mix 2c-d.  My normal 2c-d dose is 70mg.  My normal 2c-i dose is 15mg - 45mg (45 mg split into 15mg doses over a few hours).  Last time I took 2c-d i took 15mg of 2c-i and 70mg of 2c-d and got very nearly a +4 experience... Definitely beyond +3, but not quite +4.  As I've developed tolerance 2c-i ceases to do anything enjoyable for me.  Maybe time for a break?

2C-D is definitely a good candidate for easy mixing.

It has no big identity of itself, but can really potentiate other phenethylamines.


Shame to hear you don't find much comfort in 2C-I, most people have it as one of their favs.

But I would definitely try the 2C-E/2C-I combo at least once.

You might not really enjoy 2C-I by itself, but if you like 2C-E the 2C-I will definitely bend the effect of 2C-E a bit.


About the break...what do you call a break (lengthwise) and how often do you take phenethylamines atm?

Tolerance can develop, but is usually not really harsh with psychedelics.

Have you ever had the chance to test the purity of your powders/content of your capsules?

Recently read some reports that more RC powders then you would think are around 80% pure.

I find 2c-i enjoyable, just not very interesting, and I fear the body stimulation could become too much at higher doses.  Perhaps I just haven't taken enough.


I haven't quite cracked the "nut" of 2c-d, so I will withhold judgement in that I am not sure if it has an identity of its own or not.  I've always taken it with 2c-i to good effect.  I don't get visuals on 2c-i, but if I add in 70mg of 2c-d, magic happens.  I attribute this to the 2c-d more than the 2c-i.  I will have to perform more experiments.


I consume phenethylamines right now about once every 2 weeks.  I was dosing weekly for a bit.  Now I mix up my phenethylamine use with tryptamine use, but I will typically ingest something on a weekend, even if its a smallish dose of 2c-i or something.


Haven't tested the purity of the powders.  I have no real means or interest in doing so.

Tried 2c-e for the first time last night; great experience! DPH really helped. 


However, I was quite surprised at mental ease and lucidity of the trip, given that I've heard people refer to it as an "ego shreeder" many times. I have to wonder if tolerance was the key factor, or if I'm merely a hardhead...


The previous night I had done 3 hits of (VERY) degraded acid and about 25mg of 2c-D. This provided an enjoyable, but very mild +2 trip. The next day (last night), I decided to do 2c-e. I knew tolerance would be an issue, so I decided to up the dosage and choose a more intense ROA to make up for this.


First, I plugged 20mg. After about 2 hours, I was at a very mild +2, extremely similar to a light 2c-i or 2c-d trip. I knew that the drug had finished coming up, and also knew tolerance was the cause of this. So, I decided to take 20 more mg orally. After another hour, I felt slightly more inebriated, but still, easy on the body and light visuals - and virtually NO mental alteration. FINALLY, I thought to myself, "shit, I am not totally wasting 40mg of 2c-e. I'm going to snort this shit." So, I snorted 15mg. This is where things finally got going - the visuals increased 10 fold, I saw wonderful floral patterns on a mere blank white wall, saw entrancing hieroglyphics on my couch, in addition to many little stick figures. The bodyload also increased - I dry heaved a couple of times, but thanks to the DPH, this wasn't even as bad as the bodyload I get while IMing or snorting 2c-i. Once the nausea subsided (pretty shortly - after maybe an hour), I actually found the body load relatively pleasant (aside from the over stimulation when I tried to sleep - ugh) and music + synesthesia was nuts. However... my mentality was totally unaffected, aside from a slight increase in creativity. I was having extremely lucid conversations with some friends online, who weren't even aware of the fact that I was tripping. 


My guess is that a combination of tolerance and hardheadedness played a role in this - given the previous night, and the spacing of the dosages, but also taking into account the sheer volume of 2ce I consumed. My plan is to wait a week, and then take 20mg orally with a 5mg snorted - and, after I can gauge the effects at the peak, possibly supplement with some 2cd. 


I have to say though, this substance RULED! Bodyload, at least with the DPH, was totally overstated by people, I felt, and music was out of this world. After the nausea subsided, I felt a remarkable similarity to LSD at higher doses (3 + hits), and to be honest, I'm not sure I could qualitatively differentiate the two in a blind test.

I feel like the same thing has been repeated for many pages on this thread now. DPH WILL reduce nausea and bodyload as well to some degrees. From my experiences 25mg of benadryl is enough to eliminate the nasty effects of 2c-e up to a 20mg dose. After that you might want to take more benadryl. 


Does anyone have any good information on 2c-e tolerance. Ive done over 350mg of 2c-e since late september, after taking a three week break my 45mg dose barely phased me which was incredibly surprising. Its pointless taking anymore now, but i want to get a good idea of how long i have to wait till i can dose with no tolerance to 2c-e again.

Does anyone have any good information on combination of 2c-e and dxm? Since they are both fairly sedating from my experience, i think they would combine well in terms of body high. Im nervous about combining dxm with anything, and i havnt before, but this is a combination ive been thinking about for a while and might give it a shot.


Any insight bluelighters?

i snorted 2-3mg of 2ce one night, and smoked throughout the night. I got pretty decent visuals and a very trippy head set for a solid 4 hours. It was really great actually, visuals were very liquid like, whole thing felt like a more visual light acid trip. It was nice. Its so pwerful it blows my mind.

Theres plenty of info on this if you even attempt to use the search engine.  If you go to the first page of this thread you can also find a thread on 2ce + dissociatives.

I'd imagine even with DPH the combined bodyload of 2c-e and dxm would be horrifying. Just my guess, though.

yea i did that for new years this year haha. was a good time, i did delsym so in a combination with 2ce i had a little bit of nausea. But was a very visual time. I waited til i started feeling the effects of the dxm before snortin the 2ce. VERY VISUAL!!


one of my buddys came out to our party in the country and he flew off the road and high-centered his truck in a snowdrift. So were flying 55 on the frozen tundra blarin kid cudi- felt like i was in a moon-rover going to help our buddy stuck in a crater. it was a good time despite the -20 degree weather

threw some pot into the mix about an hour ago. sent me to another world.


I take a step outside and looked around not noticing much then i look down to light my j and as i get it to go take my first hit and looked up...


Lost in space... 


Then I thought a message was written in my neighbors yard.


Never the less no matter which way you take 2C-E, expect a hour's worth of downtime filled with some sort of discomfort. After that..

tried a 2c-e flip (2c-e + mdma) last night. turned out pretty successfully, not what i was expecting really.


took 15mg (have some tolerance from acid on monday), the visuals and time distortion were very strange, but it taught me some really cool lightshow moves. 


i can understand the sparkle flip moniker, whenever i looked at my phone it was covered in sparkley things, and some other things were too. 


it was definitely lacking a euphoric push for parts, which made me wish i had just taken some acid.


i was reminded of shulgins entry about it being a difficult chemical but one that people wanted to explore more. i found it really difficult when it first hit me, but i fully intend to explore it with a higher dose of 2c-e, mostly because i want to see if it can teach me more lightshow moves or teach me anything. :D

as for now, 25mg DPH down the hatch, eagerly awaiting the next half hour to pass so i can take 30mg 2ce. very excited :>

^sorry I didnt notice this earlier.   For 30mg 2C-E you will probably need more DPH than that, according to reports from others (I never tried over 22mg 2C-E).  Well perhaps it will be helpful enough.  Please let us know how it goes!  Good Luck!!!

well, interestingly i endedup taking another 25mg of DPH immediately after posting that.


regardless, 30mg was too much - felt very toxic, akin to how i felt after IMing 2c-i at 25mg. the first 3 hours were spent vomiting and hunched in agony. the plateau and come down were really nice though... listened to some chopin in a shower and visualized rainbows everywhere. 


i dont know how im going to titrate the dose exactly, 20 felt underwhelming but 30 was just retarded. hmm...

Perhaps you could take 20 mg, and then take an additional 10 mg about an hour  later?

This way the coming up is spread out and less intense, while the plateau phase will be of equal/comparable intensity.

You could also go for 25 mg of course, but that's too obvious and it just looks more professional to do it in a different way. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Just had my first 2c-e experience this weekend with a 10mg oral dose.  I took it on an empty stomach and dropped 25mg DPH an hour before.  I took 18mg of 2c-I two weeks ago and didn't enjoy my experience.  I'm a big fan of mushrooms and have a bit of experience with them.


I found this dose to a perfect introduction into this substance!  I found the body load to be no problem, my body felt really good!  The headspace created is vast and is quite introspective even at 10mg.  This is my kind of psychedelic... Not a walk in the park but with some effort it has so much ability to tease the emotional fabric of my mind. High quality headphones and music with personal meaning had me seeing some interesting CEVs with color enhancement.  Colors didn't change as the music played but they would change as the feeling of the music shifted! 


Sound distortion was weeeeeird! I heard my neighbors out an open window and I swear it sounded like they were next to my head.  A large truck stopped near my house and the sound off the rotors made me laugh out loud because it sounded like a 50ft robot had just stopped by to kill me lol. 


Going to go up to 14-15mg oral next.  I even managed to have sex near the peak and it was so damn divine!


Only downside is the stimmy nature of the drug.  My heart rate was in check but I kept sweating and shaking throughout.  Slight hand tremors. 


Adding cannabis made the trip so much more euphoric and visual and nitrous on top of that was just perfect.  


This isnt a substance for everyone and I had my fair share of anxious moments during the trip! If you apply yourself properly and make sure set and setting are right, 2c-e can really deliver!

For anyone who doesn't like the excessive stimulation of 2c-e: simple solution if you're into it - DANCE.


I went to a concert tonight after snorting ~8mg of 2c-e. FUCKING INCREDIBLE! I haven't had a more blissful night in months - I danced and danced away, totally into the music having massive closed eye synesthesia and melting into the music. The stimulation, when moving around constantly, converts into this ungodly amazing body high that feels akin to a great roll to me. Honestly, two girls asked me if I was rolling face because I was getting so into the dancing, haha. Absolutely fuckin incredible - and music live sounded OUT OF THIS WORLD.

the last time i had a grip of 2ce, i quickly worked my way up to enjoying 30 mg doses.... and it has pretty much become my favorite trip....


throughout my enjoyment of that batch i had so many mindgasm experiences.... and only once did i really freak myself out.... i wouldnt call it a negative experience, because it was still fucking awesome, and i knew i was ok....


but basically i had been peaking for 4 or 5 hours, and it happened to be the morning Tool tickets were about to become available online for the summer tour... i was waiting for that... just chillin and smoking some pot (of course)..


i had capped that batch up into 15 mg capsules... and i had laid some of them out on the desk and was watching them... really iridescent looking... glowing with blacklight .... i dont know wtf i was thinking... but i picked up 2 more caps and down the hatch they went....


let me just say that while peaking on 30.... another 30 was ...... WHEW.... god damn....


i didnt really give it any thought to what i had just done because i had double dosed before, just not even close to those levels... i was gettin some wicked sick visual distortions... and was really enjoying it... then the tool tickets came available online.... and i was trying to purchase them... i dont know if it was all in my head or if there was actually alot of traffic trying to buy tickets but i was having issues... slow loading (on a 6Mb DSL connection) and then my laptop crashed, and it was sketchy when i rebooted...


so long story short... i thought i picked up a virus or something... disassembled my laptop into a pile of parts (glad i didnt fuck it up though)... somehow i got it in my head maybe some type of law enforcement was fucking with me... and anyone who has ever had a trip along those lines should know how that shit goes.....


that was maybe an hour and a half after doubling up..... lets just say an hour after that I WAS COMING APART AT THE SEAMS.... it was, hands down, the most intense experience ive had yet.... and ive dropped a 'french fry' before... (an entire 10 strip of lsd)... white blotter.


it was fuckin nutz... but i absolutely loved every second of it in retrospect.... i ended up on the phone @ 6 am with some of my dad's friends over 300 miles away... while they chilled me the fuck out...


IT WAS GREAT

Remember that 2ce is known for having a steep dose-response curve, especially over 20mg.  I would titrate by increasing doses by 2mg increments/experience until comfortable.

I must have an unnaturally low tolerance for this substance. I drank 12 mg last night (first time!) and it was the longest, most intense experience on any substance I have ever had. The hallucinations were incredible... the floor was rippling like water and the woodgrain on my furniture was morphing. The painting on my wall was like some live action 3d tv hologram thing. After the ~first~ hour I caught myself thinking, when will this wear off? It's been forever already. I experienced eternities inside of a minute. Doing anything was difficult. Still haven't been able to sleep.


In short, 2c-e kicked my ass. This stuff, in my subjective opinion, makes LSD seem like pop rocks. Next time I will cut down my dose by about 30%, and make sure I'm more mentally and physically prepared. 2c-e is no plaything.

2c-e is interesting.  It has the potential to be the most powerful of the 2cs, but many people find it quite gentle in light doses.  If it's your first time a moderate dose might send you way over where you want to be at a festival in a crowd.

As ama said....if you are going to take 2c-e in public, please take a small dose! I have found 

2c-e to be too powerful in doses over 15mg's to use around my girl, much less random crouds. Be safe!

for those of you taking 20 mg+ how big of a step is 20 to 24 for you? I had 20 mg and found it to be slightly underwhelming and was pretty level around +7 hours...  i am on pristiq, 50 mg, daily. it is a time-released metabolite of venlafaxine (effexor) and an SNRI.

i'm no stranger to psychedelics but i'm new to 2c compounds. i tried 2c-e for the first time about 2 weeks ago and it was an amazing trip. it felt alot similar to 2c-i but the visuals i experienced were much more intense than the ones i've had on 2c-i. the body high felt very similar to a mild roll and the audio/visual effects resembled a relatively strong dose of acid. i'd love to experience it some more!

like acid but cleaner, fast emotion change happy sad happy sad, acid smiles and laughs, skitts you out like mdma or speed, your eyes will tug and move freely like with mdma, wayy more euphoric than acid or mushrooms, everything constantly shifts n melts, to me the visuals are better than acid and they last longer, you also dont fry yourself like with acid

My first dose was 23 mgs but I say a goood starting dose would be 15mgs for some one not experienced with psychs. It's a little more clear headed than acid or  shroooms. It has very strong visuals and you can actualy see the music.

took 16-20mg once and puked my guts up halfway into the comeup in the most controlled, neat, precise manner ever. (into a bin) 

after that it was smooth sailing. patterns. EVERYWHERE. 

i enjoyed the colour enhancement of the OEVs more than acid tbh, and i love my acid. 

but it was more purpley with deeper reds n greens n blues/purples hues around most objects light refracted off of. 


aka everything was like a vibrant purpley green red outlined version of itself. 

saw some stuff. learned some things. id recommend it, but i wouldnt do it again for recreation unless i had an ROA that could eliminate the nausea. fuck going through that again! 


all in all a very rewarding chemical.

When i was 18 i got started on effexor, the last time i was able to roll was also at this time.  around november of last year I decided to kick the antidepressants, i am now 21.  


being on this medication seriously fucked with my life.  I consider the first day of my entire life march 1st 2007, when i had my first MDMA pill. effexor took the experience of rolling away from me.  


back on topic:  2C-E, which i have a good amount of experience with both on and off effexor,  as well as pretty much any other psychedelic will have its effectiveness GREATLY diminished by the daily use of effexor (or other anti-depressants), if not absent - which was the case even though I took around a half gram of molly over the course of 90 min last time i tried it, which was august of last year.


If theres one drug I fully regret taking its effexor.  I also feel as though it altered my baseline mood long term and for the worse.  


the primary effect i get from 2C-E, (other than general unique psychedelia) is a feeling of time and events falling into place perfectly just as they should.  in other words nearly every time ive dosed, It was the perfect time to dose. this feeling of events falling into unison has also been brought up by tripmates.  its like indescribably profound feeling of being in tune with time and the universe at the moment of the experience.

**question regarding 2c-e**


Ok, been reading around for a few. This is my first post - don't think Ill be breaking rules here, but I'm sure youll let me know.


Could 2c-e possibly not burn or have a non-bitter, almost faint sweet taste in small or diluted doses?


A friend of mine ordered (from a recommended and somewhat reputable source - not found on any scam report websites) what he was told was 250 mg of 2c-e. It came, he prepared, researched, waited, then a week later weighed and orally dosed a 1 mg allergy test. No reaction after 1 hour, so he then dosed 5 mg orally. After 1 hour, he felt something starting to happen, but couldve easily been placebo. After another 30-40 min, he orally dosed another 5 mg, then sniffed 3 mg 25 min later. Then another 3 mg sniffed.... then 6 mg sniffed. There was no burn whatsoever, and no significant increase of effects, although he seemed to feel some light stimulation. 

My friend is a high metabolism male weighing 160 lbs - rather extensive psychedelic and other drugs experience over the last 14 years. He is on 36 mg daily methadone maintenance which he gets no recreational effects from. He consumed the RC 6 hours after his methadose.


Could this be the result of just low purity or would it still burn and taste bitter? Are there any forms of 2c-e that are not as bitter or burning and have a faint sweetness? Are there any other rcs that match this description (2c-i) that may have accidentally been sent to him?


There were 2 others who recently had negative feedback from the same purchase (after I had already ordered). I am awaiting specifics from both. One said "he described one product, then delivered another" - I am awaiting specifics on what he means by that - purity or completely the wrong chem.


I used the search engines before posting this - did not find my answers although I did find someone who purchased 2c-i that had a "faint sweetness".


Thanks for the help - looking forward to posting here more regularly!

All 2Cs I tried(including 2C-E) have very bitter chemical taste, noticable even when diluted as 0.1mg/ml(15 mg dose in a cup of water). And I doubt if any adulterant/additional impurity can hide this taste.

It can't be 2C-I either. 2C-I has similar taste, and it burns your nose. Also, 2C-I is active in similar dose range, so your friend should felt at least some psychedelic effects from the described dose.


I don't know about possible interaction with methadone, but many folks do psychedelics in combination with opiates, so I guess 2C-E while on methadone is alright. 


Overall, it sounds like your friend got scammed and at best he got highly impure chemical. Hope this helps.

2c-e was my first psychedelic (not counting salvia or the time I OD-ed on nutmeg). I took about 12mg, with about a 6mg booster a couple hours in (my brother eyeballed the dose, but I'd guess it was somewhere between 15-20mg total) orally. This was at [Bonnaroo](http://www.bonnaroo.com/) years ago, so I just added it to my water bottle so that I could get through security without problems. 2c-e was very visual for me. Lots of "auras", trees moving in unnatural ways, the music was excellent. The CEVs were fantastic for me. Very vivid. I usually get "fractal" type CEVs from other psychedelics, but 2c-e was definitely more"entity" style for me. A very unique drug.


And yes, the taste is very acidic. Didn't notice it when mixed with water, but the booster was dropped right on my tongue. I can only assume that snorting it would be extremely uncomfortable.

it was pure for sure very reliable source, straight from the chem to me basically, no tolerance to it iv just been in so many different situations, could be trip tolerance i guess but not the 2ce it self, the only things i have much of a tolerance for is mdma,cannabis,lsd. 40mg was fuckin wild deff forgot that it was safe 2 hrs in lol, it was similar to lsd loops but cleaner in many different ways

**Taking 2C-E at a party**


So I got a party I'm going to over the weekend. Wanted to know if anybody else has experienced with 2c-e in a party / venue atmosphere. 


I've tried 2c-e once before at a low dose (10mg). I didn't get any visuals until about 3 hours into the experience and they were minimal. I plan on dosing 15mg this time. I wanted to get any advice from people who have dropped at a rave or public party before. Do you think it's safe and was the vibe good? I know everyone reacts different but any experiences would be appreciated.


Thanks

The step from 10-15mg will probably lead to more of an increase in effects than you'd expect. I'd say that at 10mg you should *definitely* have experienced noticeable effects and they should have come on a lot earlier than the 3-hour mark. 


I assume that the 15mg you're planning to take is from a different source / batch? If so then be careful as you may well have taken adulterated product the first time, so this 15mg may hit you a lot harder.  


Having said that, I really enjoy 2 C-E in a party atmosphere. Some people find the 'head trip' a bit too overpowering for that kind of setting, but if you're comfortable with it and amongst people you trust (that's the crucial part) then you should be fine. 


Enjoy. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

This is actually from the same batch. I also dosed about 250mg of methylone the first time that I tried the 2c-e (10mg). That could have possibly taken away from part of the 2c-e I suppose. I'll be at the party with another one of my friends who is also taking the same dose. Other than that I won't know anyone. The visuals really didn't get intense at all. I only really got them when I found my eyes wandering off. But like I said they were minimal. I feel ike the 10mg I took just wasn't enough so that's why I decided to bump it up to 15. 


15mg is still a normal to low dosage from what I've asked of people who are somewhat experienced with this rc. I feel like it's a safe increment from my first dose to atleast have an idea of what to expect. Do you really think 5mg more will hit me *that* much harder? 


Thanks for the input btw.

The dose / response curve from 2 C-E is pretty steep, so expect more than you bargained for, especially without the methylone stinking up the trip. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Any dose at 15mg or above is definitely moderate rather than low IME. You seem to know what you're doing though. A sober friend coming along would be ideal, but in practice it's often awkward to do that, if only because the sober person gets pissed off at your psychedelic ramblings. 


All told, I'd say you're in for  good night.

Ive tripped 2C-E at a venue and it was a very good time one thing i did though was take some benadryl before the trip to mellow out the sometimes overpowering body high and i just made sure to stick with my friends so i didnt get lost.

^ I did similar, but with a small amount of alprazolam and lots of weed. Certainly helps, and you're right aout the body high being potentially overpowering.


Never had the nausea really, but that might be due to the weed. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Thanks for the tip I got some benadryl that I'll predose with. It wasn't really the body high though that I was worried about was more the mind fuck being in a public place and whatnot.

Good gawd that was intense. Didn't kick in for about 3 hours but it was a fucking mind altering experience when it did. I've never fried before so I couldn't compare it but everything was so slowed down and light shows were fkn amazing

I have a lot of experience with multiple psychedelic compounds, and find DMT, LSD, Psilocybin, and 4-AcO-DMT to be my favorite materials thus far, and these are the only compounds I've achieved what I truly believe is self transcendence.  Here's my opinion on 2C-E ^_^


I had my first experience with 2C-E almost two years ago. The experience, for lack of a better word, was extremely difficult, mainly the physical effects and the persistent body load. However, I was fascinated by the idea that besides the fact that it is very hard on the body, Shulgin had the impression that this compound was very worthwhile, and he hoped to understand 2C-E's full mechanism of action, eventually. I decided the next time I came across this compound I would really start immersing myself into the experience, to see if there was anything there worthwhile, in a self transcendence or enlightenment sense, I felt I enjoyed where my mind was at and though I wanted a a psychological trip comparable to that of my LSD experiences, I was mainly focused on the ability to connect to something, and have the ability to wander mind space and the array of out of body and mind blowing spiritual experiences I've had with LSD. 


So now we're at the present, I've had around twenty 2C-E experiences and I've finally decided to give this compound a rest, and for me, it's going to rest permanently. What I explain further into this writing, is from a complete subjective sense, how I feel about this compound, and the effects I've had from it. If you disagree and feel like sharing your experience, by all means do so, but nobody should accuse anyone of being wrong, because we tend to forget how subjective these things are. I'll be posting notes I've taken and just give my thoughts on my experiences as a whole. Hope you enjoy 


With 10mg ingested orally, I notice 2C-E puts me in a familiar state of psychedelic intoxication. At this dose I find euphoria to be extremely lacking, slight increase of body temperature, but in comparison to all my experiences with this compound, I find 10mg to be the best dose.(When it comes to comfortability.) The mental effects of 2C-E at this dose are almost non existent, I can't do much in the realm of meditation, I find music to be slightly more interesting and enjoyable than being sober, but not remarkably so, it's almost not noticeable. This dose always becomes a visual experience, and I find myself having everyday appreciation for things like the stars or moon, as I would in a sober mind set. If it is day, I can stare and have great appreciation for trees and grass, but even at 10mg I have no visual distortions, just slight enhancement comparable to any entactogens or psychedelic at low doses. There is no report with nature, no increased intuition, I equate this dose to just getting high off a phenthylamine. Not too much here. 


With 20mg I find the body load to be almost unbearable at times, and this is when 2C-E becomes a compound I'm only comfortable doing alone. Visually reminiscent of most psychedelic phenehtylamines, and appreciation for aesthetics is pronounced. Still no real euphoria, I can feel my blood pressure is up and my temperature is quite elevated. Music is enjoyable at times, but I have a hard time integrating the experience because the body load is so uncomfortable. Listening to people's voices on the radio or television becomes a task, sometimes they speak unbelievably fast, and sometimes quite slow, the distortion of sounds becomes very interesting, but when they register in my psyche they don't produce any driven euphoria like one would except on a dose of LSD or psilocybin, still very interesting nonetheless. A few hours in I generally get used to the body load at this dose, but I still find the psychological effects to be uninteresting. Still no insight into the universe, still no real connection, I do however find my pets are aware of my stimulation at this dose, they seem to be acting bizarre around me. I attempt to meditate and fail miserably, the body load is distracting to the point where I can't let go and separate mind from body.


With 33mg, I recognize this compounds dose response curve. This dose was shockingly intense, and there is a great sense of toxicity when it comes to the physical effects. My limbs tremor with uncomfortable energy, I feel extremely hot and can feel my blood pumping in my neck, very uncomfortable. The visual effects are astounding, beautiful fractals and geometric shapes are being perceived in almost every object, but I can't help but feel like I would be enjoying myself greatly if I had ingested a different compound. Still very reminiscent of other PEA's but very intense, colors and shadows are running together, reminds me of DOB at this dose. Closed eyed visuals in a dark lit room are beautiful, but they are hard to concentrate on due to how uncomfortable I am. Nausea is at it's peak, and I am surprised by the end of the experiment I did not vomit. Psychological effects still uninteresting, I find random things pop into my head that don't really have to do with anything, and I still experience no enlightenment, or insight into how the universe works. Meditation was a complete failure.


With 10mg insufflated, I find the body load is more bearable, but definitely present. Almost identical report to my 20mg experience.


It feels like 2C-E is lacking something for me. I have great respect for this compound, but it doesn't deliver in the area I wish it did. I am very fond of LSD, psilocybin, DMT, and other tryptamines and a few psychedelic PEA's because of their ability to manifests themselves in my mind in a way where I can experience self transcendence, and an array of spiritual possibilities. That being said, I think there is a lot of potential for this compound, but I find the body load and general persisting discomfort it instills in me completely inhibits me from getting to where I want to go with it. 2C-E seems to be a beautiful aesthetic enhancer, and even with this in mind it becomes a difficult one to use, because I can only use it comfortably at such limited doses. I find it could be used as a therapeutic tool for psychotherapy, yet again I question this because of the physical effects of the compound.


In regards to it and LSD, I get tired and baffled the comparison is often made. I find really no similarities between them, AT ALL, and I start to wonder how many people are ingesting psychedelic phenthylamines such as the DOxs, thinking they are taking LSD. When someone tells me they find 2C-E to be visually similar to LSD, I come to the conclusion they haven't taken high doses of either(in the sense that all psychs seem relatively similar at threshold or extremely low doses), or they have been eating DOx. I have been let down by the neutrality of this compound, it lacks in euphoria, and really doesn't produce any at all, and I have no positive mood lift like I do with other psychedelics. If the body load wasn't so pronounced for me, maybe I could achieve that mood lift and state of wonder, but I can't get there.


The pros for my subjective 2C-E experiences have been a few interesting, and borderline psychological break troughs, the appreciation of aesthetics,mainly visual and auditory aspects, and a bonding with friends. I make the comparison that taking 2C-E and expecting to meditate and self transcend is a lot like having sexual intercourse with your penis on fire, very hard to do, and very hard for any serious partaker to enjoy.


2C-E has been the most difficult psychedelic experience(also, body load) in the sense of integrating it with what I wanted to occur, and I guess I drove the difficulty trying to explore it, but I'm glad to say I have retired with this compound. 2C-E isn't good, 2C-E isn't bad, it simply just is. After my research and experiences, I am honestly confused why Shulgin lumped this in with the magical half dozen, I'd like to think there are a few more PEA's that are stronger on the mind and are gentler on the body than this compound, and I can say now I disagree with this being considered a worth while material in regards to what I'm looking for.

Finally got mine in the mail on Friday. I decided to *not* wait for my new scale and just do a liquid measurement with the whole batch (250mg). Did a 1:1 mg to ml ratio so as to avoid any silly mistakes when later attempting to dose. I'm not a retard when it comes to math but I figure the less margin for error with a substance with such a high dose-response curve the better.


I don't know how long this will last in the solution of filtered water but I figure, hell, it *is* a research chemical I might as well do a little research on it. If my money ends up getting wasted via degradation at least I can report it here and other people can avoid doing it as well ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Sleep came fairly easily at T+6:30 but I was on a low dose. I can imagine not being able to sleep on higher doses for quite some time.

Be prepared for next time when you dose higher. I first dosed at 8mg and barely felt anything... or I thought that was about how I was supposed to feel. Next time we took 15mg each and it's completely different. Crazy visuals and sounds. So, don't think you have experienced the drug yet and get cocky, lol. If you didn't get any visuals then you haven't got the full experience.

Yeah I kind of figured my dose was very low. I was definitely tripping on 8mg but it certainly didn't compare to some of the other moderate-dose reports I've seen on here. My experience closely matched that of Aldous Huxley's 1st report of mescaline in Doors of Perception.


I will definitely remain humble and respectful in the face of this psychedelic. Especially since I'm still a baby in the PEA world ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Even the jump to 10mg will make a massive difference.

One question I did have about this substance was in regards to the stomach-ache/nausea. When I'm sober dramamine completely knocks me out. like I'll take two and be out for 8 hours (I take them for long flights ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)). 


Do you guys think the light stimulation effects from 2C-E would counteract the drowsiness from dramamine? I'd like to *not* fast for a half-day again prior to dosing. The stomach ache I had from my 8mg experience was most certainly caused by being hungry and stimulated. It didn't shape my trip but it was definitely distracting at times.

Sorry, but what's the point of fasting for *a whole day* before dosing 2C-E? 

If you feel that empty stomach is better, just don't eat anything for a few hours, otherwise have light meal prior dosing. 

Also, did you stomach ache pass after come up?

Stomach ache persisted throughout the entire trip. And I honestly did mean that I'd fasted for *half* a day. Could've sworn that's what I'd typed.

@ penthos, re: dramamine


it seems to vary quite a bit. if you find 2c-e to be really "stimmy" (if it feels a lot like an amphetamine) you probably wont notice the drowsiness. i find 2c-e to be a weird mix of sedation and stimulation and have "slept" (in some sense of the word) while on 2c-e and diphenhydramine.


it definitely cures the nausea. my advice: just use one (25 mg) dramamine (about 20-30 mins before the 2c-e) and have a cup of green tea with it.


mxe cured the stomach pain for me but not the dizziness/nausea

I'm always amazed at how damn variable the effects of 2c-e are. I've experienced up to 60mg oral doses yet nothing matched the intensity of my trip yesterday at ~25mg (I think I may have found my "sweet spot") 


the visuals were out of this world intense, both OEVs and CEVs... had music blasting, stood on my balcony in the sun gazing out at the park and the streets... so incredible. The anxiety/cracked out feeling on the come down though was almost unbearable, to the point where I had to snort some addy IRs to relieve the comedown (surprisingly worked well... comedown from the addy's was far less severe) 


ive heard many people say that night time best brings out the visuals of 2ce, but i couldn't disagree more... the sunlight was perfect.

anything over 22 mgs of 2C-E for me is just fucking ridiculous.


16 mgs is a totally full on +++ for me.  I usually like to dose 18-20 mgs though.

16-18 is where i usually go, have made a couple ventures into the 22-25mg range, definitely intense, unsure as to whether i'd ever take it higher or not

Just dosed my 14mg trip ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) May pop into the social thread to have a laugh later on. Wish me luck :D

I'll be trying 2c-e for the first time this weekend. Likely at home in the comfort of my own room, not gonna be tripping with anyone else. Some of my family might be there, but tripping around them doesn't bother me. They're always asleep early anyways. Tripped on 25-30mg of 4-aco-dmt for the first time this last weekend, and it was epic and beautiful. Super excited for this 2c-e... highly considering dosing 18-20mg my first time. I've done 2c-i many times, but that's baby stuff, I feel. Purely visual for the most part. I've read a lot about 2c-e and its effects, but can any speculate on how long it'd take to kick in if I dissolved it in water and drank it on an empty stomach? I did the same thing with the 4-aco-dmt, and I started feeling effects within 15 minutes.

admittedly, i'm a hard head... but 60mg was definitely a "never again" dose and was an accident (took the wrong cap that had 3 doses in it...) 


at that point the visual/auditory effects were actually less intense than my most recent trip of 25mg, but the "toxic" body feelings were overwhelming. so much vomiting... *shudder* 


i'm thinking 25 is perfect though. every aspect (besides the body load obviously...) was great. the only non-DMT trip ive had that was more visual was 20mg of 2ce and 2 hits of moderate strength LSD followed by another 20mg two and half hours in... but the trip wasn't quite as incredible. the LSD sort of masked the serious headspace of 2c-e with its positive push... fun, but not significant.

This is how I take my 4-aco-dmt and 2C-E as I'm too impatient for dry measurements ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


For my 8mg trial I mixed the solution with a small glass of gingerale. Felt 1st alerts in 1 hour. This current trial I mixed 14mg with a small glass of an energy drink and I'm feeling 1st alerts at 30 minutes. 


That's from my limited experience with liquid dosing ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Let's let someone else jump in for some info on dry-dosing to complete the picture.


-edit- Oh both trials were done on a completely empty stomach (save for the liquid ingested, of course)

I also use liquid measurement, and injest on an empty stomach.    I find my body lets me know theres a hallucinogen in my system at around a half hour as well.  however it doesnt amount to much until about an hour and a half after dosing, then it really kicks in.

QFT. Feeling the same thing right now. 1st drug I've ever taken where 1st alerts *don't* gradually develop into peak. It's kind of like a pre-high for 1.5 hours.


-edit- Okay maybe 1.0 hours.

Dissolved and drank works great, typically about the same come-up times. For me, the duration of the first few times involved an abnormally long come-up period, to the point where we even doubted the drug's effectiveness (won't do that again!) It was something on the order of one hour before feeling effects, and another 45 minutes until the come-up began. From there it was a good hour to build into a peak. Every time I've done it was on an empty stomach, so I know that didn't affect anything.


After the initial few times, the long come-up period seemed to dissolve. We began to feel it within half an hour, and come-up after only an hour. Much better.


If its your first time doing it, please do not start with that high of a dose. This substance is extremely potent and its never a good idea to blast-off around those that may not approve of said activities on a dose that you're unsure of the effects of. Angered parents, while tripping, I can't imagine being a good thing. Start a little lower, start a little earlier, and just have fun.

1.5 hours into it now. Peak effects are in place. Cognitive abilities still intact (typing's a bitch though). Not much in the way of nausea but I did have two ginger-chews pre-dose. Music appreciation is through the damn roof. Comparable to MDMA for sure. Enjoying the body feeling of this quite alot but I've always been a strange one in the regard. I like the bodyloads from most psychedelics while most are put off by them.


No profound visuals yet but I can see them possibly forming with a little effort.

People told me not to do 25-30mg of 4-aco-dmt for my first time last week, and both my friend and I, who I tripped with, both decided we could have done more lol. And my family wouldn't be mad, I'd tell them exactly what I'd be doing and just lock myself in my room. It'd almost be like having the house to myself, especially since they're asleep by like 9PM every night.

i also feel the first alerts within about half an hour. of course, as you said, it needs at least an hour to fully kick in (orally admin.)


another question: does anyone have worse nausea, when taking it via liquid measuring? i dissolved some 2c-e in a liquor (haven't had "pure" ethanol at that time and didn't want to wait^^), and have to puke every time I take this dillution. and I never had to when taking the powder by itself (neither orally nor nasally).

How long after taking the solution do you have to puke? It could be activation of the chemoreceptor trigger zone in combination with the awfully bitter taste of 2C-E (if it happens shortly after taking the solution). You could try masking the taste with grapefruit juice or some coke (as in the beverage). There's also some OTC medication (antiemetics) to prevent vomiting, but for myself I wouldn't go taking other meds just to prevent vomiting...

I always heard Benadryl helps with the nausea, but only take like one or two 15 minutes prior to dosing the 2c-e.

Diphenhydramine is good to prevent vomiting, but since it's a first-generation antihistamine there is a high chance for sedative effects. Plus it has anticholinergic effects too, which might not combine well with psychedelics. Just some stuff to keep in mind when deciding what to do and when deciding how much you'll take. 


Personally, I think there are much better ways to prevent nausea/vomiting then pharmacotherapy. But hell, everyone should decide for themselves of course. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

yes i got this too, although was quite tired as it began to kick in anyway


also read a bluelighter say they felt the 2Cs to just feel similar to mescaline. i found something similar, but slightly different; in that the 2c-e was like having isolated only the deep, lowest layer of a cacti intoxication


glad i experienced, but little desire to repeat anytime soon. prefer acid

Decided today on my 14mg dose that I MUST combine with MDMA. I'm thinking 12mg 2C-E + 100mg MDMA.


Trip went great btw. Completely satisfied ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Visuals weren't quite as strong as I'd like them but in the same sense they were plenty intense if I let them. I almost lost my lunch looking at the clouds. It was so gorgeous so I stared and stared and then it all of the sudden donned on me how much of the cloud movement was attributed to the drugs and not the clouds lol.

Just found out my fam is leaving for the entire weekend, so I'll get to trip all by my lonesome and have the place all to myself! Trying to decide if I want to do it Friday night (won't get to dose until like 8-9PM due to my work schedule), or do it Saturday, where I can dose anytime I want during the day since I have absolutely nothing to do that day. what do?


edit/ actually, day tripping sounds a lot more epic.. I should just time it so i'll be tripping during both the day and night, so I can get the best of both worlds.

honestly, you seem pretty comfortable with the effects of that dose range, why don't you ramp it up a little bit? 2c-e is really quite rewarding in the 20mg dose area

i find the jwh series synergizes really well with the 2ce experience... cannabis as well (although not quite as much... perhaps cannabis isn't strong enough to really exert its own influence on the trip for me?) 


30mg is a good oral dose, although i would try 25 first... the dose response can be pretty steep once you start getting over 20mg. you might be surprised at how much more intense 25 can be from 20

That's just it. I'm comfortable with it so why push it? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I like the body-feeling and light visuals from the medium-low dose so far. If I combine with MDMA I want them to synergize instead of one drug overpowering the other.


I do plan to launch more tests into the 16+mg range but in slow increments just to fine-tune my sweet spot.

well, why *not* push it? there is nothing wrong with enjoying your 14mg dose experiences, I enjoy 10mg 2ce experience quite often still ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) but you don't know what you might be missing out on until you at least feel out the higher ranges 


but i agree, keep it going in slow increments. 2ce seems to have a pretty tight "sweet spot" and it can be really easy to go below or above it. you seem to be going about it in the right way ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

You might as well start snowballing or shooting up crystal meth with this reasoning... There's a reason why greedy people are never happy with what they have, and this kind of reasoning is just a form of greed (in my opinion). Of course it's a good practice to explore higher dosages, but I just don't agree with your argument for doing so. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

The dose-response curve of the 2C-x series is pretty steep...  Jumping from 14mg (which gave full effects) to 20mg in one step is probably not the best idea!

It could be activation of the chemoreceptor trigger zone in combination with the awfully bitter taste of 2C-E (if it happens shortly after taking the solution). You could try masking the taste with grapefruit juice or some coke (as in the beverage). There's also some OTC medication (antiemetics) to prevent vomiting, but for myself I wouldn't go taking other meds just to prevent vomiting...

maybe after about one and a half hour, i feel like the peak starts, when i finished clearing my stomach^^. only once i puked t+30min, but this was because I stupidly went outside on the comeup and wasn't comfortable with it. got hot flushes and rushed home, where i had to puke immediatley.

I have actually never puked from my many trips with 2ce.  Only a few times i had to run to the toilet to take a big shit but thats about.  I rarely get any nausea either.  I do get a rough body load sometimes though.

I'm really interested in 2C-E, though being in the UK, and it being a class A drug, have concerns about ordering it.


How does the body load compare to 2C-I? (Which I nickname "elektra" on the basis that the body load/energy is like an electrical current flowing through you). 2C-P's body load is a fraction as pronounced as it seemed to be for 2C-I. I'd imagine 2C-E to be similar in this regard to 2C-P.

2С-P is often cosidered to be 2C-E without side effects. I don't really agree with this opinion - in my low-dose trial(~7 mg) it was more like longer-lasting version 2C-I.


2C-E bodyload is the worst I ever had. No other psychedelic beats it(maybe 2C-T-2 comes close in high doses). 

I must admit, though it is terrible, 2C-E experiences worth it!

Yeah... I think comparing doing 20mg of 2c-e, which is a *standard psychedelic dose* that I would guess is probably the most popular dose range of most BLers, to shooting up crystal meth is a little exaggerated. I don't think anyone is going to win the Darwin award for taking a standard dose of a chemical that has been intravenously injected at 100mg type doses without causing physical harm. 


IDK guess im greedy though

I don't see any reason not to up the dose, unless you're 100% content with lower doses and want absolutely nothing else out of the trips. Advising someone to up the dose of 2c-e a few mg should not be compared to advising someone to start banging meth. That's a radical and downright ridiculous jump in logic.

25mg diphenhydramine (over the counter "Benedryl" in the US, for allergies, and sleep) seems to almost totally eliminate both nausea as well as generalized aches and pains that 2C-E can cause.  Some say if you are doing a larger dose of 30mg 2C-E (thats a pretty huge dose, btw), then 50mg of the benedryl is needed.


This has come up many times on BL and been confirmed by numerous people.


Almost makes 2C-E a new, much smoother nicer drug, really lets you focus on the fantastic psychedelic effects as opposed to trying with all your might to ignore bodyload.

I've taken suboxone (or have been on it 90% of the time when I dose 2CE) and find I usually get a pretty damn nice body high from the 2CE. Only once have I experienced stomach discomfort but eating something quickly solved that. I usually get MDMA like rushes from 2CE. Pretty crazy chemical. Enjoy your trips people and stay safe.

Continual use of 2ce seemed to null the bodyload for me, I'll note. I usually got pretty much the most extreme nausea and muscle tension you can get from it, with diphenyldramine or not... now I don't even *really* get nauseous during the come up (except for maybe sliight pangs of nausea which are easily ignorable) on 25mg doses *without* DPH. perhaps a lot of it was psychological for me and I've finally work past it... either way, it feels like a Godsend to me. 


also everyone keep in mind when deciding to hit the 20mg range that if you are having any kind of issues lately (emotional/etc), 2c-e tends to bring these to the forefront of your mind (or indeed, absolutely slap you silly with them) more than many traditional psychedelics (of course, most psyches do this to an extent... but even the smallest problems have a chance of being hugely magnified on 2c-e for me) for a lot of people. i find it to be very healthy and cathartic, although difficult as well.

This stuff is great. Has anyone fallen asleep on it? I fell asleep when it was very strong, only had like 5mg. It was strange, I was stimulated, but I fell asleep? I love looking at my face in the mirror with it, it looks so strange and loopy. Its me, but its not me. I had an ego death from it very recently. I feel refreshed again, want to take more, but I won't since its not adductive and I know I wont get any more from it. When you take a benzo at the end, does it 'ruin' the trip by making you forget stuff?

it seems illogical! like one i saw was selling both 2c-d and 2c-e at 250mg, and that was the lowest quantity you could buy, despite the fact they are clearly active at very different levels

Because most people aren't interested in buying such low amounts? I don't know about you, but I don't want to risk maybe getting in trouble with the law for like one dose of 2c-e. 


The 2c-e yesterday was pretty epic.. visuals were very similar to 2c-i for the most part, nothing super ridiculous or insane, but I enjoyed them. I enjoyed the mood aspect of it, I was extremely euphoric and happy about everything I was doing. Music sounded deep, intricate, and amazing. No matter what kind of music I listened to, I was easily able to get into it and have a blast by myself. Wasn't really much "mindfuck" to it, but I felt extremely aware of my thoughts and my surroundings, all my senses were heightened. The body high itself was amazing, felt almost like I was on MDMA. Breathing really long and heavy, skin was extremely sensitive to anything I touched. During the 'comedown' of the trip, I stood outside in my yard in the twilight and just listened to my surroundings. I felt super self-aware and aware of everything around me. It was really great. Not to mention, I was extremely horny and kept wishing I had a girl to experience such a thing with. 


After this trip, I was gonna decide if I wanted to do 2c-e or 4-aco-dmt at a dubstep show at a club this coming Friday.. 2c-e it is for sure. Definitely seems more like a good psychedelic to lose myself in the music to and have a blast with.


Still contemplating taking some MDMA with it.. not a lot, maybe 200mg.

Perhaps to further protect themselves from being accused of knowingly vending a product intended for human consumption?  Seems like I read that, among other reasons, somewhere before.

No matter what kind of music I listened to, I was easily able to get into it and have a blast by myself. Wasn't really much "mindf.ck" to it, but I felt extremely aware of my thoughts and my surroundings, all my senses were heightened. The body high itself was amazing, felt almost like I was on MDMA.

The peak lasted until about 7:45-8PM, and then it slowly went away, but left my senses still highly sensitive. I felt extremely aware, though my body and mind were starting to become drained and tired feeling.

Each individual pattern would slowly rotate in different directions like gears and the colors over everything would be saturated in bright easter egg colors and I'd be mesmerized by it for a minute or two until the the patterns slowly morphed back into what the real world looks like.

It had a really good balance of everything, because my body felt great, all my senses were heightened sharply and I loved everything, pretty decent amount of a mental/analytical aspect, but the visuals were legit too, though not as awesome as I was hoping, because some people report full blown hallucinations, such as actually being able to see music, but I never experienced such a thing. Honestly, I could do more. I'll be doing it this Friday for Bare/Dieselboy at club in Dallas, probably the same amount, but I'll be mixing it with 2 high-quality rolls if I can get my hands on them this week.

I completely understand just how steep the dose-response curve is for this substance now. So far my experienced have been 8mg, 14mg, and 17.5mg. The 17.5mg trip was at LEAST twice as intense as the 14mg trip. Wasn't quite prepared for it but I managed ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

it is definitely a steep curve, seems to level off a bit after you get to ~26mg or so though, but even then, its still pretty steep

I'm getting some 2C-E this or the next week probably and I want to experience the full beauty of it. It will be my first time but I really want to be fully blown away since my last mushrooms trips were between 1-2.3g doses and I want to experience something intense. My last trully intense trip was at least a year ago so I think I'm prepared for something interesting now =]


So I have a few questions:

1. According to what I wrote above, how much should I take?

2. How important are set and setting compared to other psychedelics such as LSD, shrooms etc. ? Would, for example, a psytrance party be overwhelming?

3. How physically stimulating is 2C-E?

4. How well do alcohol and cannabis go with this substance?

1. Only you can really make that decision.  These things tend to have high variability from person to person.  But after low dose allergy tests, no more than 10-12mg for a first time

2. Equally so, but whether its overwhelming is more a matter of dose than substance

3.  Somewhat, this tends to vary a bit, and is also rather set & setting dependent.

4.  About as well as they do with other psychedelics.

1. I largely agree, though I would advice 12-14 mg considering your background and my personal experience with 2C-E. This might not give you the full-blown experience, but as always: Better safe than sorry...

2. 2C-E would not be my first choice for an all-out dancing party, but if it's a laid-back psytrance party with room for chilling than it will probably be a-okay.

3. Not the most stimulating of the 2C's, but definitely dopaminergic activity. Plus you can steer the effects to gain some more stimulating effects, especially once you are into the music.

4. Alcohol moderately (as always), watch out with cannabis as the visuals (and nausea/bodyload - if present) can get really intense.

Is there anything that happens if you fall asleep while on 2c-e? I was tripping pretty heavily, laying in bed and listening to music at one point during my trip, but I felt extremely sleepy and felt like I could even roll over and fall asleep. I thought about doing so, just to see if I'd have any odd dreams or if anything would happen, but this thought of "what if I don't wake up?" came over me and I decided against it since I was home all alone and no one would be there until the next day. Do you enter a lucid dream state induced by the 2c-e, or do you just fall asleep like your normally would and nothing special happens? Is it even possible to actually get to asleep while on it?

What I have experienced is more a prolonged version of the 'half sleeping/half awake' state you sometimes have before falling asleep. I doubt you could really enter deep sleep when peaking on 2C-E. Anyway, the 'what if I don't wake up?' thought really sounds like you should not let your own mind fuck with you that much. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Yes, you fall asleep. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 

Actually, I would be a bit scared to fall asleep on 2C-E, because it suppresses my breathing. But otherwise it would be fine. So, if your body reactions to 2C-E are alright, then sleeping isn't dangerous, IMO.


BTW, I fell asleep on 2C-I once, and it was very shallow sleep, lasted around 30-60 minutes. Not much difference from regular tripping, maybe more strange disconnected thoughts, more images in mind, but nothing *really* special. 

There was so little difference that I understand that I was sleeping only because I felt refreshed. Before this incident, I thought that it is inpossible to sleep during tripping.

As stated, I'm sure one could sleep on 2C-E, but I'm not too sure about deep sleep. I find that during deep "visions" that my breathing slows, and that I occasionally, unknowingly, pause to hold my breath. Fortunately my sitter snapped me out of it the only time it happened. It is because of this that I would prefer not to sleep during a psychedelic experience.

You can't suffocate yourself by holding your breath, so I wouldn't worry.

hym3n, i agree that prolonged periods of apparent holding of breath can lead to the deepest visions on any trip. after extended testing with these depths, i've come to the conclusion that there is zero danger from the stopping of breathing whilst in the throes of a peak. of course, i'm not a doctor and this is most definitely not medical advice, especially if you're prone to hypoxia.

I'm not a doctor either, but I doubt any doc would have anything useful to say on this matter. Most medical professionals never come quite past the 'drugs are bad' routine... However, it is generally accepted that a healthy person can not suffocate by simply holding his or her breath. And since breathing is primarily an involuntary process, I believe sleeping will only contribute to normal breathing (as opposed to discovering you - unknowingly - hold your breath during deep visions).

Ok thanks for the answers! I guess I'll do 13mg the first time. After that I'll evaluate if it's 'party suitable' for me :]

And the alcohol/cannabis question is just for info. I rarely drink on psychedelics but I do smoke weed everytime I trip. 

We shall see what will come from this.

So, 2c-e has pretty much become my all time favourite drug and after about 6 or 7 runs I dying to share the love. I'm going out with some old school friends on Friday and I want to give them a go. All of them are pretty inexperienced with drugs in general, especially psyches, so I'm wondering how to approach this.


Is there a low dose that I can give them that won't cause any nausea (at least put the chances to a minimum), but still allow them to get a proper taste of what 2c-e can offer?


Also, how much of a party-type drug can 2c-e be? I've always taken it alone in the comfort of my home but every time I've sort of felt that it could work in a more social context.

I wouldn't suggest anyone starting off with 2C-E, especially not if inexperienced with psychedelics in general. You should always be careful when projecting your own experiences with a psychedelic on other people; they might have a totally different experience. I always suggest people to start off with 2C-C or 2C-I, since those are generally not so heavy and the dose-response curve is not so steep. If you do decide to dose your friends on 2C-E, perhaps start with 10-12 mg. But accept the fact you can't give them a proper taste of 2C-E while simultaneously minimizing the chance of adverse effects like nausea. You can't have the best of both worlds here, unfortunately...

Esoterik,


I'd say to start them between 8-12 mg oral. I have found that this dosage range for everyone I have used the material with is never overwhelming, although very affective in leaving the user feeling altered. Generally their is a mood lift and a brightening of color. 


I have a friend who is not accustomed to psyches, and was generally afraid of them before I introduced him to 2ce. He enjoys snorting cocaine from time to time, but is mainly into smoking marijuana. He used mushrooms, but had a bad experience and so was nervous about using... for some reason he really wanted to use the 2ce... On his first occasion with it, I had used it earlier in the day snorting some undetermined amount... I told him my experience, and he immediately was into the idea of doing it then and there.


I was a bit apprehensive, but figured why not. We each snorted 5 mg... I told him that it would be extremely painful, and he may be a bit thrown off by the pain. He looked at the line, and greatly doubted my words, thinking he has put a decent amount of stuff into his nose and that this was nothing.... oh well... I guess you learn only through the experience. So we did....


To this day, he tells me that it was his best drug experience... and he loves talking about 2ce... I have eaten with him in the 8-12 mg range. He hasn't been too interested in going beyond that... And he still is in doubt of the greatness of acid... However, he always gives 2ce praise when the topic of hallucinogens arises. 


I have used it with other people in these small amounts... and it generally is really awesome... just don't expect to trip them out too much... It is better for them to be underwhelmed in their expectations than to be put into a mindfuck... and generally by the end of an experience they should, or probably will, find some appreciation for it.


I'd suggest a nice day, where you can be in a comfortable place that supports both indoor and outdoor activity... with not large amounts of people.... camp fires are nice... especially since it is spring time now... Relaxing in the backyard and around the house is enjoyable. Anything you normally do I guess. I enjoy watching movies with the 2cs sometimes... 


You'll figure it out. The hard part is getting non-psyche users to try something like 2ce. Enjoy and good luck.

So my best friend and I will each be mixing 2c-e with MDMA. I did ~25mg by itself for the first time this weekend and had a great time. Dosage wise, I'm thinking we should stay in the 15-20mg range for 2c-e and two high-quality pressed rolls each (probably yellow playboys going around dallas, which are supposed to be pretty bomb. If they're anything like the playboys I've had before, that looked very similar to aliens, then I know they're legit). I think the two would mix perfectly for a night of raving at big dubstep (Bare & Dieselboy) show. We'll be at a club in downtown Dallas, a club we've been to many times before, so the setting itself won't be anything new to us.


My biggest concern is the timing of the two. The club opens at 9PM, and I don't expect the headliners to go until probably like 11 at the earliest. I would really like to dose the 2c-e in water. When I did so this weekend on a completely empty stomach, I started seeing surfaces move if I concentrated at almost exactly 30 minutes after dosing. The trip wasn't into full effect until about 1.5 hours after the initial dose. The peak lasted for about 3-4 hours before starting to decline. 


I was thinking we should dose the 2c-e in water around 9PM (If we dissolved it in water, it'd *have* to be before we enter the club), maybe slightly later. We plan on getting to the club sometime between 9-10. This would give us time for the 2c-e to kick in and for us to get acclimated to the club scene while on 2c-e since neither of us have ever done a psychedelic of this magnitude at a rave. If we dosed at 9PM, it should be in full effect no later than 11. I had an idea to drop the MDMA pills around 10-10:30PM once we're inside the club, around the time the 2c-e would really be getting into full swing. Like I mentioned, I believe this would allow us to experience and get acclimated to the 2c-e, and then once that's in decent effect, the rolls would kick in and the peaks would be simultaneous. The two would probably start to decline around the same time also.


Does this sound good? Any suggestions or insight?

Sounds like a pretty intense combo at those dosages but that may just be me ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


What sounds, to me, like the best option would be to take 14mg 2C-E, then at T+3:00-4:00 pop your pills. This will not only give you time to decide whether or not you even *need* the E but also align the experiences so you're not coming down from the E while still tripping. 


I also find tactile and auditory stimulation from 2C-E to be more prevalent during the decline and I'd imagine MDMA at that point would feel pretty special. This is all speculation, of course, on my end as I haven't done this combo. Just relaying my thoughts on it.


Hope you have a great time and stay safe ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Thanks, that does sound like a wise choice. 2c-e itself almost felt like rolling, tactile senses were already increasingly sharpened and everything felt great. The combination of the MDMA close to the end of the peak/comedown from the 2c-e would be amazing. Awesome idea. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I still think 18 is a better choice than 14 for you, though. you took 25 your first time and loved it - I don't think you'll have a problem with handling 18 in the mix.

I agree, that's why I initially mentioned 15-20mg. Haven't really decided yet. Honestly, I see absolutely no reason why the trip/experience would go badly. Everything has always been perfect when we've gone to this particular place, and we're both definitely in the right mindset heading into it. 18mg + 150-200mg of MDMA should be perfect. Like the "just right" dose. We'd get the full effects of the 2c-e + the synergetic characteristics from the rolls, but we won't be so fucked up we can't talk to anyone/do something productive. I plan on tryin to meet some girls and pull some ass too, so I guess we'll see what my talking ability is like on 2c-e lol.

I've mixed with M1 and thought the synergy was fantastic. I have no doubt that (for me) it would mix amazingly with MDMA. 


I've also mixed with LSD for the most visually intense non-DMT trip I've ever had. 


Definitely plan to do more mixes soon.

Why snort? Snorting always gives a higher intensity and shorter duration. So if you are worrying about tripping too hard, just go for oral administration. 10-12 mg should be nice imo, but it would help if you list the dosages of 2C-I and LSD you normally take. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

20 mg orally I presume, or did you snort the 2C-I as well?

Based on the 20 mg 2C-I, I guess you could start with 12-14 mg of 2C-E.

Big chance it's still intense, but there's not really a middle road with 2C-E as far as my experience goes...

I took them orally 2ci to me is not very visual more stimulating then anything, especially when compared to lsd. 2ce on the other hand is like lsd of the 2c family one can say from the reading I have done, and snorting it I heard works more effectively then 2ci which is why I wanted to give it a try.

Would dosing a decent amount of 2c-e in liquid and then possibly boosting with a few mg nasally a few hours later be efficient? Or would there not be much of a change other than in the duration?

2C-E is still extremely psychedelic on it's own at doses of 12-16 mgs.  Above 16 mgs you're getting into walls COVERED in morphing full on rainbow fractal laser beams and increase body load and 12 hour duration....12 to 16 mgs of 2C-E is just a nice enjoyable albeit intense psychedelic 8-10 hours.


18-22 mgs is where you really start getting into full on "tripping-balls" territory, in my expereince that is....more than 22 mgs for me is INSANE, too much for confort.  After 20-22 mgs it's not enjoyable so much as just a test of endurance.

^ Are higher doses desirable for introspective thought? I've been dosing it at low doses, from 2mg-5mg and its very powerful, it works very well but I would rather see if I could do one 'big' one and then never need to change myself more. I feel like I'm touching the tip of the iceberg, but not sure if a higher dose will help or just be more powerful feeling, but not more useful.

I'd say that there's going to be a dosage for everyone where the experience becomes too intense for serious introspection. I'd imagine it'll be different for everyone so titrate up in dose slowly and methodically for a more rewarding discovery of your butter-zone. So far, introspectively, my sweet spot is about 14mg. It was a very nice thoughtful trip for me on par with some of my lower-dose LSD trips.


But I will say, however, that even my 17.5mg experience with this stuff (which proved to be quite intense) left my thinking (and even fine motor skills, surprisingly) still quite unhindered. I never got foggy-headed or confused like I sometime do with tryptamines however I do realize I was on the lower end of high in terms of dose.

Yeah 2C-E is very clear headed, even at overwhelming doses.  However, there is a point when twitching muscles and general body discomfort will get in the way of that wonderful train of thought you are trying to have.


When i first started taking research chemical psychedelics, I used to always take large doses.  Even at the advice of my more experience buddy whom I would frequently trip with, I would take big doses.  I just thought all the fireworks were awesome.


But since those days, I've come to realize that "medium" dose trips are often much more enjoyable and pleasant.  They kind of "optimize" psychedelic effects versus unwanted somatic effects.


even with gentler compounds like 4-aco-dmt, and 2C-D, dosing too high can cause a period of several hours where you're just sitting there like "wow...lots of colors, lots of visuals, lots of interesting body sensations", to the point where you don't get any intuitive leaps in there, just a whole shitload of "WOW THIS IS CRAZY !!!!".


I feel like since I've stoped using such high doses as frequently as I used to, I can actually get to a full on +++ from smaller amounts of material (not talking about any drug in particular here).  I think it's kind of a psychic sensitization that has happened to me.  Now that I am familiar with these drugs a bit and the things they do to my psyche, I tend to have MORE respect for them, and am MORE aware of what I might potentially be putting myself through.  So I don't really see the need to dose like I used to.

hahahah whoa that's a lot of drugs to mix together...


LSD MDMA and ketamine alone is a like the holy trinity of feeling AWESOME, I would be hard pressed to add more drugs to it incase I ruined the beautiful kitty-candy-flip.

not to mention you can reallllly get yourself in too deep from mixing too many drugs.


I mixed ~250 mgs MDMA, a LOT of ketamine, and 50 mgs of 2C-D together on night while I was doing an overnight at a friend of a friends house.  It was in a basement suite, and there were people above us that none of us knew.  The owners of said basement suite were nice enough to let a bunch of us crash at their place while they were off taking care of some serious business.


Annnnyways, the intensity of this trip caught me waaaaaay off guard, and I spent a good 15 minutes tripping soooo hard that I was unaware of myself practically screaming "THERE ARE EYEBALLS EVERYWHERE !!!!!!!", followed by countless utterances of "OH MY GOD...OH MY GOD...OH MY GOD"...


We all had a good laugh about it the next day, but yeah...mixing drugs together can bite you in the ass if you're not COMPLETELY conscious of set/setting.


I had a great experience that night though, it was extremely reminiscient of a very very strong DMT trip actually.  Totally immersive visuals with 1000000's of eyeballs morphing in and out and across every surface imaginable.  I definitely couldn't make out the room I was in, and I remember seeing flashes of my girlfriends face from time to time, and it was definitely not connected to her body.


It was a group effort to calm me down.  I wasn't having a bad time, I was just tripping balls sooooo hard and so unexpectedly.


Now when I mix three different classes of drugs together, I know to expect the unexpected.

Currently in the middle of a 20mg trip, with 250mg of M1 and 200mg of 4-FA (this combo without 2ce roughly mimcis the effects of MDMA for me) 


TOO INTENSE!!! I will definitely have to reduce dosages if i try this ocmbo again.. i havent had a "bad trip" in years and am feeling very close to that right now. the intensity is just fucking overhwleming

haha yes, I did pull through indeed pretty quickly - I attribute that frenetic little melt down that lasted approx. 15 minutes to the extreme rush/intensity of the come up from the stims. this was just really overwhelming/in my face and kind of blew me away. but the peak was over very quickly and i was able to really enjoy the rest of the state. interestingly, while the combo kick started the visuals into hyper gear for the duration of the peak, during the plateau/comedown of the stims the visuals of the 2ce trip pretty much vanished altogether. 


won't even go into how awful the come down from all 3 of these drugs at once was... haha

Mixing 2c-e with MDMA was literally perfect.. took a benadryl a little while before dosing the 2c-e that was dissolved in liquid. It was about 40mg, which i divided out between my friend and I with a 5ml syringe. I've done once 2c-e previously (about 20-25mg), weekend before this last one, and my friend has never done it, but he has done 2c-i and other psychedelics like mushrooms and DMT. We dosed it around 9:20-30ish, and drove the 10 minutes to the club because we knew it'd take at least 30 minutes to the club (already know the severity of driving while intoxicated, thanks). 


Took a little bit to kick in, don't remember the time but had kicked in before Bare went on stage around 11-11:15. I took a roll a little before this time, and so did my friend. The 2c-e come up to me was very tolerable, almost felt like that pre-rolling feeling you get when you eat MDMA. My friend though felt extremely intense and had to sit down in front of a sub for a while, but he said it felt extremely good, just super intense. Later in the night, my friend and I split another tab between each other, which I got about 3/4 of because I bit a little bit too much off of it with my teeth when trying to split it (usually isn't a problem doing this), but it was too late at that point so I gave him what little was left. They were purple crowns from Dallas (supposedly pretty good, equivalent to legit rhinos and aliens).


not sure how much of a roll the MDMA played in the whole thing, but i felt extremely energetic and was able to party hard and rock the fuck out to Bare during his hour and a half set. We went outside to smoke a cigarette and noticed how worn out and tired our bodies felt from everything when we sat down. We ended up deciding to go back in for Dieselboy and it was fairly easy to still dance and move around well, but our energy levels were never the same as before. we only stayed for about 30 more minutes before deciding to leave to go back to our hotel and smoke weed and do wippets. Once we stopped and gave our body to rest, we noticed how tight we were and we began to wear down. I felt extremely great during the entire time though, very euphoric, speedy somewhat, but it wasn't dirty feeling. Senses were heightened extremely when we left the club and stayed that way for the much of the night back at our hotel room.


I never noticed extreme visuals, but lights did play with my eyes and got a visuals similar to 2c-i when I actually stopped and stared at something. Getting a lightshow by someone who was good with gloves was fairly awesome. The trails were soo long, and this is where I really felt like MDMA was playing a pretty legit part of the entire experience, cause lookin at lights like that looked and felt exactly the same as rolling, just longer trails so it was epic. CEV were present, as they were with my initial 2c-e trip, and looked pretty much the exact same. They seemed a little more pronounced and brighter looking this time though, could be from the rolls. I enjoyed closing my eyes and getting lost in the visuals and the feel of the bass. 


bass from the subs felt amazing, music sounded deep and fantastic.. loved everything i was hearing, even when i was outside smokin a cig and they had music playin over the loud system. talking to people/being around people wasn't hard, and it wasn't hard to act normal. it in no way "mindfucked" me or made me feel anxious. I felt extremely aware and sharp the entire time.


All in all, it was probably one of the most epic nights of my life.. Bare and Dieselboy killed it, and dancing all night, literally within fist bumping distance of them, in that kind of atmosphere and state of being was absolutely amazing. Definitely something I'll be repeating again.

It's crazy how some people can take 20mg of this substance and experience little to no visuals. At 14mg I had persistent visuals and at 17mg my whole field was vibrating with holographic patterns.

I remember the first time I took 2c-E. I mixed up 2 bags by accident, one was 20mgs 2c-I, the other 20mgs 2c-E. I dissolved in water, what I thought was 20mgs of 2c-I, but it was 2c-E. 40 mins in, I was puking my guts out, but everything was alive and moving, twisting and breathing. I couldn't beleive, people said 2c-I was only mildly psychedelic, I was totally out of it. I dosed the real 2c-I about a week or so later, and realized my mistake within an hour or so. It's funny though, because my 2c-E trips since then, haven't matched the intensity of that first time.

Visuals weren't as apparent on the night I tripped in combination with the MDMA as on my first trip where I consumed 2c-e alone. That first trip, I ate 20-25mg and got pretty intense visuals, similar to 2c-i in a way but definitely more intense.

It's a weird thing this 2C-E, for me at least.


I don't care for it by itself: It's not very visual, and it's so introspective and emotionally and socially intense that I don't want to go there often.


But, I find it's perfect to introduce visuals and a little emotional punch into a 2C-C experience. Soon as the ~5 mg 2C-E bump get insuffed, the oral 2C-C becomes magically visual.


So, on it's own no, but 2C-E introduces quite the range of visuals to a mild 2C-C experience.

Gave some 2c-e to a friend of mine (14mg oral) and for about 8 hours he reported vivid visual effects, full blown hallucinations and zero body load. It sounded like a magical trip. Curious how differently it can affect different people.


Anyone got experience with low dose oral 2c-e, in the 4-5 mg range? Is there anything interesting to be had from oral dosing in the single digits?

i've heard that ~8 mg can be a decent time in a social situation where you might not want others to know that you're on something.  i imagine it to be more of a slightly psychedelic stimulant at those doses.  lowest i've went is ~12 mg

Exactly why I asked.


Ended up dosing 4 mg oral after writing the post and mixed with a lot of alcohol and I can see this working in all sorts of social occasions.


Every time I take this drug is just slaps me in the face with something new.

Effectively no visuals. Mainly stimulation, but nothing intrusive. I was sort of hoping for a shorter duration, but the EDM board has kept me going for a while now and it's showing no signs of letting up.


Still, this kind of dose, taken at about 9pm at the start of an evening, out with a load of straights, could really smoothen things out a bit. 


This is why I take drugs during the week: so I can plan the weekend.

4-6 mg is just unpleasant for me if I am up and trying to function - stimulation, slight clumsiness, an occasional hint of OEVs, and mild stomach discomfort.  However, a dose in this range taken about 2 hours before sleep is very effective at inducing lucid dreams for me, similar to what is discussed in the following thread:

If you really like your sleep, I wouldn't recommend this.  After a couple hours in bed, I am able to thoroughly enter a dream state, but I remain very active mentally... which does not seem to be conducive to restful sleep.  The following morning I always get out of bed feeling physically and mentally drained, but I find the experience worthwhile enough to do every few months.

That's pretty interesting there.  I too find threshold doses of two carbon PEA's to be a touch agitating, though low doses of tryptamines & ergolines i've found rather pleasant.  The induction of lucid dreaming with low dose 2c-e sounds very interesting though, may have to give that a shot sometime.

both separately, never together though.  I tend to have bad luck with phen+trypt combos.  Nothing particularly bad, more of a 2+2=3 type situation ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

so snorting 5mg of 2ce is equivalent to 16-20mg oral?

Got my first shot at 2c-e friday after a bassnectar show. I decided to hold off till after because i had never done it but i am fairly experienced with psychedelics. Me and my buddy had 25mg each, he orally ingested his and i decided to snort mine. "Heard it burns" I thought to my self but oh well. NO PAIN NO GAIN!!! 


I didnt intend to do the whole 25mg but i didnt realize how light the powder was so i ended up with 25mg in my nose and it burned like no other! Might be a good time to mention i was currently rolling a little bit still from the show. We sat in the parking lot for about 30min smokin some good budz and once we started to leave is when i felt the initial effects coming on. Slight vibrations and a very vividness to colors around me even tho it was dark out by this time. Driving down the road in the backseat with trance playing i lost myself. I couldn't tell whether my eyes were open or closed except for a very small 2in gap on the left and right side of my vision which i could faintly tell was "reality". So i would have to compare it to something of a "tunneling" in my vision. I could see the world around me IF i wanted to. Which is something i liked, i found it very easy to control the visuals and mental state. One down side i did notice through out the night was some slight muscle spasms and the thought of i was going to piss myself a few times.


Thats basically how it went most of the night. Intense audible hallucinations, i was in a totally silent room creating the most vivid sounding trance in my brain. Honestly probablly my new favorite psych. Going to give it another go here soon and try some stuff out and compare it to other experiences ive had on other psychs. (lsd,shrooms,dmt)

I've mixed 2C-E and 4-aco-DMT, I really really love this combination actually.


I took the 2C-E first, at about 20 mgs, and then 4-5 hours into the 2C-E, i took 20 mgs 4-aco-DMT.


The 4-aco-DMT added a nice burst visuals and euphoria to the 2C-E peak.  It was quite an intense combination though.


I think I did 2C-T-7 the day before, so my doses are with a little bit of tolerance.


You may want to dose lower than I did this this combination.

It was a very interesting experience. I believe it was somewhere around 7-8hrs of good solid visuals and audible hallucinations. I dont remember actually going to sleep. Once i got home i turned on my 3color strobe on one end of the room, then the lava lamp on the opposite....layed it bed and just watched my room melt away.

I love this substance, it is very uncomfortable, but I return looking to it. Do you guys ever look forward to this discomfort it brings? I think that I'd like it to just work once so I can fix things that are broken in my life, but I don't know how to do this. I don't have the 'ah-ha' that I'm looking for, most of the time its either a bit of fun, a lot of questions or nothing that comes out of it. I never regret doing it, but I want to have its utility rather than just the fun of it.

i'm sure it'll dull the trip, but i was more concerned about about what would actually happen if i did it. like would it be shitty? or would the xanax take away from the 2c-e body load/high and make it still somewhat visual and euphoric like previous experiences? xanax and 2c-e occupy different receptors, so they won't cancel each other out of cause implications with each other. i'm thinking about snorting small amounts


and to answer your question, whenever i snorted large amounts of RCs at once, it always hurt, but i always managed. if i had the ability, i'd split the amount up into a bunch of very small bumps, and just do those individually over the course of 15-30 minutes. such a small amount each time it barely burns at all, but you still consume it all within a reasonable time frame.

I don't think it changes the quality, I just know that they stop me from being anxious. I don't think they make a very good combination, they differ from their purposes in life. You aren't going to be on psychedelics most of your life, and xanax just stops feelings of anxiety. It doesn't work on the same receptors, but it can still cancel it. How much did you plan to take?


Benedryl works for the bodyload and if you are doing small amounts I don't know if it would be enough to kill the trip or just have it diminished. Thanks for the tip, I'm going to remember it.

word.. i don't think i'm gonna do it. i was just kinda bored and curious about the combo. i can see how it could turn out to be a cool combo, but i can also see how it could turn out to be shitty. i'm feelin great how i am now though, weed, xanax, and a bit of hard alcohol. i'd really like to trip on either 2c-e, which i find to be more of a party/rave drug, or 4-aco-dmt, which is definitely a lot more chill and 'psychedelic' in a sense. maybe tomorrow? i hope so

Well I suggest against, but if you're curious and just want to know, I think its better to just do it so you won't have the thought in your mind. If you're ok with not doing it thats even better. It sounds like it will do nothing from all that you consumed. Its the same reason that people here snort kpins even when they know its not as good and worst for you. Doing is a better learning experience than reading. If you do want to do it tomorrow though, don't do it today.

If you are looking for 'utility' perhaps you should try substituted tryptamines instead of 2Cs. People generally report much more introspection and life-changing breakthroughs on tryptamines than on phenethylamines. Also, it is up to you to take control of the trip and direct yourself towards the important questions and answers. So perhaps you need more experience, or you need to experiment more with how to control your trip. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Just to illustrate the faultiness of your reasoning: Atropine and MDMA also occupy different receptors, as do PCP and barbiturates. Still, these are some of the most dangerous combinations. Same goes for benzodiazepines and virtually all psychedelics, but still - a heavy dose of a potent benzo will knock out almost any trip. And it so happens to be that Xanax is a very potent benzo...

I'm pretty sure 2c-e isn't a "typical" phenethylamine experience in that it is very introspective and dark for a lot of people. 4-subbed trypts are a good route to go too though.

2c-e was never "dark" for me, but it was rather introspective when I did it by myself. It was still rather euphoric though and never ceased to feel amazing.

Yes! Another winner when combined with nature and good (or wierd) weather! Kinda of grew out of love with mushrooms but I missed the oneness and appreciation with nature soooo much. Our 1st real warm day of the year I did 13mg and had one of the best trips of my life. 


I just sat outside with the sun on my face absorbing all the energy I could. I even meditated a bit, which I haven't done in a very long time. Enjoyed a good 1.5hrs of CEV's of the most beautiful orange you can imagine :D It was neat too because EVERYTHING outside shimmerd with that heat-shimmer effect like you see on the top of pavement on a hot day.


Another neat visual I had was I'd look up at the sky with my eyes closed and I'd keep them closed for a good 10 minutes. When I reopened my eyes everything was greyscale. Like truly black-and-white. Lasted about 10 seconds but it was wild. My mother's color blind so it was sort of neat to see what she sees for a few seconds.

how old is it? i still have some 2c-e from an order many months ago, and it still is as white as it was the day i received it. kept it in a dark place at room temperature in a ziplock bag. 2c-e (and phenethylamines in general) should be pretty stable for a long long time...


maybe impurities that degraded? can't really say something about safety to consume though.

Colour of a powder says absolutely nothing about its identity (although pure 2C-E should be white and pure 2C-B should have a yellowish hue). Give me 1 drop of colorant and I can make 100 grams of powder any colour you like... Colour change is of course an indication that something has happened, although a slight change to yellow probably indicates the majority of your compound is still perfectly fine. Could also be uptake of water which alters the crystal structure, this can also change the hue of the powder.


Anyway, as with all these kinds of questions: It is all pure speculation and no definite conclusions can be drawn from your description of the powder.

So without any kind of lab-analysis to confirm the identity I should just get rid of it? Guess thats probably the best thing to do; it's not worth running the risk of getting poisoned :D

^I wouldn't say that. I sometimes get batches of 2C-T-2 which are yellow or peachy coloured, and they feel the same potency of the white crystalline batches I have had. In fact, my current batch of 2C-T-2 is yellowish. I think the last batch of 2C-E I had was similarly coloured too.

You can always test with Mecke or Marquis and compare to results [here](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=512598&highlight=marquis).

As undoubtedly stated many times before on this site, reagent testing can only be used for **negative** identification (i.e. 'this is not ...') and not for positive identification. Furthermore, the person asking the question already confirmed that the powder was 2C-E; the question is only about a discoloration. So even if there is only 10% 2C-E remaining, a reagent test will still come out positive for 2C-E.

I think that would be a very bold decision. Discoloration can also be due to recrystallization or a minor breakdown product. The chance that a possible breakdown product would be so poisonous that ingesting a merely 5 mg (assuming more than 25% degradation, which is extremely unlikely) would have adverse effects is virtually non-existent. Especially when considering the structure of 2C-E and phenethylamines in general; most potent poisons contain at least a tertiary or quarternary ammonium or some phosphorous functional group.

I know from your previous posts that you're a smart poster so you have me a little confused.  Aren't Mecke and Marquis the same reagents in Narco packs that police use to field test suspected drugs?  If the test returns a positive, isn't that a positive?  


In this case, if the OP wants to

, why couldn't (s)he test with Mecke and see if it goes dark brown?  TWouldn't that at least narrow it down to either 2ci or 2ce?


I also didn't realize the OP had confirmed the identity of said compound since (s)he asked if (s)he should

  To me that indicated (s)he wasn't sure about the compound's identity.

I don't blame you for misunderstanding, since about 90 per cent of people are doing it wrong. The only instance where Mecke/Marquis reagents can be used with 100% certainty is exclusion. Like when you test a tablet and your reagent does not turn black, you can exclude MDMA (and any other substance causing the reagent to go black). However, if you test a tablet and the reagent goes black this is never a guarantee the tablet contains MDMA. There are other compounds that will also give a black colour after polymerization, while there are also reports (in the NL at least) where tiny bits of dark blue colorant were added to a tablet to fool users wise enough to test their supply. Hope this is enough explanation to clarify what I meant? If not feel free to ask. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I understand you took it up like this. However, if you read back a post or 20 you'll see the original post in which it is stated that it is indeed a bag of 2C-E (which I thought meant a 'confirmed identity'-statement) that was left in a drawer for a long amount of time, causing it to change colour.

I licked some off my fingers when I was measuring it. Its very difficult to measure something that is so sticky and clumpy. I ended up tripping a little, no visuals, but it was very mental, it seemed like I was connected with more thoughts, like how I would think of weed which leads to green, then think of something semi related, like Al Gore or Springtime for Hitler.

Actually, maybe it's just in the bag it looks different...cuz when I poured a small amount on the counter it looks white. Then again, maybe my eyes are deceiving me, I did take some :D.

Yeah mine was a teeny-tiny bit yellow when clumped up. When spread out (on the scale) it looked pure white. 


I'm still only 150/250mg from finishing my batch and I've been dosing about once a week since I got it lol. Gotta say I kinda like the value from RC's if nothing else.

I'm guessing you won't peak off of the 2C-E until you're already mostly come down from the shrooms at those times. If you want a simultaneous peak I'd do the 2C-E about 30 minutes before you dose your shrooms. 


As for the dose amounts, I don't know...personally I'm a bit of a bitch and would use 2g shrooms with no more than 12mg 2C-E. I haven't heard alot about psylocybin+2CE either...think I'll go googling cause it sounds mildly interesting.

From my experiences with combining 4-AcO-DMT (so not *exactly* the same as shrooms) and 2C-X, I can say the combination of tryptamines and phenethylamines can have some unexpectedly potent effects. Besides that, perhaps it would be better to take the 2C-E first and then do the shrooms about 3-4 hours after reaching peak effects on 2C-E. This is generally how I would combine a long- and short-acting psychedelic. Dosage-wise there seems nothing wrong though, especially not since it can be assumed you are familiar with these shrooms and this batch of 2C-E, so you must be aware of their relative potency etc. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I'm planning on taking 10mg 2C-E with cannabinoid for increased visuals.

I've only ever had mushrooms once, and lsd 4 times.

I don't get visuals from lsd, which is why I wanted to add the cannabinoid, as I heard it increases visuals.

Would this be good for my first time with 2C-E for OEV's and possible CEV's?

Combining stuff on your first try with a new substance is not advisable, especially not since you have almost no experience with psychedelics. If you want visuals, you could also focus on your own mindset during tripping. It takes time and practice to bend your trip the way you want it to go. Rushing things is just asking for problems, while it also results in experiences devoid of real learning opportunities.

a cannabinoid is ill advised?? TONS of people smoke pot tripping... I hardly even call this a real combo. 


I don't think 4 lsd trips and a mushroom trip is inexperienced to the point where adding a cannabinoid in the mix would be too overwhelming - what you should do is gauge how the trip is going, if it's not visual enough and you're doing fine, then smoke a CB. if you're at all feeling overwhelmed, though, don't!

People are different, personally smoking weed on top of the peak of a good strong acid trip just spins my head into paranoia. It's irritating as I love the combo since it really brings out the visuals. It doesn't happen every time, but it's happened a fair few. Smoking on the comeup/comedown is completely different as opposed to smoking at the peak.

This. Plus if you use a substance for the first time you won't have a clue when you are hitting the peak and how it will develop from there. Now in all fairness, 2C-E will probably be heavier during the coming-up (in case of bodyload) than whilst peaking. But it is just disrespectful not to appreciate a chemical by itself at first, just to get to know it.

True, and a significant percentage of bad trips is caused by smoking weed while tripping and suddenly getting totally psyched out or overwhelmed. You probably know cannabinoids are prone to cause paranoia, which can really exacerbate anxious feelings already lingering inside. Of course it might turn out okay, but that does not mean it is good advice saying someone should just go ahead and do it.

Yeah, I guess your right, I should probably test it out alone a few times, then if i'm comfortable with it and more I have more knowledge about the trip from personal experiences, I can try it.


How do you guys say the CB affects you if you smoke it on the peak, as opposed to the come up or come down?

This substance interests me quite a bit. I had the chance to do "as much as I wanted" from a friend of a friend one night, passed up the chance to do it because I had already done a good amount of LSD and was close to baseline and didn't feel like blasting back off into the metaverse. I've regretting it ever since, and every online vendor seems too suspect for me to drop 120 bucks on something that may or may not be 2C-E.

During the come up on my 2c-e experience we had to have easily smoke 3-4 bowls, decent size probablly half gram or so. It seemed to help the visuals out quite a bit and the body load was incredible!

During coming up: Don't know, never tried. But this is probably the worst time to light up a joint, since you have absolutely no way of knowing how intense the trip ahead is going to be. Plus you might get the munchies while your capsule of 2C-E is still dissolving.

Whilst peaking: Depends a bit on the height of your peak of course, but you could easily be blasted off into another level (which might be too high of a level for your liking; this is exactly why you should be careful!). If you are really peaking good and depending on the amount you smoke, it will also be hard to distinguish between the effects from the cannabis and the 2C-E. This might sound arbitrary, but it just means you could lose the comfortable feeling you usually get when smoking because the well-known mindset just doesn't register anymore.

When coming down: This is the only part of the trip where smoking is likely to have the desired effect without a big chance of adverse effects. Most people describe this as the cannabis catalyzing the last of your 2C-E and giving you back a bit of the magic again. Usually, this is more of a visual revisit than anything else, which most people find really nice in the afterglow of a nice trip.

Ever snorted 4-FMP?

It is close to 2C-E in terms of nastiness (4-FMP is somewhat nastier).

Beside nastiness of snorting, snorting also seems to enhance the prevalence of bodyload and other nasty side-effects.

This might just be coincidence as most of my friends and I have only snorted 2C-X compounds a few times in total.

But you should be aware that the pros of snorting might not weigh up to the cons. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

i've snorted 2c-e once, didn't feel the need to do it again.  In fact i've only snorted 2c-x's roughly half a dozen times since the first time i tried one back in 2003.  Generally regarded to not be worth it.  Also, coming up like a rocket ship while your face feels like it has burning, tabasco laden shards of glass in it isn't too cool.  And it can also increase the physical & psychological dangers of these compounds.  I'd recommend sticking to oral or rectal.

To be honest, the roughness of the comeup after railing 10mg was a real negative for what the trip was, it wasn't work such a rough comeup for the results. Reminded me of a low dose of acid with flat visuals and 10 cups of coffee or some speed, the amphetamine afterglow was my favourite part.

Trying 2C-E for the first time soon, think I will take 10mg. How would this affect my tolerance for the substance when I want to take 15 or 20mg in the near future (in about a month)?

i don't think that you will still have a tolerance after a month between tripping. actually is dosed 2c-e every 2 weeks for some time and didn't experience any tolerance. have fun!


to the snorting thing: for me, snorting 2c-e isn't that bad to be honest. actually i divide my dose into several bumps and take some time until it's all up the nose. taken that way it hardly hurts at all and i get less bodyload and nausea than with snorting all in one line. i highly recommend this if someone wants to take it nasally!

and if you think my batch might be impure, i don't think so. psychedelics never seem to get too visual for me, but a friend who dosed ~20mg from the very same batch got them so hard, he couldn't really see anything but fractal patterns during the peak.


i really want to try it rectally soon, but atm no proper scale i can use. (stupid, i know, not recommended at all).

2ce is a very powerful but unforgiving chemical. if you dont know how it will affect you, you should take a low dose the body load can be very strong.  any1 who likes 2ce add me as a friend.

For me, 2C-E is a bit too intense to really get creative. Also, since 2Cs are a bit stimulating, I wouldn't be surprised if you can't actually finish what you started. I would say that - generally speaking - tryptamines are a lot better to stimulate creativity, while phenethylamines are best in a social setting or when *enjoying* creativity (music/art/movies/whatever). ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I tried to draw while I was tripping pretty hard on it, but I found it difficult. It just ended up being a few doodles and that was all. I was feeling artistic and creative, but it seemed to create a block between the mind and the hand, just as I found I also couldn't articulate well.

2c-e is the only chem i've seen someone become catatonic and unresponsive on. it was my friend, she is a fairly small and lightweight girl, and she took 17mg 2c-e. after the come-up she stopped responding to external stimuli. her eyes were open and you could see that she was experiencing something inside her head, but she simply was not responding to any physical connection to this real world. calling her name, touching her hand, waving in front of her face... nothing. but she was smiling so we didn't worry about it. a couple hours later, she began coming back into this world, describing what an intense trip she just had. but unfortunately those types of trips are much like dreams, in which it is incredibly difficult to remember exactly what happened while you were away.


so i would agree that 2c-e can 'create a block between the mind and the body', which can become complete dissociation in higher doses with sensitive individuals.

Ahhh 2C-E.  Whether 12mg, 16mg, 18mg, or 20mg you never cease to amaze me.  You never cease to bring the fear of God into me, while showing me a bliss that is Heaven with 72 pretty virgins, all on MDMA.  You are challenging, yet clear-headed.  It is probably one of the most true, pure psychedelics I've tried (as opposed to, say 5-MeO-DiPT which is more a 'feeling' like a polluted wave from a dead zone in the ocean washing over you....or 2C-B which is a psychedelic, stimulant, and empathegen all rolled up into one....also would apply to a-MT.

Should've read up a bit in this very thread, me thinks ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) But you made it out and with a valuable lesson! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


I find having a small amount of food in my stomach helps settle it (like eat a sammich an hour before dosing). Too much and, well you know what happens. Empty stomach is almost worse because you get nauseous with nothing to purge.


I also can't imagine a 24mg oral trip, personally. 17mg was my max and it was quite intense. I think you've inspired me to look up some TR's with high dose experiences, though.

Again, 25mg Benedryl (diphenhydramine, in antihistimines and sleep aids) 30 mg before 2C-E entirely eliminates the nausea and the musculo-skeletal discomfort/dysphoria ("body load").  It's not needed for other 2C's but for 2C-E it's a godsend.

I agree with this. But "not needed for other 2C's..." is interesting. I'm obtaining some 2C-I for the first time shortly and was actually wondering if DPH was gonna be a good idea, like it is for 2C-E. Or is the body-load from 2C-I just not as bad as 2C-E?

Body load from 2C-I is not bad, just stimulation artifacts.  2C-E, specifically and very uniquely, has some weird propensity to strongly bond with serotonin receptors all over the body, including nerves in the digestive system (hence the nausea) and nerves going to musculature and everything else (hence the strange diffuse but quite annoying overall aches/pains/discomfort).  Diphenhydramine (quite a fascinating substance with a VERY interesting history, see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphenhydramine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphenhydramine)) has effects on multiple aspects of the nervous system, including serotonin receptors which turns out to block the binding by 2C-E and blocking the icky body load.


I actually like the body load from 2C-I, for me no nausea or aches, just a moderately elevated heart rate for an hour or 1.5 that feels like I did some speed, which I enjoy... house-cleaning energy while I wait to start tripping, haha.  Good to trip with a clean house.

Neat. Thanks for the info. Yeah I generally don't have any problems with stimulating body-load. I actually don't mind 2C-E's body load much either except for the nausea. And a little nausea while twisted on a psychedelic goes a long way to shaping a trip, IME.

2C-E can be stored for years with no signs of degradation in a solution. But for the long-term(1 year+) storage purer solvents are better. Who knows, how additions will react/degrade with time? And it is also recommended to have 20% of alcohol in the solution, because it prevents bacteria growth.

The 1st time I tried it it didn't work for me either. I didn't vomit (never have on it) but I still had nausea. All the other times I took 2C-E+DPH i experienced NO nausea. I could've been placebo though, for all I know. 


I tried ginger and it didn't work. I have heard alot of mixed reviews on DPH working so it's quite possible it may not work with you. I've said it before but I'll say it again...Might I suggest a very light meal an hour or two before dosing? It helped me before I tried DPH.

Anyone else find this chemical a bit of a let down? I find that the side effects such as nausea outweigh it's positives in comparison to the likes of LSD/Psilocybin. In combinations it synergises really well, but on it's own I just find it a little lacking and boring - despite how visual it is, the visuals are very flat and dull compared to other psychedelics. I tend to rail 10mg, I haven't attempted any other ROA as they are supposedly less potent and increase nausea.


Also, the nausea is ridiculous, I'm guaranteed to throw up after taking the chemical making it fairly useless in a club or if I'm travelling. To be honest, until the trip is well under way I ALWAYS regret taking it due to it's ridiculous nausea and just wish I ate some acid instead.

Insufflating 2c-e tends to increase the nausea and negative side effects for *a lot* of people, myself included. Try taking it orally - many find more visual depth to the trip this way too. I will honestly never take 2c-e any other way but orally again, and I've railed it about 6 times.

maybe it's a let down because you snort it.  lots of people think that oral dosing provides a more "complete" experience.

2c-e + MDMA = Favorite combo for raves/shows/festivals.. turns it into a speedy, trippy roll. and you don't have to take as much MDMA as you normally do (I take like half my normal dose and feel nearly like I'm rolling for the first time every time).

I just took 35mg of some 2c-e I recently acquired that was nmr'd twice to be 98-99% pure, some people might know of this certain batch. This is the only widely known 2ce to be chemically analyzed and let me tell you it was fucking insane. I've taken up to 60mg before of 2ce from legitimate vendors and none of that matched how insanely visual, nauseating and intense 35mg of this stuff was. Anyone who might have some, I would advise dosing very conservatively to start with, IMO.

Oh yes I have taken that as well, I purchased a good amount of it. Mines had black specks in it, so I doubt it was 99.99% pure, but it certainly is more pure than all others I have tried. 


For the people out there who don't have a good experience with it, you should try different ROAs. I get nothing snorted, but when it is eaten, I get a very nice effect from it.

**22 Hour 2C-E experience**


Well this is my first post so I thought I might as well start off with a bang. 

The first time I tried 2C-E I had only tripped on LSD I think 2 or 3 times beforehand, and had done no more than 3 tabs at once.


So I tried 60mg. Fuck it, I thought.


Turned out to be amazing. One of the most intense and best trips I ever had. I felt love for the first time. I had a whole host of revelations and ideas. It was definitely a very fun trip.


Too bad the effects didn't let me sleep until 22 hours later. Went from 4pm to 2pm and had a calculus 2 class to go through. 

So if you're about 6'2" and 175, try 60mg or more. I could handle it fine, although I think my personality definitely lends me aid when it comes to handling psychedelics (what's spirituality, lol?). 


I'm sure lots of you guys on here would pride yourselves in your mental strength. If so, I say go for it. It was very fun.


EDIT: How do you guys feel about the 2C's?

First experiences, recommendations, etc.

i dont think you should be encouraging first timers to take such a large dose of a powerful psychedelic. im glad you had a great trip, but 60mg is a TON of 2c-e for someone without much experience. a safe starting dose would be 15-20mg at most, best to start around 10 though. 

also, this isnt really suitable for the forum since theres no question to spark a discussion. id suggest either moving this to your blog, or expanding the details and make it into a trip report. i for one would love a long description of your trip, but its up to you whether you want to expand it.

Edited.


I wrote a submission to Erowid because not many people have taken 60mg of 2C-anything and I wanted to give something to the website that has helped me so much. I'm waiting for them to post it(because I forgot to save it, like a dumbass), it has the same title as this thread.

Hopefully it gets accepted, lol.

My friends had 40mg, 40mg and 20mg and we all had a great time, actually. One of them is a diagnosed schizophrenic and he was one of the 40mg'ers, and he was fine.


I also wouldn't say try a 2C without doing one of the classics first, is why I recommended that high of a dose to those who are strong of mind, aka experienced. I apologize if my language caused a misunderstanding of my idea.

Stupid language. Once we figure out how to shoot ideas into each others brains without having to outsource through language is when things are gonna get interesting.

erowid tends to take months to post trip reports, you can volunteer to be an experience reviewer of sorts, maybe youll find yours lol. 

as for my experience with 2c-e i have very little. a 10mg oral experience that didnt quite get me going, and a 5-7mg snorted which was more pain than i thought was possible. im very intrigued by these chemicals, and i do have a way of getting 2c-e, but cost and the time it takes up are hard to get around these days. i dont have too many tripping friends to share with, so solo trips are more my thing now.

I wouldn't suggest soloing an RC, but that's entirely up to you. 

I personally don't like tripping without other people at least there. I need other people in order to think. I cannot think without talking, thanks shrooms for revealing that to me.

My first experience with 2C-I at 17 mg left me tripping for 12 and awake but trying to sleep for 20. Unfortunately I had some work to do that day so ended up going 30 without sleeping. I was feeling pretty wacked by the end of that.

i took one 250mg tablet of magnesium with 20mg of 2c-e yesterday.  it did seem to help with some of the muscle tension and whatnot.

mine did not have black specks in it and was definitely very fure, still in chunks of rock-like crystal, plus two separate nmr's... the stuff is 98-99% pure, no doubt about it. 


I am just wondering how much better it is than the majority of 2ce out there because the doses were completely more intense than with past 2ce.

solo trips can be a very good thing. you should have a safe environment and have experience before you do it though. ego death is much easier when flying solo, introspection is also kicked up a few thousand notches lol. i like to keep my trip groups as small as possible. 3 other people is the most ill trip with, depending on the people, set, and setting, there may be an exception to this rule. me and my buddy like to have nice mellow 1 on 1 trips, thats the best IMO.

I have tried 2c-e twice now. The first time I snorted about 7.5 mg. Bad idea. Burned like a mofo. Gave my legs some tremors and muscle aching for the come up. Also made my heart race. Although I felt pretty trippy, but no major visuals. Ate another 7.5 a couple of hours later. Gave me some decent visuals and kept me up all night. Had to eat a xanax, 2 benadryl and drink some beer at 5 in the morning.


The second time, my friend got some of a different batch. This time the effects were quite different. I ate 17 mg in one go. This time I had even worse body load. Tremors in my upper leg and inner thigh/groin area. Made my heartrate increase. But no visuals really at all. Didn't keep me up all night that time either.


I'm wondering what the difference in the two substances was. Was the 2nd batch less pure or something?

The first batch looked kind of different from the 2nd also. 

1st batch was white with some small blue/black specks and was flaky.

The 2nd batch was pure white and very powder-like.

the stuff I got looked almost yellow-ish inside the gel capsule. 

My friend took about 30mg of it and he describes it by saying "My brain snapped and I blacked out".


This kid.... He's 5'7" and vaulted a 10 foot fence, twice, like it was nothing. He was also naked. He starts running around the apartment complex on my campus screaming bloody murder and eventually jumps through a window into someone's apartment. Then he jumped through another window out of that person's apartment.  


Yeah. I don't know how that happened. 2C-E, for me, was a very fun time.

Agreed, both 2C-I and LSD are very fun combos.  Shrooms and/or 4-AcO-DMT (the only trytpamines I've tried) are also very fun with 2c-e, it makes for a more fun trip than 2c-e by itself which can be a bit sinister IMO.  I still love the stuff though, and I don't mind the sinister side of it, esp when I have my benzos on hand.  When I first started tripping, I would know that I was starting to/was still tripping if I saw skulls flowing down the walls...lol. Now it takes a bit more to get to the visuals I want, it used to be a lot easier/take less.


^^^

All the 2c-e I've ever had has always been a very fine, fluffy, white powder.  2C-I looks a bit more yellow-ish, and 4-AcO-DMT has ranged in color from pure white to slightly tan in color.  2C-T-2 is fucking huge compared to the other 2c's I've seen, it's not very dense at all.

30mg 2c-e is a pretty fucking huge dose, it's not for everyone.

i recently ate a g of cubes on 20-25mg of 2ce it was pretty nice, very slow photo fake visuals, i def recommend the combo ime, just know your doses and potentcy. 2ce by yourself does get pretty dark mentally and visually, iv had visuals by myself that were pretty fuckin scary. i recommend doing it alone if your able to its pretty interesting


my 2ce and 2ci have both been very white, the 2ce although was more fluffy, have had fat thumb nail sized clumps/rocks 


whats the shelf life left in powder form? and whats the liquid shelf life when mixed with a liquid?

This is the only widely known 2ce to be chemically analyzed and let me tell you it was fucking insane. I've taken up to 60mg before of 2ce from legitimate vendors and none of that matched how insanely visual, nauseating and intense 35mg of this stuff was. Anyone who might have some, I would advise dosing very conservatively to start with, IMO.

That sounds about right, that's definitely within the realms of normality, rather than 60mg. I would think the 60mg dose was coming from a very impure batch, which is what you seem to be saying anyway. 35mg would be a heavy dose for me too. It's great that it has been analyzed for purity - it should be standard practice.

Please mate, don't be advising people to take 60mg of 2C-E, I don't care how awesome your trip was. That is a gigantic dose for most people, you are the exception to the rule and I'm sure there is a good explanation as to why you were able to tolerate such a large dose. Remember this is a harm reduction forum, and many people passing through here are very naive about these things.

You know for me *sometimes* people are just distractions to prevent a trip from fully unraveling. There's an unspeakable effect to the trip where when someone speaks nonsense or people are constantly like "what?" it creates weird tangents in the direction of your thoughts. I guess what I'm trying to say is, that sometimes people can end up keeping you grounded to reality, and the trip never really takes off.


Anyways, I'm wondering if anyone can tell me if there's a significant difference between sublingual and oral administration for 2c-e?

generally speaking sublingual dosing requires less material, but i've not done it with 2c-e.  This is mostly due to the rather caustic sensations most 2c-x's cause on mucosae.  They generally taste none-too-pleasant either, but some people don't mind it as much.  I'd probably go with 2/3 of an oral dose or about what one would dose rectally.  Bout time to split this into a new B&D.
