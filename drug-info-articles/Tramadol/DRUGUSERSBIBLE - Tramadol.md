## Subjective Experience

Launched under the brand name tramal in 1977, tramadol is a synthetic opioid
analgesic which also acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. It is currently marketed
as a generic medication under a variety of brand names and is a common
prescription drug.

My supply came via an accident: someone else’s accident. As per standard practice, it
was prescribed as a painkiller, and I was offered a blister pack to photograph for
another project. Rather than discarding this after the event, I chose to put some of its
contents to a constructive use.

Straight off the bat it is important to stress that this must be treated with a great deal
of caution, particularly regarding dosage. TripSit categorically states that there is a
“Risk of seizure at doses over 300mg”. This is echoed by Erowid thus: “Doses over
300 mg can be physically dangerous in non-tolerated or smaller users.” Don’t
ignore this paragraph.

Wikipedia’s contribution on this is as follows:

```
“Common side effects include constipation, itchiness, and nausea. Serious
side effects may include seizures, increased risk of serotonin syndrome,
decreased alertness, and drug addiction“.
```
With words like these ringing in my ears, and with less than pleasant experiences in
the bank with respect to other opioids, I decide to tread carefully, and head to the
lower end of the common threshold, with a dose of 100mg.

```
T+0:00 I take two of the 50mg capsules from the pack and swill them down
the hatch with a glass of cold water. [15:50]
```
```
T+1:00 Gradually, over the last hour, the effects have emerged: a sort of heady
relaxed feeling, with anxieties dissipated. I am able to function completely
normally as far as I can tell. This is not unpleasant at all.
```
```
I am warm, with mouth becoming slightly dry from time to time. Looking in
the mirror I may be flushed and a little glassy eyed.
```
```
T+2:00 I have now settled into a slightly dazed comfort zone, with a little
uplift. As I find with opioids generally a want for more intensity is present if I
think about it. It is hard to measure, but I have an impression that my speed of
thought has slowed down.
```
```
T+3:00 I am not as hungry as usual for this time of day, but I manage to eat a
small meal (vegetarian). The comfort zone may be of a slightly lower order
now, but I am still warm and contented.
```
```
T+7:00 Slowly but surely the effects have wound down over the last few hours,
although I still experience a calm dreamy and restive afterglow. I retire to bed
at about 10:30pm.
```
The night’s sleep was a good one, and I awoke with no hangover, other than a little
fogginess. This was largely chased away by the morning coffee, although some
tiredness did persist for a few hours.

Overall this was quite a pleasant ride. There was some sea-sickness-like dizziness at
times, suggesting that I may have been borderline on the dose with respect to
negative payload, but on the 100mg I just about got away with it.

Finally, a reminder on both the dosage and the addiction potential: be cautious and
of course, never make a habit of it.
