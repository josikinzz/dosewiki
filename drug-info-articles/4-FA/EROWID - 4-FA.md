Canada #
 
4-fluoroamphetamine is not listed under Canadian law, but Health Canada considers it an analogue of amphetamine, and thus a Schedule III controlled substance. See [http://isomerdesign.com/Cdsa/HC/StatusDecisions/A-2013-00235%20-%20PDFs/C-4-Fluoroamphetamine-2009-06-19.pdf](http://isomerdesign.com/Cdsa/HC/StatusDecisions/A-2013-00235%20-%20PDFs/C-4-Fluoroamphetamine-2009-06-19.pdf) . "The drug is currently not listed specifically on the CDSA. However, Item 1 of Schedule III is, “Amphetamines, their salts, derivatives, isomers and analogues and salts of derivatives, isomers and analogues including.” As analogue is defined in the CDSA as, 'a substance that, in relation to a controlled substance, has a substantially similar chemical structure', 4-fluoroamphetamine must be considered an analogue of amphetamine."
