## Subjective Experience

Welcome to the world of nootropic stacks. A stack is a combination of two or more
supplements that have a synergistic effect on cognitive functionality and/or
motivation. Stacking is a widely practised approach to nootropic medication.

This particular combination was highly cited at the time of testing, but was generally
used as part of a daily or regular regime, which is outside the parameters I set for my
personal safety. As a single dose experience, it was hard to distinguish its effects. In
other words, it invoked a mild stimulation, with a possible clarity that could easily
have been a placebo effect.
