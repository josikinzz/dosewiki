## Subjective Experience

Rhodiola Rosea has been used in traditional medicine to treat a variety of disorders,
but primarily with respect to this book, anxiety and depression. Its root contains
about 140 chemical compounds although contemporaneously rosavin is often
extracted for these purposes.

I sampled this on the second day of a visit to Australia, whilst (as usual) I was
suffering from significant jet lag. The packet was labelled Rhodiola 3, and 3%
Rosavin, with Super Concentrate capitalized on the rear.

At about 1pm a colleague poured some of the powder into a gel cap. This wasn’t a
measured dose, but given my condition and that I was feeling wretched my
judgement was impaired and I consumed it anyway.

By 2pm I was experiencing a mild heady sedation, which wasn’t unpleasant. I was
being driven down the M1 towards Brisbane, and it produced a generally relaxed
blanket over the jet lag. At 3pm I noted the impression that if I was lying in a bed
rather than sitting in a car this would have helped me to drop off. I generally felt
sleepy and relaxed in a less jet-lagged and more positive sort of way.

Overall this was a mild but decent anxiolytic ride, which faded over the following
hours.
