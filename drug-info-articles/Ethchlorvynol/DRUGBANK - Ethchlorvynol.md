*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00189*

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as ynones. These are organic compounds containing the ynone functional group, an alpha,beta unsaturated ketone group with the general structure  RC#C-C(=O)R' (R'  not H).

### Background

Ethchlorvynol is a sedative and hypnotic drug. It has been used to treat insomnia, but has been largely superseded and is only offered where an intolerance or allergy to other drugs exists.

### Indication

Used for short-term hypnotic therapy in the management of insomnia for periods of up to one week in duration; however, this medication generally has been replaced by other sedative-hypnotic agents.

### Pharmacodynamics

Ethchlorvynol is a sedative drug and schedule IV (USA) controlled substance. It produces cerebral depression, however the exact mechanism of action is not known.

### Mechanism of Action

GABA(A) Receptor
Positive allosteric modulator

### Absorption

Rapidly absorbed from gastrointestinal tract.

### Metabolism

About 90% of a dose is metabolized in the liver. Some ethchlorvynol may also be metabolized in the kidneys. Ethchlorvynol and metabolites undergo extensive enterohepatic recirculation.

### Half-life

Plasma half-life is approximately 10 to 20 hours, terminal half-life is 21-100 hours.

### Toxicity

Symptoms of overdose include thrombocytopenia.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

### Mechanism of action

Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, ethchlorvynol appears to depress the central nervous system in a manner similar to that of barbiturates. Barbiturates bind at a distinct binding sites associated with a Cl
-
ionopore at the GABA
A
receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl
-
ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged.

### General Function

Beta subunit of the heteropentameric ligand-gated chloride channel gated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain (PubMed:19763268, PubMed:27789573, PubMed:29950725, PubMed:8264558). GABA-gated chloride channels, also named GABA(A) receptors (GABAAR), consist of five subunits arranged around a central pore and contain GABA active binding site(s) located at the alpha and beta subunit interface(s) (PubMed:29950725). When activated by GABA, GABAARs selectively allow the flow of chloride anions across the cell membrane down their electrochemical gradient (By similarity). Chloride influx into the postsynaptic neuron following GABAAR opening decreases the neuron ability to generate a new action potential, thereby reducing nerve transmission (By similarity). GABAARs containing alpha-1 and beta-2 or -3 subunits exhibit synaptogenic activity; the gamma-2 subunit being necessary but not sufficient to induce rapid synaptic contacts formation (PubMed:23909897, PubMed:25489750). Extrasynaptic beta-2 receptors contribute to the tonic GABAergic inhibition (By similarity). Beta-containing GABAARs can simultaneously bind GABA and histamine where histamine binds at the interface of two neighboring beta subunits, which may be involved in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness (By similarity)
