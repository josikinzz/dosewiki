*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/methylphenidate/*

Methylphenidate is a stimulant that’s widely used in the treatment of ADHD. It is also used for narcolepsy and has been looked at for many other conditions.

Outside of medical settings, it can provide recreational and work-enhancing effects. As such, prescriptions are often diverted.

The effects provided by methylphenidate (e.g. stimulation and euphoria) are generally less significant than what’s seen with an amphetamine like [adderall](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/adderall/) .
