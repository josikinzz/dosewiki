- Light: 50 - 70 mg
- Common: 70 - 100 mg
- Strong: 100 - 125 mg
- Heavy: 125 mg +

**Hexedrone** is a novel synthetic [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) of the [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cathinone) class. It has been speculated to act as a [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) - [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) - [reuptake-inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) (NDRI).

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration) and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) .

Little is known about toxicity, addiction, and abuse potential of hexedrone. Due to its novelty and extremely short history of human usage, all information related to the use of this compound should be treated with caution.

## Chemistry

Hexedrone is a [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinone) , which is closely related to [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamines) , but have a ß-substituted ketone group as well. Relative to regular cathinone, which can be found in the Khat plant, hexedrone consists of two added substitutions. At the R 2 position, a n-Butyl substitution forms a hexan chain. The second substitution is a Methyl group, that's attached to the amine (R 4 ), thus forming N-Methyl.

## Pharmacology

Due to the lack of research regarding the substance, all discussion regarding the pharmacology of it is purely based upon its structure and subjective effect similarities to other [cathinones](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinone) such as [pentedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pentedrone) and others. Hexedrone most likely acts as both a [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) . This allows [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) to build up within the brain, resulting in [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) effects.

The decreased potency, compared to both pentedrone as well as [ethyl-hexedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ethyl-Hexedrone) can be easily explained. Compared to pentedrone, there is a larger non-polar side chain. Ethyl-hexedrone has an ethyl group, instead of a methyl, which results in a significantly shifted electronegativity.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Spontaneous tactile sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_tactile_sensations)** - High doses of hexedrone result in a pleasurable body high characterized by pleasant tingling.
- **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the user's physical energy levels, hexedrone can be considered to be extremely stimulating and energetic.
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** - Dry mouth and increased sweating can occur after consuming hexedrone. Low doses of the substance in question cause minimal dehydration.
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** - Hexedrone can be considered slightly vasoconstricting.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)**
- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component can be considered to be less intense when compared with that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is mostly present in lower doses when not overshadowed by euphoria.
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)** ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
## Toxicity and harm potential

Since hexedrone has been insufficiently studied and most data consists of speculation and user experiences, one should be especially cautious when it comes to the risks and harm this substance may pose, especially in terms of seriouslong-term health hazards.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , the chronic use of Hexedrone can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of hexedrone develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Hexedrone presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of Hexedrone all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) will have a reduced effect.

## Legal status

- **Brazil** : On September 7, 2018, all Cathinone analogues are controlled substances considered illegal to possess, use and distribute. This was made possible due to a blanket ban law appended to Portaria SVS/MS nº 344.
- **Germany** : Hexedrone is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of November 26, 2016. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.
- **Switzerland** : Hexedrone can be considered a controlled substance as a defined derivative of Cathinone under Verzeichnis E point 1. It is legal when used for scientific or industrial use.
- **United Kingdom** : Hexedrone is a Class B drug in the United Kingdom as a result of the cathinone catch-all clause.

Hexadrone is a stimulant of the substituted cathinone class which has been sold as a designer drug. Through analysis of the Structure-Activity Relationships in similar cathinones such as MDPV, hexedrone is believed to be a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor.
Subjective effects include stimulation, disinhibition, thought acceleration and euphoria.
Little is known about toxicity, addiction, and abuse potential of hexedrone. Due to its novelty and extremely short history of human usage, all information related to the use of this compound should be treated with caution.

## Legal status

In the UK, Hexedrone is a Class B drug under The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) Order 2010 following the ACMD's report on substituted cathinone derivatives, making it illegal to sell, buy, or possess without a license.
