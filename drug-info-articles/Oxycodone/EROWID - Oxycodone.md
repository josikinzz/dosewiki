Oxycodone (Percocet, Oxycontin)
 
Basics
 
by Erowid
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
[Oxycodone Images](https://erowid.org/oxycodone_images.shtml)
 
Oxycodone (Percocet, Oxycontin) is a semi-synthetic opioid analgesic (pain killer) similar to morphine. Oxycodone is widely prescribed for the relief of moderate to severe pain, in both regular and time-release forms. It is widely available by prescription and is notoriously addictive, leading many users to have problems controlling their own use. 
 
[ [Main Oxycodone Vault](https://erowid.org/oxycodone.shtml) ]
 
[Dose](https://erowid.org/oxycodone_law.shtml) #
 
Oxycodone typically comes in different strengths, including: 5 mg capsules; 5, 10, 15, and 30 mg oral tablets; and 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg sustained-release tablets. Some people choose to grind and insufflate (snort) oxycodone tablets in order to get a stronger effect, however, the use of higher dose sustained-release tablets in this manner can be very dangerous. 
 
 An average adult dose is typically 5 mg every six hours. Tolerance develops very quickly; those who take it on a daily basis may find they need to increase their dosage in order to get the same effects. Higher doses, especially the 80 mg sustained-release tablets are for opioid-tolerant people only.
 
Price #
 
Prescription prices vary but have increased since the introduction of the gummy anti-injection/anti-snorting versions of Oxycodone tablets. Prices in the U.S. are in the range of $5-10 per 40 mg tablet in the United States (2013), with street prices around $1 USD per mg ($40 per 40mg tablet). Canadian prices are around 1.25-1.75 CDN per mg for OxyNeo and 2-2.5 CDN per millligram of oxycodone. **much** lower.
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/oxycodone_law.shtml) #
 
Oxycodone is available by prescription only in most countries. It is Schedule II in the United States, making it illegal to sell without a license and illegal to purchase or possess without a prescription.
 
[Chemistry](https://erowid.org/oxycodone_chemistry.shtml) #
 
Oxycodone is an opioid analgesic, closely related chemically to opioids such as codeine and morphine.
 
Pharmacology #
 
As with most other opioids, oxycodone's mechanism of analgesic action is unknown. It is presumed to work by affecting opioid receptors found in the brain.
 
Production #
 
Most recreationally consumed oxycodone is diverted from prescription medical uses, rather than produced/manufactured illegally.
 
History #
 
Oxycodone was first synthesized in 1916 in Germany and has been used therapeutically since shortly thereafter. It has been available in the United States since about 1939. It became more popular in the 1950s. It was placed into Schedule II in the U.S. in 1970. The sustained-release form (Oxycontin) has been available in the U.S. since 1995/6 and quickly gained popularity.
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
Brand Names:
 
Percocet, Percodan, Endocodone, M-oxy, Oxycontin, Oxydose, OxyFAST, OxyIR, Percolone, Roxicodone, Roxicet, Supeudol, Tylox.
 
The Substance:
 
Oxy, Oxies, O.C.'s, Oxycottons, Oxy 80's, Hillbilly Heroin, Roxies, Percs.
 
The Experience:
 
Jammed.
 
EFFECTS #
 
Primary effects include analgesia (pain relief), sedation, reduction of anxiety, euphoria, and relaxation.
 
Onset #
 
Effects are generally felt 10-30 minutes after oral ingestion, although it can take up to an hour to feel the full effects.
 
Duration #
 
Oxycodone, when taken orally (and not in sustained-release form) has effects that last last from 3 to 5 hours. Sustained-release tablets last up to 12 hours.
 
Visual Effects #
 
Rarely (less than 1% in clinical trials) oxycodone may result in changes in visual perception, or abnormal vision.
 
PROBLEMS #
 
Side effects range from the common: constipation, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, itching/pruritus, dry mouth, sweating, fatigue, and weakness; to the less common: impaired thinking, confusion, loss of appetite, nervousness, sleeplessness/insomnia, fever, diarrhea, difficulty urinating, clammy skin, light-headedness, and fainting; to the rare and very concerning: abdominal pain, seizures, convulsions, difficulty breathing, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and circulatory depression or shock.
 
Contraindications #
 
Combining oxycodone with alcohol or other CNS depressants can lead to a dangerous slowing of the central nervous system and respiratory system. Other contraindications include: 
- those hypersensitive to opiates history of drug or alcohol abuse those with head injuries, increased intracranial pressure, seizures, asthma, COPD, prostatic hyperplassia, severe hepatic or renal disease, acute abdominal conditions, urethral stricture, hypothyroidism, Addison's disease, or arrhythmias
 
Addiction Potential #
 
Oxycodone is both physically and psychologically addicting. Anyone taking it, whether for recreational or medicinal reasons, may become addicted, especially if it is used on a daily basis. Tolerance is developed over a period of weeks, resulting in higher doses being needed to achieve the same effects. Withdrawal symptoms, including aches and pains, restlessness, nausea, anxiety, diarrhea, fever, headaches, runny nose, tremors, sweating, vomiting, and trouble sleeping, may be experienced by those ceasing use after regular and especially high-dose use.

DESCRIPTION #
 
Oxycodone is a semi-synthetic opioid analgesic used to treat moderate to severe pain. It is most effective treating acute pain rather than chronic pain. The precise mechanism of action of oxycodone and other opiates is not known, although it is believed to relate to the existence of opiate receptors in the central nervous system.

Oxycodone Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
Oxycodone is available in several forms. Percocet contains between 2.5-10 mg oxycodone and 325-650 mg acetaminophen/paracetamol. Percodan most often contains 4.5 mg oxycodone and 325 mg aspirin. Oxycontin is a timed-release form that gradually releases oxycodone (10, 20, 40, 80, or 160 mg) over several hours when taken orally. Other formulations are available.

**Onset : 10 - 30 minutes Coming Up: 30 - 60 minutes Peak : 30 - 60 minutes Plateau : 2 - 4 hours Duration : 3 - 6 hours**
 
 The chart above shows oral dosages for individuals with different levels of tolerance to opiates. Because people quickly develop tolerance to the effects of oxycodone, dosages will vary dramatically depending on whether an individual has been using regularly, and for how long. Some new users report an alarming degree of sedation and nausea after taking 15 mg, while some chronic users report taking 200 mg or more a day.

 Some people choose to insufflate (snort) oxycodone in order to deliver a more rapid onset. Note that snorting any substance can result in injury to nasal passags, sinuses, throat, etc and crushed tablets include binders and inert ingredients that do not rapidly dissolve.

**Oxycodone (Oxycontin, Percoset, Roxycodone) Health Concerns** 
 **by Erowid** 
 
 
DEATHS #
 
Respiratory arrest and death stemming from overdose or drug combinations involving oxycodone is the most serious health concern from oxycodone use . Deaths from oxycodone alone or in combination with other CNS depressants [data?] Although the death rate from opioids increased between 1999 and 2011, the rate of increase has slowed since 2006.[1]
 
WARNINGS #
 
- Respiratory Depression. Respiratory depression from taking too much oxycodone or mixing it with other CNS depressants can have life-threatening consequences. 
 
 [grabbed from Alcohol Health] Seek medical attention if : 
 The person is unconscious and cannot be wakened 
 Breathing is irregular and/or shallow 
 You suspect oxycodone has been mixed with other drugs 
 Skin is clammy or pale
- Depressant Combinations. Avoid other depressants (alcohol, benzos, opiates, some dissociatives) in combination with oxycodone, which can increase respiratory depressions risks.
- Oxycodone is Addicting. Oxycodone is an opiate and, as with most opiates, is addicting. Some people find opiates very appealing and with even moderate use, can find themselves using more than they want to. With regular use, the body becomes physically dependent upon the substance, causing withdrawal symptoms if use is ceased.
- Oxycodone Causes Tolerance. Those who use Oxycodone for many days in a row report that they begin to require a higher dose for the same effects. Beware of dosages recommended by an individual who uses Oxycodone regularly as their dose could be dangerous for a non-user due to tolerance.
 
CAUTIONS #
 
- Frequent or increased use. Many people have reported using more oxycodone than they intended. Often this takes the form of continuing to redose repeatedly after they had planned to stop, or taking more oxycodone to achieve the same effects.
- Constipation. Using opiates like oxycodone can cause constipation.
- Hyperalgesia stemming from chronic use. Some people report a heightened sensitivity to pain after prolonged use of opiates.

 After high-dose oxycodone tablets as OxyContin were approved in 2005, the FDA revoked its approval of the original sustained-release formulation in 2010 because of the record of unapproved use. A re-engineered OxyContin product was released to try to make it harder to snort or inject and in April 2013, the FDA approved a newer formulation that is even harder to snort or inject. See [http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm348252.htm](http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm348252.htm) .
 
INTERNATIONAL LAW #
 
Australia #
 
Oxycodone is a controlled drug in Australia and prescriptions must be recent (6? 12? months) to authorize current possession. (unconfirmed) (thanks JL)
 
Canada #
 
Oxycodone is schedule I in Canada. (Note: Canadian schedules are very different than U.S. schedules)
 
Germany #
 
Oxycodone is BTM Anlage 3 in Germany making it illegal to possess without a BTM prescription. (unconfirmed) (thanks PM)
 
U.K. #
