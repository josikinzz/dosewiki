# Pregabalin
*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00230*

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as gamma amino acids and derivatives. These are amino acids having a (-NH2) group attached to the gamma carbon atom.

### Background

Pregabalin is structurally similar to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) - an inhibitory neurotransmitter.
13
It may be used to manage neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, and fibromyalgia among other conditions.
20
Although as per the FDA Label the mechanism of action has not been definitively characterized, there is evidence that pregabalin exerts its effects by binding to the α2δ subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels.
20
,
22
Pregabalin is marketed by Pfizer under the trade name Lyrica and Lyrica Cr (extended release).
21
,
22
It may have dependence liability if misused but the risk appears to be highest in patients with current or past substance use disorders.
4

### Indication

Pregabalin is indicated for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury, and as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older.
22

### Pharmacodynamics

Although the structure of pregabalin is similar to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), it does not bind to GABA receptors.
6
,
20
Instead, it binds the alpha2-delta subunit of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system.
6
,
20
Pregabalin does not modulate dopamine receptors, serotonin receptors, opiate receptors, sodium channels or cyclooxygenase activity.
20

### Mechanism of Action

Voltage-dependent calcium channel subunit alpha-2/delta-1
Modulator

### Absorption

After oral dosing administered in the fasted state, pregabalin absorption is rapid, and extensive.
8
Pregabalin oral bioavailability is reported to be ≥90% regardless of the dose.
8
Cmax is attained within 1.5 hours after single or multiple doses, and steady state is attained within 24-48 hours with repeated administration.
8
,
22
Both Cmax and AUC appear to be dose proportional.
8
Food decreases the rate of pregabalin absorption and as a result, lowers the Cmax by an estimated 25-30% and increases the Tmax to approximately 3 hours.
22
However, the effect of food does not appear to impact the total absorption of pregabalin in a way that is clinically relevant. As a result, pregabalin can be administered with or without food.
22

### Metabolism

Less than 2% of pregabalin is metabolized and it is excreted virtually unchanged in the urine.

### Half-life

The elimination half life of pregabalin is 6.3 hours.
22

### Toxicity

In a systematic review that included 38 randomized controlled trials, there were 20 identified adverse effects that were significantly associated with pregabalin, most of which involve the central nervous system and cognition.  The identified adverse effects include vertigo, dizziness, balance disorder, incoordination, ataxia, blurred vision, diplopia, amblyopia, somnolence, confusional state, tremor, disturbance in attention, abnormal thinking, asthenia, fatigue, euphoria, edema, peripheral edema, dry mouth, and constipation
14
.
The most common symptoms of pregabalin toxicity (dose range includes 800 mg/day and single doses up to 11,500 mg) include somnolence, confusion, restlessness, agitation, depression, affective disorder and seizures.
23
Since there is no antidote for pregabalin overdose, patients should receive general supportive care. If appropriate, gastric lavage or emesis may help eliminate unabsorbed pregabalin (healthcare providers should take standard precautions to maintain the airway).
23
Pregabalin pharmacokinetic properties suggest that extra-corporeal elimination methods including haemodialysis, may be useful in situations of severe toxicity.
19
However, there are cases where patients have presented with very high serum levels of pregabalin and have been successfully managed with supportive care alone.
19

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The therapeutic efficacy of 1,2-Benzodiazepine can be increased when used in combination with Pregabalin.
Abacavir
Pregabalin may decrease the excretion rate of Abacavir which could result in a higher serum level.
Acarbose
The risk or severity of hypoglycemia can be increased when Pregabalin is combined with Acarbose.
Acebutolol
Pregabalin may increase the bradycardic activities of Acebutolol.
Aceclofenac
Aceclofenac may decrease the excretion rate of Pregabalin which could result in a higher serum level.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol. Alcohol may increase CNS effects.
Take with or without food. Food alters drug absorption, but not to a clinically significant extent.

### Mechanism of action

Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, studies involving structurally related drugs suggest that presynaptic binding of pregabalin to voltage-gated calcium channels is key to the antiseizure and antinociceptive effects observed in animal models.
22
By binding presynaptically to the alpha2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system, pregabalin modulates the release of several excitatory neurotransmitters including glutamate, substance-P, norepinephrine, and calcitonin gene related peptide.
6
In addition, pregabalin prevents the alpha2-delta subunit from being trafficked from the dorsal root ganglia to the spinal dorsal horn, which may also contribute to the mechanism of action.
15
Although pregabalin is a structural derivative of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), it does not bind directly to GABA or benzodiazepine receptors.

### Volume of distribution

After oral administration of pregabalin, the reported apparent volume of distribution is roughly 0.5 L/kg.
22
Although pregabalin is not very lipophilic, it is able to cross the blood brain barrier(BBB).
16
System L transporters facilitate the transport of large amino acids across the BBB and it has been confirmed that pregabalin is a substrate.
22
,
16
This information suggests that system L transporters are responsible for pregabalin uptake into the BBB.
16
In rat models, pregabalin has been shown to cross the placenta.
22

### Protein binding

Pregabalin is not plasma protein bound.
8
,
22

### Route of elimination

Pregabalin is almost exclusively eliminated in the urine.
17
,
18
Further, based on preclinical studies, pregabalin does not appear to undergo racemization to the R enantiomer in the body.
11

### Clearance

In young healthy subjects the mean renal clearance is estimated to be 67.0 to 80.9 mL mL/min.
22
Given pregabalin's lack of plasma protein binding, this clearance rate suggests that renal tubular reabsorption is involved.

### General Function

The heterodimer with SLC3A2 functions as a sodium-independent, high-affinity transporter that mediates uptake of large neutral amino acids such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, histidine, methionine, tryptophan, valine, isoleucine and alanine (PubMed:10049700, PubMed:10574970, PubMed:11557028, PubMed:11564694, PubMed:12117417, PubMed:12225859, PubMed:15769744, PubMed:18262359, PubMed:25998567, PubMed:30867591, PubMed:9751058). The heterodimer with SLC3A2 mediates the uptake of L-DOPA (By similarity). Functions as an amino acid exchanger (PubMed:11557028, PubMed:12117417, PubMed:12225859, PubMed:30867591). May play a role in the transport of L-DOPA across the blood-brain barrier (By similarity). May act as the major transporter of tyrosine in fibroblasts (Probable). May mediate blood-to-retina L-leucine transport across the inner blood-retinal barrier (By similarity). Can mediate the transport of thyroid hormones diiodothyronine (T2), triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) across the cell membrane (PubMed:11564694). When associated with LAPTM4B, the heterodimer formed by SLC3A2 and SLC7A5 is recruited to lysosomes to promote leucine uptake into these organelles, and thereby mediates mTORC1 activation (PubMed:25998567). Involved in the uptake of toxic methylmercury (MeHg) when administered as the L-cysteine or D,L-homocysteine complexes (PubMed:12117417). Involved in the cellular activity of small molecular weight nitrosothiols, via the stereoselective transport of L-nitrosocysteine (L-CNSO) across the membrane (PubMed:15769744)
