## Subjective Experience

DOM was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in 1963 and was later documented
in his book PiHKAL. It gained particular prominence during the summer of love
(1967), but a number of issues emerged, apparently due to the circulation of
particularly high-dosed pills, its slow onset and long duration. There were a number
of hospitalisations at the epicentre (San Francisco) causing some notoriety and
supply of the drug began to fade thereafter. Nonetheless, Shulgin listed this as one of
his magical half-dozen; his personal favourite compounds.

I finally obtained my supply some years after the publication of the first edition of
this book, but there was a hitch: the supplier was unsure whether the pills were
dosed at 3mg or 5mg. Given this dubious uncertainty I was particularly careful, and
of course sent some of my supply for full laboratory analysis.

On confirmation that this was indeed authentic DOM, I was left with one full pill
along with a crumbled half-pill, and something of a dilemma regarding dose. Despite
wanting to go reasonably high, I eventually decided to take a logical and cautious
path, and undertake two experiments: one with the crumbled half-pill and the other
at a later date with the full pill.

Regarding anticipated effects, this psychedelic is also a substituted amphetamine,
with a reputation for relative stimulation and an intense body high. Despite the
large-dose issues cited above, at the level I am limited to I don’t expect any
complications to arise.

```
T+0.00 I pop the half-pill into my mouth, gently bite to crumble it, and
swallow with water [11.15am]
```
```
T+1.00 An hour in there is little to report other than some semblance of a
potentially emerging headspace.
```
```
T+2.00 The headspace is now a little stronger. There is a hint of body load,
but with some stimulation and potential for horn. I feel a little chilly but
clammy at the same time.
```
```
T+3.00 In truth I have felt tight-chested and uncomfortable for the last hour
or so. It’s hard to escape the notion that this is what the onset of a heart
attack might feel like.
```
```
The upside is there but I am not able to properly enjoy this due to this issue.
There is a moderate headspace in play, with the stimulation and increased
sexual appetite becoming increasingly prominent.
```
```
T+4.00 I lie in bed for a while and notice that my hands are trembling. The
tight chest remains. I would describe the headspace as mellow, but there are
no OEVs or CEVs to speak of, but rather, a bit of blurred and fuzzy vision.
```
```
At this point I check my blood pressure and BPM. The former is 128/86, and
latter is a steady 56. These may seem reasonable but both figures are
significantly off my norm. I usually hover around 125/75 with a BPM of less
than 50 (which is generally considered to be quite low). The 86 (diastolic
blood pressure) is higher than I have ever seen it.
```
```
T+5.00 With the chest discomfort being strong and persistent I take 0.5mg of
etizolam to (hopefully) calm it.
```
```
T+6.00 It appears that the benzo has now started to take effect in that my
chest feels a little healthier. Blood pressure is back to normal although my
BPM remains elevated at 57. Not surprisingly I am now a little jaded and tired.
```
```
T+8.00 The unpleasantness has largely subsided, leaving a hazy heady slightly
sleepy feel, and a general body awareness ebbing and flowing in the
```

```
background. The sexual payload has faded as well, and I note that this drug
could certainly be characterised as an effective chemsex agent.
```
```
T+9.00 I take a short and gentle swim, and the stretching makes me feel a
little better. I am in the afterglow at this point, with just a mild headspace and
some body tactility.
```
```
As bedtime approaches (9.30pm, over 10 hours in) I am somewhat exhausted,
in both body and mind, and am seriously looking forward to slumber. I feel
like I have been put through a ringer.
```
On reaching the bedroom I took 1mg of etizolam, which as usual delivered a sound
night’s sleep. In the morning I felt a little distant but was generally well. On checking
my BPM and blood pressure at lunch time I was back within normal parameters.
