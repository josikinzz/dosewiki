4-AcO-DET, also known as 4-acetoxy-N,N-diethyltryptamine as well as ethacetin or ethylacybin, is a psychedelic tryptamine. It was first synthesized in 1958 by Albert Hofmann in the Sandoz lab.

## Use and effects

4-AcO-DET is orally active, and doses of 10 to 25 mg are common. Effects last 4 to 6 hours.  The free base is also active when smoked in a dose range of 5 to 20 mg. Smoking 4-AcO-DET greatly speeds up the onset; peak effects are experienced within 10 minutes, and are usually over within 1 hour.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

It is expected that 4-AcO-DET is quickly hydrolyzed into the free phenolic 4-HO-DET by serum esterases, but human studies concerning the metabolic fate of this drug are lacking.

## Chemistry

### Analogues
