**3-Chlorophencyclidine** (commonly known as **3-Chloro-PCP** or **3-Cl-PCP** ) is a novel [dissociative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) substance of the [arylcyclohexylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Arylcyclohexylamine) class that produces potent [dissociative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) , [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) and [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoric) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) .

3-Cl-PCP was presumably first synthesized in 2020 and was marketed alongside other novel dissociatives that were produces at roughly the same time, such as [3-F-PCP](/w/index.php?title=3-F-PCP&action=edit&redlink=1) and [DMXE](/w/index.php?title=DMXE&action=edit&redlink=1) .

It is known to primarily induce a state referred to as " [dissociative anesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives#Subjective_effects) ", albeit the extent to which this occurs has been reported to be highly dose-dependent and variable in its effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] It is said to produce little stimulating effects compared to [3-MeO-PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-MeO-PCP) or [3-HO-PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-HO-PCP) and share some sedating characteristics with [DCK](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DCK) .

There are also reports that suggest this compound may produce more physical side effects such as muscle soreness, elevated cardiovascular functions and flu-like symptoms during or shortly after administration. This suggests it may be uniquely more dangerous or toxic than related dissociatives, particularly at higher doses. It's chlorine substitution might make it hard to break down by the body and some reports suggest it produces such physical effects which might hint towards this effect. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Today, 3-Cl-PCP is almost exclusively distributed as a gray area [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) by online vendors. Extremely little is known about its pharmacology, metabolism and toxicity in humans. Due to its sensitive dose-response, potential habit-forming properties, as well as unknown toxicity profile, it is strongly recommended that one use proper [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if choosing to use this substance.

## History and culture

3-Cl-PCP was first synthesized in 2021 alongside other novel dissociatives designed to mimic the effects of [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) . The list also includes [MXPr](/w/index.php?title=MXPr&action=edit&redlink=1) , [MXiPr](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXiPr) , [DMXE](/w/index.php?title=DMXE&action=edit&redlink=1) , [3-F-PCP](/w/index.php?title=3-F-PCP&action=edit&redlink=1) , [3-Me-PCP](/w/index.php?title=3-Me-PCP&action=edit&redlink=1) and [HXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/HXE) .

## Chemistry

3-Cl-PCP, or 3-chlorophencyclidine, is a synthetic dissociative of the arylcyclohexylamine class. The structure of 3-Cl-PCP is comprised of cyclohexane, a six-member saturated ring, bonded to two additional rings at R 1 . One of these rings is a piperidine ring, a nitrogenous six member ring, bonded at its nitrogen group. The other ring is an aromatic phenyl ring, substituted at R 3 with a chlorine substitution.

3-Cl-PCP is a structural analog of [PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PCP) and [3-MeO-PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-MeO-PCP) .

## Pharmacology

Like other [arylcyclohexylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Arylcyclohexylamine) [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives) , 3-Cl-PCP acts principally as an [NMDA receptor antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor_antagonist) . In comparison to [PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PCP) and other related analogs like [3-MeO-PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-MeO-PCP) , this compound acts as more of a NMDA receptor antagonist whilst still being an equipotent [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) reuptake inhibitor like the aformentioned compounds.

The NMDA (N-Methyl-D-Aspartate) receptor, a specific subtype of the [glutamate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Glutamate) receptor, modulates the transmission of electrical signals between neurons in the brain and spinal cord; for the signals to pass, the receptor must be open. Dissociatives inhibit the normal functioning NMDA receptors by binding to and blocking them. This disruption of neural network activity causes network disintegration, some research suggests, by hyperconnectivity throughout the brain. This causes an increase in noise (random, nonsensical and erraneous data) on the cerebral network and thus produces loss of normal cognitive and affective processing, psychomotor functioning, and anesthesia. This is often observed in those showing psychosis or induced with high-dose IV THC or Ketamine in healthy participants, please see references.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** & **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - These two effects can alter between one another, but users report that sedation is more present with minimal stimulation.
- **[Restless legs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Restless_legs)**
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)**
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)**
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - This effect is usually not present.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** and **[Tactile suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression)** - At lower dosages, this compound tends to induce tactile enhancements. At higher dosages, this enhancement shifts towards tactile suppressions and [anesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) .
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)** - This substance can produce distinct nerve-signal blocking anesthetic effects typically fit for surgical settings, but only in the stronger to heavier dose ranges.
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)**
- **[Changes in felt gravity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_gravity)**
- **[Spatial disorientation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spatial_disorientation)** - In contrast to other dissociatives like ketamine, this effect is only prominent at high doses.
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** - 3-Cl-PCP may produce feelings of increased cardiovascular output or strain as if one's body is working harder to metabolize the substance.
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)**
- **[Olfactory hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Olfactory_hallucinations)**

- **[Erectile dysfunction](/w/index.php?title=Erectile_dysfunction&action=edit&redlink=1)**
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - This extent to which this effect can be produced is unknown but can likely happen in those predisposed to them, especially while in physically taxing conditions such as being dehydrated, fatigued or undernourished. ### Disconnective effects
 
- The disconnective effects of this compound appear to be less prominent compared to dissociatives like [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) or [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) . They seem to not occur at common doses and may only occur at levels that may be accompanied by potentially dangerous side effects. 
- **[Tactile disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_disconnection)**
- **[Visual disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection)**

- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)** - This effect is more prominent based on the route of administration used. For example, it is especially present when [smoked](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Route_of_administration#Smoked) or [vaporized](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Route_of_administration#Vaporized) , due to the relative abruptness of the substance entering and leaving the bloodstream.

### Experience reports

There are currently anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 3-Cl-PCP use have not been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 3-Cl-PCP has an extremely brief history of human usage.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

While evidence is lacking, early reports suggest that the chronic use of 3-Cl-PCP is likely to be moderately addictive with a high potential for adverse side effects such as psychosis. As with the closely related analog [3-MeO-PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-MeO-PCP) , reports suggest that 3-Cl-PCP may be more habit-forming than dissociatives such as [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) , [diphenidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diphenidine) , [ephenidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ephenidine) , [DCK](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DCK) , and [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) . When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of 3-Cl-PCP is thought to develop with prolonged and repeated use. If true, this would require users to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it likely takes about 4 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 3-Cl-PCP likely presents cross-tolerance with all [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) , meaning that after the use of 3-Cl-PCP, all [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) will have a reduced effect.

It is recommended that one exercise extreme caution and [harm reduction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) practices when using this substance.

- Users should avoid taking the substance multiple days in a row or becoming dependent/addicted to it as this seems to be the main common factor in the observed incidences of severe adverse effects associated with closely related substances like [3-MeO-PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-MeO-PCP) .
- The recommended dosage range should not be exceeded as high doses are likely to trigger these effects as well.
- Users should start with extremely low doses and work their way up as slowly as possible.
- [Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) before one has fully sobered up is not recommended and can result in too high of a dose being administered, which may result in highly unpredictable side effects.

Due to the potential risk of psychosis, it is not recommended to combine 3-Cl-PCP with any other substances, especially [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , or other [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives) . [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) , such as [volumetric dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_dosing) , when using this substance to ensure the administration of the intended dose.

### Urinary tract effects

3-Cl-PCP is likely to exhibit similar bladder and urinary tract problems to those found within [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) when used repeatedly and excessively for extended periods of time, but to a lesser extent. This is likely because 3-Cl-PCP is far more potent than ketamine, so significantly less of drug needs to be consumed. Symptoms of ketamine-induced cystitis can become extremely serious and can be described as:

- **Urinary frequency** - Urinary frequency is the need to empty the bladder every few minutes.
- **Urinary urgency** - This can be described as a sudden, compelling need to urinate.
- **Urinary pressure** - This is experienced as a constant sensation of fullness in the bladder that is unrelieved by urination.
- **Pelvic and bladder pain** - Pain can develop suddenly and severely, particularly as the bladder fills with urine.
- **Hematuria** - Hematuria is visible blood in the urine.
- **Incontinence** - This is the leakage of urine.

### Dangerous interactions

- **Stimulants** - Both stimulants and dissociatives carry the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and these risks are exacerbated when the two substances are combined.
- **Depressants** - Because both depress the respiratory system, this combination can result in an increased risk of suddenly falling unconscious, vomiting and choking to death from the resulting suffocation. If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.

## Legal status

- **Germany:** 3-Cl-PCP is a controlled substance under the NPSG. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Switzerland:** 3-Cl-PCP is not a controlled substance as of 2021.

3-Chloro-PCP (3'-Cl-PCP) is a recreational designer drug from the arylcyclohexylamine family, with dissociative effects. It has comparable potency to phencyclidine but with a slightly different effects profile, being somewhat more potent as an NMDA antagonist but around the same potency as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It was first identified in Slovenia in December 2020, and was made illegal in Hungary in April 2021.
