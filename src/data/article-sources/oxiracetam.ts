## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: 250 mg
- Light: 500 - 1200 mg
- Common: 1200 - 1800 mg
- Strong: 1800 - 2400 mg
- Heavy: 2400 mg +

**Duration:**
- Total: 8 - 10 hours
- Onset: 30 - 90 minutes

**Oxiracetam** ( **ISF 2522** ) is a mild central nervous system [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) and [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) agent belonging to the [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) family of drugs. Although it is one of the first known and synthesized derivatives of [piracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piracetam) , its research and efficacy in humans is limited.

Oxiracetam is readily available and sold through online vendors as a dietary supplement in the United States. Dosages are nearly twenty times those of [noopept](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noopept) , making it less potent while offering comparable benefit.

Supplementation of oxiracetam tends to be in the dosage range of 1,200-2,400mg taken over the course of a day, either in two to three evenly spread dosing periods (such as three doses of 400mg or 800mg).

Oxiracetam has moderately protected against [scopolamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Datura) -induced amnesia both in rat populations and in human populations, suggesting it can aid recovery from [deliriant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriant) intoxication and other typically cognitively impaired states by preserving adequate levels of [acetylcholine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acetylcholine) as a primary mechanism.

## Chemistry

Oxiracetam, or (RS)-2-(4-hydroxy-2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl)acetamide, is a synthetic compound of the [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) family. Racetams share a [pyrrolidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pyrrolidine) nucleus, a five member nitrogenous ring with a ketone bonded oxygen at R 2 . This 2-pyrrolidone ring is bound to the terminal carbon of an acetamide group, an ethyl amide chain with a ketone bond (C=O) at the alpha carbon. Oxiracetam is substituted with an additional hydroxy group at R 4 , which is a chiral center for the molecule. Oxiracetam is presumably produced as a racemate of its enantiomers. Oxiracetam is structurally analogous to [piracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piracetam) , which lacks the R 4 hydroxy substitution of oxiracetam.

## Pharmacology

Oxiracetam has been shown to increase [acetylcholine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acetylcholine) release within hippocampal cells. As acetycholine is involved in the function of memory consolidation, this could potentially account for its [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) effects.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - The stimulation which oxiracetam presents can be considered as primarily subtle, with a magnitude comparable to that of [caffeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Caffeine) . ### Visual effects
 
- - **[Acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Enhancements](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- This effect listing primarily pertains to the recommended dosage. Users commonly report contradictory effects at higher (>2400mg) doses. 
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
- **[Mindfulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)**
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Memory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_enhancement)**
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)**
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: Oxiracetam](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Smarts_Oxiracetam.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

Several studies suggest that this substance is safe even when high doses are consumed for a long period of time although it is worth noting that the exact toxic dosage is unknown. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried oxiracetam within the community suggest that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Lethal dosage

The median lethal dosage ( [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) ) of oxiracetam has not been officially published as it has low abuse potential, but is not known to be harmful in it's recommended dosage range.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

The chronic use of oxiracetam can be considered as non-addictive with a low potential for abuse. It does not seem to be capable of causing psychological dependence among users, although this fact has not been corroborated by clinical studies. Tolerance to many of the effects of oxiracetam develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Oxiracetam may presents cross-tolerance with all [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) [nootropics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) , meaning that after the consumption of oxiracetam certain [nootropics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropics) such as [aniracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Aniracetam) and [piracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piracetam) may have a reduced effect.

## Legal status

Oxiracetam, being a member of the [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) family, currently is legally available to buy and sell in most countries, but may still vary by region.

- **United Kingdom** - It is illegal to produce, supply, or import this drug under the Psychoactive Substance Act, which came into effect on May 26th, 2016.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxiracetam*

Oxiracetam (developmental code name ISF 2522) is a nootropic drug of the racetam family and a very mild stimulant. Several studies suggest that the substance is safe even when high doses are consumed for a long period of time. However, the mechanism of action of the racetam drug family is still a matter of research. Oxiracetam is not approved by Food and Drug Administration for any medical use in the United States.

## Clinical findings

Oxiracetam has been studied to determine if it has an effect on symptoms of dementia, but no consistent results were obtained in patients with Alzheimer's dementia or organic solvent abuse.
Patients with mild to moderate dementia experienced some beneficial effects, measured by higher scores on tests for logical performance, attention, concentration, memory and spatial orientation. Improvement was also seen in patients with exogenic post-concussion syndrome, organic brain syndromes and other dementias. It seem to be ineffective for enhancing memory and cognitive function in patients with mild to moderate TBI.
Oxiracetam-treated laboratory mice demonstrated a significant increase in spatial learning performance as determined by the Morris water navigation task, compared to controls. This increase in performance was correlated to an increase in membrane-bound PKC.

## Pharmacokinetics

Oxiracetam is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with a bioavailability of 56-82%.
Peak serum levels are reached within one to three hours after a single 800 mg or 2000 mg oral dose, with the maximal serum concentration reaching between 19 and 31 μg/ml at these doses.
Oxiracetam is mainly cleared renally and approximately 84% is excreted unchanged in the urine.
The half-life of oxiracetam in healthy individuals is about 8 hours, whereas it is 10–68 hours in patients with renal impairment.
There is some penetration of the blood–brain barrier with brain concentrations reaching 5.3% of those in the blood (measured one hour after a single 2000 mg intravenous dose).
Clearance rates range from 9 to 95 ml/min and steady-state concentrations when 800 mg is given twice daily range from 60 μM to 530 μM.
The highest brain concentrations of oxiracetam are found in the septum pellucidum, followed by the hippocampus, the cerebral cortex and with the lowest concentrations in the striatum after a 200 mg/kg oral dose given to rats. Oxiracetam may be quantitated in plasma, serum or urine by liquid chromatography with one of several different detection techniques.
The major metabolites of Oxiracetam include: beta-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidone, N-aminoacetyl-GABOB, GABOB (beta-hydroxy-GABA) and glycine. Thus its metabolic route is exactly parallel to that of piracetam, aniracetam, phenylpiracetam, and all other members of the -racetam family, and also pyroglutamic acid.
