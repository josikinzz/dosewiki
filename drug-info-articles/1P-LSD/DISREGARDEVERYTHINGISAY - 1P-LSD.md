**1-propionyl-lysergic acid diethylamide** (abbreviated as** 1P-LSD** or **1P-LAD**) is a hallucinogenic psychedelic drug of the lysergamidefamily.

This substance has little to no history of human usage. It has not
been reported upon within any formal scientific literature and is
almost entirely unknown by both the academics and public. However,
given its similarity to LSD
and ALD-52,
the structural similarity reliably suggests an extremely similar
effect profile. Due to the lack of research regarding the substance,
all discussion regarding the pharmacology of it is purely based on
its structure and subjective effect similarities to other
lysergamides.

Over the first few months of 2015, it came to be marketed as a
legal alternative to LSZ,
AL-LAD and LSD
through online research chemical vendors which are currently selling
the compound in the form of freely available blotter sheet tabs. It
is usually marketed as a research chemical which means that it is
sold legally but not meant for human consumption.

In terms of its chemistry, 1P-LSD is a member of the lysergamide family and is generally regarded as a psychedelic. It is analogous to LSD, featuring a propionyl group bound to the nitrogen of the indole group. It is homologous to ALD-52, which contains an acetyl group instead of the propionyl group bound to the same location.

In terms of its pharmacology, 1P-LSD acts as a 5-HT2A partial agonist. The psychedelic effects are believed to come from 1P-LSD’s efficacy at the 5-HT2A receptors. However, the role of these interactions and how they result 
in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

It has been theorized that 1P-LSD may be a prodrug to LSD.
 Despite this prevailing theory, however, it appears that this is likely
 untrue. It has both a shorter duration, subtly distinct subjective 
effects and an extremely close potency which are three things which are 
rarely associated with a prodrug (especially in combination).

The effects of 1P-LSD are almost identical to that of its close structural relative LSD with the differences being so minuscule they are almost negligible or primarily due to different responses within the tripper.

The effects listed below are based upon the [subjective effects index](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index) and personal experiences of [PsychonautWiki](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki#Contributors). The listed effects will rarely if ever occur all at once but heavier 
dosages will increase the chances and are more likely to induce a full 
range of effects.

**Physical effects:**

The physical effects of 1P-LSD can be broken down into several components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. 
These are described below and generally include:

- **[Spontaneous tactile sensations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_tactile_sensations)**
 - The “body high” of 1P-LSD can be described as proportionally very 
intense in comparison to its accompanying visual and cognitive effects. 
It behaves as a euphoric, fast moving, sharp and location specific 
tingling sensation. For some, it is manifested spontaneously at 
different unpredictable points throughout the trip, but for most it 
maintains a steady presence that rises with the onset and hits its limit
 once the peak has been reached. At moderate to high doses of 1P-LSD, 
this sensation will usually hit its highest level and become so 
overwhelming that people may find themselves writhing on the floor in 
complete pleasure.
- **[Stimulation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)**
 - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper,
 1P-LSD is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating 
without being forced. For example, when taken in any environment it will
 usually encourage physical activities such as running, walking, 
climbing or dancing. In comparison, other more commonly used 
psychedelics such as psilocin are generally sedating and relaxed.
- **[Nausea](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)**
 - Mild nausea is occasionally reported when consumed in moderate to 
high dosages and either passes instantly once the tripper has vomited or
 gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Tactile enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Salivation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Salivation)**
- **[Increased heart rate](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Pupil dilation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**

**Cognitive effects:**

The cognitive effects of 1P-LSD can be broken down into several components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. 
In comparison to other psychedelics such as psilocin, LSA and ayahuasca,
 1P-LSD is significantly more stimulating and fast paced in terms of the
 specific style of thought stream produced and contains a large number 
of potential effects.

The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include:

- **[Current mind state enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Current_mind_state_enhancement)**
- **[Thought acceleration](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Time distortion](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Analysis enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Memory suppression](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** (ego death)
- **[Thought loops](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops)**
- **[Feelings of interdependent opposites](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Feelings_of_interdependent_opposites)**
- **[Delusions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
- **[Feelings of self-design](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Feelings_of_self-design)**
- **[Spirituality enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spirituality_enhancement)**
- **[Delineation of thought](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delineation_of_thought)**

**Visual effects:**

*Enhancements*

1P-LSD presents a full and complete array of visual enhancements which generally includes:

- **[Visual acuity enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**

*Distortions*

1P-LSD presents a full and complete array of visual distortions which generally includes:

- **[Drifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *([melting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting), [breathing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing), [morphing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Morphing) and [flowing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing))*
 - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as 
highly detailed and cartoon-like in its appearance. The distortions are 
slow and smooth in motion and fleeting in their appearance.
- **[Tracers](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[Depth perception distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depth_perception_distortions)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Colour shifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Perspective distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_distortions)**

[Geometry](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry)

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of 2C-B or 2C-I than psilocin, LSA or DMT. It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Variations) as primarily intricate in complexity, algorithmic in form, unstructured
 in organization, brightly lit, colourful in scheme, synthetic in feel, 
multicoloured in scheme, flat in shading, sharp in edges, large in size,
 fast in speed, smooth in motion, angular in its corners, non-immersive 
in depth and consistent in intensity.

In the case of higher level geometry, this substance is [level 8A](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) dominant but is also capable of inducing [8B Geometry](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) under the right circumstances.

*Hallucinatory states*

1P-LSD is capable of producing a full range of low and high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is significantly less consistent 
and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. 
These effects include:

- **[Transformations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations)** (*[Autonomous entities](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)*, *[Settings, sceneries, and landscapes](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)*, *[Alterations in perspective](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alterations_in_perspective)* and *[Scenarios and plots](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)*) - Although 1P-LSD is technically capable of producing hallucinatory states in a fashion that is on par with psilocin or DMT
 in its vividness and intensity, these effects are rarer and more 
inconsistent in comparison. While traditional psychedelics such as LSA, ayahuasca and mescaline will induce internal hallucinations near consistently at level 5 [geometry](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) and above, 1P-LSD will for most simply go straight into [Level 8A](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry)
 visual geometry. This lack of consistently induced hallucinatory 
breakthroughs means that for most, 1P-LSD is not quite as deep of an 
experience as certain other psychedelics. On the occasion that they are 
induced, however, they can be comprehensively described in terms of 
their [variations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability and [geometry](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry)-based in appearance.

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of 1P-LSD are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- [Enhancements](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)
- [Distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)
- [Hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)

**Physical health effects, potential addiction and tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational 1P-LSD use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact
 toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 1P-LSD is a research chemical 
with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people 
within the psychedelic community who have tried 1P-LSD suggests that 
there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this 
drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (but nothing 
can be completely guaranteed).

1P-LSD is non-habit forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

An almost immediate tolerance is built to 1P-LSD after ingestion,
 preventing one from experiencing its full effects more often than every
 4-7 days unless they increase their dose significantly.

**Legal issues:**

1P-LSD is currently a grey area compound within all parts of the world. This means that it is not known to be specifically illegal within
 any country, but that people may still be charged for its possession 
under certain circumstances such as under analogue laws and with the 
intent to sell or consume.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, 1P-LSD is an exciting new research chemical with little to no information regarding its existence within the formal scientific literature. In terms of the effects it produces, it is identical to LSD apart from a slightly shorter duration and is therefore an excellent and worthwhile alternative which is superior to that of LSZ and AL-LAD.
