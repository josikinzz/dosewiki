## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenanthrenes and derivatives. These are polycyclic compounds containing a phenanthrene moiety, which is a tricyclic aromatic compound with three non-linearly fused benzene.

### Background

Buprenorphine is a weak partial mu-opioid receptor agonist and a weak kappa-opioid receptor antagonist used for the treatment of severe pain.
12
,
15
It is also commonly used as an alternative to
methadone
for the treatment of severe opioid addiction.
22
Buprenorphine is commercially available as the brand name product Suboxone which is formulated in a 4:1 fixed-dose combination product along with
naloxone
, a non-selective competitive opioid receptor antagonist. Combination with naloxone is intended to reduce the abuse potential of Suboxone, as naloxone is poorly absorbed by the oral route (and has no effect when taken orally), but would reverse the opioid agonist effects of buprenorphine if injected intravenously.
14
,
22
Buprenorphine has poor gastrointestinal absorption and is therefore formulated as a sublingual tablet.
Buprenorphine has a number of unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that make it a preferred agent for the treatment of conditions requiring high doses of strong opioids.
13
For example, buprenorphine dissociates from opioid receptors very slowly, resulting in a long duration of action and relief from pain or withdrawal symptoms for upwards of 24-36 hours. Use of once-daily buprenorphine may benefit individuals who have developed tolerance to other potent opioids and who require larger and more frequent doses. Buprenorphine may also be a preferred agent over
methadone
(which is also commonly used to treat severe pain and opioid use disorder), as it has less effect on Qtc interval prolongation,
9
,
10
fewer drug interactions, reduced risk of sexual side effects,
17
and an improved safety profile with a lower risk of overdose and respiratory depression.
6
,
7
,
8
Buprenorphine acts as a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist with a high affinity for the receptor, but lower intrinsic activity compared to other full mu-opioid agonists such as
heroin
,
oxycodone
, or
methadone
.
15
This means that buprenorphine preferentially binds the opioid receptor and displaces lower affinity opioids without activating the receptor to a comparable degree. Clinically, this results in a slow onset of action and a clinical phenomenon known as the "ceiling effect" where once a certain dose is reached, buprenorphine's effects plateau. This effect can be beneficial, however, as dose-related side effects such as respiratory depression, sedation, and intoxication also plateau at around 32mg, resulting in a lower risk of overdose compared to
methadone
and other full agonist opioids.
4
,
5
It also means that opioid-dependent patients do not experience sedation or euphoria at the same rate that they might experience with more potent opioids, improving quality of life for patients with severe pain and reducing the reinforcing effects of opioids which can lead to drug-seeking behaviours.
11
Treatment of opioid addiction with buprenorphine,
methadone
, or slow-release oral
morphine
(SROM) is termed Opioid Agonist Treatment (OAT) or Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST). The intention of substitution of illicit opioids with the long-acting opioids used in OAT is to prevent withdrawal symptomns for 24-36 hours following dosing to ultimately reduce cravings and drug-seeking behaviours. Use of OAT is also intended to improved social stabilization including a reduction in crime rates, marginalization, incarceration, and use of illicit substances such as
heroin
or
fentanyl
. Illegally purchased opioids can often be injected and may be laced with other substances that increase the risk of harm or overdose. Provision of OAT is often combined with education about harm reduction including use of clean needles and injection supplies in an effort to reduce the risks associated with injection drug use which includes contraction of HIV and Hepatitis C and other complications including skin infections, abscesses, or endocarditis.
16

### Indication

Buprenorphine is available in different formulations, such as sublingual tablets, buccal films, transdermal films, and injections, alone or in combination with
naloxone
.
The buccal film, intramuscular or intravenous injection, and transdermal formulation are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternate treatments are inadequate.
21
,
23
,
24
The extended-release subcutaneous injections of buprenorphine are indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe opioid use disorder in patients who have initiated treatment with a single dose of a transmucosal buprenorphine product or who are already being treated with buprenorphine. Injections are part of a complete treatment plan that includes counselling and psychosocial support.
20
Sublingual tablets and buccal films, in combination with naloxone, are indicated for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence as part of a complete treatment plan that includes counselling and psychosocial support.
19
,
22

### Pharmacodynamics

Buprenorphine interacts predominately with the opioid mu-receptor. These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, spinal cord, and other tissues. In clinical settings, buprenorphine exerts its principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. In addition to analgesia, alterations in mood, euphoria and dysphoria, and drowsiness commonly occur. Buprenorphine depresses the respiratory centers, depresses the cough reflex, and constricts the pupils.
Dependence
Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and chronic administration produces physical dependence of the opioid type, characterized by withdrawal signs and symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation or rapid taper. The withdrawal syndrome is typically milder than seen with full agonists and may be delayed in onset. Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing buprenorphine in situations when the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion.[F4718]
Withdrawal
Abrupt discontinuation of treatment is not recommended as it may result in an opioid withdrawal syndrome that may be delayed in onset. Signs and symptoms may include body aches, diarrhea, gooseflesh, loss of appetite, nausea, nervousness or restlessness, anxiety, runny nose, sneezing, tremors or shivering, stomach cramps, tachycardia, trouble with sleeping, unusual increase in sweating, palpitations, unexplained fever, weakness and yawning.[F4718]
Risk of Respiratory and Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression and Overdose
Buprenorphine has been associated with life-threatening respiratory depression and death. Many, but not all, post-marketing reports regarding coma and death involved misuse by self-injection or were associated with the concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressant, including alcohol. Use buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression).
22
Risk of Overdose in Opioid Naïve Patients
There have been reported deaths of opioid-naïve individuals who received a 2 mg dose of buprenorphine as a sublingual tablet for analgesia. Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets are not appropriate as an analgesic in opioid-naïve patients.
22
Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms
If buprenorphine is started in opioid-dependent individuals, it will displace the other opioids and cause a phenomenon known as "precipitated withdrawal" which is characterized by a rapid and intense onset of withdrawal symptoms. Individuals must therefore be in a state of mild to moderate withdrawal before starting therapy with buprenorphine.
Because it contains naloxone, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets are also highly likely to produce marked and intense withdrawal signs and symptoms if misused parenterally by individuals dependent on full opioid agonists such as heroin, morphine, or methadone.
22
Gastrointestinal Effects
Buprenorphine and other morphine-like opioids have been shown to decrease bowel motility and cause constipation. Buprenorphine may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions and should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract.
22
Effects on the Endocrine System
Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date. Patients presenting with symptoms of androgen deficiency should undergo laboratory evaluation.
22
Adrenal Insufficiency
Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.
22
Use in Patients With Impaired Hepatic Function
Buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The doses of buprenorphine and naloxone in this fixed-dose combination product cannot be individually titrated, and hepatic impairment results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a much greater extent than buprenorphine. Therefore, patients with severe hepatic impairment will be exposed to substantially higher levels of naloxone than patients with normal hepatic function. This may result in an increased risk of precipitated withdrawal at the beginning of treatment (induction) and may interfere with buprenorphine’s efficacy throughout treatment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the differential reduction of naloxone clearance compared to buprenorphine clearance is not as great as in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. However, buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended for initiation of (treatment induction) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment due to the increased risk of precipitated withdrawal. Buprenorphine/naloxone products may be used with caution for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment who have initiated treatment on a buprenorphine product without naloxone. However, patients should be carefully monitored and consideration given to the possibility of naloxone interfering with buprenorphine’s efficacy.
22
Risk of Hepatitis, Hepatic Events
Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through post-marketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role. In other cases, insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality. Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases; however, in other cases no dose reduction was necessary. The possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases. Liver function tests, prior to initiation of treatment is recommended to establish a baseline. Periodic monitoring of liver function during treatment is also recommended. A biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic event is suspected. Depending on the case, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets may need to be carefully discontinued to prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms and a return by the patient to illicit drug use, and strict monitoring of the patient should be initiated.
22
Orthostatic Hypotension
Like other opioids, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients.
Elevation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure
Buprenorphine, like other opioids, may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure and should be used with caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, and other circumstances when cerebrospinal pressure may be increased. Buprenorphine can produce miosis and changes in the level of consciousness that may interfere with patient evaluation.
Elevation of Intracholedochal Pressure
Buprenorphine has been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, as do other opioids, and thus should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract.

### Mechanism of Action

Kappa-type opioid receptor
Antagonist
Mu-type opioid receptor
Partial agonist

### Absorption

Bioavailablity of buprenorphine/naloxone is very high following intravenous or subcutaneous administration, lower by the sublingual or buccal route, and very low when administered by the oral route. It is therefore provided as a sublingual tablet that is absorbed from the oral mucosa directly into systemic circulation.
18
Clinical pharmacokinetic studies found that there was wide inter-patient variability in the sublingual absorption of buprenorphine and naloxone, but within subjects the variability was low. Both Cmax and AUC of buprenorphine increased in a linear fashion with the increase in dose (in the range of 4 to 16 mg), although the increase was not directly dose-proportional. Buprenorphine combination with naloxone (2mg/0.5mg) provided in sublingual tablets demonstrated a Cmax of 0.780 ng/mL with a Tmax of 1.50 hr and AUC of 7.651 ng.hr/mL.
22
Coadministration with naloxone does not effect the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine.

### Metabolism

Buprenorphine is metabolized to norbuprenorphine via Cytochrome P450 3A4/3A5-mediated N-dealkylation. Buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine both also undergo glucuronidation to the inactive metabolites buprenorphine-3-glucuronide and norbuprenorphine-3-glucuronide, respectively.
18
,
22
While norbuprenorphine has been found to bind to opioid receptors in-vitro, brain concentrations are very low which suggests that it does not contribute to the clinical effects of buprenorphine.
18
Naloxone
undergoes direct glucuronidation to naloxone-3-glucuronide as well as N-dealkylation, and reduction of the 6-oxo group.

### Half-life

Buprenorphine demonstrates slow dissociation kinetics (~166 min), which contributes to its long duration of action and allows for once-daily or even every-second-day dosing.
18
In clinical trial studies, the half-life of sublingually administered buprenorphine/naloxone 2mg/0.5mg was found to be 30.75 hours.
22

### Toxicity

Manifestations of acute overdose include pinpoint pupils, sedation, hypotension, respiratory depression and death.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
1,2-Benzodiazepine may increase the central nervous system depressant (CNS depressant) activities of Buprenorphine.
Abametapir
The serum concentration of Buprenorphine can be increased when it is combined with Abametapir.
Abatacept
The metabolism of Buprenorphine can be increased when combined with Abatacept.
Abemaciclib
The metabolism of Abemaciclib can be decreased when combined with Buprenorphine.
Abiraterone
The metabolism of Buprenorphine can be decreased when combined with Abiraterone.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol. Ingesting alcohol may increase the sedative and CNS depressant effects of buprenorphine.
Avoid grapefruit products. Grapefruit inhibits the metabolism of buprenorphine through CYP3A4, which increases the serum levels buprenorphine.
Take separate from meals. When buprenorphine is formulated as a sublingual tablet or buccal film, avoid eating or drinking until the dosage form is completely dissolved.

### Mechanism of action

Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa-opioid receptor. It demonstrates a high affinity for the mu-opioid receptor but has lower intrinsic activity compared to other full mu-opioid agonists such as
heroin
,
oxycodone
, or
methadone

This means that buprenorphine preferentially binds the opioid receptor and displaces lower affinity opioids without activating the receptor to a comparable degree. Clinically, this results in a slow onset of action and a clinical phenomenon known as the "ceiling effect" where once a certain dose is reached buprenorphine's effects plateau. This effect can be beneficial, however, as dose-related side effects such as respiratory depression, sedation, and intoxication also plateau at around 32mg, resulting in a lower risk of overdose compared to
methadone
and other full agonist opioids.

It also means that opioid-dependent patients do not experience sedation or euphoria at the same rate that they might experience with more potent opioids, improving quality of life for patients with severe pain and reducing the reinforcing effects of opioids which can lead to drug-seeking behaviours.
11
Buprenorphine's high affinity, but low intrinsic activity for the mu-opioid receptor also means that if it is started in opioid-dependent individuals, it will displace the other opioids without creating an equal opioid effect and cause a phenomenon known as "precipitated withdrawal" which is characterized by a rapid and intense onset of withdrawal symptoms (i.e. anxiety, restlessness, gastrointestinal distress, diaphoresis, intense drug cravings, and tachycardia). Individuals must therefore be in a state of mild to moderate withdrawal before starting therapy with buprenorphine.
Buprenorphine is commercially available as the brand name product Suboxone which is formulated in a 4:1 fixed-dose combination product along with
naloxone
, a non-selective competitive opioid receptor antagonist. Combination of an opioid agonist with an opioid antagonist may seem counterintuitive, however this combination with naloxone is intended to reduce the abuse potential of Suboxone, as naloxone is poorly absorbed by the oral route (and has no effect when taken orally), but would reverse the opioid agonist effects of buprenorphine if injected intravenously.

### Volume of distribution

Buprenorphine is highly lipophilic, and therefore extensively distributed, with rapid penetration through the blood-brain barrier. The estimated volume of distribution is 188 - 335 L when given intravenously. It is able to cross into the placenta and breast milk.

### Protein binding

Buprenorphine is approximately 96% protein-bound, primarily to alpha- and beta-globulin.
22

### Route of elimination

Buprenorphine, like morphine and other phenolic opioid analgesics, is metabolized by the liver and its clearance is related to hepatic blood flow. It is primarily eliminated via feces (as free forms of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine) while 10 - 30% of the dose is excreted in urine (as conjugated forms of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine).
22
The overall mean elimination half-life of buprenorphine in plasma ranges from 31 to 42 hours, although the levels are very low 10 hours after dosing (majority of AUC of buprenorphine is captured within 10 hours), indicating that the effective half-life may be shorter.
22

### Clearance

Clearance may be higher in children than in adults. 
Plasma clearance rate, IV administration, anaesthetized patients = 901.2 ± 39.7 mL/min;
Plasma clearance rate, IV administration, healthy subjects = 1042 - 1280 mL/min.

### General Function

Broad substrate specificity ATP-dependent transporter of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family that actively extrudes a wide variety of physiological compounds, dietary toxins and xenobiotics from cells (PubMed:11306452, PubMed:12958161, PubMed:19506252, PubMed:20705604, PubMed:28554189, PubMed:30405239, PubMed:31003562). Involved in porphyrin homeostasis, mediating the export of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) from both mitochondria to cytosol and cytosol to extracellular space, it also functions in the cellular export of heme (PubMed:20705604, PubMed:23189181). Also mediates the efflux of sphingosine-1-P from cells (PubMed:20110355). Acts as a urate exporter functioning in both renal and extrarenal urate excretion (PubMed:19506252, PubMed:20368174, PubMed:22132962, PubMed:31003562, PubMed:36749388). In kidney, it also functions as a physiological exporter of the uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate (By similarity). Also involved in the excretion of steroids like estrone 3-sulfate/E1S, 3beta-sulfooxy-androst-5-en-17-one/DHEAS, and other sulfate conjugates (PubMed:12682043, PubMed:28554189, PubMed:30405239). Mediates the secretion of the riboflavin and biotin vitamins into milk (By similarity). Extrudes pheophorbide a, a phototoxic porphyrin catabolite of chlorophyll, reducing its bioavailability (By similarity). Plays an important role in the exclusion of xenobiotics from the brain (Probable). It confers to cells a resistance to multiple drugs and other xenobiotics including mitoxantrone, pheophorbide, camptothecin, methotrexate, azidothymidine, and the anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin, through the control of their efflux (PubMed:11306452, PubMed:12477054, PubMed:15670731, PubMed:18056989, PubMed:31254042). In placenta, it limits the penetration of drugs from the maternal plasma into the fetus (By similarity). May play a role in early stem cell self-renewal by blocking differentiation (By similarity). In inflammatory macrophages, exports itaconate from the cytosol to the extracellular compartment and limits the activation of TFEB-dependent lysosome biogenesis involved in antibacterial innate immune response

Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Buprenorphine**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Scheduled
- SCHEDULE: Schedule III
- CLASSIFICATION: Narcotic
 
Buprenorphine (Temgesic, Subutex, Buprenex, Suboxone) is Schedule III in the U.S. This means it is illegal to sell without a license and illegal to possess without a valid license or prescription. 
 
 Buprenorphine was rescheduled in 2002 by the DEA from Schedule V to Schedule III. For more information on this, see [DEA's Final Ruling on Rescheduling Buprenorphine, 2002.](http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/sched_actions/2002/fr1007.htm) 
 
 On May 22, 2008, the DEA issued a Final Rule in the Federal Register increasing the number of patients a clinic can prescribe controlled substances (such as buprenorphine) to for the purposes of "maintenance or detoxification". Prior to this new rule, the maximum number of patients was 30 and was raised to 100. Drug treatment practitioners must notify the Secretary of Health and Human Services in order to qualify under this rule. See [Federal Register: May 22, 2008 (Volume 73, Number 100)](http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2008/E8-11471.htm) . 
 
 In 2016, SAMHSA increased the number of patients an addiction practitioner can treat with buprenorphine to 275 patients. [Final Rule 81 FR 66191 2016-23277](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/27/2016-23277/medication-assisted-treatment-for-opioid-use-disorders-reporting-requirements)
 
INTERNATIONAL LAW #
 
Austria #
 
In Austria, buprenorphine is available by prescription both as Temgesic (for pain) and as Subutex (for opiate addiction). (thanks TNS)
 
Croatia #
 
In Croatia, buprenorphine is available by prescription only as Subutex in the form of 2 mg tablets for opiate addiction. Pharmacies sell Subutex, but prescriptions may only be dispensed by an approved addiction treatment physician. (unconfirmed) (thanks V) (last updated Dec 2005)
 
Finland #
 
In Finland, buprenorphine is available by prescription both as Temgesic (for pain) and as Subutex (for opiate addiction). Temgesic can be purchased from a pharmacy with a prescription, but pharmacies do not sell Subutex which has to be dispensed by an approved addiction treatment physician. (thanks SR)
 
Germany #
 
In Germany, buprenorphine is available by prescription both as Temgesic (for pain) and as Subutex (for opiate addiction). (thanks P)
 
Netherlands #
 
In the Netherlands, buprenorphine is listed on list 2 of the opiumlaw and available by prescription as Temgesic in 0.2 mg tablets for the treatment of severe pain and by injection in hospital settings. (thanks P) (last updated Jul 2007)
 
Norway #
 
Buprenorphine is a class A drug in Norway. Sold in 0.3mg Temgesic for pain relief and subutex (8mg) and suboxone (8mg) for opiate addiction treatment. See [http://lovdata.no/for/sf/ho/to-19780630-0008-001.html](http://lovdata.no/for/sf/ho/to-19780630-0008-001.html) . (thanks oe) (last updated Sep 26 2011)
 
Sweden #
 
Buprenorphine is a Schedule IV narcotic in Sweden. There are two brands, Temgesic and Subutex. Temgesic are sold as sublingual tablets at 0.2 and 0.4 mg and as injectionfluid 0.3 mg/ml. Subutex is sold as subling. pills at 0.4 mg, 2 mg and 8 mg. Generally any physician is allowed to prescbribe subutex, but there is a recommendation that only the ones praticing at drug treatment centers should treat addicts with subutex. Temgesic can be prescribed by any physician. (thanks JM) (last updated Mar 2003)
 
Turkey #
 
One visitor tells us that buprenorphine is only available as part of official addiction treatment, with a requirement for a prescription from a doctor working in an addiction clinic, that it be purchased from a major hospital, and also the patient must have passed a urine screen showing they are not using any other opioid. In 2011, available as combination buprenorphine and naloxone preparations at a 4:1 ratio: 2mg buprenorphine+0.5mg naloxone and 8mg + 2mg. (unconfirmed) (thanks W) (last updated June 14 2011)
 
U.K. (Britain) #
 
Buprenorphine is Schedule 3, Class C in the U.K. It requires a prescription or a license to possess legally. A Home Office license is required to export buprenorphine. It is commonly used as a treatment for heroin, methadone, or other severe opiate addiction and is often a preferred choice of medication for the treatment of heroin dependency. (thanks DW) (Jan 2005)

**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) , [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or other [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Buprenorphine** is a semisynthetic [opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) of the [morphinan](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphinan) chemical class. It functions as a mixed partial [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) opioid [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) modulator.

At higher dosages, it is used to treat opioid addiction in opioid-dependent individuals. In lower dosages it is used to control moderate-acute pain in non-opioid-tolerant individuals and in even lower dosages it is used to control moderate chronic pain.

Buprenorphine was patented in 1965, and approved for medical use in the United States in 1981. In 2017, 14.6 million prescriptions for the medication were written in the United States. It is also a common medication used to treat opioid use disorders, such as addiction to heroin. Buprenorphine may also be used recreationally by injection or intranasally for the high it produces.

## Chemistry

Buprenorphine is a semi-synthetic morphinan derivative of the opioid alkaloid thebaine. Like many [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) , such as [codeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Codeine) or [hydrocodone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hydrocodone) , it is has a [morphinan](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphinan) backbone.

Buprenorphine and other molecules of this class contain a polycyclic core of three benzene rings fused in a zig-zag pattern called phenanthrene. A fourth nitrogen containing ring is fused to the phenanthrene at R 9 and R 13 . Buprenophine (along with other morphinans) contains an ether bridge between two of its rings, connecting the benzene and opposite cyclohexane ring through an oxygen group.

Buprenorphine is unique to human medical opioids as it contains an addition fused ring which connects to the lower cyclohexane ring at R 6 and R 14 . This structure is called a endoethenotetrahydrooripavine backbone, often found in veterinarian opioids. It contains a hydroxy group (OH-) substituted on the benzene ring and a methoxy group bound to the lower cyclohexane ring. The backbone of buprenorphine is also substituted with a methyl cyclopropyl moeity on its amino group. Adjacent to its methoxy attachment, the cyclohexane ring is bonded to R 2 of a 2-butanol chain.

## Pharmacology

Buprenorphine acts as a partial agonist of the μ-opioid receptor with a binding affinity of K i = 1.5 nM in contrast to full agonists like morphine. It also acts as an antagonist of the κ-opioid receptor with a binding affinity of K i = 2.5 nM and the δ-opioid receptor with a binding affinity of K i = 6.1 nM. The ratio of these binding affinities is important, if you compare morphine's binding ratio of 1:50:176 to Buprenorphine's ratio of 15:25:61, it is apparent that the side-effect profile will be much higher to Buprenorphine and μ-opioid stimulation for euphoric effects, sequentially the drug will also bind to delta and kappa opioid receptors to a comparatively high degree.

Buprenorphine exerts its effects by binding to and activating the [μ-opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid#Receptor_types) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) . This occurs because opioids structurally mimic endogenous endorphins which are naturally found within the body and also work upon the μ-opioid receptor set. The way in which opioids structurally mimic these natural endorphins results in their [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) , [pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) and [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiolytic) effects. This is because endorphins are responsible for reducing pain, causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or general excitement.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)**
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - This particular substance can be considered as less intense in its physical euphoria when compared with that of [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) or [diacetylmorphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diacetylmorphine) (heroin) due to it being a partial agonist of the μ-opioid receptor.

- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** - One may experience a state of semi-consciousness and [hypnagogia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnagogia) during heavy dosage nodding which results in dream-like states and up to level 3 [imagery](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lucid_dreaming#Internally_sourced_sensory_input) . This is often accompanied by ill-defined [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) .
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: Buprenorphine](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Pharms_Buprenorphine.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

Buprenorphine has a low toxicity relative to dose: the ceiling dose for buprenorphine is usually between 16mg and 32mg, and anything above this will not produce an increase in respiratory depression (the primary cause of death in opioid overdose is severe respiratory depression, leading to respiratory collapse). Thus increasing the dose of buprenorphine above this level will not continue to increase risk of death in a fashion similar to other μ-opioid receptor agonists. As with all opioids, long-term effects can vary but can include diminished libido, apathy and memory loss.

Regardless of the ceiling dose, an important distinction has to be made in the dose used in opioid naive individuals and opioid experienced individuals. Even low doses in individuals with no tolerance can cause unpleasant side-effects like dizziness, loss of balance, and vomiting. Because of the long half-life of buprenorphine, these side-effects can last a long while in opioid naive individuals which creates the risk of severe dehydration from uncontrollable vomiting.

Buprenorphine is often sold under the brand name **Suboxone** , which also contains [naloxone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Naloxone) . Naloxone is not orally active except at higher doses, so when large amounts of Suboxone are taken, the naloxone takes effect and reverses the effects of the buprenorphine. This is done to deter abuse of Suboxone.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , the chronic use of buprenorphine can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal symptoms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids#Discontinuation) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of buprenorphine develops with prolonged and repeated use. The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects, with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly for instance. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Buprenorphine presents cross-tolerance with all other [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , meaning that after the consumption of buprenorphine all [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) will have a reduced effect.

### Precipitated withdrawal syndrome

Buprenorphine has the ability to precipitate withdrawal symptoms in opiate-dependent individuals. This is due to buprenorphine only being a partial agonist, which does not activate the receptor with the appreciable efficacy of a full [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) , as well as having a very high binding affinity for the [μ-opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid#Receptor_types) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) (K i = 1.5nM), displacing other agonists that may still be attached when the buprenorphine is ingested.

**Note** : It is a common misconception that [naloxone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Naloxone) , in some buprenorphine formulations, is what causes the precipitated withdrawal syndrome to manifest. This is false, as naloxone has a lower binding than Buprenorphine, as well as being inactive through most [routes of administration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) .

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Alcohol** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. Place affected patients in the recovery position to prevent vomit aspiration from excess. Memory blackouts are likely
- **Stimulants** - Stimulants increase respiration rate which allows for a higher dose of opiates than would otherwise be used. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the user and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Benzodiazepines** - Central nervous system and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present. The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position blackouts/memory loss likely.
- **DXM** - Generally considered to be toxic. CNS depression, difficulty breathing, heart issues, and liver toxicity have been observed. Additionally if one takes DXM, their tolerance of opiates goes down slightly, thus causing additional synergistic effects.
- **GHB** / **GBL** - The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position
- **Ketamine** - Both substances bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the user falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
- **MAOIs** - Coadministration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) with certain opioids has been associated with rare reports of severe adverse reactions. There appear to be two types of interaction, an excitatory and a depressive one. Symptoms of the excitatory reaction may include agitation, headache, diaphoresis, hyperpyrexia, flushing, shivering, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor, diarrhea, hypertension, tachycardia, seizures, and coma. Death has occurred in some cases.
- **MXE** - MXE can potentiate the effects of opioids but also increases the risk of respiratory depression and organ toxicity.
- **Nitrous** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position. Memory blackouts are common.
- **PCP** - PCP may reduce opioid tolerance, increasing the risk of overdose.
- **Tramadol** - Increased risk of seizures. Tramadol itself is known to induce seizures and it may have additive effects on seizure threshold with other opioids. Central nervous system- and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present.
- **Grapefruit** - While grapefruit is not psychoactive, it may affect the metabolism of certain opioids. Tramadol, oxycodone, and fentanyl are all primarily metabolized by the enzyme CYP3A4, which is potently inhibited by grapefruit juice . This may cause the drug to take longer to clear from the body. it may increase toxicity with repeated doses. Methadone may also be affected . Codeine and hydrocodone are metabolized by CYP2D6. People who are on medicines that inhibit CYP2D6, or that lack the enzyme due to a genetic mutation will not respond to codeine as it can not be metabolized into its active product: morphine.

## Legal status

In the European Union, buprenorphine can be prescribed either alone or in combination with another substance and is approved for the treatment of opioid addiction.

- **Austria** : Buprenorphine is legal for medical use under the AMG (Arzneimittelgesetz Österreich) and illegal when sold or possessed without a prescription under the SMG (Suchtmittelgesetz Österreich). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Canada** : Buprenorphine is a schedule I substance in Canada and is only available with a valid prescription.
- **Germany** : Buprenorphine is controlled under Anlage III BtMG ( *Narcotics Act, Schedule III* ) as of September 1, 1984. It can only be prescribed on a narcotic prescription form.
- **Netherlands** : Buprenorphine a List II drug of the Opium Law, although special rules apply to its prescription and dispensation. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Russia** : Buprenorphine is a Schedule II controlled substance.
- **Sweden** : Buprenorphine is a class IV controlled substance.
- **Switzerland** : Buprenorphine is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis A. Medicinal use is permitted.
- **United States** : Buprenorphine, either alone or in combination with naloxone (as, for example, Suboxone), is a Schedule III drug. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] 
- Prior to the approval of Suboxone in the U.S. for treating opioid addiction, the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 was passed. This law gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to grant a waiver to all physicians with appropriate training to prescribe and administer narcotics from Schedules III-V in the treatment of drug addiction. Prior to the passage of this law such authority was restricted solely to physicians working in an outpatient clinic specifically designed for treatment of addiction. The waiver, which requires the physician to undergo an 8-hour training course, initially allowed that physician to treat only 10 patients in this manner; as of 2016, this limit has been increased to 275.

## Effects
Like all opiates, buprenorphine has analgesic and cough-irritant effects. However, its euphoric and sedative properties are less pronounced than those of other opioids, which is why it is also used for substitution treatment. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist. This means that, for safety reasons, only a submaximal effect is elicited. After a certain dose, a saturation effect (ceiling effect) occurs, which prevents a further increase in the effect. This makes the active ingredient so relevant for substitution treatments, as withdrawal symptoms can be alleviated and overdoses avoided.

## Dosage
From 16 mg, the saturation effect (ceiling effect) takes effect and no more effect enhancement is felt.
When consuming for the first time, low doses should be used, as the risk of respiratory arrest is increased.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
The side effects are less pronounced than with other opioids. Nevertheless, fatigue, constipation, drowsiness, sweating, nausea, vomiting, insomnia and irritability may occur. Buprenorphine has a lower risk of respiratory depression, which is why it is considered comparatively safe.
Overdoses with buprenorphine are difficult to treat with the opioid antagonist naloxone due to its high binding to the μ-opioid receptor. Therefore, agents from the group of respiratory stimulants (such as doxapram) are used.

### Long-term Risks
Unlike other opioids, the active ingredient floods on slowly, which is why the risk of dependence is considered lower.

## Safer Use
- Opioids are highly effective drugs that should only be used for a limited time and at best under medical supervision.
- Start with a low dose and wait for the effect and tolerance before adding more. Do not exceed the maximum daily dose.
- If you inject opioids, dose even more carefully, as the range between desired effect (rush) and dangerous overdose is even more difficult to assess. Avoid injecting fentanyl; the risk of overdose is particularly high. Always use new (clean and sterile) injection material! Never exchange syringes, filters, water, disinfection swabs to avoid transmission of hepatitis and HIV.
- Do not rely on dosage information from colleagues who regularly use opioids. Due to habituation or dependence, their doses are much higher and can be fatal for new users.
- Take longer breaks (at least several days) between consumption.
- After a period of abstinence, take a much lower dose! The usual dose before the abstinence phase can otherwise quickly have life-threatening consequences.
- The simultaneous consumption of depressant substances such as alcohol, ketamine, GHB/GBL, nitrous oxide, benzodiazepines and/or other opioids is dangerous as there is an increased risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. The risk of suffocation is high!
- Refrain from citrus fruits (especially grapefruit) before or during consumption. The combination can lead to an increase in the effect of the opiate and/or to respiratory depression.

Buprenorphine is a semisynthetic thebaine derivative in the orvinol class. It’s an opioid that’s widely used for pain and opioid replacement. While it does provide recreational effects, users reliably prefer opioids like [morphine](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/morphine/) .

It has a similar efficacy to methadone in the area of opioid replacement.

The risk of death from overdose is lower with buprenorphine due to it producing less respiratory depression. It can still be very dangerous when combine with other depressants like [benzodiazepines](http://thedrugclassroom.com/categories/benzodiazepines/) and [alcohol](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/alcohol-ethanol/) .

**Buprenorphine** is a semi-synthetic opioid derived from thebaine which is typically used for treatment of opioid addiction. It is an analgesic, and has gained notoriety for its ability to successfully interrupt severe opiate addictions. Buprenorphine has a higher affinity for μ-opioid receptors compared to full opioid agonists. Because of this, buprenorphine can block the effects of other opioid agonists in a dose-dependent fashion. By its dual effects of reducing craving and attenuating the response to administered heroin, buprenorphine reduces the self-administration of heroin. Methadone, a full opioid agonist, also reduces the impact of additional heroin, but the effect of methadone is primarily due to the induction of cross-tolerance which is dose dependent. In contrast buprenorphine achieves its effect primarily by prolonged occupancy of a high proportion of opioid receptors, blocking the action of heroin and other opioid receptor agonists.

## History

Addiction therapeutics arose within the historical context of efforts to develop a non-addicting analgesic that began in the United States in the early 1920s. Early 20th century efforts to respond to the “opium problem,” through regulation and control at the source of supply and to address public health concerns through innovation in the research laboratory set the stage for the gradual shift in researchers’ interests toward developing a treatment for addiction therapeutics.

The solution to the “opium problem” was first sought at the laboratory bench at a time when the United States was becoming a major player within the evolving international drug control framework. For such a narrowly tailored goal to be understood as meeting a broad social problem of unclear etimology, it had to be translated into a feasible research program. Reliable methods to test compounds in animals and human beings had to be developed and validated. In the CDA’s first decade, some 150 compounds were produced and evaluated; all but one - Metopon (5-methylhydromorphone) - demonstrated the elusiveness of the goal.

Methadone was introduced into the United States in 1947 by Eli Lilly and Company, however, researchers opposed using methadone for maintenance given the results of studies on former morphine and/or heroin addicts in the late 1940s indicating that the subjects expressed increased satisfaction as dosage increased. They concluded that “narcotic drug addicts would abuse methadone and would become habituated to it if it were freely available and not controlled”. They also noted that methadone “completely alleviated the morphine abstinence syndrome in man,” yet itself exhibited a mild abstinence syndrome.

In 1974, Congress became concerned with methadone diversion and amended the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), in 1970 to give DEA considerable powers despite the inception of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and sunset of SAODAP in 1973. Many clinicians came to view the methadone regulations as government interference with the practice of medicine. The restrictive climate had led SAODAP to prioritize development of narcotic antagonists.

Buprenorphine was discovered in 1966, at the research labs of a home products company, Reckitt & Colman (hereafter Reckitts), in Hull, England.

The story of the development of buprenorphine as an "addict treatment" began in 1975, when Lexington Addiction Research Center (ARC) scientist Jasinski countered growing opposition to using prisoners as clinical research subjects by arguing that many prisoners were addicts and the pharmacology of buprenorphine made it such an “attractive candidate" as a treatment for opiate dependence that its human abuse potential was in urgent need of study.

Jasinski singled out buprenorphine as having an “especially unique pharmacology in man” because it produced “very little physical dependence”, even with chronic administration.  Citing his 1978 study, he speculated that buprenorphine “would not only have a therapeutic application as an analgesic of low abuse potential but also as a new type of drug treatment of narcotic addiction."

Jasinski heralded buprenorphine’s unique potential because it alone produced long-lasting “changes in feelings that are acceptable to addicts,” and was “less toxic than methadone,” declaring that the committee’s 50-year project to “potentially utilize narcotics therapeutically to both relieve pain and treat addiction without the production of physical dependence” had yielded buprenorphine, which “appears to have the advantage of both methadone and naltrexone but without the major disadvantage of each”.

In 1979, following the ban on use of federal prisoners as research subjects, NIDA had moved the ARC’s Clinical Research Program, now under the direction of Jasinski, to the medical campus of The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) in Baltimore, Maryland; the preclinical program followed in 1981. The JHU site was chosen partly because Baltimore provided a suitable source of research subjects: inner-city heroin addicts. Addiction researchers considered it unethical and unwise to carry out research involving addictive substances on people who were not or had not been addicted.

By 1985, injectable buprenorphine had been marketed for analgesic applications in 29 countries and the sublingual tablet in 16 countries. In the United Kingdom, Reckitts had launched injectable buprenorphine for severe pain in 1978,with the sublingual analgesic following in 1982. It licensed Norwich–Eaton to distribute buprenorphine hydrochloride (Buprenex) in the United States, where the analgesic was launched in 1985, after FDA approval.

The difficulties of coordinating public and private interests, local and global effects, changes in domestic regulatory mechanisms, and perceptions of addiction and its treatment charted buprenorphine’s tortuous, 30-year path to FDA approval and market. Buprenorphine arose as a maintenance therapy at a time when addicts - like other citizens - were expected to take personal responsibility for health and healthcare, and where such decisions were seen as individual matters of choice and political entitlement.

## Uses

Buprenorphine is usually sold in the form of sublingual tablets (Suboxone), or trans dermal patches (Butrans). Patches can be attached to skin for long release as treatment for opioid withdrawal, or cut and chewed for recreational use. Usual (30 minutes) sub-lingual use of patches is not 100% effective, so patches can be re-used. Buprenorphine is water-soluble, and can be extracted with a [Cold Water Extraction](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Cold_Water_Extraction) (takes more time, usually 24 hours, or around 4 hours with few drops of strong alcohol). Since buprenorphine is a long acting opioid antagonist, other opioids won't work for at least 36 hours after dosing buprenorphine (though some negative effects will be garnered).

Buprenorphine will cause withdrawal if you have an opioid tolerance and don't wait long enough (typically 48~ hours) before taking it.

Respiratory depression from buprenorphine (or buprenorphine/naloxone) overdose is less likely than from other opioids. There is no evidence of organ damage with chronic use of buprenorphine, although increases in liver enzymes are sometimes seen. Likewise, there is no evidence of significant disruption of cognitive or psycho motor performance with buprenorphine maintenance dosing.

## Dosage

Dosage is usually 2-3mg (assuming 100% effectiveness), and most users don't feel the need to take more. Ceiling effect is 16-32mg, and redosing is not effective.

600µg is considered equivalent to 10 mg morphine for pain relief.

| Light | 1-2mg |
| --- | --- |
| Common | 3-6mg |
| Strong | 6-8mg |
| Heavy | 8mg+ |
| Ceiling | 16-32mg |

## Duration

| Onset | 30-60 minutes |
| --- | --- |
| Peak | 1-4 hours |
| Total (low dose) | 8-12 hours |
| Total (high dose) | 24-72 hours |

## Effects

Because of its ceiling effect and poor bio-availability, buprenorphine is safer in high doses compared to full opioid agonists. The maximal effects of buprenorphine appear to occur in the 16–32 mg dose range for sublingual tablets. Higher doses are unlikely to produce greater effects. 

### Positive

## Harm Reduction

Unlike methadone, the effect of buprenorphine on respiratory depression reaches a ceiling, therefore higher doses do not increase risk of respiratory depression to a significant degree.

However, if buprenorphine is used in combination with other central nervous system depressants, such as benzodiazepines and other CNS [Depressants](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Depressants), the combined effect on respiration can be life threatening.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

Buprenorphine is a derivative of the opioid alkaloid thebaine that is a more potent (25 – 40 times) and longer lasting analgesic than morphine. It appears to act as a partial agonist at the μ- and κ-opioid receptors and as an antagonist at δ-opioid-receptors. The lack of δ-opioid agonism has been suggested to account for the observation that buprenorphine tolerance may not develop with chronic use.

Buprenorphine is metabolised by the liver, via CYP3A4 (also CYP2C8 seems to be involved) isozymes of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, into norbuprenorphine (by N-dealkylation).

[/r/opiates Suboxone FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1f3ak7/suboxone_faq/)`,
  "wikipedia": `# Buprenorphine
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buprenorphine*

Buprenorphine, is an opioid used to treat opioid use disorder, acute pain, and chronic pain. It can be used under the tongue (sublingual), in the cheek (buccal), by injection (intravenous and subcutaneous), as a skin patch (transdermal), or as an implant.
In the United States, the combination formulation of buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone) is usually prescribed to discourage misuse by injection. Maximum pain relief is generally within an hour with effects up to 24 hours. Buprenorphine affects different types of opioid receptors in different ways. Depending on the type of opioid receptor, it may be an agonist, partial agonist, or antagonist. Buprenorphine's activity as an agonist/antagonist is important in the treatment of opioid use disorder: it relieves withdrawal symptoms from other opioids and induces some euphoria (primarily when first starting treatment if one is not already opioid tolerant/dependant), but also blocks the ability for many other opioids, including heroin, to cause an effect. Unlike full agonists like heroin or methadone, buprenorphine has a ceiling effect, such that taking more medicine past a certain point will not increase the effects of the drug.
Being a partial MOR agonist, buprenorphine offers flexibility to prescribers treating opioid use disorder as the dosage can be easily adjusted.
Side effects may include respiratory depression (decreased breathing), sleepiness, adrenal insufficiency, QT prolongation, low blood pressure, allergic reactions, constipation, and opioid addiction. Among those with a history of seizures, a risk exists of further seizures. Opioid withdrawal following stopping buprenorphine is generally less severe than with other opioids. Whether use during pregnancy is safe is unclear, but use while breastfeeding is probably safe, since the dose the infant receives is 1–2% that of the maternal dose, on a weight basis.
Buprenorphine was patented in 1965, FDA approved for medical use as an analgesic in 1981, and FDA approved for treating opioid use disorder in 2002. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Despite originally being marketed as an analgesic it is far more commonly prescribed and used to treat opioid use disorders, such as addiction to heroin. In 2020, it was the 186th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2.8 million prescriptions. Buprenorphine provides virtually no euphoria or "high" for opioid tolerant individuals, making it ideal as a medication for treating opioid use disorder. Buprenorphine has reduced euphoric potential compared with full opioid agonists thanks to its partial-agonist ceiling effect. In many patients with opioid use disorder it does not produce a noticeable ‘high’, which supports its use in maintenance therapy. However, in opioid-naïve individuals it may still produce euphoria, so the risk is not zero. Even though the risk is lower, buprenorphine is still an opioid, and it still carries risks (dependence, misuse, respiratory depression especially when combined with other depressants). In the United States, buprenorphine, alone and as a combination drug, is a schedule III controlled substance.

## Medical uses

### Opioid use disorder

Buprenorphine is used to treat people with opioid use disorder. In the U.S., the combination formulation of buprenorphine/naloxone is generally prescribed to deter injection, since naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is believed to cause acute withdrawal if the formulation is crushed and injected. Taken orally, the naloxone has virtually no effect, due to the drug's extremely high first-pass metabolism and low bioavailability (2%).
Before starting buprenorphine, individuals are generally advised to wait long enough after their last dose of opioid until they have some withdrawal symptoms to allow for the medication to bind the receptors, since if taken too soon, buprenorphine can displace other opioids bound to the receptors and precipitate an acute withdrawal. The dose of buprenorphine is then adjusted until symptoms improve, and individuals remain on a maintenance dose of 8–16 mg.
Because withdrawal is uncomfortable and a deterrent for many patients, users have called for different means of treatment initiation.  The Bernese method, also known as micro dosing was described in 2016, where very small doses of buprenorphine (0.2 to 0.5 mg) are given while patients are still using street opioids, and without precipitating withdrawal, with medicine levels slowly titrated upward. This method has been used by some providers as of the 2020s. Many of the publications on the Bernese method are case reports, case series, or clinical guidance rather than large randomized controlled trials (RCTs). For example, a CMAJ article noted that only two case reports and one small case series existed at the time of writing, and guidance documents typically state that micro-dosing is not yet a fully evidence-based alternative compared with standard induction. Furthermore, the phrase “without precipitating withdrawal” should be understood as "typically less likely to precipitate withdrawal" rather than guaranteed to avoid it. Clinicians adopting this method must do so with caution, informed consent, and close monitoring — particularly because many of the studies are small, heterogeneous, and variable in protocol.

#### Buprenorphine versus methadone

Both buprenorphine and methadone are medications used for detoxification and opioid replacement therapy, and appear to have similar effectiveness based on limited data. Both are safe for pregnant women with opioid use disorder, although preliminary evidence suggests that methadone is more likely to cause neonatal abstinence syndrome. In the US and European Union, only designated clinics can prescribe methadone for opioid use disorder, requiring patients to travel to the clinic daily. If patients are drug-free for a period they may be permitted to receive "take-home doses," reducing their visits to as little as once a week. Alternatively, up to a month's supply of buprenorphine has been able to be prescribed by clinicians in the US or Europe who have completed basic training (8–24 hours in the US) and received a waiver/licence allowing the prescription of the medicine. In France, buprenorphine prescription for opioid use disorder has been permitted without any special training or restrictions since 1995, resulting in treatment of approximately ten times more patients per year with buprenorphine than with methadone in the following decade. In 2021, seeking to address record levels of opioid overdose, the United States also removed the requirement for a special waiver for prescribing physicians. Whether this change will be sufficient to impact prescription is unclear, since even before the change as many as half of physicians with a waiver permitting them to prescribe buprenorphine did not do so, and one-third of non-waivered physicians reported that nothing would induce them to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder.
Buprenorphine versus naltrexone
Naltrexone is a full antagonist, meaning it fully blocks the opioid receptor from binding with other opioids and any feelings of euphoria if opioids are ingested. Buprenorphine has a higher affinity than most opioids and can bind to opioid receptors to have some effects - the mechanism that treats withdrawal symptoms. However, like naltrexone, buprenorphine can also block other opioids from binding to the receptors.

### Chronic pain

A transdermal patch is available for the treatment of chronic pain. These patches are not indicated for use in acute pain, pain that is expected to last only for a short period, or pain after surgery, nor are they recommended for opioid addiction.

### Potency

For equianalgesic dosing, when used sublingually, the potency of buprenorphine is about 40 to 70 times more potent than morphine. When used as a transdermal patch, the potency of buprenorphine may be 100 to 115 times greater than that of morphine.

## Adverse effects

Common adverse drug reactions associated with the use of buprenorphine, similar to those of other opioids, include nausea and vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, memory loss, cognitive and neural inhibition, perspiration, itchiness, dry mouth, shrinking of the pupils of the eyes (miosis), orthostatic hypotension, male ejaculatory difficulty, decreased libido, and urinary retention. Constipation and central nervous system (CNS) effects are seen less frequently than with morphine. Central sleep apnea has also been reported as a side effect of long-term buprenorphine use.

### Respiratory effects

The most severe side effect associated with buprenorphine is respiratory depression (insufficient breathing). It occurs more often in those who are also taking benzodiazepines or alcohol, or have underlying lung disease. The usual reversal agents for opioids, such as naloxone, may be only partially effective, and additional efforts to support breathing may be required. Respiratory depression may be less than with other opioids, particularly with chronic use. In the setting of acute pain management, though, buprenorphine appears to cause the same rate of respiratory depression as other opioids such as morphine. Central sleep apnea is possible with long-term use, possibly resolving with dose reduction.

### Buprenorphine dependence

Buprenorphine treatment carries the risk of causing psychological or physiological (physical) dependencies. It has a slow onset of activity, with a long duration of action, and a long half-life of 24 to 60 hours. Once a patient has stabilised on the (buprenorphine) medication and programme, three options remain: continual use (buprenorphine-only medication), switching to a buprenorphine/naloxone combination, or a medically supervised withdrawal.

### Pain management

Achieving acute opioid analgesia is difficult in persons using buprenorphine for pain management. However, a systematic review found no clear benefit to bridging or stopping buprenorphine when used in opioid substitution therapy to facilitate perioperative pain management, but failure to restart it was found to pose concerns for relapse. Therefore, it is recommended that buprenorphine opioid substitution therapy is continued in the perioperative period when possible. In addition, preoperative pain management in patients taking buprenorphine should use an interdisciplinary approach with multimodal analgesia.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

#### Opioid receptor modulator

Buprenorphine has been reported to possess these following pharmacological activities:

μ-Opioid receptor (MOR): Very high affinity partial agonist: at low doses, the MOR-mediated effects of buprenorphine are comparable to those of other narcotics, but these effects reach a "ceiling" as the receptor population is saturated. This behavior is responsible for several unique properties: buprenorphine greatly reduces the effect of most other MOR agonists, can cause precipitated withdrawal when used in actively opioid dependent persons, and has a lower incidence of respiratory depression and fatal overdose relative to full MOR agonists.
κ-Opioid receptor (KOR): High affinity antagonist/weak partial agonist —this activity is hypothesized to underlie some of the effects of buprenorphine on mood disorders and addiction.
δ-Opioid receptor (DOR): High affinity antagonist
Nociceptin receptor (NOP, ORL-1): Weak affinity, very weak partial agonist
In simplified terms, buprenorphine can essentially be thought of as a nonselective, mixed agonist–antagonist opioid receptor modulator, acting as an unusually high affinity, weak partial agonist of the MOR, a high affinity antagonist of the KOR and DOR, and a relatively low affinity, very weak partial agonist of the ORL-1/NOP.
Although buprenorphine is a partial agonist of the MOR, human studies have found that it acts like a full agonist with respect to analgesia in opioid-intolerant individuals. Conversely, buprenorphine behaves like a partial agonist of the MOR with respect to respiratory depression.
Buprenorphine is also known to have high binding affinity with antagonistic activity at the putative ε-opioid receptor.
Full analgesic efficacy of buprenorphine requires both exon 11- and exon 1-associated μ-opioid receptor splice variants.
The active metabolites of buprenorphine are not thought to be clinically important in its CNS effects.
In positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies, buprenorphine was found to decrease whole-brain MOR availability due to receptor occupancy by 41% (i.e., 59% availability) at 2 mg, 80% (i.e., 20% availability) at 16 mg, and 84% (i.e., 16% availability) at 32 mg.

#### Other actions

Unlike some other opioids and opioid antagonists, buprenorphine binds only weakly to and possesses little if any activity at the sigma receptor.
Buprenorphine also blocks voltage-gated sodium channels via the local anesthetic binding site, and this underlies its potent local anesthetic properties.
Similarly to various other opioids, buprenorphine has also been found to act as an agonist of the toll-like receptor 4, albeit with very low affinity.

### Pharmacokinetics

Buprenorphine is metabolized by the liver, via CYP3A4 (also CYP2C8 seems to be involved) isozymes of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, into norbuprenorphine (by N-dealkylation). The glucuronidation of buprenorphine is primarily carried out by UGT1A1 and UGT2B7, and that of norbuprenorphine by UGT1A1 and UGT1A3. These glucuronides are then eliminated mainly through excretion into bile. The elimination half-life of buprenorphine is 20 to 73 hours (mean 37 hours). Due to the mainly hepatic elimination, no risk of accumulation exists in people with renal impairment.
One of the major active metabolites of buprenorphine is norbuprenorphine, which, in contrast to buprenorphine itself, is a full agonist of the MOR, DOR, and ORL-1, and a partial agonist at the KOR. However, relative to buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine has extremely little antinociceptive potency (1/50th that of buprenorphine), but markedly depresses respiration (10-fold more than buprenorphine). This may be explained by very poor brain penetration of norbuprenorphine due to a high affinity of the compound for P-glycoprotein. In contrast to norbuprenorphine, buprenorphine and its glucuronide metabolites are negligibly transported by P-glycoprotein.
The glucuronides of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine are also biologically active, and represent major active metabolites of buprenorphine. Buprenorphine-3-glucuronide has affinity for the MOR (Ki = 4.9 pM), DOR (Ki = 270 nM) and ORL-1 (Ki = 36 μM), and no affinity for the KOR. It has a small antinociceptive effect and no effect on respiration. Norbuprenorphine-3-glucuronide has no affinity for the MOR or DOR, but does bind to the KOR (Ki = 300 nM) and ORL-1 (Ki = 18 μM). It has a sedative effect but no effect on respiration.

## Chemistry

Buprenorphine is a semisynthetic derivative of thebaine, and is fairly soluble in water, as its hydrochloride salt. It degrades in the presence of light.

### Detection in body fluids

Buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine may be quantified in blood or urine to monitor use or non-medical recreational use, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a medicolegal investigation. A significant overlap of drug concentrations exists in body fluids within the possible spectrum of physiological reactions ranging from asymptomatic to comatose. Therefore, knowing both the route of administration of the drug and the level of tolerance to opioids of the individual is critical when results are interpreted.

## History

In 1969, researchers at Reckitt and Colman (now Reckitt Benckiser) had spent 10 years attempting to synthesize an opioid compound "with structures substantially more complex than morphine [that] could retain the desirable actions whilst shedding the undesirable side effects". Physical dependence and withdrawal from buprenorphine itself remain important issues since buprenorphine is a long-acting opioid. Reckitt found success when researchers synthesized RX6029 which had shown success in reducing dependence in test animals. RX6029 was named buprenorphine and began trials on humans in 1971. By 1978, buprenorphine was first launched in the UK as an injection to treat severe pain, with a sublingual formulation released in 1982.

## Society and culture

### Regulation

#### United States

In the United States, buprenorphine and buprenorphine with naloxone were approved for opioid use disorder by the Food and Drug Administration in October 2002. The DEA rescheduled buprenorphine from a schedule V drug to a schedule III drug just before approval. The ACSCN for buprenorphine is 9064, and being a schedule III substance, it does not have an annual manufacturing quota imposed by the DEA. The salt in use is the hydrochloride, which has a free-base conversion ratio of 0.928.
In the years before buprenorphine/naloxone was approved, Reckitt Benckiser had lobbied Congress to help craft the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000, which gave authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to grant a waiver to physicians with certain training to prescribe and administer schedule III, IV, or V narcotic drugs for the treatment of addiction or detoxification. Before this law was passed, such treatment was permitted only in clinics designed specifically for drug addiction.
The waiver, which can be granted after the completion of an eight-hour course, was required for outpatient treatment of opioid addiction with buprenorphine from 2000 to 2021. Initially, the number of people each approved physician could treat was limited to 10. This was eventually modified to allow approved physicians to treat up to 100 people with buprenorphine for opioid addiction in an outpatient setting. This limit was increased by the Obama administration, raising the number of patients to which doctors can prescribe to 275. On 14 January 2021, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced that the waiver would no longer be required to prescribe buprenorphine to treat up to 30 people concurrently.
New Jersey authorized paramedics to give buprenorphine to people at the scene after they have recovered from an overdose.

#### Europe

In the European Union, Subutex and Suboxone, buprenorphine's high-dose sublingual tablet preparations, were approved for opioid use disorder treatment in September 2006. In the Netherlands, buprenorphine is a list II drug of the Opium Law, though special rules and guidelines apply to its prescription and dispensation. In France, buprenorphine prescription by general practitioners and dispensed by pharmacies has been permitted since the mid-1990s as a response to HIV and overdose risk. Deaths caused by heroin overdose were reduced by four-fifths between 1994 and 2002, and the incidence of AIDS among people who inject drugs in France fell from 25% in the mid-1990s to 6% in 2010.

### Barriers to access

In the US, the list price for a long-acting injectable form is five to 20 times as much as a daily pill.  This has reduced the number of people who are able to get a single monthly dose, instead of daily pills.  Some jails consider the more expensive form a positive tradeoff:  a single monthly injection may be simpler and easier for the staff to manage than daily trips to the dispensary to have a nurse provide a pill and make sure that it has been swallowed.

### Brand names

Buprenorphine is available under the brand names Cizdol, Brixadi (approved in the US by FDA for addiction treatment in 2023), Suboxone (with naloxone), Subutex (typically used for opioid use disorder), Zubsolv, Bunavail, Buvidal (approved in the UK, Europe and Australia for addiction treatment in 2018), Sublocade (approved in the US in 2018), Probuphine, Temgesic (sublingual tablets for moderate to severe pain), Buprenex (solutions for injection often used for acute pain in primary-care settings), Norspan, and Butrans (transdermal preparations used for chronic pain). In Poland buprenorphine is available under the trade names Bunondol (for pain treatment, when morphine is too little; amounts of 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg) and Bunorfin (for addicts substitution in amount of 2 and 8 mg).

## Research

### Microdosing

There is some evidence that a buprenorphine microdosing regime, started before opioid withdrawal symptoms have started, can be effective in helping people transition away from opioid dependence.

### Depression

Some evidence supports the use of buprenorphine for depression. Buprenorphine/samidorphan, a combination product of buprenorphine and samidorphan (a preferential μ-opioid receptor antagonist), appears useful for treatment-resistant depression.
A buprenorphine implant (developmental code name SK-2110) is under development by Shenzhen ScienCare Pharmaceutical in China for the treatment of refractory major depressive disorder.

### Cocaine dependence

In combination with samidorphan or naltrexone (μ-opioid receptor antagonists), buprenorphine is under investigation for the treatment of cocaine dependence, and recently demonstrated effectiveness for this indication in a large-scale (n = 302) clinical trial (at a high buprenorphine dose of 16 mg, but not a low dose of 4 mg).

### Neonatal abstinence

Buprenorphine has been used in the treatment of the neonatal abstinence syndrome, a condition in which newborns exposed to opioids during pregnancy demonstrate signs of withdrawal. In the United States, use currently is limited to infants enrolled in a clinical trial conducted under an FDA-approved investigational new drug (IND) application. Preliminary research suggests that buprenorphine is associated with shorter time in hospital for neonates, compared to methadone. An ethanolic formulation used in neonates is stable at room temperature for at least 30 days.

## Veterinary use

Buprenorphine is commonly used as a long-lasting post-operative analgesic in small animal veterinary practice. Buprenorphine can be administered via subcutaneous, transdermal, intravenous, or intramuscular. Buprenorphine provides analgesia for 6–8 hours in dogs and 4–8 hours in cats when administered as an intramuscular or intravenous injection. A transdermal application can provide analgesia for up to 4 days in cats. The oral-transmucosal route has been investigated due to the potential for client administration but variability in bio-availability and other issues limit this usage. When used in combination with local anaesthetics or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug buprenorphine provides good analgesia for ovariohysterectomies and orchidectomies. In horses buprenorphine can be used for castration and dental extraction; however, buprenorphine is not commonly used in horses as a post-operative analgesic due to potential for adverse gastrointestinal effects and locomotive stimulation.
