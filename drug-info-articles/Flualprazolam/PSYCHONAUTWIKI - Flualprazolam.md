**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) , [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or other [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Flualprazolam** is a novel [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) substance of the [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) class. It is a structural analog of [alprazolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alprazolam) ( *Xanax* ), a widely used prescription benzodiazepine with high recreational potential. The mechanism is unknown, but it likely acts as a [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) .

Flualprazolam appears to have first become available for sale in 2017 on the online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market. The origins of its development is not clear. It has been marketed or deceptively sold as a replacement for alprazolam despite differing in substantive ways, according to some reports.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) , [memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . Its effects are somewhat similar to alprazolam; however, it is reported to be more hypnotic and sedating than anxiolytic, and not as recreational. It appears to be more potent-by-weight than alprazolam.

Limited data exists on the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicology of this compound. It likely possesses high abuse potential due to its similarity to alprazolam. The health risks of forming physical dependence to this compound are not known, and may possess additional risks relative to traditional benzodiazepines.

Additionally, it should be noted that the sudden discontinuation of benzodiazepines can be dangerous or even life-threatening for individuals for heavy or long-term users. As a result, individuals who are physically dependent on this substance are advised to [taper](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Taper) their dose by gradually lowering the amount taken each day over a prolonged period instead of stopping use abruptly.

Flualprazolam has been reported by users to dramatically and rapidly increase benzodiazepine cross-tolerance. It is strongly advised to only use Flualprazolam for short periods of time, and if used as an emergency substitute to avoid benzodiazepine withdrawal, to avoid compulsive redosing and minimize the administered dose as much as possible.

The potency of Flualprazolam compared to Alprazolam has been reported to vary dramatically by users (ranging anywhere between 1.5x and 5x stronger than Alprazolam).

It is strongly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## History and culture

Flualprazolam first appeared on the [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market around 2017

## Chemistry

Flualprazolam belongs to a class of synthetic organic compounds called benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines contain a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring, which is a seven membered ring with the two nitrogen constituents located at R 1 and R 4 .

The benzyl ring of flualprazolam is substituted at R 8 with a chlorine group. Further, the diazepine ring is bonded at R 5 to a phenyl ring. The only difference to alprazolam is a fluorine group located at R 2' .

Flualprazolam also contains a 1-methylated triazole ring fused to and incorporating R 1 and R 2 of its diazepine ring. Flualprazolam belongs to a class of benzodiazepines containing this fused triazole ring, called triazolobenzodiazepines, distinguished by the suffix "-zolam".

It can be described as the 2'-fluoro derivative of [alprazolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alprazolam) , which it might share some of its effects , though some users report that it subjectively feels different than alprazolam in most aspects.

## Pharmacology

Flualprazolam can be described as the 2'-fluoro derivative of alprazolam, or the fluoro instead of chloro analogue of triazolam, and has similar sedative and anxiolytic effects.

## Subjective effects

Flualprazolam is reported to to be more [hypnotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnotic) , have a longer duration, and a significantly longer elimination half-life than its parent compound alprazolam.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - Reported to be stronger than many benzodiazepines. It has been described as a very forceful hypnotic, inducing sleep by force at high doses. This effect is dangerously hard to predict independent of any previous benzodiazepine tolerance. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)** - Reportedly stronger than Alprazolam.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - Short-lasting, encouraging compulsive redosing.
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)** - More common at higher doses.
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)** ,
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** - Uncommon but noticeable effect, especially for first-time users.
- **[Seizure suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure_suppression)**
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)** - Strong at higher doses.
- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)** - Can sometimes be very strong and last for a few hours. ### Cognitive effects
 
- If applicable, a brief paragraph summary of the substance's cognitive effects may be included here. You may select from a list of cognitive effects to add below [here](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index#Cognitive_effects) . 
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)** - Somewhat effective, but outweighed by hypnotic & sedative effects.
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)** - More prominent at high doses.
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - Reportedly short lasting (1-2h after dosing), encouraging compulsive redosing while still intoxicated.
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** - Quite strong at high doses.
- **[Delusions of sobriety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions_of_sobriety)** - Present but manageable with some of the effect being imperceptible until the following day, depending on the dosage.
- **[Analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)**
- **[Ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)** - This effect seems to be more pronounced than other benzodiazepines.
- **[Sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)** - Noticeably more sedating than Alprazolam.
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)** - See paradoxical effects section ### Visual effects
 
- - **[Visual acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)** - Like many [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) , flualprazolam may cause blurred or otherwise suppressed visual acuity, especially at high doses. ### After effects
 
- - **Rebound [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** - Rebound anxiety is a commonly observed effect with [anxiety relieving](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) substances like [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) . It typically corresponds to the total duration spent under the substance's influence along with the total amount consumed in a given period, an effect which can easily lend itself to cycles of dependence and addiction.
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)**
- **Residual [sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)** - While benzodiazepines can be used as an effective [sleep-inducing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnotic) aid, their effects may persist into the morning afterward, which may lead users to feeling "groggy" or "dull" for up to a few hours.
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Thought disorganization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_disorganization)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)** ### Paradoxical effects
 
- Paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines such as increased seizures (in epileptics), aggression, increased anxiety, violent behavior, loss of impulse control, irritability and suicidal behavior sometimes occur (although they are rare in the general population, with an incidence rate below 1%). 
These paradoxical effects occur with greater frequency in recreational abusers, individuals with mental disorders, children, and patients on high-dosage regimes.

## Toxicity and harm potential

Flualprazolam likely has a low toxicity relative to dose. However, it is potentially lethal when mixed with depressants like alcohol or opioids.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

Like most benzodiazepines, Flualprazolam is considered to be highly addictive with a high potential for abuse.

Tolerance will develop to the sedative-hypnotic effects within a couple of days of continuous use. After cessation, the tolerance returns to baseline in 7 - 14 days. However, in certain cases this may take significantly longer in a manner which is proportional to the duration and intensity of one's long-term usage.

Benzodiazepine discontinuation is notoriously difficult and potentially life-threatening for heavy or long-term users. There is an increased risk of seizure following discontinuation of [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) . Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing usage abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. Substances which lower the seizure threshold such as [Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) should be avoided during withdrawal.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Depressants** ( *[1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) , [2M2B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2M2B) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) / [GBL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL) , [methaqualone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methaqualone) , [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids)* ) - This combination potentiates the [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , and [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) caused by one another. At higher doses, it can lead to a sudden, unexpected loss of consciousness along with a dangerous amount of depressed respiration. There is also an increased risk of suffocating on one's vomit while unconscious. If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs before a loss of consciousness, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **Dissociatives** - This combination can unpredictably potentiate the [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) and [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) that can be caused by each other. It may also result in a sudden loss of consciousness accompanied by a dangerous degree of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs before consciousness is lost, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **Stimulants** - Stimulants mask the [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) effect of depressants, which is the main factor most people use to gauge their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant effects wear off, the effects of the depressant will significantly increase, leading to intensified [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) , and dangerous [black-out states](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) . This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if one's fluid intake is not closely monitored. If choosing to combine these substances, one should strictly limit themselves to a pre-set schedule of dosing only a certain amount per hour until a maximum threshold has been reached.
