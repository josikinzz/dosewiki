## Overview

Inhalants are chemicals in gaseous form or volatile solvents (liquids) that become gas at the time of use, which are inhaled for their psychoactive effects.

Common examples include:
- Gasoline
- Acetone
- Mineral spirits
- Freon
- Computer duster
- Glue

## Classification

- **Class:** Anaesthetic, Intoxicant, Dissociative

## Critical Health Warning

**There is no such thing as safe use of most volatile solvents, aerosols or other street inhalants: their psychoactive effects may be inseparable from nerve and organ damage.**

This caution indicates that the psychoactive effects cannot be separated from potential harm to the nervous system and organs. Documented cases exist of inhalant-related deaths and vision damage.

## Health Resources

The vault includes information from NIDA (National Institute on Drug Abuse) regarding health warnings, as well as research journal articles on solvent neurotoxicity.

*Source: https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Inhalants*
**It is never ever safe to ingest inhalants (except alcohols) or directly inhale compressed gases! Short-term moderate inhalation of properly administered medical inhalants (e.g. alkyl nitrites (poppers) , or nitrous oxide (when supplemented with vitamin B12 after use to prevent deficiency) can be safe. However, inhalants that are not designed for medical use (e.g. *medical gasoline* ) are considered toxic inhalants , and even a single session of using them can result in sudden death, and can cause [chronic solvent-induced encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_solvent-induced_encephalopathy) (CSE), and [volatile inhalant withdrawal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_inhalant_withdrawal) with frequent use.**
 
Unlike other substances, there is no such thing as safe recreational use of volatile solvents without medical use (street inhalants)—their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage. Additionally, aerosol spray dispensers can cause [aerosol burn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol_burn) and hypoxia (lack of oxygen). It is strongly discouraged to take any amount of these substances, even for minor experimentation purposes. Avoid them at all costs. Please see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Inhalants#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) for more details.
**Inhalants** refer to a broad range of household or industrial chemicals whose volatile vapors or gases are concentrated and inhaled into the lungs via the nose or mouth to produce a state of acute intoxication. The effects of inhalants range from central nervous system depression and intense [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) to vivid [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) experiences such as [internal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) and [external hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) . However, these intoxicating and debilitating effects vary widely depending on the substance and the dose used.

Inhalants do not include substances that are breathed in after they have been heated through vaporization or burned. For example, [amyl nitrite](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Poppers) (poppers), [nitrous oxide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide) and [toluene](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Toluene) are considered to be inhalants because they are volatile at room temperature and need no other heat source to transform from liquid to gaseous state. [Tobacco](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tobacco) , [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) , [crack-cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) , or any other [psychoactive substance](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Category:Psychoactive_substance) that requires an external heat source is not considered to be a member of the inhalant category of substances, even though once heated the resulting fumes are inhaled into the lungs.

## Overview

## Medical inhalants

### Antidote to cyanide poisoning

#### Alkyl nitrites (poppers)

[Alkyl nitrites](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alkyl_nitrites) (also known as poppers) are a class of volatile liquid substances whose fumes are inhaled for recreational purposes, particularly in preparation for sexual activities. They are known for producing intense but short-lived muscle relaxing effects that start after about 15 seconds and last for up to 3 minutes.The substance is often sold under the name 'Rush'.

### General anesthetics

For a full list of medical inhalational anesthetic agents, see: [List of medical inhalants#Inhalational anesthetic agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_medical_inhalants#Inhalational_anesthetic_agents)

#### Nitrous oxide

While not a volatile organic chemical, nitrous is often inhaled or huffed and is therefore technically an inhalant. It is also worth noting that this is one of the very few inhalants which are not inherently dangerous to use assuming that appropriate precautions are taken.

Nitrous oxide, commonly known as laughing gas, nitrous, nitro, NOS or hippy crack, is an [inorganic molecule](/w/index.php?title=Inorganic_molecule&action=edit&redlink=1) and chemical compound with the formula N 2 O. It is an oxide of nitrogen. At room temperature, it is a colorless and non-flammable gas with a slightly sweet odor and taste. It is used in surgery and dentistry for its anesthetic and analgesic effects.

It is also known as "laughing gas" due to the euphoric effects of inhaling it, a property that has led to its recreational use as an atypical [dissociative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) [anesthetic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) . The duration of these effects is approximately 2 - 5 minutes in length. It is also used as an oxidizer in rocketry and in motor racing to increase the power output of engines. At elevated temperatures, nitrous oxide is a powerful oxidizer similar to molecular oxygen.

- Skeletal structures of the two resonance structures of a nitrous oxide molecule.
- Above are nitrous oxide canisters. These are available for purchase on [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_4_13/151-3485180-9056864?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=nitrous+oxide+chargers&sprefix=nitrous+oxide%2Caps%2C137) and many other websites.
- Nitrous canisters are used with [whip cream dispensers](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=whip+cream+dispenser&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Awhip+cream+dispenser) as an easy and convenient route of administration.

###### Food grade cream chargers compared to medical nitrous oxide

- Medical grade contains 50% nitrous oxide, and 50% oxygen.
- The gas from "cream chargers" contains food grade, not medical grade nitrous oxide. Thus, they can contain a range of impurities, such as industrial grease left over from manufacturing, and tiny particles of steel from the pierced metal. Users can filter them through a piece of cotton, cloth, or clothing to reduce the amount of impurities inhaled. Regular cleaning of nitrous dispensing devices can also reduce the harm posed by impurities.

#### Xenon

Xenon is an elemental gas that is reported to produce psychoactive effects upon inhalation, whose effects are similar to nitrous oxide. These include dissociation, anesthesia and euphoria. Recreational use of Xenon is rare due to its high cost and the difficulty of obtaining it . Xenon is neuroprotective against oxygen deprivation and has been used to prevent brain damage in extremely premature babies.

- Xenon can be found in canisters similar to Nitrous Oxide canisters.
- Xenon is an elemental gas that reportedly produces dissociative effects.
- Xenon is an elemental gas with psychoactive effects.

#### Historical general anesthetics

Obscure compounds:

- [1,1,1-Trichloroethane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,1,1-Trichloroethane) (Wikipedia)
- [Carbon tetrachloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tetrachloride) (Wikipedia)

###### Chloroethane

It was commonly used to induce general anaesthesia before continuing with di-ethyl ether, which had a much slower up-take.

Albeit not used an inhalant in modern times it is still worth to note that: In Brazil, [chloroethane](/w/index.php?title=Chloroethane&action=edit&redlink=1) is a major component of a traditional (though illegal) drug taken during Carnaval, known locally as "lança-perfume" (lit. *perfume launcher* or *sprayer* ).

###### Chloroform

**Chloroform** , or **trichloromethane** , is an organic compound with formula CHCl 3 . It is a colorless, strong-smelling, dense liquid. It is a volatile solvent that was used as a medical anesthetic during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is one of the four chloromethanes and a trihalomethane. It is a powerful anesthetic, euphoriant, anxiolytic and sedative when inhaled or ingested.

The anesthetic qualities of chloroform were first described in 1842 in a thesis by Robert Mortimer Glover, which won the Gold Medal of the Harveian Society for that year. Glover also undertook practical experiments on dogs to prove his theories. Glover further refined his theories and presented them in the thesis for his doctorate at the University of Edinburgh in the summer of 1847. The Scottish obstetrician James Young Simpson was one of the persons required to read the thesis, but later claimed to have never read the thesis and to have come to his conclusions independently.

The use of chloroform during surgery expanded rapidly thereafter in Europe. In the 1850s, chloroform was used by the physician John Snow during the birth of Queen Victoria's last two children. In the United States, chloroform began to replace ether as an anesthetic at the beginning of the 20th century; however, it was quickly abandoned in favor of ether upon discovery of its toxicity, especially its tendency to cause fatal cardiac arrhythmia analogous to what is now termed "sudden sniffer's death". Some people used chloroform as a recreational drug or to attempt suicide.

Use of chloroform as an incapacitating agent has become widely recognized, bordering on clichéd, due to the popularity of crime fiction authors having criminals use chloroform-soaked rags to render victims unconscious. However, it is nearly impossible to incapacitate someone using chloroform in this manner. It takes at least five minutes of inhaling an item soaked in chloroform to render a person unconscious. Most criminal cases involving chloroform also involve another drug being co-administered, such as alcohol or diazepam, or the victim being found to have been complicit in its administration. After a person has lost consciousness due to chloroform inhalation, a continuous volume must be administered and the chin must be supported to keep the tongue from obstructing the airway, a difficult procedure typically requiring the skills of an anesthesiologist.

###### Ether

See also: [Ether addiction (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ether_addiction)

Diethyl ether (commonly known as ether) is a volatile liquid whose vapors are inhaled to produce effects such as [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , [dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness) , and auditory hallucinations . The CNS depressant effects lead it to also cause unconsciousness, drowsiness, and [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) . Other psychoactive effects that are documented in experience reports include [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) , [loss of motor control](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Loss_of_motor_control) , and other hallucinatory states.

Ether is highly flammable and should be treated with care. It can cause irritation to the upper respiratory tract when inhaled. Irritation to the eyes and skin may also occur along with coughing and headaches.

Ether was commonly used in the 19th century for anesthesia. It was also used as a psychoactive drug for its intoxicant effects. It can be drunk in its liquid form but, due to the volatility of the substance, this practice is not advised as it can cause severe damage to internal organs. Pure ether is volatile at standard temperature and pressures, and the vapors of ether can be inhaled to experience its psychoactive effects. Ether can also be absorbed through the skin.

Diethyl ether does not depress the myocardium but rather it stimulates the sympathetic nervous system leading to hypertension and tachycardia. It is safely used in patients with shock as it preserves the baroreceptor reflex. Diethyl ether could also be mixed with other anesthetic agents such as chloroform to make C.E. mixture, or chloroform and alcohol to make A.C.E. mixture. In the 21st century, ether is rarely used. The use of flammable ether was displaced by nonflammable fluorinated hydrocarbon anesthetics. Halothane was the first such anesthetic developed and other currently used inhaled anesthetics, such as isoflurane, desflurane, and sevoflurane, are halogenated ethers.

- The chemical structure of diethyl ether, commonly known as "ether".
- Diethyl ether is a clear, volatile liquid at room temperatures.
- Ether can be found as an active ingredient in some automobile starting fluids - the inhalation of ether from this medium is not advised from a health safety standpoint due to other chemical contaminants found in the starting fluid.

Anecdotal reports of ether experience can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: Ether](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Ether.shtml)

## Non-medical inhalants

Ethanol (the [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) which is normally drunk) is [sometimes inhaled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_inhalation) , but this cannot be done at room temperature.

## Toxic inhalants
**Toxic inhalants can cause sudden death and should never be inhaled!**
Most users tend to be "... adolescents (between the ages of 12 and 17)."

### Types

#### Hydrocarbons

The most common ingredients found in aerosols is some fluorocarbon or hydrocarbon molecule acting as a propellant. Gases from aerosol spray dispenser can cause sudden death upon inhalation and is not advisable from a harm reduction perspective.

Aerosols are found in common household items such as air freshener, hair spray, and spray paint. The variety of the specific chemicals used in inhalation vary widely based on the product being used.

Most gasses are compressed into canisters and will absorb heat from the environment upon expansion into the atmosphere from the can. This temperature change can cause serious bodily harm if one does not consider the temperature change that the gas can go through upon inhalation. In addition to the dangers associated with inhaling uncompressed gas, there are dangers of asphyxiation and death because the psychoactive gas that is heavier than air will accumulate in the lungs and prevent oxygen absorption.

##### Gases

###### Butane

Use of this inhalant can cause sudden death upon inhalation and is not advisable from a harm reduction perspective.

This chemical is often found in a compressed form in a can and can be inhaled directly. Using butane as a drug is dangerous due to possible oxygen deprivation. The direct inhalation of the gas can also cause drowsiness, narcosis, asphyxia, and cardiac arrhythmia among other CNS depressant effects. Butane is the most commonly abused volatile organic solvent in the United Kingdom and caused 52% of solvent-related deaths in 2000.

When butane is sprayed directly into the throat, the jet of fluid can cool rapidly to the dangerous temperature of −20 °C by adiabatic expansion, causing prolonged laryngospasm and other bodily harm. The ingestion of liquid butane or direct inhalation of butane can cause frostbite like effects that pose a serious risk of personal injury .

Butane is also dangerous to use in an unventilated area. It is a highly flammable gas and if too much butane accumulates in the atmosphere a physical or electrical spark can cause an explosion. If pressure or heat is applied to cans containing butane, they will explode and pose a risk for bodily harm.

- Butane is compressed inside of a can. This compressed gas is inhaled directly from the can.
- Butane is a hydrocarbon that has psychoactive effects.
- Butane gas is highly flammable!

An anecdotal report of a butane experience can be found here:

- [Butane Trip Report](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=31384%7CA)

###### Propane

Propane is a hydrocarbon. It is commonly found in hair spray, and portable propane tanks used for fuel.
Gas duster
Gas dusters generally contain the halocarbons difluoroethane (DFE) or tetrafluoroethane (TFE). Some gas dusters contain trifluoroethane, but these are very rare. TFE has been used as a human anesthetic and has a similar structure to Halothane. DFE has been linked to multiple cases of sudden cardiac death after inhalation. There are no reported deaths from TFE, however, it can cause arrythmias and possibly sudden death. Beta-blockers prevent TFE-induced arrythmias. It is not known whether beta blockers prevent DFE-induced arrythmias and death.

- Difluoroethane molecules can be found in commercial electronics dusters.
- Tetrafluoroethane molecules can be found in commercial electronics dusters.
- Dustoff is commercial electronics duster that is commonly abused.

An anecdotal report of electronics duster experiences can be found here:

- [Keyboard Cleaner Trip Report](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=83412%7CA)

##### Liquid

###### Gasoline/petrol
**Gasoline is never safe to inhale. *Medical gasoline* is designed for topical use, for example to make it easy to remove adhesive residues from plaster and band-aid. It is not safe to inhale medical gasoline, just because the purification from lead eliminates lead toxicity. Medical gasoline still consists of aliphatic hydrocarbons and can cause sudden death though hydrocarbon toxicity.**
Use of this inhalant can cause sudden death upon inhalation and is not advisable from a harm reduction perspective.

This substance is highly flammable and should be treated with care.

Petrol, or gasoline, is a toxic liquid that is volatile at room temperatures. This makes it easy to inhale the vapors from sniffing a container full of liquid gasoline and achieving effects ranging from [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) to numbness and [cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria) . Gasoline that is inhaled from a gas can, or car can contain other carcinogenic and psychoactive chemicals, such as toluene, benzene, and xylene . The mixed chemical contents of gasoline make it inherently unsafe to inhale over sustained periods of time.

Gasoline as a liquid mixture of hydrocarbons contains many components, some of which are psychoactive or toxic to the body. Gasoline may contain ethanol, toluene, benzene, and many other volatile chemicals that will emit vapors that will be inhaled when abused. In areas where leaded gas is not banned, lead encephalopathy and brain degeneration may be caused by gasoline sniffing . Benzene is also a known constituent of gasoline vapors and is known to contribute to leukemia and other blood disorders .

- Gasoline vapors are commonly inhaled through the "neck" of the gas can.
- A variety of VOCs are found in gasoline that may have psychoactive and harmful effects.
- This chemical is highly flammable!

Anecdotal reports of gasoline inhalation experiences can be found here:

- ["Addicted to Gasoline"](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=24386%7C)

###### Toluene

Use of this inhalant can cause sudden death upon inhalation and is not advisable from a harm reduction perspective.

Toluene is a chemical solvent commonly used in industry. It is a liquid solvent that is volatile at room temperatures, making the vapors easy to inhale by sniffing a product containing toluene. It has a sweet smell and is colorless. Its vapors can be inhaled from soaking a rag in toluene containing liquids or sniffing the vapors directly from glue emitting toluene vapors. It can found in gasoline, acrylic paints, varnishes, lacquers, paint thinners, adhesives, glues, rubber cement, airplane glue, and shoe polish, among various other common everyday household items. Toluene can be absorbed through the skin in addition to being inhaled.

Exposure to the high concentrations used in toluene abuse can cause many acute physical and cognitive effects ranging from [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , [dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness) , drowsiness, general CNS depression, [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) , and [hallucinatory states](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinatory_states) . The [hallucinatory states](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinatory_states) induced by toluene can be assessed by experience reports submitted by users.

Long term damage to the central nervous system has been well-documented among long-term inhalant users of toluene. The long-term effects of chronic toluene exposure include changes in sleeping patterns, liver failure, kidney failure, heart failure, persistent neurological damage, and death .

Toluene is known to cause congenital disabilities and the birth rate of children when used by pregnant women . It is a possible carcinogen, and its nature as a carcinogen is unknown is due to insufficient data from the EPA . Caution should be used if choosing to inhale this chemical in recreational amounts (i.e. over a single experience and over long periods of time).

- The molecular structure of toluene.
- A common brand of toluene-based glue.
- A common brand of toluene based paint thinner.

An anecdotal report of toluene experiences via glue sniffing can be found here:

- [Glue Inhalant Trip Report](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=57668%7CA)
- [Glue Inhalant Trip Report - "Glue Sniffing Nightmare"](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=88914%7CA)

##### Liquid/gas mixtures

###### Freon

Freon is a trademark name for fluorinated hydrocarbons. Freon is an odorless gas commonly used as refrigerants and aerosol propellants, it's also found in air conditioning units. They are stable, nonflammable, low toxicity gases or liquids.

Use of this inhalant can cause sudden death upon inhalation and is not advisable from a harm reduction perspective.

This class of chemical refrigerants can be abused as a psychoactive substance. Pure Freon is a brand manufactured by DuPont, the most current brand of Freon being phased out of production is R-22 and contains primarily chlorodifluoromethane. There are many different variants of the brand name Freon and the chemical composition varies along with the "R-x" name given the refrigerant. Some people huff Freon directly from AC units and this is a dangerous practice as one does not know the exact type of Freon found in an AC unit, much less the potential chemical contaminants found in the gas from the AC unit.

- Chlorodifluoromethane is found in Freon R-22
- The most common type of refridgerant used for huffing is DuPont's Freon R-22, coming in teal barrels.
- There are many different formulations of Freon and each is contained in a color coded compressed barrel.

An anecdotal report of Freon experiences can be found here:

- [Freon Trip Report](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=13789%7CA)

A NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) International Chemical Safety Card for R-22 as one example of these chemical refrigerants can be found here:

- [CDC - CHLORODIFLUOROMETHANE - International Chemical Safety Cards - NIOSH](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/81-123/pdfs/0124.pdf?id=10.26616/NIOSHPUB81123)

#### Ketones

A solvent is something that emits vapors that can be inhaled for their psychoactive effects. The liquid form of the solvent itself is not consumed. Some common forms of psychoactive solvents are toluene containing paint thinners and lacquers, spray paint, and blends of hydrocarbons such as gasoline or petrol.

##### Liquid

###### Acetone

Use of this inhalant can cause sudden death upon inhalation and is not advisable from a harm reduction perspective.

Acetone is a liquid solvent that is volatile at room temperatures. The vapors of acetone are flammable and so extra caution should be taken when handling and using acetone.

Its vapors can be sniffed and are known to have damaging physical effects such as respiratory tract irritation . The acute effects of acetone exposure through inhalation and dermal exposure include CNS depression, [dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) , and "narcosis" which can be interpreted as drunkenness or otherwise intoxicant effects . This evidence suggests that acetone acts as a psychoactive chemical in high concentrations.

- The chemical acetone is a volatile liquid at room temperatures and produces vapors that may be inhaled.
- The acetone found in many household items, such as nail polish remover, can be sniffed to produce a psychoactive effect.
- The hazard chart for acetone shows that it is a flammable vapor.

### Toxicity and harm potential for toxic inhalants

**There is no safe way to consume aerosol sprays, or solvents, as sudden death upon inhalation is always a present risk.**

Some inhalant users become injured due to the harmful effects of the inhalants themselves, or due to other chemical by-products that are unintentionally inhaled in a contaminated solvent.

The specific toxicities of each inhalant are given below, but inhalants as a class of substances are among the most harmful and dangerous to use due to the possibility of long-term health damage, and sudden death.

Certain inhalants, such as hydrocarbons (e.g. butane, propane), toluene cause renal, liver, lung, and bone marrow damage.

Pneumonia, cardiac failure or arrest, or aspiration of vomit are other common causes of death after inhalant use. Brain damage is typically seen with the chronic long-term use of solvents, while short-term exposure carries a lower chance of permanent brain damage .

#### Lethal dosage

The lethal doses of inhalants vary depending on the substance used. All nonmedical inhalants are inherently dangerous to use and may cause sudden death.

Sudden sniffing death syndrome , also known as SSDS, is when inhalants indirectly cause sudden death by cardiac arrest, in a syndrome known as "sudden sniffing death." In some cases, the anesthetic gasses present in the inhalants themselves appear to sensitize the user to adrenaline treatment by emergency medical services and, in this state of intoxication, a sudden surge of adrenaline (possibly from a frightening hallucination or run-in with other persons), may cause fatal cardiac arrhythmia.

### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of inhalants within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: Inhalants Reports (also Glue, Freon, Propellants, Solvents)](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Inhalants.shtml)

## Methods of inhalation

### Gases

For nitrous oxide see also: Impurity filtration from decompressed cream chargers

#### Inhalation from balloons

To avoid frostbite, the gas is decompressed into a balloon, which is then inhaled.

#### Direct inhalation of decompressed gas (dangerous)

Other forms of inhalants are gases that are inhaled directly from a pressurized container (e.g. computer duster, butane gas, [nitrous oxide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide) or xenon gas). These gases can be inhaled directly from a compressed chemical canister (as is the case with butane gas and computer duster), which may cause physical harm due to the freezing of skin tissue as the gas expands in the lungs.

It is imperative that one ensure an adequate flow of oxygen to the brain while using inhalants to minimize the chances of permanent brain damage.

#### Aerosol products

##### Filtering

Air fresheners are inhaled in a similar matter to hairspray inhalation. A rag is placed over the mouth, which the air freshener is discharged into and subsequently inhaled.

### Solvents

Solvents are inhaled at room temperature through the inhalation of the gases emitted from a solvent, as seen in the case of recreational gasoline or acetone use. One must inhale the vapors from the solvent or gas itself via the nose or mouth. Inhalants that are solvents are commonly used by saturating the cloth with spray paint or other liquid materials, then placing this soaked rag over the nose and mouth, which result in the inhalation of the vapors from the rag. This subsequent inhalation often produces feelings of [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , especially when huffing generic "glue" or "paint thinner" that may contain high volumes of toluene and other hydrocarbons.

#### Huffing

Some common for inhalation include "huffing" which is the process of filling a bag up with a solvent and inhaling the resulting fumes and "bagging" which is the process of spraying a solvent into a plastic bag of some sort and inhaling the vapors that emit from it. In the process of inhalation by bagging, the exhaled air is re-breathed by the user, and the resulting lack of oxygen and elevated breathing rates may add to the intoxicating and harmful effects of the solvent.

## Toxicity and harm potential

**This section covers risks general risks for both medical and nonmedical inhalants. For specific risks with nonmedical inhalants, see Toxicity and harm potential for toxic inhalants**

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_use) when using this class of substances.

Both medical and nonmedical inhalants should be avoided by:

- Inhaling large quantities continuously with a strap-on mask connected to a gas canister. Because it will eventually cause oxygen deprivation. In some cases, users have died from a lack of oxygen, also known as hypoxia [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] .
- Inhaling compressed gas directly from a container. Because it can cause aerosol burn and frostbite.

### Addiction potential

The chronic use of many inhalants can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

### Oxygen deprivation

The direct inhalation of any gas or solvent that is capable of displacing oxygen in the lungs (especially gases heavier than oxygen itself) carries the risk of hypoxia (oxygen deprivation) as a result of the very mechanism by which breathing is triggered.

Since reflexive breathing is prompted by elevated carbon dioxide levels rather than diminished blood oxygen levels, breathing a concentrated and inert solvent or gas (ex: tetrafluoromethane or [nitrous oxide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide) ) that removes carbon dioxide from the blood without replacing it with oxygen will produce no outward signs of suffocation even when the brain is experiencing hypoxia.

Once full symptoms of hypoxia appear, it may be too late to breathe without assistance, especially if the gas is heavy enough to sink in and remain in the lungs for extended periods of time. Even completely inert gasses, such as argon, can have this effect if oxygen is largely excluded. This dangerous property of heavy gasses makes many inhalants inherently unsafe.

If one is inhaling an inhalant that is a pure compound, they will not be inhaling any oxygen. Severe oxygen deprivation can lead to unconsciousness and death. 'Huffing' from a bag that contains no fresh oxygen source is an especially risky practice in this respect. When inhaling gasses directly from a balloon or canister, it is imperative that one also intake an adequate amount of oxygen to prevent brain damage and cell death.

## Legal status

Many solvents and gasses that can be abused can be obtained easily in a legal manner across all continents; these include solvents, adhesives, fuels, dry-cleaning agents, cigarette lighters, permanent markers, correction fluid, and aerosols with propellants used in whipped cream, deodorants, paints, electronic cleaning sprays, and cooking sprays. Many inhalants or solvents that can be abused are readily available, easy to purchase, not illegal to possess, easy to conceal, and are found in households. Prosecution of offenders tends to be minimal, and few US states have laws prohibiting inhalant abuse.

  "wikipedia": `# Inhalant
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalant*

Inhalants are a broad range of household and industrial chemicals whose volatile vapors or pressurized gases can be concentrated and breathed in via the nose or mouth to produce intoxication, in a manner not intended by the manufacturer. They are inhaled at room temperature through volatilization (in the case of gasoline or acetone) or from a pressurized container (e.g., nitrous oxide or butane), and do not include drugs that are sniffed after burning or heating.
While a few inhalants are prescribed by medical professionals and used for medical purposes, as in the case of inhaled anesthetics and nitrous oxide (an anxiolytic and pain relief agent prescribed by dentists), this article focuses on inhalant use of household and industrial propellants, glues, fuels, and other products in a manner not intended by the manufacturer, to produce intoxication or other psychoactive effects. These products are used as recreational drugs for their intoxicating effect. According to a 1995 report by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the most serious inhalant use occurs among homeless children and teenagers who "live on the streets completely without family ties." Inhalants are the only substance used more by younger teenagers than by older teenagers. Inhalant users inhale vapor or aerosol propellant gases using plastic bags held over the mouth or by breathing from a solvent-soaked rag or an open container. The practices are known colloquially as "sniffing", "huffing" or "bagging".
The effects of inhalants range from an alcohol-like intoxication and intense euphoria to vivid hallucinations, depending on the substance and the dose. Some inhalant users are injured due to the harmful effects of the solvents or gases or due to other chemicals used in the products that they are inhaling. As with any recreational drug, users can be injured due to dangerous behavior while they are intoxicated, such as driving under the influence. In some cases, users have died from hypoxia (lack of oxygen), pneumonia, heart failure, cardiac arrest, or aspiration of vomit. Brain damage is typically seen with chronic long-term use of solvents as opposed to short-term exposure.
While legal when used as intended, in England, Scotland, and Wales it is illegal to sell inhalants to persons likely to use them as an intoxicant. As of 2017, thirty-seven US states impose criminal penalties on some combination of sale, possession or recreational use of various inhalants. In 15 of these states, such laws apply only to persons under the age of 18.

## Categories

## Medical inhalants

A small number of recreational inhalant drugs are pharmaceutical products that are used illicitly.

Antidote to cyanide poisoning
Alkyl nitrites (poppers)
Inhalational anesthetics used as general anesthetics
Nitrous oxide
Xenon
Historical general anesthetics
Chloroethane
Chloroform
Ether
Medical anesthetics  that have been used as recreational drugs include diethyl ether  (no longer used medically due to  high flammability and  development of safer alternatives) and nitrous oxide,  widely used since the late 20th century by dentists as an anti-anxiety drug and mild anesthetic during dental procedures. The effects of ether intoxication are similar to those of alcohol intoxication, but more potent. Also, due to NMDA antagonism, the user may experience all the psychedelic effects present in classical dissociatives such as ketamine in the forms of thought loops and the feeling of the mind being disconnected from one's body. Nitrous oxide is a dental anesthetic that is used as a recreational drug, either by users who have access to medical-grade gas canisters (e.g., dental hygienists or dentists) or by using the gas contained in whipped cream aerosol containers. Nitrous oxide inhalation can cause pain relief, depersonalization, derealization, dizziness, euphoria, and some sound distortion.

### Recreational use

#### Liquids

##### Alkyl nitrites

Ingestion of alkyl nitrites can cause methemoglobinemia, and by inhalation it has not been ruled out.
The sale of alkyl nitrite-based poppers was banned in Canada in 2013. Although not considered a narcotic and not illegal to possess or use, they are considered a drug. Sales that are not authorized can now be punished with fines and prison. Since 2007, reformulated poppers containing isopropyl nitrite are sold in Europe because only isobutyl nitrite is prohibited. In France, the sale of products containing butyl nitrite, pentyl nitrite, or isomers thereof, has been prohibited since 1990 on grounds of danger to consumers. In 2007, the government extended this prohibition to all alkyl nitrites that were not authorized for sale as drugs. After litigation by sex shop owners, this extension was quashed by the Council of State on the grounds that the government had failed to justify such a blanket prohibition: according to the court, the risks cited, concerning rare accidents often following abnormal usage, rather justified compulsory warnings on the packaging.
In the United Kingdom, poppers are widely available and frequently (legally) sold in gay clubs/bars, sex shops, drug paraphernalia head shops, over the Internet and on markets. It is illegal under Medicines Act 1968 to sell them advertised for human consumption, and to bypass this, they are usually sold as odorizers. In the U.S., originally marketed as a prescription drug in 1937, amyl nitrite remained so until 1960, when the Food and Drug Administration removed the prescription requirement due to its safety record. This requirement was reinstated in 1969, after observation of an increase in recreational use. Other alkyl nitrites were outlawed in the U.S. by Congress through the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. The law includes an exception for commercial purposes. The term commercial purpose is defined to mean any use other than for the production of consumer products containing volatile alkyl nitrites meant for inhaling or otherwise introducing volatile alkyl nitrites into the human body for euphoric or physical effects. The law came into effect in 1990. Visits to retail outlets selling these products reveal that some manufacturers have since reformulated their products to abide by the regulations, through the use of the legal cyclohexyl nitrite as the primary ingredient in their products, which are sold as video head cleaners, polish removers, or room odorants.

#### Gases

##### Nitrous oxide

Nitrous oxide can be categorized as a dissociative drug, as it can cause visual and auditory hallucinations. Anesthetic gases used for surgery, such as nitrous oxide or enflurane, are believed to induce anesthesia primarily by acting as NMDA receptor antagonists, open-channel blockers that bind to the inside of the calcium channels on the outer surface of the neuron, and provide high levels of NMDA receptor blockade for a short period of time.
This makes inhaled anesthetic gases different from other NMDA antagonists, such as ketamine, which bind to a regulatory site on the NMDA-sensitive calcium transporter complex and provide slightly lower levels of NMDA blockade, but for a longer and much more predictable duration. This makes a deeper level of anesthesia achievable more easily using anesthetic gases but can also make them more dangerous than other drugs used for this purpose.
Nitrous oxide is thought to be particularly non-toxic, though heavy long-term use can lead to a variety of serious health problems linked to the destruction of vitamin B12 and folic acid.

In the United States, possession of nitrous oxide is legal under federal law and is not subject to DEA purview. It is, however, regulated by the Food and Drug Administration under the Food Drug and Cosmetics Act; prosecution is possible under its "misbranding" clauses, prohibiting the sale or distribution of nitrous oxide for the purpose of human consumption as a recreational drug. Many states have laws regulating the possession, sale, and distribution of nitrous oxide. Such laws usually ban distribution to minors or limit the amount of nitrous oxide that may be sold without a special license. For example, in the state of California, possession for recreational use is prohibited and qualifies as a misdemeanor. In New Zealand, the Ministry of Health has warned that nitrous oxide is a prescription medicine, and its sale or possession without a prescription is an offense under the Medicines Act. This statement would seemingly prohibit all non-medicinal uses of the chemical, though it is implied that only recreational use will be legally targeted. In India, for general anesthesia purposes, nitrous oxide is available as Nitrous Oxide IP. India's gas cylinder rules (1985) prohibit the transfer of gas from one cylinder to another for breathing purposes. Because India's Food & Drug Authority (FDA-India) rules state that transferring a drug from one container to another (refilling) is equivalent to manufacturing, anyone found doing so must possess a drug manufacturing license.

#### Safety

In contrast, a few inhalants like amyl nitrite and diethyl ether have medical applications and are not toxic in the same sense as solvents, though they can still be dangerous when used recreationally.

## Non-medical inhalants

Ethanol (the alcohol which is normally drunk) is sometimes inhaled.
The ethanol must be converted from liquid into gaseous state (vapor) or aerosol (mist), in some cases using a nebulizer, a machine that agitates the liquid into an aerosol. The sale of nebulizers for inhaling ethanol was banned in some US states due to safety concerns.

## Toxic inhalants

Most inhalant drugs that are used non-medically are ingredients in household or industrial chemical products that are not intended to be concentrated and inhaled.

Hydrocarbon poisoning
Gases
Butane
Propane
Solvents
Gasoline/petrol
Toluene
Liquid/gas mixtures
Freon
Ketones
Solvents
Acetone

### Solvents

A wide range of volatile solvents intended for household or industrial use are inhaled as recreational drugs. This includes petroleum products (gasoline and kerosene), toluene (used in paint thinner, permanent markers, contact cement and model glue), and acetone (used in nail polish remover). These solvents vaporize at room temperature.

Until the early 1990s, the most common solvents that were used for the ink in permanent markers were toluene and xylene. These two substances are both harmful and characterized by a very strong smell. Today, the ink is usually made on the basis of alcohols (e.g. 1-Propanol, 1-butanol, diacetone alcohol and cresols).
Organochlorine solvents are particularly hazardous; many of these are now restricted in developed countries due to their environmental impact.

#### Legality

Even though solvent glue is normally a legal product, there is a 1983 case where a court ruled that supplying glue to children is illegal. Khaliq v HM Advocate was a Scottish criminal case decided by the High Court of Justiciary on appeal, in which it was decided that it was an offense at common law to supply glue-sniffing materials that were otherwise legal in the knowledge that they would be used recreationally by children. Two shopkeepers in Glasgow were arrested and charged for supplying children with "glue-sniffing kits" consisting of a quantity of petroleum-based glue in a plastic bag. They argued there was nothing illegal about the items that they had supplied. On appeal, the High Court took the view that, even though glue and plastic bags might be perfectly legal, everyday items, the two shopkeepers knew perfectly well that the children were going to use the articles as inhalants and the charge on the indictment should stand. When the case came to trial at Glasgow High Court the two were sentenced to three years' imprisonment.
As of 2023, in England, Scotland, and Wales it is illegal to sell inhalants, including solvent glues, to persons of any age likely to use them as an intoxicant. As of 2017, thirty-seven US states impose criminal penalties on some combination of sale, possession or recreational use of various inhalants. In 15 of these states, such laws apply only to persons under the age of 18.

#### Gasoline

Gasoline sniffing can cause lead poisoning, in locations where leaded gas is not banned.

#### Toluene

Toluene can damage myelin.

### Gases

A number of gases intended for household or industrial use are inhaled as recreational drugs. This includes chlorofluorocarbons used in aerosols and propellants (e.g., aerosol hair spray, aerosol deodorant). A gas used as a propellant in whipped cream aerosol containers, nitrous oxide, is used as a recreational drug. Pressurized canisters of propane and butane gas, both of which are intended for use as fuels, are used as inhalants.

#### Legality

"New Jersey... prohibits selling or offering to sell minors products containing chlorofluorocarbon that is used in refrigerant."

### Dangers

Statistics on deaths caused by heavy inhalant use are difficult to determine. It may be severely under-reported because death is often attributed to a discrete event such as a stroke or a heart attack, even if the event happened because of inhalant use. Inhalant use was mentioned on 144 death certificates in Texas during the period 1988–1998 and was reported in 39 deaths in Virginia between 1987 and 1996 from acute voluntary exposure to used inhalants.

#### Chronic solvent-induced encephalopathy

Chronic solvent-induced encephalopathy (CSE) is a condition induced by long-term exposure to organic solvents, often—but not always—in the workplace, that lead to a wide variety of persisting sensorimotor polyneuropathies and neurobehavioral deficits even after solvent exposure has been removed.

#### Sudden sniffing death syndrome

Sudden sniffing death syndrome, first described by Millard Bass in 1970, is commonly known as SSDS.
Solvents have many potential risks in common, including pneumonia, cardiac failure or arrest, and aspiration of vomit. The inhaling of some solvents can cause hearing loss, limb spasms, and damage to the central nervous system and brain. Serious but potentially reversible effects include liver and kidney damage and blood-oxygen depletion. Death from inhalants is generally caused by a very high concentration of fumes. Deliberately inhaling solvents from an attached paper or plastic bag or in a closed area greatly increases the chances of suffocation. Brain damage is typically seen with chronic long-term use as opposed to short-term exposure. Parkinsonism (see: Signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease) has been associated with huffing.

Female inhalant users who are pregnant may have adverse effects on the fetus, and the baby may be smaller when it is born and may need additional health care (similar to those seen with alcohol – fetal alcohol syndrome). There is some evidence of birth defects and disabilities in babies born to women who sniffed solvents such as gasoline.
In the short term, death from solvent use occurs most commonly from aspiration of vomit while unconscious or from a combination of respiratory depression and hypoxia.
Inhaling butane gas can cause drowsiness, unconsciousness, asphyxia, and cardiac arrhythmia. Butane is the most commonly misused volatile solvent in the UK and caused 52% of solvent-related deaths in 2000. When butane is sprayed directly into the throat, the jet of fluid can cool rapidly to −20 °C by adiabatic expansion, causing prolonged laryngospasm.
Some inhalants can also indirectly cause sudden death by cardiac arrest, in a syndrome known as "sudden sniffing death". The anaesthetic gases present in the inhalants appear to sensitize the user to adrenaline and, in this state, a sudden surge of adrenaline (e.g., from a frightening hallucination or run-in with aggressors), may cause fatal cardiac arrhythmia.
Furthermore, the inhalation of any gas that is capable of displacing oxygen in the lungs (especially gases heavier than oxygen) carries the risk of hypoxia as a result of the very mechanism by which breathing is triggered. Since reflexive breathing is prompted by elevated carbon dioxide levels (rather than diminished blood oxygen levels), breathing a concentrated, relatively inert gas (such as computer-duster tetrafluoroethane, helium or nitrous oxide) that removes carbon dioxide from the blood without replacing it with oxygen will produce no outward signs of suffocation even when the brain is experiencing hypoxia. Once full symptoms of hypoxia appear, it may be too late to breathe without assistance, especially if the gas is heavy enough to lodge in the lungs for extended periods. Even completely inert gases, such as argon, can have this effect if oxygen is largely excluded.

### Patterns of use

Inhalant drugs are often used by children, teenagers, incarcerated or institutionalized people, and impoverished people, because these solvents and gases are ingredients in hundreds of legally available, inexpensive products, such as deodorant sprays, hair spray, contact cement and aerosol air fresheners. However, most users tend to be "... adolescents (between the ages of 12 and 17)." In some countries, chronic, heavy inhalant use is concentrated in marginalized, impoverished communities. Young people who become used to heavy amounts of inhalants chronically are also more likely to be those who are isolated from their families and community. The article "Epidemiology of Inhalant Abuse: An International Perspective" notes that "[t]he most serious form of obsession with inhalant use probably occurs in countries other than the United States where young children live on the streets completely without family ties. These groups almost always use inhalants at very high levels (Leal et al. 1978). This isolation can make it harder to keep in touch with the sniffer and encourage him or her to stop sniffing."
The article also states that "... high [inhalant use] rates among barrio Hispanics almost undoubtedly are related to the poverty, lack of opportunity, and social dysfunction that occur in barrios" and states that the "... same general tendency appears for Native-American youth" because "... Indian reservations are among the most disadvantaged environments in the United States; there are high rates of unemployment, little opportunity, and high rates of alcoholism and other health problems." There are a wide range of social problems associated with inhalant use, such as feelings of distress, anxiety and grief for the community; violence and damage to property; violent crime; stresses on the juvenile justice system; and stresses on youth agencies and support services.

#### Africa and Asia

Glue and gasoline (petrol) sniffing is also a problem in parts of Africa, especially with street children. In India and South Asia, three of the most widely used inhalants are the Dendrite brand and other forms of contact adhesives and rubber cement manufactured in Kolkata, and toluenes in paint thinners. Genkem is a brand of glue, which had become the generic name for all the glues used by glue-sniffing children in Africa before the manufacturer replaced n-hexane in its ingredients in 2000.
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has reported that glue sniffing is at the core of "street culture" in Nairobi, Kenya, and that the majority of street children in the city are habitual solvent users. Research conducted by Cottrell-Boyce for the African Journal of Drug and Alcohol Studies found that glue sniffing amongst Kenyan street children was primarily functional – dulling the senses against the hardship of life on the street – but it also provided a link to the support structure of the "street family" as a potent symbol of shared experience.
Similar incidents of glue sniffing among destitute youth in the Philippines have also been reported, most commonly from groups of street children and teenagers collectively known as "Rugby" boys, which were named after a brand of toluene-laden contact cement. Other toluene-containing substances have also been used, most notably the Vulca Seal brand of roof sealants. Bostik Philippines, which currently owns the Rugby and Vulca Seal brands, has since responded to the issue by adding bitterants such as mustard oil to their Rugby line, as well as reformulating it by replacing toluene with xylene. Several other manufacturers have also followed suit.
Another very common inhalant is Erase-X, a correction fluid that contains toluene. It has become very common for school and college students to use it, because it is easily available in stationery shops in India. This fluid is also used by street and working children in Delhi.

#### Europe and North America

In the UK, marginalized youth use a number of inhalants, such as solvents and propellants. In Russia and Eastern Europe, gasoline sniffing became common on Russian ships following attempts to limit the supply of alcohol to ship crews in the 1980s. The documentary Children Underground depicts the huffing of a solvent called Aurolac (a product used in chroming) by Romanian homeless children. During the interwar period, the inhalation of ether (etheromania) was widespread in some regions of Poland, especially in Upper Silesia. Tens of thousands of people were affected by this problem.
In Canada, Native children in the isolated Northern Labrador community of Davis Inlet were the focus of national concern in 1993, when many were found to be sniffing gasoline. The Canadian and provincial Newfoundland and Labrador governments intervened on a number of occasions, sending many children away for treatment. Despite being moved to the new community of Natuashish in 2002, serious inhalant use problems have continued. Similar problems were reported in Sheshatshiu in 2000 and also in Pikangikum First Nation. In 2012, the issue once again made the news media in Canada. In Mexico, the inhaling of a mixture of gasoline and industrial solvents, known locally as "Activo" or "Chemo", has risen in popularity among the homeless and among the street children of Mexico City in the 21st century. The mixture is poured onto a handkerchief and inhaled while held in one's fist.
In the US, ether was used as a recreational drug during the 1930s Prohibition era, when alcohol was made illegal. Ether was either sniffed or drunk and, in some towns, replaced alcohol entirely. However, the risk of death from excessive sedation or overdose is greater than that with alcohol, and ether drinking is associated with damage to the stomach and gastrointestinal tract. Use of glue, paint and gasoline became more common after the 1950s. Model airplane glue-sniffing as problematic behavior among youth was first reported in 1959 and increased in the 1960s. Use of aerosol sprays became more common in the 1980s, as older propellants such as CFCs were phased out and replaced by more environmentally friendly compounds such as propane and butane. Most inhalant solvents and gases are not regulated under drug laws such as the United States Controlled Substances Act. However, many US states and Canadian cities have placed restrictions on the sale of some solvent-containing products to minors, particularly for products widely associated with sniffing, such as model cement. The practice of inhaling such substances is sometimes colloquially referred to as huffing, sniffing (or glue sniffing), dusting, or chroming.

#### Australia

Australia has long faced a petrol (gasoline) sniffing problem in isolated and impoverished aboriginal communities. Although some sources argue that sniffing was introduced by United States servicemen stationed in the nation's Top End during World War II or through experimentation by 1940s-era Cobourg Peninsula sawmill workers, other sources claim that inhalant abuse (such as glue inhalation) emerged in Australia in the late 1960s. Chronic, heavy petrol sniffing appears to occur among remote, impoverished indigenous communities, where the ready accessibility of petrol has helped to make it a common addictive substance.
In Australia, petrol sniffing now occurs widely throughout remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory, Western Australia, northern parts of South Australia, and Queensland. The number of people sniffing petrol goes up and down over time as young people experiment or sniff occasionally. "Boss", or chronic, sniffers may move in and out of communities; they are often responsible for encouraging young people to take it up.
A 1983 survey of 4,165 secondary students in New South Wales showed that solvents and aerosols ranked just after analgesics (e.g., codeine pills) and alcohol for drugs that were inappropriately used. This 1983 study did not find any common usage patterns or social class factors. The causes of death for inhalant users in Australia included pneumonia, cardiac failure/arrest, aspiration of vomit, and burns. In 1985, there were 14 communities in Central Australia reporting young people sniffing. In July 1997, it was estimated that there were around 200 young people sniffing petrol across 10 communities in Central Australia. Approximately 40 were classified as chronic sniffers. There have been reports of young Aboriginal people sniffing petrol in the urban areas around Darwin and Alice Springs.
In 2005, the Government of Australia and BP Australia began the usage of opal fuel in remote areas prone to petrol sniffing. Opal is a non-sniffable fuel (which is much less likely to cause a high) and has made a difference in some indigenous communities.

## Administration and effects

Inhalant users inhale vapors or aerosol propellant gases using plastic bags held over the mouth or by breathing from an open container of solvents, such as gasoline or paint thinner. Nitrous oxide gases from whipped cream aerosol cans, aerosol hairspray or non-stick frying spray are sprayed into plastic bags. Some nitrous oxide users spray the gas into balloons. When inhaling non-stick cooking spray or other aerosol products, some users may filter the aerosolized particles out with a rag. Some gases, such as propane and butane gases, are inhaled directly from the canister. Once these solvents or gases are inhaled, the extensive capillary surface of the lungs rapidly absorbs the solvent or gas, and blood levels peak rapidly. The intoxication effects occur so quickly that the effects of inhalation can resemble the intensity of effects produced by intravenous injection of other psychoactive drugs.
Ethanol is also inhaled, either by vaporizing it by pouring it over dry ice in a narrow container and inhaling with a straw or by pouring alcohol in a corked bottle with a pipe, and then using a bicycle pump to make a spray. Alcohol can be vaporized using a simple container and open-flame heater. Medical devices such as asthma nebulizers and inhalers were also reported as a means of application. The practice gained popularity in 2004, with the marketing of the device dubbed AWOL (Alcohol without liquid), a play on the military term AWOL (Absent Without Leave). AWOL, created by British businessman Dominic Simler, was first introduced in Asia and Europe, and then in the United States in August 2004. AWOL was used by nightclubs, at gatherings and parties, and it garnered attraction as a novelty, as people 'enjoyed passing it around in a group'. AWOL uses a nebulizer, a machine that agitates the liquid into an aerosol. AWOL's official website states that "AWOL and AWOL 1 are powered by Electrical Air Compressors while AWOL 2 and AWOL 3 are powered by electrical oxygen generators", which refer to a couple of mechanisms used by the nebulizer drug delivery device for inhalation. Although the AWOL machine is marketed as having no downsides, such as the lack of calories or hangovers, Amanda Shaffer of Slate describes these claims as "dubious at best". Although inhaled alcohol does reduce the caloric content, the savings are minimal. After expressed safety and health concerns, sale or use of AWOL machines was banned in a number of American states.
The effects of solvent intoxication can vary widely depending on the dose and what type of solvent or gas is inhaled. A person who has inhaled a small amount of rubber cement or paint thinner vapor may be impaired in a manner resembling alcohol inebriation. A person who has inhaled a larger quantity of solvents or gases, or a stronger chemical, may experience stronger effects such as distortion in perceptions of time and space, hallucinations, and emotional disturbances. The effects of inhalant use are also modified by the combined use of inhalants and alcohol or other drugs.
In the short term, many users experience headaches, nausea and vomiting, slurred speech, loss of motor coordination, and wheezing. A characteristic "glue sniffer's rash" around the nose and mouth is sometimes seen after prolonged use. An odor of paint or solvents on clothes, skin, and breath is sometimes a sign of inhalant abuse, and paint or solvent residues can sometimes emerge in sweat.
According to NIH, even a single session of inhalant use "can disrupt heart rhythms and lower oxygen levels", which can lead to death. "Regular abuse can result in serious harm to the brain, heart, kidneys, and liver."

## General risks

Many inhalants are volatile organic chemicals and can catch fire or explode, especially when combined with smoking. As with many other drugs, users may also injure themselves due to loss of coordination or impaired judgment, especially if they attempt to operate machinery.

### Hypoxia

All commonly abused inhalants act as asphyxiant gases, although a common myth is that their primary effects are only due to oxygen deprivation. In reality, the majority of abused inhalants still exhibit psychoactive effects, although oxygen deprivation does add to the notable effects.
Regardless of which inhalant is used, inhaling vapors or gases can lead to injury or death. One major risk is hypoxia (lack of oxygen), which can occur due to inhaling fumes from a plastic bag, or from using proper inhalation mask equipment (e.g., a medical mask for nitrous oxide) but not adding oxygen or room air.

### Frostbite

Another danger is freezing the throat. When a gas that was stored under high pressure is released, it cools abruptly and can cause frostbite if it is inhaled directly from the container. This can occur, for example, with inhaling nitrous oxide. When nitrous oxide is used as an automotive power adder, its cooling effect is used to make the fuel-air charge denser. In a person, this effect is potentially lethal.
The second cause being especially a risk with heavier-than-air vapors such as butane or gasoline vapor. Deaths typically occur from complications related to excessive sedation and vomiting. Actual overdose from the drug does occur, however, and inhaled solvent use is statistically more likely to result in life-threatening respiratory depression than intravenous use of opioids such as heroin. Most deaths from solvent use could be prevented if individuals were resuscitated quickly when they stopped breathing and their airways cleared if they vomited. However, most inhalant use takes place when people inhale solvents by themselves or in groups of people who are intoxicated. Certain solvents are more hazardous than others, such as gasoline.

### Aerosol burn

Use of butane, propane, nitrous oxide and other inhalants can create a risk of freezing burns from contact with the extremely cold liquid. The risk of such contact is greatly increased by the impaired judgement and motor coordination brought on by inhalant intoxication.

### Risks of specific agents

Methylene chloride, after being metabolized, can cause carbon monoxide poisoning.
Carbon tetrachloride can cause significant damage to multiple systems, but its association with liver damage is so strong that it is used in animal models to induce liver injury.
Benzene use can cause bone marrow depression. It is also a known carcinogen.

### Excess NMDA antagonism

Toxicity may also result from the pharmacological properties of the drug; excess NMDA antagonism can completely block calcium influx into neurons and provoke cell death through apoptosis, although this is more likely to be a long-term result of chronic solvent use than a consequence of short-term use.

## Inhalant-related disorders

Inhalant-related disorders are a group of mental health conditions associated with the misuse of volatile substances. These disorders are recognised in both the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), though there are notable differences between the two classification systems.
The DSM-5 identifies four primary types of inhalant-related disorders: inhalant intoxication, inhalant use disorder, inhalant-induced disorders, and unspecified inhalant-related disorder.

Inhalant intoxication refers to acute symptoms resulting from recent inhalant use.
Inhalant use disorder is characterised by a persistent pattern of volatile hydrocarbon use that leads to clinically significant distress or impairment.
Inhalant-induced disorders encompass conditions caused by the toxic effects of inhalant substances and include inhalant intoxication delirium, inhalant-induced psychotic disorder, inhalant-induced anxiety disorder, inhalant-induced depressive disorder, and inhalant-induced major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
Unspecified inhalant-related disorder applies to cases where symptoms linked to inhalant use do not meet the criteria for the other defined categories.
The ICD-11 includes a diagnosis for inhalant withdrawal, which is not covered in the DSM-5.

## In popular culture

### Music and musical culture

One of the early musical references to inhalant use occurs in the 1974 Elton John song "The Bitch Is Back", in the line "I get high in the evening sniffing pots of glue." Inhalant use, especially glue-sniffing, is widely associated with the late-1970s punk youth subculture in the UK and North America. Raymond Cochrane and Douglas Carroll claim that when glue sniffing became widespread in the late 1970s, it was "adopted by punks because public [negative] perceptions of sniffing fitted in with their self-image" as rebels against societal values. While punks at first used inhalants "experimentally and as a cheap high, adult disgust and hostility [to the practice] encouraged punks to use glue sniffing as a way of shocking society." As well, using inhalants was a way of expressing their anti-corporatist DIY (do it yourself) credo; by using inexpensive household products as inhalants, punks did not have to purchase industrially manufactured liquor or beer.

One history of the punk subculture argues that "substance abuse was often referred to in the music and did become synonymous with the genre, glue-sniffing especially" because the youths' "faith in the future had died and that the youth just didn't care anymore" due to the "awareness of the threat of nuclear war and a pervasive sense of doom." In a BBC interview with a person who was a punk in the late 1970s, they said that "there was a real fear of imminent nuclear war—people were sniffing glue knowing that it could kill them, but they didn't care because they believed that very soon everybody would be dead anyway."
A number of 1970s punk rock and 1980s hardcore punk songs refer to inhalant use. The Ramones, an influential early US punk band, referred to inhalant use in several of their songs. The song "Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue" describes adolescent boredom, and the song "Carbona not Glue" states, "My brain is stuck from shooting glue." An influential punk fanzine about the subculture and music took its name (Sniffin' Glue) from the Ramones song. The 1980s punk band The Dead Milkmen wrote a song, "Life is Shit" from their album Beelzebubba, about two friends hallucinating after sniffing glue. Punk-band-turned-hip-hop group the Beastie Boys penned a song "Hold it Now – Hit It", which includes the line "cause I'm beer drinkin, breath stinkin, sniffing glue." Their song "Shake Your Rump" includes the lines, "Should I have another sip no skip it/In the back of the ride and bust with the whippits". Pop punk band Sum 41 wrote a song, "Fat Lip", which refers to a character who does not "make sense from all the gas you be huffing..." The song "Lança-Perfume", written and performed by Brazilian pop star Rita Lee, became a national hit in 1980. The song is about chloroethane and its widespread recreational sale and use during the rise of Brazil's carnivals.
Inhalants are referred to by bands from other genres, including several grunge bands—an early 1990s genre that was influenced by punk rock. The 1990s grunge band Nirvana, which was influenced by punk music, penned a song, "Dumb", in which Kurt Cobain sings "my heart is broke / But I have some glue / help me inhale / And mend it with you". L7, an all-female grunge band, penned a song titled "Scrap" about a skinhead who inhales spray-paint fumes until his mind "starts to gel". Also in the 1990s, the Britpop band Suede had a UK hit with their song "Animal Nitrate" whose title is a thinly veiled reference to amyl nitrite. The Beck song "Fume" from his "Fresh Meat and Old Slabs" release is about inhaling nitrous oxide. Another Beck song, "Cold Ass Fashion", contains the line "O.G. – Original Gluesniffer!" Primus's 1999 song "Lacquer Head" is about adolescents who use inhalants to get high. Hip hop performer Eminem wrote a song, "Bad Meets Evil", which refers to breathing "... ether in three lethal amounts." The Brian Jonestown Massacre, a retro-rock band from the 1990s, has a song, "Hyperventilation", which is about sniffing model-airplane cement. Frank Zappa's song "Teenage Wind" from 1981 has a reference to glue sniffing: "Nothing left to do but get out the 'ol glue; Parents, parents; Sniff it good now..."

### Films

A number of films have depicted or referred to the use of solvent inhalants. In the 1968 film How Sweet It Is!, Grif Henderson (James Garner), refers to him and his young son once making model aeroplanes together, but says, "...now all he wants to do is sniff the glue". The 1980 comedy film Airplane!, the character of McCroskey (Lloyd Bridges) refers to his inhalant use when he states, "I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue." In the 1996 film Citizen Ruth, the character Ruth (Laura Dern), a homeless drifter, is depicted inhaling patio sealant from a paper bag in an alleyway. In the tragicomedy Love Liza, the main character, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, plays a man who takes up building remote-controlled airplanes as a hobby to give him an excuse to sniff the fuel in the wake of his wife's suicide.
Harmony Korine's 1997 Gummo depicts adolescent boys inhaling contact cement for a high. Edet Belzberg's 2001 documentary Children Underground chronicles the lives of Romanian street children addicted to inhaling paint. In The Basketball Diaries, a group of boys is huffing Carbona cleaning liquid at 3 minutes and 27 seconds into the movie; further on, a boy is reading a diary describing the experience of sniffing the cleaning liquid.
In the David Lynch film Blue Velvet, the bizarre and manipulative character played by Dennis Hopper uses a mask to inhale amyl nitrite. In Little Shop of Horrors, Steve Martin's character dies from nitrous oxide inhalation. The 1999 independent film Boys Don't Cry depicts two young low-income women inhaling aerosol computer cleaner (compressed gas) for a buzz. In The Cider House Rules, Michael Caine's character is addicted to inhaling ether vapors.
In Thirteen, the main character, a teen, uses a can of aerosol computer cleaner to get high. In the action movie Shooter, an ex-serviceman on the run from the law (Mark Wahlberg) inhales nitrous oxide gas from a number of Whip-It! whipped cream canisters until he becomes unconscious. The South African film The Wooden Camera also depicts the use of inhalants by one of the main characters, a homeless teen, and their use in terms of socio-economic stratification. The title characters in Samson and Delilah sniff petrol; in Samson's case, possibly causing brain damage.
In the 2004 film Taxi, Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon are trapped in a room with a burst tank containing nitrous oxide. Queen Latifah's character curses at Fallon while they both laugh hysterically. Fallon's character asks if it is possible to die from nitrous oxide, to which Queen Latifah's character responds with "It's laughing gas, stupid!" Neither of them had any side effects other than their voices becoming much deeper while in the room.
In the French horror film Them (2006), a French couple living in Romania are pursued by a gang of street children who break into their home at night. Olivia Bonamy's character is later tortured and forced to inhale aurolac from a silver-colored bag. During a flashback scene in the 2001 film Hannibal, Hannibal Lecter gets Mason Verger high on amyl nitrite poppers, then convinces Verger to cut off his own face and feed it to his dogs.

### Books

The science fiction story "Waterspider" by Philip K. Dick (first published in January 1964 in If magazine) contains a scene in which characters from the future are discussing the culture of the early 1950s. One character says: "You mean he sniffed what they called 'airplane dope'? He was a 'glue-sniffer'?", to which another character replies: "Hardly. That was a mania among adolescents and did not become widespread in fact until a decade later. No, I am speaking about imbibing alcohol."
The book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas describes how the two main characters inhale diethyl ether and amyl nitrite.

### Television

In the comedy series Newman and Baddiel in Pieces, Rob Newman's inhaling gas from a foghorn was a running joke in the series. One episode of the Jeremy Kyle Show featured a woman with a 20-year butane gas addiction. In the series It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Charlie Kelly has an addiction to huffing glue. Additionally, season nine episode 8 shows Dennis, Mac, and Dee getting a can of gasoline to use as a solvent, but instead end up taking turns huffing from the canister.
A 2008 episode of the reality show Intervention (season 5, episode 9) featured Allison, who was addicted to huffing computer duster for the short-lived, psychoactive effects. Allison has since achieved a small but significant cult following among bloggers and YouTube users. Several remixes of scenes from Allison's episode can be found online. Since 2009, Allison has worked with drug and alcohol treatment centers in Los Angeles County. In the seventh episode of the fourteenth season of South Park, Towelie, an anthropomorphic towel, develops an addiction to inhaling computer duster. In the show Squidbillies, the main character Early Cuyler is often seen inhaling gas or other substances.
