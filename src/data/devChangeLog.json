Virtually no clinical history: all human data are anecdotal. Reports of confusion, mania and prolonged delirium at heavy doses. Limited reagent-test data; use full panel to rule out NBOMe / opioid adulterants. Crystal often hygroscopic – store in airtight, light-protected container with desiccant.` → ``"
