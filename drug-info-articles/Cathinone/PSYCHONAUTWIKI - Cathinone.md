**Cathinone** is the naturally occuring stimulating psychoactive substance, active constituent of [khat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Khat) (Catha edullis), a plant whose leaves are chewed on for stimulant effect. Cathinone is closely related in structure to amphetamine, differing solely by a ketone group on the beta carbon. Based on cathinone, a group of chemical psychoactive substances called [substituted cathinones](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinone) was created. Cathinone is a basic [substituted cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinone) , on the basis of which other chemical substances from this group are created (cathinone skeleton). Due to its similar structure to amphetamine, it has similar effects. Cathinones are modeled on amphetamines.
