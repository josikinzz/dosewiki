**Clonidine** (known by the trade names **Catapres** , **Kapvay** , **Nexiclon** , **Clophelin** , and others) is a [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) substance of the [arylaminoimidazoline](/w/index.php?title=Arylaminoimidazoline&action=edit&redlink=1) class. It is primarily used to treat [high blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , but can also be used for a variety of conditions that include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) disorders, tic disorders, [substance withdrawal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drug_withdrawal) , migraine, [diarrhea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diarrhea) , and certain pain conditions.

Developed by Boehringer Ingelheim for its blood pressure effects, clonidine first saw clinical use in 1966. As the first anti-hypertensive agent with a clearly identifiable central site of action, clonidine has been an important pharmacological tool in discovering the role of central α-adrenoceptors in the physiology of central blood pressure regulation.

Clonidine is classified as a centrally acting α 2 [adrenergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Adrenergic) [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) and imidazoline [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) . Its activity on the α 2 receptors in the brainstem inhibits the release of [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) (NE), resulting in decreased sympathetic nervous system tone.

Clonidine has several off-label uses. It has been prescribed to treat psychiatric disorders including stress, sleep disorders, and hyperarousal caused by post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, and other anxiety disorders.

## History and culture

In the early 1960s, the medicinal chemist Helmut Stähle was tasked by Boehringer Ingelheim with synthesizing a peripherally active a-adrenergic compound that would be useful for nasal decongestion as simple nose drops. A locally acting a-adrenergic vasoconstrictor agent was expected to provide relief from the symptoms of the common cold by shrinking the swollen nasal membranes and producing an unobstructed air passage.

The synthetic design of clonidine was achieved when Stähle had the idea of substituting two chlorine groups on the phenyl group of the imidazoline structure, which most of the newer decongestive agents at the time were derived from. At that time, a double halogen substitution was still unusual for pharmaceuticals, and the prevailing opinion was that compounds with several halogen atoms would at best be useful as pesticides. Despite this, clonidine was pursued and discovered to have a remarkably high vasoconstrictive and decongestive effect at an unusually low dosage level.

The decongestive effects were then determined by nasal cavity tests on anesthetized dogs. After the first trial in humans, it became clear that clonidine's decongestant properties were far less interesting than its potent anti-hypertensive effects. The compound was then developed for this new indication and was introduced into therapy in 1966 under the trade name **Catapres** , where it saw widespread use.

With the discovery of clonidine, the central a-adrenergic receptors first became known to chemists, pharmacologists and physicians. It has been an important pharmacological tool in researching the role of central α-adrenoceptors in the physiology of central blood pressure regulation and nervous system function.

In the 2010s, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved clonidine, both alone or with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in pediatric and adult patients. In Australia, clonidine is an accepted but not approved use for ADHD by the TGA.

## Chemistry

Clonidine, or 2-[(2,6-Dichlorophenyl)imino]imidazoline, is a compound of the imidazoline chemical class. Imidazolines are substituted amidines in which the amidine function is incorporated into an imidazoline ring. This portion is connected to an aromatic nucleus by way of a methylene bridge.

Additionally, two chlorine atoms are substituted in the 2- and 6-positions of the phenyl ring. This addition has the critical effect of making the molecule sufficiently lipophilic to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Other compounds of this class include the a-adrenergic agents tolazoline, naphazoline, and phentolamine. The a-adrenergic effects of clonidine and other imidazolidine compounds may be explained on the basis of a structural overlap between clonidine and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) .

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Clonidine is an [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) for the α 2 [adrenergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Adrenaline) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) . When α 2 receptors in the brain are stimulated, peripheral vascular resistance decreases, resulting in lowered blood pressure. It has specificity towards the presynaptic α 2 receptors in the vasomotor center in the brainstem. This binding decreases presynaptic calcium levels and inhibits the release of [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) (NE). The net effect is a decrease in sympathetic nervous system tone.

Three G-protein coupled α2-receptor subtypes have been identified: α 2A , α 2B , and α 2C . Each subtype has a unique pattern of tissue distribution in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. The α2A-receptor is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system; it is found in the locus coeruleus, brain stem nuclei, cerebral cortex, septum, hypothalamus, and hippocampus. α 2A receptors are also expressed in the kidneys, spleen, thymus, lung and salivary glands. The α 2C -receptor is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, including the striatum, olfactory tubercle, hippocampus and cerebral cortex. The α 2B receptor is located primarily in the periphery (kidney, liver, lung and heart). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

The α 2A - and α 2C receptors are located presynaptically and inhibit the released of noradrenaline from sympathetic nerves. Stimulation of these receptors decreases sympathetic tone, resulting in decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. Sedation and analgesia is mediated by centrally located α 2A receptors, while peripheral α 2B receptors mediate constriction of vascular smooth muscle. α 2A receptors also mediate essential components of the analgesic effect of nitrous oxide in the spinal cord. Clonidine stimulates all three α 2 receptor subtypes with similar potency. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Clonidine also has peripheral α 1 agonist activity. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Clonidine is also an agonist for the imidazoline I 1 receptor. This has been proposed to be responsible for the antihypertensive effects.

### Pharmacokinetics

Clonidine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has excellent CNS penetration because of lipid solubility. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Peak plasma concentrations are reached 3-5 hours after a single oral dose. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] No known pharmacologically active metabolites exist. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Plasma half-life is 12-16 hours, with the antihypertensive effects occurring within 30-60 minutes of ingestion. Clonidine is excreted unchanged in the urine and is metabolized by the liver. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Subjective effects

'' ***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.''*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - Clonidine can produce a strong sedative effect, which has been compared to that of [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) . Users can become very tired and sleep through prompts to awake.
- **[Decreased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_heart_rate)** - In normal use as well as overdose, heartrate is lowered and is directly affected by how much is taken.
- **[Decreased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_blood_pressure)** - Clonidine's sympatholytic effects quickly and effectively lower blood pressure. Users should take care to avoid standing up too quickly to avoid an overwhelming light-headedness and possible fainting spell.
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)** - This effect has a low likelihood. Caution should be taken if clonidine is taken with other substances that affect heartbeat. Intense physical activity should be avoided while on this substance.
- **[Dry mouth](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dry_mouth)**
- **[Constipation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Constipation)**
- **[Physical fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue)**
- **[Pupil constriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_constriction)**
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)** - This effect can increase the likelihood of falling and injuring oneself.
- **Raynaud's Phenomenon** - Raynaud's Phenomenon occurs when the spasm of arteries results in reduced blood flow to the extremities, causing a pale tone, tingling, coldness, and numbness. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Addiction suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Addiction_suppression)** - Clonidine has shown efficacy as a treatment for alcohol, opioid, and nicotine substance use disorders. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] It has been shown to block opiate withdrawal symptoms.
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)** - Clonidine has mild to moderate anxiolytic effects and is sometimes used clinically to treat anxiety.
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This effect usually occurs at lower doses which are sometimes prescribed for the treatment of ADHD.
- **[Focus suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_suppression)** - This effect usually occurs at higher doses.
- **[Memory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_enhancement)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_suppression)** - Reports describe this effect as a "hollow" loss of hearing. It is believed to be a result of lowered blood pressure. ### After effects
 
- - **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)** - One can feel very agitated and annoyed, especially with more ease. This especially happens when the medicine is suddenly stopped, which is an incorrect practice; clonidine should be [tapered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tapering) off of the user.
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** - This occurs as a rebound effect to clonidine's antihypertensive effects and is typically only prominent following sustained use.
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** - This occurs as a rebound effect to clonidine's antihypertensive effects and is typically only prominent following sustained use.

## Toxicity and harm potential

At therapeutic doses (0.2-0.9 mg/d), clonidine is commonly associated with adverse effects such as dry mouth, sedation, dizziness, and constipation. While generally safe, at toxic doses clonidine can cause serious cardiopulmonary instability and central nervous system (CNS) depression in children and adults. Caution should be used when clonidine is taken with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) .

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_use) when using this substance.

### Lethal dosage

The oral [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) for clonidine in mice is 206 mg/kg and for rats, 465 mg/kg. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] In humans, lethality is rare with a small number of reported deaths. Morbidity, in terms of cardiorespiratory and CNS dysfunction, generally tends to be more severe in young persons than in adults. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

### Overdose

Symptoms of clonidine overdose include constriction of pupils of the eye, drowsiness, high blood pressure followed by a drop in pressure, irritability, low body temperature, slowed breathing, slowed heartbeat, slowed reflexes, and weakness. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

There are case reports that show [naloxone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Naloxone) may be a useful antidote in treating clonidine overdoses. However, this is not in widespread clinical use.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Clonidine is not addictive and has a low potential for abuse. The chronic use of clonidine can produce physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms if one suddenly stops their usage. Clonidine therapy should generally be gradually tapered when discontinuing therapy to avoid rebound hypertension from occurring.

Although clonidine is not considered to be addictive, cases of misuse have been documented among certain groups with pre-existing substance use disorders. It is sometimes used in combination with [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) to extend and potentiate their effects. This practice may increase the risk of oversedation and respiratory depression associated with opioid use.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Depressants** ( *[1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) , [2M2B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2M2B) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) / [GBL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL) , [methaqualone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methaqualone) , [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids)* ) - This combination potentiates the [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , and [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) caused by one another. At higher doses, it can lead to a sudden, unexpected loss of consciousness along with a dangerous amount of depressed respiration. There is also an increased risk of suffocating on one's vomit while unconscious. If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs before a loss of consciousness, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **Dissociatives** - This combination can unpredictably potentiate the [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) and [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) that can be caused by each other. It may also result in a sudden loss of consciousness accompanied by a dangerous degree of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs before consciousness is lost, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **Stimulants** - Stimulants mask the [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) effect of depressants, which is the main factor most people use to gauge their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant effects wear off, the effects of the depressant will significantly increase, leading to intensified [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) , and dangerous [black-out states](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) . This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if one's fluid intake is not closely monitored. If choosing to combine these substances, one should strictly limit themselves to a pre-set schedule of dosing only a certain amount per hour until a maximum threshold has been reached.
