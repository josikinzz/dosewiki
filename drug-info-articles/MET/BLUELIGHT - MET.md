N-ETHYL-N-METHYLTRYPTAMINE


Does anyone have any experience with this compound?


All I know is that it is orally active.

I]N,N[/I]-MET is *N*-**M**ethyl-*N*-**E**thyl**T**ryptamine is a N,N-DMT homologue.  One atom of carbon is added to N-methyl groups...making for an ethyl group.  N-Methyl-N-Ethyl-Tryptamine.  Thus it lies "between" N,N-DMT and N,N-DET

> **EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY **: This is the simplest tryptamine with the somewhat magical pair of nitrogen substituents, a methyl group and an isopropyl group. Why should this combination allow a molecule to be orally active, even though the conventional thinking is that if there is a methyl group there, the amine oxidases will destroy it? My sense is that it is the N-small-group that does the job in the brain, and it is the N-big-group that keeps the inactivating oxidase enzymes away from the nitrogen atom. This is consistent with the N,N-dimethyl compound (DMT) not being orally active. Lying midway between DMT and DIPT is the ethyl compound, N-ethyl-N-methyltryptamine, or MET. It can be made by adding ethyl acetate to a reaction mixture where the formamide of tryptamine (see under NMT) has been reduced to NMT but there is still a goodly excess of hydride still remaining. The free base, as an oil, shows oral activity in the eighty to one hundred milligram range, so going from a methyl to an ethyl does indeed protect the compound from total enzymatic annihilation when taken orally.

This is no DMT mimick, unlike 4-HO-MET is to 4-HO-DMT.  The ethyl group is serving a purpose here ... it is not just quasi-legal substitute for DMT.  The  oral activity of MET makes it unique.   Sounds like a good candidate for exploration into mostly uncharted territory.

Trial 1:


Insufflated 15 mg MET freebase


I was initially told that this was the HCl salt, but after my first trial, I was informed that it was the freebase ... which may have been why it burned like hell.  After about 5-10 minutes of an agonizing burn, I felt a definite alert.  It quickly escalated to a somewhat DMT-like state.  It was much more than I expected from such a low dose.  I was planning on insufflating a small amount and going to hang out with some friends and maybe have a nice buzz.  Well, that didn't happen.  


I spent about 15 minutes examining the walls in my new apartment, as I had become convinced that they were blue ... they are completely white, but I couldn't convince myself otherwise.  There was also some noticable wave-like motion on all flat surfaces.  Other than that the visuals were not too impressive, but I felt like there was a lot of potential.  It was similar to maybe 10-20 mg DMT smoked, except much more gradual in and out.  My balance and motor skills went downhill pretty quickly, but it wasn't really uncomfortable ... kind of like DMT.  I was somewhat annoyed that I was feeling the effects this strongly, when I wasn't expecting it.  I finally got around to putting on some music, which really helped out.  Overall, the plateau lasted for about 45 minutes, with a gradual decline ending at about 3 and a half hours.  


Now that I know it is a freebase, I may try smoking it next time.  I'm guessing that it would be more like DET smoked since it doesn't get broken down as quickly as DMT.  


Am I right that the HCl salt would burn less insufflated?  I doubt I will try insufflating again, so I guess there's no point in converting it.  And I'm guessing that the freebase will work fine orally, although it seemed pretty caustic when I put it on my tongue.  Maybe capping it would be a good idea.  


I'll write a full report when I take this to interesting level ... this was just an introduction.  ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Wow, great work Dondante.  This sounds like it may hold some promise and I'm glad to see that there are still some that are exploring where few have gone.


How was the headspace? How was the body load?  How did you sleep afterwards? 


Keep up the good work and stay safe.  I look forward to the full report ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png).

> The best comparison would be to that of a very high dose LSD or Psilocybin experience, entering at the peak immediately, rather than waiting for 2-3hrs. The initial DET effect is far stronger than anything experienced with high LSD doses. The initial effects begin within 30secs increasing in strength at a massive rate reaching peak of maximum effect within 5 minutes The 'non-compus stage' (immobile stage - you really dont feel inclined to move much) this part of DET peak lasts around half an hour gradually weakening in effect to the level of a high LSD peak after about an hour. (One could walk relatively easily again). The effect diminished gradually for a further 2-3hrs, fading back to normality and ending with virtually no indication the experience had occured - very clean finish.

I am basing my predictions on MET off of DET experiences.  The pharmacology  of MET should be much more similar to DET than DMT, because of the protection from MAO enzymes, but the effects might lie somewhere between the two.  There's only one way to find out ... except I can't compare it to DET.


I think the body load could be quite strong, as in loss of motor coordination at higher doses, mild vertigo, etc., but I don't expect that it would be too uncomfortable.  The reports in Tihkal on DET range from disappointing to profound and enriching, with the majority being positive.  I have a feeling that MET will be better all around.  


The headspace is hard to define since it was such a low dose and I was kind of annoyed that there was no way I was going to be driving my car to my friend's place.  


As far as sleep, I took it at 9:00 p.m. and was sleeping before 1:00 a.m. ... and normally I have trouble getting to sleep after taking psychedelics.

Mods, can we make this a 'little and dandy MET thread"?


So I've obtained a sample preported to be MET.  It has not been through any analysis, but it seems a reliable source.


Unlike DMT, DPT, alpha-MT, and DiPT...this one does not have any of the indole smell.  Neither does MiPT.  Any reason the asymetrical nature of these two molecules would hinder any odor?

No smell?No way!MIPT and MET as base smell clearly "indolic".The MET I have is the fumarat salt, wonderful crystals and has no smell.Guess you have a salt as well.I think the freebase is not easy to crystallize.

Yup...  all the freebase tryptamine compounds I've worked with stunk, but all the salts were scentless, with the exception of 5-MeO-Ts and 4-AcO-Ts (never smelled much either way).

Maybe the company made a new batch / decided to make it a salt form now or if from a different source did make it into a salt.  


DonDante does yours smell?


Yes it would be very interesting to smoke some, if 15mg snorted did that then maybe its much more potent smoked than say DMT.

I'll do a rough MP analysis when I get the chance.  Assuming it's MET, I can easily tell if it's the salt (MP: around 170 deg C) or freebase (MP: 50-60 deg C) by seeing if the substance melts in boiling water.  I'll see if I can do that today.


Oh, and there's no strong odor.

I would have to agree that DMT smells quite a bit different, as compared to the other tryptamines.  It almost smells incense-like.  Actually, it smells the same way that 5-MeO-DMT tastes...while 5-MeO-DMT has little odor.


In a few weeks, I hope to learn if this "MET" is authentic.  The problem is having a reference standard to compare with.  Though he thinks he will be able to figure it out.  Hugo, do you have the specs for MET?  THis would speed up the process.

GUYS!.................Damnit. This is just like DMT except it has a methyl and an ethyl group instead of two methyls. You don't need to go slack jawed, googly-eyed, and drooling when you see something a tiny bit different. Use some sense! MAO does not break it down so it can be taken orally. With the suggestion of the old Shulger start at maybe 90mg. Smoking dosages are obviously much lower. Start at perhaps 20mg to be on the safe side, unless you want to make it your last trip eva!

I didn't mean I was going to put it in water.  I just meant I was going to heat it to 100 deg C from the heat of boiling water.  I finally got around to doing this simple test and it melted easily so it's definitely MET freebase.  


I was planning on taking 80 mg MET freebase yesterday, but decided to go with 170 mg Ketamine for my first time with that substance instead ... very interesting drug.  I wouldn't call it enjoyable, but definitely interesting.   


BTW, MET is the black monolith goddamnit! ![:X](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/mad.gif)  I want to try it at a full dose, but for some reason it's intimidating.  I'll get around to it sometime.  I just need more free time.

For most of tryptamines without 5-meo and 4-ho group, best ingestion I think way is IM injection. I believe im'ed MET should work perfectly.

Like MiPT, MET does not smell.  Perhaps the asymetrical ones don't.  Anyone remember an odor with EIPT?

Agreed.  Then again, DiPT was best orally.  I'm going to try MET orally first...it is nice to have a tryptamine last less than 4 hours.

Says you.  Personally, I find the idea of MET, 5-MeO-MET, and 4-Ho-MET to be far more fascinating that even the grand monolith found near Jupiter.  Maybe you don’t realize the supreme significance of this DMT (Praise Be Upon Him) analogue.  It’s like sex from behind…you just never know if it is supposed to be that color?

Should be very similar to DET in dosage


[http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal03.shtml](http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal03.shtml)


I'd definitely start low though.  Start with 20-30 mg, wait 5 to 10 minutes, and redose.  That first smoked report of DET cracks me up.  I mean really ... WTF?

Personally, I would not assume the dosage is similar to DET. At this point in the game it would be best to nibble slowly up from the bottom. You'd really skew the data if the initial tests included dead dude...

On the other hand, there are a few reports on MET's oral activity and it does seem that 50mg to 100mg is safe.  But make no assumptions.  DPT's oral dose is (for most people) around 200mg.  MiPT's is 20mg-25mg.  DiPT's and DET's is 50mg-100mg.  Definitely be on the safe side and go slow because the activity of other N,N-dialkyltryptamines is all over the place.

^^Well, this advice is coming from someone who has already "nibbled".  It is probably slightly more potent than DET, but as I said, dosages are probably similar (50-100mg oral).  But I do recommend that everyone should "nibble up slowly" as CatfishRivers suggests.

Is there any indication that this will be a complete mind blowing psychedelic like DMT or DPT, or is it just too soon to tell? Im just waiting on some more reports to come in on what exactly this will be like. Ive always wanted to try one of these i.e. DMT or DPT, but DPT is just too expensive, and I want a little more education in Chemistry before I go ahead and perform an extraction on MHRB. 

I also dont really want to waste my money if it turns out to be one of the DIPTs or the MIPTs.

I didn't get to a +3 with my 80mg trial,but the stuff is quite active and in no way comparable to the "hollow" MIPT.No one else tried it yet?

I had MIPT only twice,at 15mg and 26mg.MGS,you said you had the feeling that you missed something,thats the best words describing it.There was some stimulation/speedyness and yet I felt a bit drunken.Visually,not much to report.A body high ala a low dose Moxy was present but on the other hand it was "clearly antierotic".


The higher dose proved to be more psychedelic,colors were enhanced (yellow green and blue) but objects didn't move as they usually do on trypt's.On the whole it was a rather hollow experience but it didn't seem because of a too low dose.Either it is crap or it needs learning.I will try this higher someday,erowid has some reports up to 40mg I think but it didn't sound more intense.Strange stuff.Isopropyl seems to abolish certain properties in the tryptamin series (and not add always something new),I mean MET has only 1 CH2 less and is quite the stuff.


Can the empty shallow nothingness be intensified?And what will be the result,deeper nothingness or less of it?

10mgs was mild but noticable. Runs like crazy on foil, so I missed some of it. Alot like a threshold dose of DMT. A higher dose looks like it will be very interesting, but I've been up a couple days on meth. I'll try 50mg next time, but right now it's xanax, bud and bed.

invest in a decent oil pipe first.  check with a local head shop, if they don't have them out they'll probably have them hidden somewhere.  they're usually only $5-10.

I've got two fellow psychonauts that are planning on trying MET with me tonight.  I'll post some results tomorrow.


Edit (later tonight):


Well, I ingested 90 mg MET freebase.  Then at +1:15, still not feeling too much other than a euphoric body high (maybe a ++), smoked an estimated 50 mg.  This stuff is kind of tricky to smoke, because you have to inhale slowly and 50 mg is a lot of smoke.  After 3 good hits out of a freebase pipe, it felt quite a bit like DMT.  It hit almost immediately and was very visual.  I smoked another 20 mg at T+1:45.  For the next 2 hours I felt pretty stoned, but with some slowly declining visual activity, and a greatly enhanced appreciation for music (Flaming Lips!).  It was never mindblowing, but interesting nonetheless.  I don't want to pass judgement on this substance, so I'll leave it at this for now.


I'd like to try IMing this substance in the future.


Here's a link to my report:

I also tried MET at something like 50mgs, without the oral dose. This did not seem to make much difference on the affects smoked, as my results were quite similar to Dondante's. The CEVs were truely amazing. I have little dought DMT type hyperspace is possible with MET, wish I had more. IM injection may be the way to go, MET is tricky to smoke, harsh, and tastes terrible.

No anxiety whatsoever ... some ego loss, but I didn't take it nearly as far as I could have.


It would take some serious work, but I think this stuff would really shine if you smoked ~60+ mg in quick succession.

this is really starting to sound like an interesting chem to try. I would like to try a DMT like chem like DPT. 5meo-DMT sounds just to earth shattering, with out the CEV patterns I love so much. DPT sounds a little weird from TIHKAL, and some reports, namely Morninggloryseeds. I think I want to wait till I take a little more Chem until I try a extract. MET sounds like it could be a good DMT CEV ish trip. Im just a little worried about the mind fuck/anxiety component as this is my biggest issue with tripping.

No anxiety at all, and no nausea, unlike say 5meo-dmt, which gives me plenty of both. Ego loss with eyes closed, completely lost in the visuals, but when I opened them I came back to reality, although that isn't exactly the right word. Definately plan to explore this one at higher doses.

i have been reading this THREAD and have been geting more nd more interested in this chemical.

someone mentioned earlier about IM'ing MET.

i think this would be a good way to administer this chem. IV IM or smoking probably are the best.

I will probably test this chemical out in the next week.

any sugesstions of a dose to start with IM met?

I have IM DPT doses ranging from 40-80-mg, and have IV DPT at 18mg.

also have IM and IV many many other substances.

I just want to try to find a good starting dose for MET.

I enjo yIM administration because it hits you really hard , but not as fast as IV.

If no one has any good ideas about dosage i will start medium and work my way up.

hopefully i will have a report in this week.


peace

So few people have tried this that I think no advice can be given. Except that start low, instead of "medium". If you're going to IV / IM it all. Perhaps you shouldn't, I don't know.

I would IM no more than 40 mg for your first time.  Actually, I'd probably start with 30 mg and maybe get another ready to go in case it doesn't do the trick.  Maybe 80 mg will turn out to be ideal, but there's so little info on this one that it would be extremely irresponsible to start that high.

I tried MET for the first time today.  I started with 30mg's and then moved up to around 50mg's, maybe a little more.  


30mg's produced a very nice, DMTish type experience. Visuals were more intense than expected, with tracers and patterns along with some interesting CEV's.  Pretty much identical to DMT in duration.  


After I was pretty much down from the first dose, I smoked 50mg's (perhaps a tad bit more).  It was somewhat difficult to inhale all of the smoke, and I was basically so spun that I had to lay the pipe down with a bit of residue still left in the pipe.  


I must say, this was an intense experience.  The first alerts reminded me a little bit of 5-meo-dmt.  I had intense energy rushes throughout my body and my head felt like it was spinning as I came up.  I then leveled off and must say that I enjoyed the holy hell out of myself!!  Spectral patterns, geometrical creepy crawling type visuals along with colorful CEV's.  I know about the tolerance issues with repeated DMT smoking but I didn't notice much.  It's hard quantify how much more intense 50mg's was than 30mg's, but it felt like double the intensity.  


It's now been about 2 hours since the second dose and I am completely down and have been for sometime.  Short, swift and sweet...just the way I like it. This one is special, at least in my eyes!

Okay I did have a bout of anxiety during the come-up when I smoked the second dose of 50mg's.  As I said before the come-up reminded me a bit of 5-Meo-DMT.  The anxiety stemmed from the super fast onset I believe, and within 30 seconds it was gone completely and I then leveled off into a very nice place.   Oh yeah, smoking is the only way to go IMO.  


I can't wait to step it up a notch... %)

so boywonder, when you say your first 30mg dose, I assume you mean this one was smoked aswell?


I'm very interested in this chem and hope to try it soon.  But, the dosages are still too unknown for me to want to venture (granted, I like playing the guinea pig), I just don't want to pay the prices i'm being charged on such a small quantity, that might be less than a single dose :/

Interesting thread everyone.  I was wondering if anyone will be trying an oral dose with an MAO-i, AKA "huasca" style?


Another thing, my experinces with the basic tryptamines like DPT have led me to believe that tolerances can be high when other 5HT2a chems have been consumed in the recent past.  When reporting experiences, it would be nice to know your recent past trips for probably the last month.  That could help in fudging the numbers a bit, making it easier to come to a concensus regarding the active doses of MET.

But the good thing about this molecule is that it is basically orally-active DMT. The MAOI isn't necessary. Not saying it would be a bad thing, just not necessary.

It may not be necessary just like it is not necessary for DPT.  However, mono-amines aren't either totally broken down or not affected at all by an MAO-i.  Rather, they would be broken down at different rates.  An effective dose of a chemical is one that is absorbed by your body at a quicker rate than

MAO can metabolise.  By adding a MAO-i, you should be able to lower the effective dose or any route of administration.


This is my current understanding.

Yep it was smoked as well.  See I really don't have any desire to even try another method of administration.  Vaporization gives me an intense experience with super fast onset and quick comedown which is just the way I like it.  I think I'll be trying 75mg's next time.  If I can get it all vaporized and inhaled that is.  Even at 50mg's it was quite a bit of smoke...

Yeah, with having such a quick onset, and being a relitively high quantity to smoke, it's understandable.  Although, I'm also interested in the other routes of administration, namely insufflation, and IM/IV.

Well I certainly wouldn't go as far as saying its orally active DMT ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) hehe.


But yeah, with DPT, i've taken moclobemide (mao-a inhibitor) beforehand and it was MUCH stronger, so i'd guess it would potentiate MET also.


Also with smoking DMT, an maoi beforehand seemed to slow down the comeup time, maybe that would allow you to take a giant rip of MET, hold for a bit.. blow out, take another huge giant rip.. dunno.

The great thing about MET is that you can smoke a little, see how you feel, and decide if you want more.  With DMT, you just have to take a quick hit or two, sit back, and hang on.  The increased length of the MET experience makes it easier to redose and get to the level you desire.  And I didn't notice significant tolerance between doses, so you can try again, and again, and again.  Enjoy.![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

has anyone tried MET in combination with an maoi for improving the effectiveness of oral dosing?  I am interested in trying this and am wondering what doseage would be appropriate to start with.  Of course starting low is a must especially with this kind of combo but i was just wondering if anyone had any insight or had tried it yet.  i have tried this before with syrian rue and mushrooms and it was very effective.  any imput would be great.

I suppose I'll report back in a few days maybe, tomarrow if school doesnt kick my ass.

wish me luck! 


I only have 100mg, so do you think 10mg increments is good in like a one every 5 minute time frame or should I do like 15 or 20?

MET + maoi is definitely a promising candidate.  This might actually be the best option in the long run, especially for people who don't like inhaling acrid smoke.  Dosages should be worked up very slowly with this combo.  


A while ago I tried to dissolve MET just to see if I could prep a sol'n for IM.  It wouldn't dissolve at all, even after adding copious amounts of HCL.  So I tried heating it and it oiled out without dissolving a bit.  Needless to say I gave up on that idea.  I don't have any experience with preparing a solution for injection, so maybe I just was doing something wrong.


Edit:  Beenhead, I suggest just putting 50 mg in the pipe and smoking it slowly.  I think it would be too much work to reload after every 10 - 20 mg.  Trust me, one hit is not going to be "too much."

You'll probably be hard pressed to get a HCl of this (follow Shulgin with DMT; dissolve the base in dilute aqueous HCl, and neutralize this with base to achieve an end pH of appropriate 6).  But you'll probably find fumaric acid much easier.  Alternatively, you could use castor or sesame or some other thin, sterile oil with a filter for an IM injection of the base.

One day soon I'll add my input to this.  4-AcO-DMT and MET are the next on my list, for sure.  Probably the AcO first.


On a related note, do you think significant tolerance issues would come into play if I dosed the AcO one night, and then the next time experimented with smoked MET?

Probably.  You know better.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Trips must be spaced out.  Even if a physical tolerance is not an issue, mentally tripping two days in a row is not conducive for getting the most from each experience.

You could always smoke MET after enjoying the first 4-5 hours of 4-aco-dmt ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) ... I didn't recommend this.

^so how did it go beenhead.

The comparison to DMT really makes me interested in this.


Church, in one the posts above you said this is basically orally active DMT.

What do you mean by this? Eating MET feels like ayahuasca? And what dose would you recomend for oral dosing?

Of course mental tolerance is a factor but with certain combinations I find that "piggybacking" one substance on the tail end of another can sometimes add to the profundity and sometimes help to make some sense of the previous experience.  For example, when I recently tried an LSD/ 2C-B combo, and then the next morning took a low dose of DOC, which tied the whole thing together perfectly.

Sorry... I should clarify. I kinda thought that I should go back and edit that, because I dont want people to take that TOO seriously... it's just that I was told by some people who study this stuff that something about the molecular structure is very similar to DMT, only it allows the chemical to be active orally. I have personally never used this chemical before, so I can't give you any personal stories, but it does seem from people's reports that it is very similar to dmt.


But I hereby clarify that statement, by saying "reportedly, this drug feels a lot like DMT, but is orally active without the use of an MAOI."


I am not a chemist though, so I don't want to give people the impression that I am speaking from that perspective. I was just making an anecdotal claim.

The extra carbon does allow this chemical to be orally active.  Beyond that, I don't know of any study or test that compares MET to DMT.  The subjective effects of MET don't sound exactly like DMT to me.  There is no way to compare orally consumed DMT with MET because DMT is not orally active without an MAOI...which alters the psychopharmacology of the substance.  The smoked reports seem to suggest this drug is interchangable with DMT either.  No entity reports yet. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  They do look pretty nice next to each other though.

I ressurect this terrific thread to say that I finally got around to trying this one out. I havent done DMT or DPT, DET...., so I decided to go slow with only 22mgs at first. I  must say I was suprised to where I got. A mild +2 with fairly pronounced open eye distortion and some fairly mild CEV. The thing that I liked the most was the rush I got right after exhaled. Felt pretty damn good. I was supposed to do 2C-E with some friends tomarrow, but I am considering giving this a go at around 50mg. I'll get back saturday.

All I can say now is it has a hell of a euphoric compontent, in the low dose. And the rush was very nice, makes me less fearful of DMT. I believe Im going to hit 50 mgs next week end. The more complete dose will warrant a complete report though!

Having tried DMT a few times recently, I can say that you shouldn't fear it.  It, too, has quite a euphoric component.  I haven't broken through yet, but I have to say it's the most pleasant and natural-feeling psychedelic I've yet ingested, with the least potential for fear.  Except for ketamine, which destroys the ability to feel fear at its root.


But your post reminds me that I've got a sample to try of MET.  I may do so this weekend.

Ive been waiting to hear what thought of MET Xoroth so Hurry up will ya! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I am actually hoping that my MET experiences will be a good stepping stone to get to DMT with out being completely overwhelmed at the unfamiliarity with the space. It is (MET) a very good psychedelic and Ive been wondering why not many of us have jumped on it. Also, I dont remember if I said this but the low dose had some wicked Audia Hallucinations. The crazy psychedelic sounds that are impossible for me to describe!

I think I'll be giving this one a go in the next month or so.  But I plan to convert some of it from the freebase, to the hcl salt, for IM injection.


When I finally get around to it, I'll report on some smoked dosages (of the freebase), and probably some other methods for the hcl (insufflation and IM mostly).  Any ideas on the best starting dosages for IM?  And what's a good amount of saline solution to dissolve the said amount of hcl in?  I'm not too familier with IM, but I imagine you don't want to go and inject 10ml of basically water into your muscle.

This one interests me...


I hardly use psychedelics anymore, but expect a report on this one from me sometime soon ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

This is one hell of a substance here.

After having tried it i understand where all the comparisons to DMT come from.

I only had a low dose (~25-30mg) and didnt even finish the bowl but was feeling some very nice effects.

The body high at my dose reminded me of opiates in that it was really relaxing and euphoric. The mind trip felt like 5 meo dmt for the first 10 seconds or so  untill the rsh wore off. During the rush i felt a pressure on my temples that always get when smoking 5 meo dmt and the speed of onset and intesity of onset was similar to 5 meo dmt aswell.

After the rush passed the nature of the trip changed entirely. I was very happy, giggel. the visuals were mild but present; everything became a bit fluid and ofcourse the colors became mush brighter.


A friend of mine tried around 45-50mg (i put 34mg into the bowl but there was alot of MET left over from the previous person). He had a "breakthrough" trip.  From what he said it reminded him of a very intense acid trip, he compared it to eating a ten strip. He said he was scared the entire time, had death visions etc. He also said it was very visual, with rainbows everywhere and things constantly bending in on him (he was lying on the floor).

He snapped out of that state 10 minutes later. He also claimed that the comedown made him euphoric. He was completely down by 1 hour later.


So this definetly looks like a keeper.

Very enjoyable substance and definetly has the potential to get quite powerful.


well thats about itl

I forgot to add that everyone who had smoked the MET also smoked opium before hand and that might have had an effect on the trip (though for some reason i doubt it had much of an effect)


oh, low doses seem to get rid of headaches very well.


Cant wait to try this one orally.

I might have said this before, but I think this one should be tried with a low dose MAOI orally.  90 mg oral on its own got me to a +.  I'd start much lower with an MAOI, but I think it could make an interesting or maybe even excellent variation on pharmahuasca.

An old aquantience maintained that if mixed into OJ and drank on an empty stomach, DPT hcl worked for him orally...even at just 75mg orally.  Yes, that is with no MAOI.


Most people (when it even works) need 150mg or more to get DPT to work by mouth.


I've not tried this (taking DPT or MET disolved in OJ) myself, but since oral DPT (sans MAOI) and MET are *on the list*, I do plan on consuming them that way.  If one is to try MET orally, I'd recommend it be taken in OJ.

Orally just doesnt seem to be as effective economically. That would consume a whole sample. Id reather break it up into 50mgs working up to find a good dose. And im also interested in smoking right now since I have never Vaporized psychedelics before. (Except MET)

^I understand your logic as that is the reason I haven't ordered any myself (yet).


I also know that I myself, after trying DMT with an MAOi, and insufflating the freebase, would never want to smoke it again.


Smoking it, to me, is fluff; eating it, to me, is where the experience is.


I was made very curious by Dondante's report of insufflation (MET 15mg if I remember correct), as it seems that not much more than 30 to 50mg may produce significant results, but I've seen no more reports.

I'd rather experience a material to its "fullest" that fret about the cost.  On the other hand, there isn't enough information on MET to really say that the oral route is better than other routes...quite simply because so few people are trying it orally.


I don't have much MET, but I've got enough that I can spare 100mg or so for a  good oral dose.  I don't know if I will eat it first (as opposed to IM which is the other way I will try) but I will definitely give it (MET orally) a shot (no pun intended) one day.

Still makes me cringe thinking about how badly that burned.  UUggghhh!  I thought I had snorted NaOH ... okay maybe that's an exaggeration.   It felt like a damn corrosive chemical though.  It burned my tongue too, but I capped it for the oral dose so the stomach acids took care of it fine.  I would not insufflate this compound unless you convert it to a salt first.

15mg make me feel a little lightheaded.


25mg + a little residue from the 15 produced a sort of meditative state (not sure how else to describe it). I curled up in a ball under a blanket with my eyes closed and spaced out pretty hard, but not much happened.


Everything the vapor touched kind of stung and went number for a few minutes. It was pretty rough on my throat/lungs.

People's descriptions of similarities with threshold DMT here remind me very much of my threshold dose with Yagé produced something that sounds similar... a very meditative state without much psychedellia. Same goes to threshold DPT, although DPT has non-negligible stimulation at any dose. 


I am very close to MET rectally. I am just uncertain whether it will be absorbed or not as freebase. I *think* I once took freebase AMT rectally and it worked, but I actually don't remember :S. 


Any input on the efficacy of anything-freebase rectally?

Cheers!


I'll be trying this as soon as my mood clears up from friday's methylone mishap (I am not very afraid of short-acting psychedelics, mood-wise). 


Since I have seen only good things from all non-substituted N,N-somethingtryptamines I tried, I have high hopes for this one!


Will post results here..

My one threshold DMT experience did brighten my mood, yes.


DPT - I can rely on if all else fails ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Low doses of LSD make a great antidepressant due to such doses having a different pharmacology. There is a research about that too, but I cant dig it up for the life of me.

Oral DMT changes lives (IMO). To this day the sun still seems brighter. It would not be a bad thing if MET contained that kind of magic.

Edit (reread post, your conclusion answers my question).


That is too bad, so the cost::effect; dose::response may never resolve itself comfortably here, in regards to oral use.


Regardless, anyone who enjoys DMT, please do yourself a favor and try it Orally with an MAOi or insufflate the freebase (which does work, and burns like hell awkening inside your face, without an MAOi).

I took freebase AMT rectally a few times, but it was always as a booster so I can't be sure it worked.  But I do believe it worked.


Unfortunately I can't comment on MET.  I really should try out that sample.

Strange, I don't know why there's a lack of potentiation here either.  The 4-XXX-T freebases I've plugged usually fall somewhere around 150% of the dose it would oral.  Ah well.

Well when you (or anyone else) gets around to trying it... Keep your fucking tongue away from the stream of vapor!


Damn its nasty. It felt like the stuff was caustic. Everywhere it touched it burned and made me go numb. This dissipated a minute or two after putting the pipe down, but at first it really felt like I'd chemically burned myself. My throat was like that too, but I couldn't feel it as much as on my tongue.

I don't know. I didn't test it.  


The feeling went away after 1-2min (not real sure of the time, as I was affected a little at this point). I suffered no ill effect after this point.. no soreness, no burns or anything. I could taste everything normally.

just tried it in the 35mg range, It was nice if I had to make a comparison I would say it felt like a cross between Salvia and DMT. I will try it again worthwhile a good learning tool. My only disapointment was that it was not as colorful DMT, and its tough to get that taste out of your mouth.

Good luck trying to smoke 50mg of this stuff. Its pretty hard for me to smoke all the material... it just keeps going and going. I haven't tried more than 30mg in one sitting because it gets to the point where I just can't take another hit of the stuff.

Yeah, I burnt the shit out of the back of my throat trying that for the 1st time.  Much harsher than DMT.  I agree it felt  caustic, particularly in the nose. Ouch!


MET + MAOI ... said it before and I'll say it again.  I sure as hell will never try to insufflate this stuff again, and will probably never vaporize it either.  MET-huasca!  Someday I'll get around to it.

Looks like I'll be sticking to the oral route when I get around to trying this.  Actually, with the exception of 5-MeO-DMT...I "believe" psychedelics were "meant" to be taken orally anyway so I'll stick with what works best.

Has anybody IM’d this yet (I’ve only seen it mentioned as probably the best route overall as well as speculation about dosing but don’t recall experiences)?  I can get the hydrochloride and am interested in dosage ranges before I buy/try.  Oral seems wasteful (though maybe not with an maoi), insufflation seems painful, and the general conscientious on smoking the freebase seems to be that it is difficult.  MET (along with 4-AcO-DMT) is on the surface at least, about the most interesting “RC” ever made available.  Someone brave and already holding please give it a chance at its full potential (IM or oral w/maoi) and report back.

I will most likely try MET via IM injection, after I try it orally.  Knowing me though it would probably be a long while until I get to either one.  Those PEAs always take priority.

This drug seems to have jumped into and then right out of the radar, perhaps due to the reported difficulty of vaporising a sufficient dose.  Are there any further thoughts/experiences - particularly with oral delivery?

smoked... sprinkled a little into a joint. Subtle but real. But the nastiest of tastes, yuk!  Later added a few mg's of 4-meO-Mipt into another joint and the combo is euphoric!! Subtle but euphoric. I was reminded of the silly smoked DPT mindstate (DPT at threshold levels).


I dunno what to make of this MET yet - it really tastes so bad when smoked.

30mg in a vapor pipe did not taste any worse than DPT and had a similar onset and duration, though the peak takes a little longer to reach its apex - not like the instant onset of smoked DMT or 5meoDMT. Visuals were more subdued than DMT, though this dose is still low for this compound. Eyes closed, the imagery with rich and unique in character compared to the CEVs experienced with other tryptamines. There was a mild sensual aspect like DPT, but without any of the strong stimulation. It is difficult to acheive the full entheogenic potential of this material with vaporization, but it is promising as a pharmahuasca admixture and worth the effort if nothing else because the effects are unique and so far the material is very friendly.

Perhaps the general will try at some point. If it converts to a salt easily on microscale, it might be worth IM administration too. 

I'll share when either is attempted. Thanks for the welcome.

Any IM reports on this substance?

I would choose this route when I try MET.

I always IM DPT. 

any comparisons with IM MET to DPT?

I smoked 50mg of the freebase. It takes SLIGHTLY longer to come on (60 seconds  rather than 30 seconds) but it lasts more like 30 minutes rather than 15 minutes of DMT. Qualitativly I didn't find it as good as DMT but damn, it's still excellent. Certainly a lot better than ANY of the 5-MeO derivatives (Don't like being sat on by an elephant).

I never understood that.  5-MeO-DMT is nothing but bliss for me.  I find DMT laregly worthless (smoked) but hope IMed MET proves very interesting.  At least as a substitute until I get my hands on DET.


DPT is good medicine, but I prefer other treatments.

**first time MET.**


i have already posted this in the big and dandy MET thread, but unfortunately i got no responses, so i try again by opening a new thread, in the hope that this will cause more feedback.


i want to test MET by freebasing it. do you think this can be done using a volcano vaporiser? is there any chance that it melts, drops down and damages the volcano?


is this a efficient method of administering? or would a classical smoke bubble be better?

Classic bubble would be better....Every surface of the pipe gives a chance for MET to cool and condense to the sides.  Use a short one.  If you use your nice vaporizer, all of the surfaces will be coated in MET.

Don't use a Volcano...  It could just fuck up your $525 piece of equipment, though it MAY work (it would probably waste A LOT).  I would recommend just using a tweak pipe/'insence oil burner'.

i once used a volcano to smoke 5-MeO-DMT, and it worked very well, that's why I was thinking about using one for MET again. unfortunately I cannot say how efficient it was, since we were eyeballing back then).

i measured 30 mg MET freebase and gave them in my new smoking bubble. since i never consumed any substance this way before, i had my trouble freebasing it: after heating, it melted, and then vaporised, but while doing so, the liquid MET seemed to run away from my lighter. thats why i only inhaled maybe the half or so of the substance, but this already gave me a distinct effect, which was very distinct from my usual tryptamine-tryps: there were no mayor visuals, but the outher world seemed completely abstract to me. very hard to explain, but a very distinct headspace. this lasted about ten minutes, after which i felt somehow stoned. i smoked marijuana afterwards, so i can't say how long this lasted. i also tried to vaporise the leftovers in several small hits afterwards, which gave me little effects again.

I founf the effects of smoked MET to feell like a strange combination of DMT and Salvia. The girl I shared it withhad a much stronger reation to it than I did. For her it brought back hallucination/memories from her childhood back in Italy, stuff she had repressed. Overall though she said it was worthwhile and very thereputic.

I have a hunch that MET will be quite effective via IM injection assuming that it shares similar pharmacokinetics with DPT, which I believe it does.  90 mg oral MET did very little for me, but I'd guess that it shares the poor/unpredictable GI availability with DPT (90 mg DPT orally would also do very little).  It's possible that 200-250 mg MET oral would do the trick, but that seems wasteful when 50 mg IM would be plenty sufficient. 


MAOI would do the trick as well.

Although serotonergics are off-limits for me at the moment, an IM shot of MET (30mg, perhaps?) is probably the first thing I'll be doing if I ever get back into the mood.


I would not risk it with MAOIs, even though I imagine it shouldn't be too much of a problem. Its just that I prefer not to use MAOIs unless absolutely necessary.

Someone told me MET should be more potent via IM than DPT due to increased lipid solubility.

Actually, if anything, I'd expect DPT to have increased lipid solubility because of the elongated alkyl chains.  


I tried 25 mg MET IM this weekend 2.5 hr after 14 mg 4-ho-dmt oral.  Frankly, it reminded me a little too much of DPT, which I intend to avoid for a good while after my recent humbling IM experience.  It's not that I dislike DPT, rather I have immense respect for the substance.  


25 mg MET was manageable and seemed to fade completely into the background after about 2 hours.  When DPT resemblance started to manifest, I began to feel the same DPT-associated fear, albeit on a much smaller scale.  30 minutes after the MET, I insufflated 10 mg ketamine, which actually seemed to help sort out my thoughts and aid in relaxation.  


Previous trials with smoked MET were much different, but that is at least in part due to the 4-ho-dmt that was in my system.  Nonetheless, I believe IM MET can provide more of a full on experience than smoked.  With smoking, aside from the burn, it's an all-around pleasant experience.  I know the confounding factors don't make this information very useful, but I figured I'd post it anyway.  The trip turned out to be absolutely wonderful overall.  I led two close friends through their first trips (4-ho-dmt), which they enjoyed immensely.

Has anybody other than Dondante IMed this substance?


Dondante, would you say 25mg got you to a ++?


If one had 80mg of this, one might try for a 30mg shot and then some weeks later go for a 50mg. Or perhaps combine the 50mg with MAOI. Oh, only if one had more of this substance.


Like MGS this person longs for DET as well!!! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Yeah I have a really good feeling about DET.   Plus, ethyls work so nice on LSD and 2C-E...it has to be a good one.

My woman's intuition tells me DET is less taxing on the mind as compared to DPT, and far more visual....lots of sky blues.  I can't get a feel for MET...I can't wait to try it and see what it is about.  I was going to try oral dosing, but the reports just don't sound that great.  So will go the IM route.  I'll bet 30mg will hit the spot.

^^ Yeah, I also feel like DET will produce lots of blues.  It's probably from the Erowid report entitled something like "Electric blue veins extended into the night" or whatever it's called.

Anyone else tried this substance? There hasn't been much conclusive information on it, even though most people who have tried it find it promising at least.


I have gone through almost 500mg via the smoking route, the highest I've gone is probably in the 30-40mg range (I tend to not weigh the doses out but rather load the pipe and take a few hits until I feel I'm at the desired level).


The effects have been quite interesting, although sometimes quite flooring even when not overly intense when compared to some other substances. However, I account that to the smoking route (haven't gotten to try DMT yet, so I have nothing to compare it with). This substance produces quite unique visuals for me, strong psilocybin-like auditory distortions, and decent mental effects. I haven't managed to break through with it yet (which is not surprising, as many people seem to report having difficulties with smoking high enough amounts to break through with this substance), but at times felt that I'm close.


The timeline of smoked MET seems to be somewhat longer than that of DMT. You can feel initial effects right away, but it takes a minute or so to reach peak effects. The plateau lasts for around an hour, and it's a slow decline back to baseline from there. I usually find it difficult to fall asleep until around the 2.5 or 3 hour mark.


I don't find the taste half as bad as many people make it sound, in fact the aftertaste can be quite pleasant at times (it's, I dunno, kinda nutty flavour I guess?), though often I find hard to force myself to light it after loading the pipe. It has something to do with the chemical taste I guess, I can't imagine DMT tasting a lot more pleasant.


All in all, a decent chemical, and I'm somewhat surprised there are not more reports on this. I suppose it might have something to do with the availability these days. Personally, I would definately experiment with it some more, but sadly I'm currently almost run out.

Alas, the few milligrams of MET I've been saving to IM are now an ocean and a continent away, so it'll be a while untill I get back to it. But MET is definitely a priority for me now.

IM route seems like the best way to go with with this substance (apart from perhaps oral with MAOI, which unfortunately no-one seems to have pursued yet), but I've been having difficulties with overcoming my phobia for needles so far ![:!](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/argh.gif)![:o](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f631.png)

The MET is next (maybe?). A 30mg shot was going to be conducted but it was put off due to psilocin moving in to the neighborhood.


Now Meemsters will have a chance again to bump its way to the head of the line.


A 30mg shot and a 50mg shot was planned (with a week in between each shot of course).


The brain was thinking about suggestions for mild MAOIs to take on board before the shot. Like passionflower tea or something similar? Suggestions?

When I try MET, it will be by IM injection.  And I will give it a try orally as well.  I just don't care for smoking psychedelics, with the exception of 5-MeO-DMT.

I don't think I've had MET that long.  I may have been longing for it since then (or even before) but it was only in recent months that the opportunity presented itself.  One day, I promise.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I think it came out a year ago, I may have been exaggerating a tad with the two years thing. It just didnt seem to be that great when smoked but hopefully it will present its self in a much more beautiful way than it did me! I have a feeling that IM will give something that is less natural than DMT, but more so than DPT. I dont think I could do IM though.

Why couldn't you do IM? IM is much better than smoking, since you have a moment to collect yourself before you start tripping (compared to with smoking you are hurtled into it).


I find this moment of calm before the trip helps set the intention of the trip (at the very least you can do some nice yoga stretching or a moment of meditation).


I don't quite know what you mean by more natural than *X*. The amount of trips I've had have taught me its all 'natural' its all physical. Whether thats from a pure chemical powder or from a plant material like marijuana or a fungus like psilocybes, its all good, its down to earth, organic, groovy.


Peace,

Ive always form what ive read, pictured DMT patterns as being more mushroom like and organic, and DPT being more rigid and subjective, I could definately be wrong. But when smoking the MET the CEVs were of a very odd, almost mechanical nature, but the colors were very organic colors not very bright.


With, IM, I have thought of it with a few drugs, like Demerol or DMT, but I dont like all the teks Ive read. Like sticking a needle and inch deep, and how you know when youve gone past the fat... its seems scary, not in a  junky way, but in a needle going  into my bone on accident way ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I don't want to come off like I am condoning/glorifying needle use...because I am not.


Having said that....."IMing" isn't so bad if you do it the way I do...which is really sub-q.  I've done enough ketamine and DPT both ways to say I can't find any difference between an IM injection and a SQ shot...maybe IM comes on a little faster.


I only need a 1/2 needle, which is much less intimidating than a 1".  I inject into my buttocks and it is not a big deal at all.  Doesn't hurt at all (if you are steady you will only feel pressure).  Of course, needles are only for junkie loosers and crack heads like Mr T.  So stay in milk, drink school, and don't use needles.

I always inject into the deltoid muscle, same deal as IM vaccinations ... watch next time you get one.  With a 1/2 inch needle you shouldn't be able to hit bone unless you really jam it in there.  Always use a micron filter!  


DPT is as "organic" as it gets IMO ... billowing, boiling, bubbling visuals.  It's the #1 most mindblowing psychedelic in my book.  To me, DMT seems more "alien" ... the buzzing vibrations I get on DMT feel more unnatural.  Come to think of it, maybe it's just a difference in the onset of the two drugs.  DMT can also meet my definition of organic when you get above a certain threshold.  LSD + DMT ... whoa, now that's just glorious.  Describing the visuals is meaningless.  It's an all-encompasing extra-dimensional experience.  Lastly, on one occasion with MET I felt like the visuals were very mechanical as you described, but other times they were completely different.  I just reread this paragraph and realized that it will probably make no sense to anybody ... which leads me to say, you'll just have to try them all!!

S_S: If you're IMing, i recommend against a MAOI since it will alter the trip as you know. Yes, MAO exists everywhere, but it is gut MAO that is responsible for most breakdown. 


If MAO interfered with injections, then DPT and DMT would not have worked.

I have found visuals on DPT not to be very organic either.. rather I see those bright, colourful, electric fractal patterns swirling and turning and spinning everywhere I look; with eyes closed it resembles winamp visualizations (very artificial) more than anything. Perhaps it has to do with where you trip (I've only done DPT in indoor settings) and in nature the visuals seem more organic than indoors.


I haven't gotten to try DMT yet so cannot comment on that. With MET, however, the visuals seemed more "organic" than with DPT in that the colors were less bright, more smooth and glowing (as opposed to neon-coloured fast-paced tossing-and-turning dancing geometric patterns of DPT). It's probably just me, but yellow seems to be the most dominant colour with MET, while with most other psychedelics, greens and reds and blues seem to dominate (except for mushrooms, which also tend to emphasize yellow for me). That's just a personal observation, however, and will probably not hold true for others.

I've tried ~25 mg and ~40mg (vaporised) 8 minutes later and I've noticed the same predominance of yellow and blue, pretty vivid.

30 mg MET IM


… great adjunct for a live show, even better if that live show happens to be Animal Collective.  First of all, I’d like to say that psood0nym and I are curious as to why this band hasn’t caught on more with the psychedelic community.  Animal Collective and Panda Bear (side project of Noah Lennox) create some excellent music, check out links below.  Anyway, the show was absolutely incredible ... lots of energy, plenty of dancing.  


Anyway, getting to the point, I took 50 mg MET in a syringe, but only used 30 mg for fear of overdoing it in a public place. 30 mg was perfect ... nice peak, and still feeling some after-effects 2 hr later.  The effects were very different from the time I combined it with 4-ho-dmt.  This time it was a very expansive headspace, not threatening in any way.  It was much more in line with my trials of smoking the substance.  With eyes open, the visuals didn’t predominate, but that may have been due to the overwhelming sensations of ecstasy derived from auditory stimulation.  I spent most of the show with my eyes closed, transfixed on the sounds, and enjoying subtle CEVs that adapted to the music.  


I found the most similarities with DMT … surprise, surprise.  There was a DMT-esque alteration of thought patterns, more chaotic than mushrooms.  IMO, there are less thought trains/tangents than with mushrooms … less room for exploring thoughts (may be due to environment in this case, but I’m basing this off previous experiences as well).  


The afterglow (probably a combination of the show and MET) was wonderful.  I was supremely blissful and came home with the irresistible urge to cuddle and kiss my fiancé … who probably just wanted to go back to sleep.  I finally got tired and went to sleep at the 4 hr mark, after replaying the show in my mind ad infinitum and watching Animal Collective videos on youtube.  MET is definitely a worthwhile compound.  I will probably experiment with a higher dose next time in a less demanding environment.

A few videos won’t come close to capturing the essence of their music … still worth checking out though.

So you feel like 50mg would be sufficient for a +3 -


I think I am going to try this - I was planning on using it with a MAOI, but it seems like IM would be better from your reports -


Is it sufficiently like DMT that someone experienced with DMT could jump in with a high dose or do you think one should work one's way up (taking into account one may have only enough for about 1,5 doses)

I've never tried any MAOI combos, but I'm sure it would be a good route as well ... just not as predictable.  For you samadhi, 50 mg IM would be fine ... that's what I plan on doing next round w/ a 25 mg booster ready.  


As I said in another recent post, the Shulgin scale isn't very useful for describing intensity.  I'd say 30 mg qualified as a +++, but only because as I would have been "unable to ignore the drug's action."  It would have been very difficult to go about normal activities at that dose.  ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Security?  Pffffft ... 


I don't encourage others to do what I did, but there was no security checkpoint.  Even if there had been, a quick pat down wouldn't have revealed anything.  You just need 30 sec in a bathroom stall, bam, and you're done.  I ran into a friend of a friend when I was walking out of the stall ... and he was going into one (I don't think he had to take a shit either) ... hmmm.  The only crappy part is squeezing your way back into the middle/front of the crowd.  Again, I don't recommend this behavior.   ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I didn't really go anywhere.  It's all pretty silly really.


Anyway, I have a concert tonight (Smashing Pumpkins) and would love to use a short-acting psychedelic (so I am down in time) but I better not go messing about with MET since I've never tried it before.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Ahh well, 2C-D it is.  Not that this is a bad thing...it just seems like it's my usual all-purpose psychedelic and I'd love to try something new...but not at a concert.  Bad new bears.

2C-B lasts too long...had this problem before where I went hiking, but 6 hours later (after 2C-B) I still could not drive.  I don't want to get into that issue again, especially since I have to take a windy 2-lane hwy to get home.  Has to be a much shorter-acting psychedelic, so 2C-D is all there is....not going to take DPT, or any simple N,N-dialkyltryptamine, at a concert.  Those are more "spiritual" or "working" materials for me...I am looking for something more on the recreational side.


And I don't care for DMT...certainly not at a concert.  Personal preference.

What a concert!  Holy shit, the Smashing Pumpkins are so good and professional.  That was the best concert I've ever been to, save for Roger Waters.


To be honest, the concert to so powerful and impressive that I am not too sure I even needed the 2C-D.  I really didn't note much of any effects until the concert was over and the lights turned on.  I had CEVs, but I was really in a psychedelic state because of the music and show they put on.


Sorry to go OT.

Sorry.  It (MET) really is high up on the list, for what is is worth.


Sorry I just can't live up to my old standards, but I just don't do these things very often anymore.  But it makes the times I do that much more special.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

sigh this is a pointless post but I really want to trip - but don't have time -


the next opportunity I get to trip will be an IM dose of 50mg of MET - I just don't know when that point will come under the onslaught of work right now-


MET 'feels' special to me right now - its as if I am on the brink of something quite large - like the feeling I got before taking DMT -


Lord knows I need it right now ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

I've been there Samadhi.  Just keep pluggin' away and you'll find the time eventually.  It isn't so much the lack of tripping that gets me down when the workload really piles up, rather it's the lack of time to reflect on the big picture and pursue all those fascinating ideas that psychedelics have opened you up to.  The time will come for you and MET.  There's no rush.

3nd trial with MET IM (50 mg) 


My relationship with this chemical seems to be up and down.  My previous experience with 30 mg IM was fantastic, but that was undoubtedly enhanced by the great set and setting (see the previous page in this thread for details).  This time, I wasn’t 100% intent on tripping, but it was my only chance for another few months so I figured I’d give it a try anyway.  What’s an hour or two anyway on a slow Saturday night?  


Initially I was into it, but the intensity escalated quickly.  The peak occurred around the 5-10 minute mark.  I attempted to listen to music, but it failed to provide much comfort; my thoughts were becoming more chaotic and the music seemed distant.  I ventured outside for some fresh air and nearly threw up, at which point I was seriously regretting my decision.  My mind-set oscillated between neutral and negative.  


The visuals were outstanding, particularly with eyes closed, somewhat reminiscent of DPT, but not quite as lavish.  MET engaged the visual system more selectively that DPT, which seems to spill over into a more encompassing synaesthetic experience.  My one DPT experience was with a very high dose, so I can't be sure that I’m making a legitimate distinction.  I felt more comfortable with eyes open; the alien visuals would quickly become overwhelming when I closed my eyes.  


There were orderly arrangements of geometric faces marching in circles.  Their mouths seemed to be opening and closing, and inside each mouth there was a brilliant white light.  This was impressive, but not enjoyable, at least in my state of mind.  At this time, for about the first 30 minutes, I was definitely resisting the compound.  Each time a mouth opened it gave me this unpleasant impression that I was losing part of myself, or losing touch with reality.  Needless to say this whole experience was powerfully psychedelic.  The mouth phenomenon or sensations of opening and closing was very similar to my experience with 25 mg IM on top of a moderate dose of 4-ho-dmt, but completely different from my experiences with 30 mg IM and another with vaporization.  Also, I felt more unsteady and shaky than with previous trials.  Perhaps it's important to note that I had taken 4.5 mg hydergine 4 hours prior (no piracetam though).  


I wasn't incredibly observant with respect to the chronology, but the plateau seemed to last just under an hour, with aftereffects keeping me awake for another two.  I felt much better, actually great, as the plateau began to fade.  The aftereffects were quite pleasant.  And one more thing ... I experienced some significant pain and swelling in my left arm about 30 min post injection.  I suspect the solution may have been too concentrated and caused some kind of hyperosmotic response in the tissue.  I used a 2:1 ratio of MET to citric acid, distilled water, a micron filter, and checked the pH, but for some reason my body did not react well.  I also remember tasting citrate on my tongue, but wasn't sure if it was real or hallucination.  The swelling has completely resolved this morning, and there is a very minimal amount of tenderness.  Anyone have any ideas for why this happened?  I may come back to MET some day, but I think it's going in long-term storage for now.  Despite my wide range of experiences, I must say it’s definitely a worthwhile compound.  


P.S. Samadhi, I recommend starting at 30-40 mg for your first try with this compound if you go with IM admin.  50 mg may be a bit much.  ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Wow thanks for the details, Dondante! It makes me look forward more to it!


I believe I will start with 30mg for a first trial, since I would then have enough to do a 50mg trial with (and then its gone for me probably)-


I PMed you btw-

Yeah, thanks for another IM report.  I think it’s just you and one other person whose done IM, and your reports are far more comprehensive.  Barring the still unexplored (to my knowledge) oral MAOI route, IM is obviously the way to go.  You made comparisons to your aMT/DPT trip.  Does this comparison apply just to this last trip or to all of your MET experiences?  I just assumed IM MET would be closer in character to IM DMT than anything else. 


I’m always fascinated by symbols during trips that are consistent over time and experience because their consistency implies deeper psychological representation.  Your mind settled on geometric faces traveling in circles (did they form a ring around you (like a trap) or around arbitrary points in space?) whose luminescent mouths open in time to increasing ego dissolution.  It’s unfortunate that such a beautiful vision was so unpleasant, but I can see how it could be threatening. I imagine the opening mouths could seem like a disembodied entity that’s predatorily consuming your sense of self and reality for its own “illuma-nutritive” sustenance.  Mmmm… souls.


Maybe try it in combination with a "positive push" psychedelic?

It applies to both my recent 50 mg IM trip and my MET/4-ho-dmt trip.  The lower dose trips were closer to DMT, although the length makes it hard to compare.  Also, I haven’t had all that much experience with DMT, and only one with DPT, which was a combination as you mentioned.

A similar vision was something like a steam whistle on a train, popping open and closing.  I was having a jack-in-the-box type startle reaction to these hallucinations too … dododododo, Pop! Ahhh!

I could see potential there ... LSD + DMT was the greatest combination I've experienced thus far, so I imagine LSD + MET would be good as well.  Also, AMT or MDMA could potentially augment MET very nicely.

MET was the first tryptamine I ever tried. 


It seemed to me lots milder than DET, which I tried a few years later.

That's unusual.  You may very well be the only person in all of human history for whom MET was their first tryptamine (at least at the time you did it years ago).  What few reports there are on MET make it sound to me like it's similar to DET--based on what few reports there are of that substance.  Have you written a trip report?  If not please do!

I smoked 10mg of this chemical a few days ago just to get an idea of what it is like before I IM it (soon I hope). It was way more shroom-like than I thought it would be. It took about 60 seconds to come on after smoking it, which was very different from DMT (which starts almost immediately). I thought I had just taken too little a dose, but then I looked outside and the branches started twirling around outside and were very saturated with color. Also CEVs appeared (different from DMT again).


Funny thing about those branches, they have stayed saturated with color ever since that trip. Its amazing how psychedelics can help us notice the beauty of reality.

I look forward to hearing about that IM report.  MET is one of the few substances I'm still considering buying.  Dondante's experience with it is interesting, as it seems to vacillate between being DMT-like and DPT-like at lower and higher doses respectively; I'm searching for a chemical that can bridge that gap so I can use DMT, substance x, and DPT all at once and have a more unified experience than just DMT and DPT together can provide.  I'm also curious to know what an oral trip would be like with a MAOI.

yes, but it does not replace DMT (who ever thought it would seriously). It is like DPT that it is 'hard' on your body, if you know what I mean, compared to the translucent nature of DMT (in, out, clean body), the synthetic tryptamines sometimes leave my body a little 'agitated' (I'm thinking mainly DPT and 5-meo-DMT here).

Takes longer for your brain to sweep up the mess after the party too no doubt.  Still, in the abscence of the ever-elusive DET, MET is probably going to have to jump into my homologic daisy chain fantasy to replace it.

**The MET Appreciation Thread.**


First of all, some background information:  


I have limited experience with tryptamines.  I have done psilocybin a handful of times, DPT once or twice (didn't get off due to underdosage error, my bad), 

4-OH-MIPT (very good at very high dosages), 4-OH-DIPT (inactive) and MET once.  (I have tons of experience with LSD, but LSD is an ergoline, not a proper tryptamine per se.)  And I have yet to experience DMT or 5-MeO-DMT.


Also, chemically speaking, MET (N-ethyl-N-methyltryptamine) should be abbreviated EMT because E comes before M alphabetically, but somehow that's not the name this compound has wound up with, and besides, EMT also stands for Emergency Medical Technician (or Ambulance driver).


However, let me say that my experience with MET was extremely positive, with good visuals, nice bella donna type pupil dilation, and gentle, emphathetic, transcendental insights thrown in for good measure.  It was not the mind-blowing, DMT-like experience which I was expecting, and there was none of the uncontrollability and excitement of a peak shrooms experience.  In fact, MET to me felt quite a lot like MDMA in certain respects.  There was a woody overtone to the chemical, if that makes any sense.  The smoke, however, was unbelievably harsh.


So, my point is, I guess, if you ever get a chance to try MET, don't pass it up.  It is a highly worthwhile chemical!

The thing I loved most about MET was the very beautiful CEVs near the end of the trip (probably there at the beginning but I didn't take time to notice them cause I was tripping too hard puking my negativity out and inhaling LOVE from the mountain wind! ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)).


The CEVs were like a very delicate jewel lattice structure...if I relaxed they would emerge...if I tensed up...they would fade away....it promoted a very peaceful state of relaxation, curled up into a fetal position on the clifftop I was on during my trip.

I tried that this weekend with methylone and it was HEAVENLY. On the tail end (still empathetic effects) we smoked a joint (mj) with about 25mg of MET sprinkled in. We shared the joint and both had a very, very, very pleasant trip. The CEVs were amazing...and for me at least, MET visuals are much more 'delicate' than DMT...crystaline, ethereal, gossamer.


I really like this stuff...for low doses, it is extremely gentle and deep.


my friend and I had a very positive afterglow/uplifting feeling the entire next day and now persisting into today :D

I finally had a pleasant experience with this stuff this past weekend. Smoking it never got me anywhere, except making me nervous and searing my throat. As a small amount of MDMA was wearing off I IV'd 10mg, then 15mg. It was fantastic... didn't slam e like I thought it might. It came on fairly gradually. I didn't even really feel it come on so much as see it.


The bed I was sitting on started to undulate, then patterns appeared all over every surface of he the room. I didn't get moved off into what felt like some sort of physical construct like I do with DMT. I guess the dose might have been low for that.


If I had more I'd try to see if I could "break through" as with DMT. Has that happened to anyone?

I'm gonna try to breakthrough on an IV dose also. I like you injected 10mg (but stayed at that with no bump up). It was minor but definitely active (CEVs were amazing).


I'm really blown away by the CEVs from this stuff...so delicate and beautiful to behold. It blew away my friend also who felt like she was 'building a dream' during our trip.


fizzacyst, do you have the HCL that you are trying to smoke? The freebase works SO easily (i smoke it on joints and in bowls).

I had the freebase, salted it out for injection.


I just couldn't smoke it. It might have been the pipe I was using (ball on a stick type that a lot of people use for meth), but I didn't want to contaminate or have to clean out another piece.

i don't understand it then, do you have the same problem with DMT (it sounds like you're making a point about MET in particular or are you just making a point about smoking simple tryptamines in general).


its to be expected that you might get a thick paste like coating in your mouth, a harsh feeling in your lungs, and slightly burning lips (smoking a LOT of tryptamines at once will do this I've found no matter what the chemical is).


That's why I like to IV them. But, I'll leave that aside for.


IV tryptamines is "a new way to say hurray" :D

Well, not really. The other pipes I didn't want to contaminate had DMT and DPT base resin in them. Those worked well. The DPT works pretty much perfectly with one of those ("glass dicks" or whatever you want to call them). The DMT... not so much. I mean, it works, but I have a hard time heating the glass properly, etc. Its much easier for me to smoke it with a flame on some plant matter. I don't care if its wasting some.. when I have it I have plenty, and it gets me to That Place every single time.


The MET was just too harsh on my mouth/throat/lungs. I don't know why it bothers me more than the others.


I kind of hate to be the IV psychedelic advocate or anything, but it works like... infinitely better for me that way. I must say, starting out a trip that intense with that god awful wretched mothball taste in you mouth and some pain is not the best way to start out at all.


But I've not tried DMT IV... I'm really sort of afraid of DMT to be honest unless I'm on MDMA. I mean, its FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC once I get there. but getting there scares the piss out of me. The thought of IVing DPT is just too much for me to even consider. It was bitchslapped me too many times.


I do get tingly lips/numbness to a slight degree, and a film in my mouth. and yes, it rapes my lungs.


edit:

stuck DIPT in there instead of DPT. big difference. oops.

even super pure stuff still aggravates my lung tissue. its not worth smoking more than like 25mg at a time. If I want to breakthrough I'll have a needle/wheel filter ready.


I haven't IVed DMT either, it should be the best one to IV I think.


praise tryptamines


ps I agree that MET vapor is harsher than DMT or DPT. I wonder what DET vapor is like? (gosh I wish I could try that last one in the DMT/DET 'bridge'!).

10mg IV MET:


delicate visuals, 20 minute trip. Weaker than 10mg DPT.


Has anybody else IVed this stuff? Its like DMT-lite, somebody called it, I agree...its really nice stuff. The positive afterglow may rival DMT's...:D


I'm going to try 25mg MET soon! :D

I wish I had given away less now, as most of the people I gave it to kinda 'meh'd at it, one guy washed it in his pocket. Now I'd really like to continue injecting it as I'm certain this is the "right" way for me personally, and I feel confident that I would get somewhere with it finally.


25mg MET base sounds like a good place to try next. The doses I mentioned when trying it were the mass of the MET only... I as not including the mass of the citric acid used to dissolve it.

really? Why do you think that? Do you think the same about smoking it (I find the timelines to be reasonably close, smoking is a bit more intense/short ime). IVing is like a little bit more drawn out smoking experience (ime again, and thats only with trying DPT and MET).


I like that I'm not wrecking my lungs smoking more tryptamines than I already do! (I still like to smoke DMT in low doses frequently :D).

hey kind sir! Well first I bless the angel that got me the MET! ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)


The effects come on shortly (take longer than snorted DMT)...the trip is about 60 minutes or so...very nice place.


I only snorted a small bit to sample it...about 15mg...it BURNED though...I would not want to snort a full dose of this stuff as I imagine the pain is very bad. Up there with 2CB for burning (MORE than DMT burned).

Has anyone tried smoking this usinf 'the machine'? DMT smoke is too harsh for me using a meth pipe, but no problems with the machine. Im going to have a decent amount of MET soon, but if it tastes worse and is more harse than DMT Im not sure what Im going to do with it. (Wont be IMing). Ill have more than enough for some oral trials, so that may be the way Ill go. Ill see how harsh the smoke is using the machine

^I thought someone tried it without an MAOI and didn't get very far.  If you're committed to trying it out with syrian rue now anyways, it'll probably be more economical to just start with that. Doing MET that way has been discussed since the beginning of this thread.  If it works, I think yours will be the first trip report of the "combo".

Yeah I did read that, Ill have a decent amount so might try up to 200-250mg without an maoi, but starting at 100mg. If I cant get moclebemide Ill use rue. Its going to have to wait a few weeks until exams are over and I can fully commit myself though

Well it turns out Ill be getting the fumerate salt, not freebase. Ill try snorting some, but if it burns like gaian planes says the HCl does thats not going to be pleasant. What would be the best way to convert to freebase? Slowly adding dilute NaOH until it falls out of solution? NaOH is hard to find here but Im sure I can get some if I try

The salt probably will not burn anywhere near as much, if at all.  The reason the freebases burn so much is because they're not water-soluble so they sit there in the nasal mucous membranes for quite a while before being absorbed.  The salts will be water-soluble so they'll dissolve pretty quickly.  Salts never see, to hurt as much as freebases with tryptamines.

hey nofx, my mistake I have since realized what I have is actually the freebase! sorry for the confusion!


It is strange because this batch is vaporizing much less than the first freebase batch I had...but it definitely is the freebase I realize now (thats what tricked me at first actually!).


I tried dissolving some for an IV and it just sat at the bottom like a lump of freebase.


MET FREEBASE has burned worse than any other chemical I know. I really wouldn't recommend snorting it at all...it was painful...more painful than say 2CE or 2CB (if you've tried sniffing those).

Well seeing as Ill have fumarate Im going to snort some first off, and convert some to freebase for smoking.


So noone has tried using the machine? If tastes/burns as bad as smoking DMT out of a meth pipe Ill pass, but DMT in the machine is fine... We'll see how it goes. Hopefully snorting the fumarate isnt too painfull.


 Failing both of those Ive got 10g to experiment with orally :D

During one pretty negative trip, I've gotten this - 勿 - which means "do not" in Chinese. My fractal-field-of-vision turned into an 勿 composed of 勿's with little 勿's inside and so on. Terrifying. It appeared again a few times.

I dunno if that is accurate.   Freebase drugs can be readily absorbed through the nasal lining (DMT and 5-MeO-DMT-containing plants are often used as a snuff as I don't know that they are ever converted to salts before hand....in the case of 5-HO-DMT-containing snuffs, it is common to add a base to it...making it even more alkaline)...but the main reason I disagree is that 2C-B hcl and 2C-T-7 hcl burn like fire when snorted.  Granted, I've never tried to snort their freebase oils...but I'm not sure that the burn factor is connected to a chemical being a salt or not.

MGS, read what xorkie wrote again, I think what he said is accurate. He wasn't saying you (or indigenous tribal person) couldn't do it, just that it would burn more and take a while to kick in. In my experience snorting DMT, DPT, and MET this is definitely the case. The freebase I snorted burned like hell and took a little longer to come up and the HCL (of those) I snorted burned less and came up quicker.

I'm not entirely sure I understood the meaning at the time. It was prompted by me trying to type "www" into my address bar, which is rendered by mac os x's smart pinyin entry system as “勿忘我," or "do not forget me." I don't know if I knew this at the time.


My field of vision turned into this in that this character - 勿 - became a creature. The top left stroke became an eye, the bottom three strokes into little legs that were moving. So my entire field of vision became like a 10x10 field of these guys... in between them was darkness. Nothing. Psychedelic emptiness. And then each of those characters broke into another 10x10... and etc and etc, until I'd blink and the process would start all over again.


I'm not sure it was semantics that prompted me to look at this character... I rarely use it. But it doesn't LOOK right if you study Chinese, because it's totally unbalanced. It's a radical, it needs to be part of 物 or something. In fact, I think I thought of it as a amputated creature, some kind of imperfect creation. Which, coincidentally, was kind of how I was seeing myself at the time. In the psychedelic sense.

I am familiar with this substance for about 3 years now. I only took it orally, since it is in the form of an acidic succinate salt. 100 - 200 mg is the dose range, 75 - 150 mg for the freebase, as succinic acid gives one third of the mass of the salt. The whole trip lasts 4 hours. This is somewhere equivalent to 2 - 3 g of ps. cubensis mushrooms. A very mild psychedelic that resemble a very low dose of DMT, yet without the deep emotional impact of dimethyltryptamines. Body load is not a big problem and mostly vanishes when you reach the plateau. It is gentle and not obtrusive as mushrooms can be, yet still preserves the magic of dimethyltryptamines that is clearly distinct from the states you can get into with tryptamines having longer alkyls attached to the amino group. I can hardly imagine someone having a harsh bad trip on it. Perfect for introducing a person to the tryptamine world.


I also tried it with MAOI once. One aurorix tablet an hour before the trip with 220 mg of the acidic succinate. Aurorix augmented it to the level where it was really hard (yet not totally impossible) to move and communicate with others. The duration was 6 hours that time.

^We finally have an MAOI report with MET, albeit a brief one.  Thanks Erny.


As suspected from the beginning of this thread, it seems like IM and oral with an MAOI are indeed the best ways to do MET (or at least the most economical.)  


So do you have any guesstimates as to just how much the MAOI increased MET's potency for you, Erny?  You went from describing the 100-200mg oral dosage range for the succinate as 2 to 3 grams of cubensis to having difficulty moving around at 220mg; that's a significant jump. Sounds like it increases duration over normal oral ingestion by about 50 percent, too.

MET mixes **extremely** well with LSD I will be happy to report from this weekend ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


Each toke of MET kicks the sparklers on behind the eyes for a moment's flash (lil bit longer than DMT flash since MAO doesn't eat it up as quick), then you're back in LSD land with a little bit extra euphoria.

I heard 100mg tossed around. That's certainly where I would start. Expect something heavy (or perhaps not, hard to tell).


I would also recommend doing it without a MAOI. The beautiful properties of MET are really its delicate and fragile nature. Adding MAOIs to tryptamines seems to make them heavier and more intense wave-like (not only a change in degree, but a shift in phenomenal character).


man thinking about MET and DMT just makes me want to hump a fuzzy pillow at the prospect of DET! :D

It's been some times now that I've discovered MET and I've a few questions that maybe some here could possibly answer...


When I use it, I smoke tiny amount (not accurately mesured) in a lightbulb. While I get pleasants effects (weird/intense feeling in the head, a instantaneous really good mood, a physical well-beingness, some slight movements in my vision), I dont get real psychedelics effects. 

So I wonder if it's possible to really break trough with MET and get a full on psychedelic experience ? If so, how ?


Also, I find the smoke quite harsh on the lung, it seem difficult to me to smoke more of this. Just after the experience my breath is always a bit reduced. This led me to my second interrogation, do we know or could we know from other parralel data what is the toxicity of the MET fumes ? I've a feeling that it's not something someone should do that often...


Thirdly, since the smoke feel quite toxic to me I'd love to read more about oral MET experience with or without MAOI... do you think it's possible to have an interesting and healing experience à la ayahuasca/pharmahuasca with MET ?


Until now, I use MET like I'd use other drugs, for a pleasant rush but I really would like to dive in psychedelia with it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Convert the freebase to a salt (if necessary) and IV it if you can't get enough of the smoke. This thread has existed for a long time and there's still not much news regarding how MET combines with an MAOI. There might be information elsewhere, I don't know, but you may need to be one of the first people to try it out and write a substantial report.  Just to remind you, the poster at the top of the page guessed from his previous experience that effects were magnified as much as 2.5 times.

Strangely when I tried to convert it to a salt with acetic acid, I got an oily substance that never crystallised. Similarly, I don't understand why the freebase I have (in powder form at room t°) never recrystallise after I've heated it, even if I put it in the fridge ?

DMT salts are oily and don't really crystallize either.  You should be able to dissolve it in water or alcohol though.

No need to convert to crystal. The freebase should dissolve in a fairly small amount of vinegar.  Then add sterile water (preservative free contact lens solution works) to dilute, filter and inject. This has been used to inject DMT that started as a freebase.  If you do it IM it'll sting a little, but reportedly it's nothing compared to the pain of snorting it. Search the b&d DMT thread for "vinegar" and further instructions will show up. The 5 percent white distilled vinegar you buy at the grocery store should be essentially sterile. 


Frankly though, I'm more interested in the MAOI report.

I really enjoyed MET. 

I've only taken it smoked, usually around 40-60mgs, and usually while on MDMA, Methylone or LSD. But always has been a good thing. 

Its a shame its not around any more, underrated perhaps because its not world shattering like DMT, but actually is nice that way. Its groovy, easy going and gentle mentally, though harsh on the lungs. Enhances the visuals in an intriguing but indefinable way. 

MET mixed with DPT freebase makes a nice combo too. 

Still have some in the freezer saved for special occasions.

hmmm... well hard for me to say because I've never used it straight from baseline, and I've never sampled 5-MeO-DMT. I don't remember any abnormally accelerated heartbeat but don't take my word as gospel. MET is in my experience more "mellow" than DPT both physically and mentally, but then maybe I've never taken enough to feel threatened. YMMV as they say

^I've recently gotten a hold of it.  I hope to use it soon.  I'll be converting it with vinegar for IM injection, as that's the route that seems to hold the most potential for it. I'll be able to compare it with IM DET not too long after that.

i have had little experience with it, always vaped as best i could. ive found it most useful when combined with longer lasting psychedelics, like lsd or synthetic tryptamines. it gives trips a bump back up... hard to explain really, something like what som describe using weed would be like. 


my methods are far from perfect, and the amounts vaped were very small (~5mg at most) but then, i do have a limited amount and there is little info out there how else to use this chem (that doesnt incolve a needle). it is also very bad to taste/smell....

duration wise i would say it comes up in about a minute or 2, and lasts ~30-40mins, might be more, as the effects are subtle (change of headspace, color saturation, contour enhancement) and they fade off rather gently.

i dont know about the dose/effects scale as i only tried it in threshold amounts, and have no intention of either iv or im. perhaps i will try it vaped in much larger quantities next, but i have yet to find the time

IME the peak is around 10-15 minutes with residual effects being felt up to an hour.

30mg seems to be a good dose to get an idea of the full spectrum of effects but it can surely be taken higher.

It is not nearly as intense as DMT, nor was it as memorable.

Its been a few years since ive had any, and i really enjoyed it when i did it, but then DMT came into my life and this stuff was easily forgotten.

thanks for the info.  I do like my DMT, but was looking for something a bit "lighter" so this might be what the doctor ordered ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Is there a dose at which one "breaks through" or does it not really offer that type of experience?


Anyone care to comment on larger vaporised doses?

It turned out that I have some trip-reports left on my hard drive, of the year 2006.


> N-methyl-N-ethyltryptamine, MET
> 
> 
> 
> Bioassay #1, 100 mg (freebase)
> 
> I took 100 mg of the title compound on an almost empty stomach. I was at home and it was evening. It tasted exactly like DMT: very bitter and with plastic after-taste. First effects appeared at 35 minutes, and this made me feel a little nervous, as I suspected an early onset. At the 35th minute an unmistakable feeling appeared that something was unusual in my perceptions. Five minutes later the colors turned brighter and some DET-like somatic effects appeared, very light indeed. I became a little nauseous. Little later the hyperacousia showed up, reminiscent of the beginning of action of DiPT or mushrooms: the close and distant sounds began distorting and leveled by volume, so that it turned out hard to determine whether the sound came from the street or from the other room. Textures began to move, and in the air waves of color looking like slowly moving smoke appeared, almost identical to those in the very beginning or the very end of DMT.
> 
> I turned off the big lights, leaving only the table-lamp as a light source, made some tea and changed the music. The perception of music under the influence of MET is exactly like that when on acid or mushrooms, it is very sensual and emotionally rich. There was no pronounced anorexia that is really strong in DET for me.
> 
> After finishing the tea, I spent some 20 minutes listening to music, and at the end of that reached the plateau. All the somatic effects were gone at that time, the body felt quite well, as in the classic tryptamines (three DMTs), no unpleasant sensations at all. With the eyes closed some DMT-like visuals were present, although fairly mild. With the eyes open visuals were again like in a very light DMT-trip, or at the end of a DMT-trip, with flowing colors, yet some of the visual effects reminded me of acid and even mushrooms: when I found myself in a completely dark environment it looked like if I was in a forest surrounded with fluorescent vegetation that was growing, blooming etc.
> 
> The experience was wave-like, as with psilocybin, when at one moment you are feeling as if it is about to end, and at the next you’re swept away again. Emotionally MET is very even and positive, without sharp edges. Nothing that would shatter the very depth of you, it just took me in a quite comfortable place and then metabolized, leaving me in a state of excitation when I was unable to sleep - due to agitation rather than physical stimulation.
> 
> The plateau lasted forty minutes and was followed by gradual come down. Two hours after the beginning of the experiment visual effects mostly faded. I was already at +1 at that time. At the third hour the effects were gone almost completely, and I was in the afterglow state, that lasted for some more time.
> 
> I’d mark this excellent, right after the three classic tryptamines and LSD.
> 
> 
> 
> Bioassay #2, 220 mg MET*HSC with 150 mg aurorex
> 
> I took moclobemide, and one hour later, MET. The onset was in ten minutes, and 30 minutes later I was completely into it. It was very intense at that level, and resembled a little DPT narcosis-like state: my walk was impaired, and there were similarities with GHB in the way the body was felt. Mental effects were more like DMT as well as the visuals, which were quite intense, though not to the point when the real world would completely dissolve. I’d compare it with, perhaps, 30 mg of DMT smoked (I have low sensitivity to DMT, and need more than 60 mg of it smoked to have an out-of-body experitence). The experience lasted 6 hours, with almost two hours at plateau. Without going into details, it was a plus four experience. This was a little too much for this chemical. A good dose for a combination with MAOI would probably be 150 mg of this salt or 100 mg of a freebase.

I find the freebase almost impossible for me to smoke because it's simply too rough on my lungs. (Don't usually smoke).

I was wondering if converting it to a salt and snorting it would be an option. 

Does anyone have experience with this?

I've tried 100mg of MET FB combined with ~3.3g of syrian rue and had to redose because it was really light. The next time I'll try 150mg with 50mg boosters at hand if needed. I'm sensitive in a normal way, I don't usually need higher dose than other peoples.


I'll write a more complete TR soon.

Does anyone have a fair range for this? I'll probably use it IM because I loved DMT IM and don't feel like smoking it, though I will probably also plug it. I assume IM would be something like, 5-15mgs fair, 25-40mgs medium,40-70mgs strong? Opinions?

Erowid lists common as 10-30 mg and strong as 30-50 mg for IM so your suggestions sound fair.


I have only tried smoking the freebase in low doses. Very harsh smoke so it was difficult for me to smoke enough to get decent effects.


I am considering making some enhanced leaf with a mixture of DMT/MET, to see how they go together.

There are certain connotations attached to it, not that I really care, but if someone stumbled across a needle at my place I'm sure they'd be pretty sketched out about it (not likely, I am not careless with any of this stuff, but still), at least the kind of people I have in my life lol. That and I feel like it'd be a slippery slope of sorts, no we're not talking about heroin, but I mean, when I was a teenager and realized I could crush and snort an E pill it was a game changer.. I feel like doing something IM would be the same way and I don't want to go there. Chosen ignorance if you will.

No, it's not just to conserve material. Intramuscular administration gives superior qualitative effects for some drugs in my experience, with this being especially true for DPT. There's something about it coming on fast that makes it more immersing, like a plunge. Even 50 mg of DPT split in two 25 mg IM shots separated by 15 minutes or so is usually not as lush and beautiful as 50 mg at once. Insufflation doesn't compare, plus there's the drip to deal with which can negatively effect things on its own. MET may be similar because it's so close to DPT structurally. 


People IM inject insulin and vitamins and things. It is weird the first time, there's no getting around that, but for me, psychologically, it's ultimately just another way of taking a drug.  There are additional concerns about sterility and preparation, however.

Just wondering if anyone has attempted to smoke the hcl form of this compound? There is very limited info at the moment on it and I have never vaporized any chemicals beside thc so I don't know if this is advisable or active.

You won't get the most out of your chemical this way, but it is definitely active.  Mixing with cannabis would probably work better than vaporizing it straight.

I have only seen it for sale as the fumarate salt (and freebase). I would expect it to be difficult to crystallize the HCl as it is with DMT HCl, considering the structural similarity of the two.

Smoking the HCl vs the Freebase, how would that compare? How much more would you have to smoke and how higher would the melting point be?

Who knows. With its "close retaliative" DMT, salt vs FB for smoking doesn't make a huge difference! I haven't tried smoking yet and mine is MET HCl, so i'll report back. IM'ing MET feels exactly like IM'ing DMT except its a bit different, makes me see why people claimed the nickname "DMT lite"!

Smoked freebase MET throughout Independence day.  Holy smoked, I had no idea what I gem this was.  Oh manoshevits I think it's new favorite of me.  Perfect little tryptamine it is.

it's been a while since i've tried it alone. Had somewhat mixed results taking it orally with MAOIs, or metahuasca if you will ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) More recently i made some ganja changa with DMT fb, MET HCl, 4-AcO-DET fb, & Harmine. It was quite interesting. Want to make some with just MET to get a better feel for it on its own. Just trying to vape it in a meth pipe type thing or test tube was largely ineffective as i couldn't hold the smoke in... pretty rough on the ol' lungs & trachea

The freebase MET I am familiar with is a slightly off white crystalline powder.  Looks similar to the 5-MeO-DMT and MiPT I am familiar with.  No detectable tryptamine odor from the vial but I definitely taste the 'indole taste' when I take a hit of it.

Thanks for the reply mgs...what i have is supposed to be in hcl form...it reminds me of the smell of some of the 4-aco-dmt i had.  I am going to vap some before i try im'	ing any of it after i do a allergy test.  I planned on im'ng it untell i received and saw what it looked like.

Redeyesmj, if that is the batch I think it is, you should purify it before injecting it. I'm pretty sure the chemists who synthesized it skipped the recrystallization/filtration step. That also goes for the DPT that was produced alongside.

I'm unable to find info on its physical properties and synthesis route; the compound is very novel and uncommon. You'll have to experiment to test its solubility.


 The Chinese lab had a big order to fill (approx. 500 g), and so it seems like they had rushed the synthesis, unfortunately, giving a larger yield by not following the last purification step. That's probably why it was so cheap. I have no idea how serious the impurities might be, though. 


 You can try dissolving it in hot water or naptha, putting it through a micron filter, then evaporating. See if that lightens the discolouration.

I just got samples of both MET and DPT. Both were the same or similar brown/red/orange color. I'm chemically sensitive but neither invoked a hypersensitive reaction, fortunately, but it would seem that they are both a little impure.


The MET seemed more what is it, hydroscopic(?) than the 4-AcO-DMT that I have had... it gummed up as soon as exposed to air. Was hoping to insufflate it but it was nearly impossible to break up. Gummed up on my knife.

In my opinion, you'll get more out of it if you convert it to freebase and vaporize it. 


An insignificant impurity of about 2-3% can cause major discolouration, so I'm not sure if it's anything to be disappointed about. I have yet to receive my DPT sample, but I plan on doing an MP test to get a rough idea of its purity.


 Do you mind posting pictures?

People overthinking it forsure, MET is rare, DPT on the otherhand is as easy to get as sticks in comparison. Let me remind some you of you older's of a funny story, once a super popular still existent yet in reincarted form release purple DPT, there testing yielded it at 98.5 pure, yet no one, and I mean no one had seen purple DPT before, and when indenpendent tests were done, 99% purity was returned.......


I've had cheap DPT that was from one of the most respected sources, in fact this was one of their last synths, DPT, it returned white, vaguely crystyalline when uncrushed, I scored 10g's as it was cheap as dirt and disappearing within days, but that DPT wasn't as strong as the purple DPT, IMO it was a long shot short of thing where 10mgs of the purple IM'ed vs 10mgs of the white was wildly different in strength and the white DPT's testing came in at 99% as well........


People who are stupid enough to say that because the MET "was" brown they would never IM, is about as smart as saying you wouldn't IV it without filter, yet anyone's who smart will tell you......you'd reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeallllllly reallly want to micron filter that brown MET properly before the injection rather than IV it with no filter............

So this 'brown' MET hcl is for sure MET? I vaped varying doses up to 10 mg of the hcl to no effect which is not surprising as the dose is below threshold but before I continue with larger doses, I want to be sure there are no toxic impurities causing the brown and sticky appearance. The aftertaste is nasty btw burnt plastic or something.

I've never had the "luck" of trying "wild" MET, but i'd say with atleast 50grams of DMT IM/IV'd/smoked/insufflated/orally taken has left with a near perfect image of the "typical" simple tyrp's are......and I can say without a doubt that was I was sold as "Brown HCL MET" is exactly as stated.....especially given its closet besides DMT, in a sense DET, is a SI chem!![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I know what batch you received, and the vendor should have included a (poorly integrated) NMR scan of the product. I'm almost positive it's MET. 


 Vaporizing the HCl form will give weaker effects, pharmacologically speaking. You should deprotonate (freebase) it first. The impurities left from synthesis, provided that they accurately assessed the purity at >98%, shouldn't be of any worry if you're vaporizing it.

 Any insoluble material is bad if you plan to inject it, even if it's only 1-2% of the total amount. I know that if the lab did not follow the last recrystallization/filtration step, which is probable, that would be a cause for concern—*if* you plan to inject it. Since no third parties have bothered to assess the purity of this batch and report it, we have no idea if this "brown" product is actually as pure as the distributor says it is, despite the discrepancies between colour and purity. Better safe than sorry, really.

Thanks for the info Terratic. Hopefully someone will test and report the purity besides the vendor, I don't have the equipment or moneys to do so otherwise I would. But I will attempt to freebase some of it tomorrow if I have time and see what it becomes.

Hello, i recently recieved a gram and a half of MET. its orangish big chunks/rocks. not sure if its freebase. i recieved it in a trade. anyhoo i cant find much info except this thread and a few TR on erowid. MET sounds great. ive never tried dmt,  the power of it and complete ego loss always scared me away. i have done every tryptamine rc except dpt 5 meo dmt, the true ego dissoluting ones. does this MET compare to DMT at all ? would you consider is recreational ? alot of things can be extremely powerful/psychedelic and not be recreational. currently im just looking for some fun, not a vision quest or white outs. also has anyone taken this orally ? how long did it last ? visuals ? MGS got me interested in this one after i was reading his 4th of july posts, also 2cc ! lol i have yet to try either but have them in my possesion.

i also have a uqestion regarding cross tolerance... most people dont report much tolerance developing to DMT. as this is also a short acting tryptamine thats mainly vaped, is this also making it less prone to tolerance? how would one go about incorporating  small amount in a combo?

PsychedelicSicknes, I don't think MET induces ego loss, unless you shoot a very high dose of cause. It's not really orally active, I think, so you would need a MAOI for that.


kingme, I think for *that* it's probably best to vape it.

Received a report that the orange/brown MET that has recently appeared might not even be MET. I also received a sample of the DPT that showed up around the same time—also an orange-ish brown colour—that either has very significant impurities, or isn't even DPT. I'm pretty sure they were produced by the same lab. The DPT HCl melted before 150°C and almost immediately vaporized; it's supposed to melt at around 174-179°C. Someone told me that the MET is also being falsely represented. 


 Stay safe, guys.

no shit not even real !!! wtf this isnt from the batch from the place that also started selling dpt recently too and plans to sell 2c-ef. i believe this was bought a little while ago and from a diff. site. but yea its straight orang ISH and has some big rocks. ill find out where he bought it in e mails hopefully. i dont want to even test it now. but what the hell ill give it a shot!


is that right MGS. well if a newb loved it then it sounds pretty fun/gentle. what were u dosing him ? ive had a couple s/n throughout the ten years or so ive been on this site, and ive always heeded your word MGS. i remember i was 17 asking you for advice on 2ct2, i know u wont remember bc i was a newb on another s/n years ago lol 


WISH ME LUCK GUYS !! ITS EITHER PLAIN AL-LAD OR AL-LAD WITH MET THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT, sorry about caps lock lol

My friend (who is the original LIGHT WEIGHT in my world, who had total ego death, OBE on 10mg DPT) was given 7mg to start with, and re-dosed twice at 7mg and 10mg.  He loved it, actually asked to do it again the next day but it wasn't in the stars.  Good 'training' psychedelic.

well, generally I would warn from relying on the appearance of chemical compounds too much. one and the same substance in the highest purity can vary greatly in appearance, just depending on the precise conditions when finally crystallizing out. this is also why one cannot warn from eyeballing too much: white powders can be very fluffy or very dense, so it is impossible to give a precise dose by just looking at it.

I appreciate a lot how positive you respond to constructive critic! I was a bit unsure if I should correct you (as one of the godfathers of bluelight), and it's good to see that we understand each other.


and of course I do not doubt that your collection is well labeled, and that you know the appearance of the compounds in your possession - but still I do think one should take care a bit in a public forum not to give the new members potentially dangerous ideas.

I also received a sample of the DPT that showed up around the same time—also an orange-ish brown colour—that either has very significant impurities, or isn't even DPT. I'm pretty sure they were produced by the same lab. The DPT HCl melted before 150°C and almost immediately vaporized; it's supposed to melt at around 174-179°C. Someone told me that the MET is also being falsely represented.

I just remembered that I have to batches of MET lying around, one is freebase and one is the fumarate salt. to me, it always seemd obvious that this compound has to be freebased (which I enjoy very much), but I am not really sure what I should do with the fumarate. do I have to go through the whole kitchen chemistry process of converting it to freebase (I know it's easy, but I'm laaazy), or are there other useful routes of application? oral is possible, but ineffective, as far as I know. kombining with a MAOI? can one snort it (i.e. what can be said about the water solvability of tryptamine fumarates vs tryptamine HCl s?) or apply it rectally? or shall I just smoke it "as is"? as already others have mentioned in this thread, smoking tryptamines as HCl salt is not the optimal way to go, but very well possible. so what can be said about smoking fumarates? my gut feeling tells me that this is probably a bad idea, since also the anion is an organic molecule that can and will burn, but has anyone actually tried it?

Me too and beneath my smart alec response I am glad you felt ok to tell 'one of the godfathers' what is up.  We do understand each other.  And no one should ever let me (or anyone) say something public that is not right, or can be taken wrong/dangerous....that goes to anybody.  Respect to ungelesene_bettlek.

My vendor just started stocking met and dpt. should I worry about his quality at all? All his other rc's nbome,2c-x,4-subs are great quality always white powder. If he has an impure batch he lists it in the description and cuts the price a bit. But his met is a new product and it's on an "introductory" sale, no reports on sos about the quality of his met and dpt


If you guys have SOS accounts please post the appearance of the met/dpt you got on the vendors page. I dont want to waste my money on shitty product

Met HCL can it be vaporized efficiently? All i can get is hcl and freebasing is a pain. I guess ill freebase some. Also have 3g dpt on the  way can it be vapourized as an hcl salt?

No, not effectively.  That is why the old axiom applies, salts for injecting, snorting and base for smoking.

Probably not a great idea to smoke HCL salts as there's a very good chance they will decompose into hydrogen chloride and the base. Even if most of it does vaporize cleanly, there's bound to be at least a small amount that decomposes and do you really want to inhale hydrogen chloride? I don't even want to smoke tryptamine free bases after trying some 5-MEO-DALT and found it pretty heinous. I'll stick with the 4 subs myself. Orally active and generally more potent anyway. Never tried any plain tryptamines myself. I've read about experimental use of DPT for psychological purposes and they would give rather high doses and invariably the subject would puke their guts out then have very violent themed hallucinations, things like large battle scenes. Then they would go through an ego death thing and everything would resolve okay. While that may be good for psychological breakthroughs, I'm not real interested in the preliminary puking and violent hallucinations parts. I think the usual dose was 60 mg if my memory serves me.

There is generally little or no nausea with DPT.  It can happen but many intense psychedelic experiences will cause vomiting in some people.

**MET-hausca world first**


I'm on Parnate. On this day I had taken 40mg prior to and 20mg with the MET, "brown", approx. 200mg.

I'm also on 6g of Piracetam per day.


t=30mins I feel the start, dreamy and sleepy tryptamine feeling. 

t=1hr       CEV are in full swing, they are very slow and messy, not kalaidescopic or geometric at all. Not particularly colourful, either.

t= 1:30    Still in full swing, body discomfort has me restless

t= 2         CEV have stopped, I look out from the bed and my eyes have severe wobbles. Can't see properly

t= 2-4      Restlessness in the body increases throughout this time. There has been no psychedelic insights although at it's peak it was a +++

t= 4:30    5mg Olanzapine taken, doesn't really work to settle the trip

t= 6         Starts to fade and become comfortable again.


Comments: I'm not very impressed with this compound. I had expected more. 50mg MiPT was more interesting (see report in MiPT thread). MET-huasca in no way resembles DMT pharm-"ayahuasca". Why is it that if the N-moiety is unbalanced in the tryptamine molecule there is not as much excitement? Why shouldn't MET be midway between DMT and DET? (not that I've had DET). I'd like to try smoking this without any MAOI or Piracetam in my body before I pass final judgement.

You took 200mg and got substandard effects? Oral or what?

Last night I did an IM dosage of 35mg with 30mg MXE and it was fucking amazing. I was completely blown away with how strong and powerful and in-depth the visuals were. I had done a MXE trip the night before of 40mg so there was even a slight tolerance. If you're willing, I would consider IM, it's how I take all my unsubstitued tryptamines.

^Yes IM MXE/MET is quite a ride. MET was coined "DMT lite" for a reason, plus you took it orally. Attempt to smoke it or IM it past 70mgs and its pretty damn intense, though not in the same manner as DMT exactly....

I generally consider myself a hardhead for tryptamines, if anything based off the dosing chart you seem just a bit hardheaded for MET.

No, I simply enjoy strong psychedelic experiences. For instantace I rarely smoke less than 50 mgs of DMT. As I stated anything above 45mgs IM(IM being the key here)would blow me out of the water. I did and do have a tolerance, as I do partake in psychedelics quite often at times. Also simple short acting tryp's don't really form tolerance like normal long duration ones. Though I suppose having pre existing tolerance may have some effect but in my experience it really doesn't much as it didn't when I frequently smoked DMT, I may have heightened the doses but again I enjoy high dose experiences. I believe it was coined lite because it doesn't have as strong as a "rushing\rocketing to the moon" effect that DMT does coming up and at least IMO has a calmer space than DMT.

Well, I agree with you on all points. "Lite" just seems derogatory when the substance certainly is a very powerful and amazing chemical. Definitely does not have the rushing qualities that DMT does though.

Exactly why they named it that! There's also nothing derogitory about, its like the inbetween DMT/DET each more powerful hence the "lite" nickname! Like stated though it can be every bit as powerful but it comes on easily and seems to last a bit longer theother simples, in my experince at least!

My friend recieved the canadian met hcl that's going around, terratic said he has reason to believe it's not MET? can anyone confirm this? he hasn't logged on for months.


Is there any HARM in vaporizing hcl vs freebase or is it just a matter of efficiency? Could this be converted to freebase in the same was as cocaine (hopefully this isnt considered synth talk)?

Ok well, MET (or atleast this brown canadian batch) was a flop for me and a friend, 15mg vaped produced no real effects except an uneasiness, felt slightly off the rest of the day in me. Friend vaped 30mg with similar effects if not less (aka, could all be placebo). Technique was good, I have quite a lot of experience with dmt. Not sure if this is a problem with this batch or not but Im dissapointed and all MET research will be over with.


What it DID do though is cause my breath to reak of dmt going on 24hrs now, gum, food, mouthwash etc I still catch a wiff every 5 mins, sort of disconcerning. I've been avoiding face to face conversations all day lmao.

You just need to smoke the base.  Base from 2008ish was fully active at under 10mg.  Probably twice as potent as DMT.  Few other folks tried it with me and found it much the same.

Nah man, not at all.  I have no need to patronize others based on how hard they trip.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I was suggesting that the hcl salt does not vaporize well, and the base is fully active at under 20mg.

I had a question about conversion of MET hcl to freebase.  Would it be the same as a DPT conversion? Basify water, add MET hcl, mix, add Naptha, mix again, remove naptha, freeze percipitate or evaporate. 

Would this work? Or am I missing something here? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

That canadian MET came from the same lab that made that shitty brown canadian DPT, so it's most likely just a shit batch. Mine is super brown and the moment I opened the bag it started to clump and now it's one big sticky mess of chunky crap. I think I'm going to throw it away honestly and wait until I find a different source. At least that chemist has been disavowed now and our canadian friends are back to their top notch quality standards.

Well if you have a freebase, it'd be wise to salt it first. Erowid says that the dose should be around 15mg to 25mg, though with DMT a nasal dose is about double a vaporized one. So I'd start in the suggested area and titratre upwards slowly.


Oral doses might be active too, could be worth a shot depending on how much you have if duration is what you're looking for.

Intranasal DMT and 5-MeO-DMT makes for a milder experience yeah, and the dose is indeed higher. Was mostly worth it for me when combined with K.


Not sure what is viable for MET, you may have to salt it indeed or it would take so much intranasally that it would be hard and painful to get a good trip off it. Oral requires very high dosages.


IM 5-MeO-DMT and DMT were effective for me, the DMT acted for a pretty damn long time that way. I really dislike vaping.

I bet you'd need either a maoi or a huge dose or find it inactive. At least that's what happened to me with any unsubstituted trypt.

How come?


I like the fact that the close to instant come up makes it easy do get the right dose, especially with things with very long comeups/hls (so it's been 4h since I took some 2c-p and I'm not feeling much... did I dose to low or just right or  too high + the duration is much lower so you aren't high too long + much less nausea, but it is disgusting). Other things like some stims (a-pvp and relatives, except 4f-pvp) and dissos (o-pce, 3-meo-pce) taste fine and retain the advantages.... even the salts are fine.

I feel like vaporized DMT violates the user in that it rips them violently out of normal reality with no warning, and leaves them confused and emotional afterwards. It's a lot like sexual assault, except beautiful.


I'm a total idiot, however, and I've never smoked it or done it at all, so who am I to describe it in any way. Does anyone think the duration for intranasal MET would be under 3 hours?

Yeah it should be around there. It lasts longer than DMT but not that much longer. I don't think it's like sexual assault. More like being uncomfortably for a few minutes to the moon. Then serenity and absolute beauty's.

I felt the same about vaping DPT - dirty, violating, unnatural. I've stopped using that ROA. I stick to intranasal now, which is a bit yucky, but it feels better to my being.

well I am getting some of this that is supposed to be an orange powder fumarate.


I have read no reports on plugging the fumarate. Any ideas on if it should be good to go as is, good to go with addition of something, no good like plugging freebase oil? Would converting the fumarate to hcl be possible with retail store supplies and would that be pluggable?


Would just really rather avoid vaping it if I can. DPT hcl plugged is wonderful. hoping this MET fumurate is as well... will let you guys know in a week or two probably

I'm afraid I can't answer your questions, but I definitely will be looking forward to what you have to say about it. I've got the fumarate as well and I was thinking about plugging it to avoid the wonderfully violent puke that's started off my oral base tryptamine experiences so far.

My vote would be to freebase it.  MET acetate IMed was good but not remarkable.  Never snorted or plugged it but when vaporized, MET base is a real delight.  Light and clear, more like DMT than DPT.  Very colorful psychedelic lasting about 45 minutes.  Id kill your loved ones for another gram of MET freebase.

Dude. No killing needed, just BTC.


If I dont hear anything else I will probabably start with plugging small amounts and see where that goes. If it works ala DPT I will probably be good. Perhaps convert to freebase for lulz. My one DMT vaporized trip had me where I would have shot myself if I had a gun and I gave the rest away. On the other hand I have plugged grams of DPT...

Don't want to derail the thread, but yepyepwoah how do you like plugging DPT? Have you ever plugged it along with a dissociative? And one more how is the dose for you compared to say, nasal? I know many questions but I've been using DPT a lot, probably acquiring more and was thinking about doing the same for MET. Plugging seems the way I'm leaning for both

I know many questions but I've been using DPT a lot, probably acquiring more and was thinking about doing the same for MET. Plugging seems the way I'm leaning for both

DPT always with a disso. Favoriites are either K or MXE. usually plug 30-50mg DPT, sometimes a second dose an hour or two later. If I use MXE, I plug both at same time. If K, plug DPT, then snort K. Have never snorted DPT,  so I can't compare dosages. It is generally accepted plugged DPT dose is much less than snorted.

Can a substance be partially soluble in something like acetone, or is it either an it is or it isn't.


MET came back 125mg our of an original 225mg tester acetone wash. Pure cold acetone.. It was an ugly redish colour I didn't feel like putting in my body without at least trying something. Tried 20mg of the washed the day I got it (which was two days after tripping quite well, so tolerance and such). Was on a lot of dissasociatives so it was hard to tell, but I swear I felt a tryptamine vibe. I am gonna give it from thirty minutes from now til sunday probably untill I try 50 or 75mg plugged.

Chemicals can be more or less soluble dependent ontge solvent used. The more soluble, the more you can get in a lesser amount of a solvent. Luckily MET is one of the simple tryptamines which has a much less considerable tolerance affliction than other tryptamines. IM MET and MXE was truly amazing. I can't wait until I try it with IM DCK.

Are you saying I can dose MET more often (daily etc) than most other chems, ala DMT?


I ended up plugging 60mg MET and 50mg "mxe" on Wednesday. I say mxe because a known selective scammer (mostly on bulk) just posted a listing for MXE they just "found" stored away. It was cheap enough to give a go, acetone washed it to 700mg/1g. This stuff feel enough like MXE I will probably grab a few more.


Holy fucking MET. The first hour my entire visual sphere was filled with something. When I closed my eyes I was presented different visions depending on where I was facing. I started out sitting up meditating. Spent most of the first hour bent forward, with my forhead touchng tge ground. After an hour I crawled into bed and writhed to pure waves of bliss for another hour or two. MET seems most welcoming. All I got was a "Hey, so glad to see you, so glad you made it." Beautiful, i wanted to dose again, but it was late and I had work.


Going back to MET being soluble in acetone. I took pure acetone, mixed with baked epsom salts, and let cool overnight. Leftover water shouldnt be an issue.


I took 225mg MET and 5ml acetone and shook vigoursly in glass vial. Pour over  coffee filter resting inside of a cup. Used another 15-20ml acetone to rinse glass vial pouring all that over MET on coffee filter. Leaving me with 125mg that was more brown than "this is an ugly rust red".


I figure I can either wait a week for tolerance (although I had 2cd/4homipt Sunday, sampled 20mg of washed MET plugged and got nothing Tuesday, then 60mg of the washed MET Wednesday and was blown out of the water

...)  and try 60mg of the non washed. Either that or rewash what I have left and see if I lose any more.


The. MET is pretty cheap and dude allready offered me more at 1/2 price for feedback, so I will probably just 2x wash it and see what happens.

I've got a secondhand trip to report on this one, not with too much intimate detail but it sure is promising.


The tripper was a 67 year old man with almost 50 years worth of psychedelic experience. In his earlier experimenting days he had used LSD hundreds of times, mushrooms at least many times, peyote at least a couple times, DOM once, and a wide variety of non-psychedelic substances, and recently he has also tried 2C-I, 4-HO-DPT, 4-HO-MPT, and MET once each, and DMT twice. He loves the DMT and found the lower dose of MET promising. 2C-I and 4-HO-DPT were a little too weak for him, and 4-HO-MPT was very intense and interesting but gave him a heavy body load. The MET was the research chemical he was definitely most interested in exploring again, so this was his second experience with it.


The MET was taken from a supply I gave him the first time, first measured to 75 mg before later having 25 mg removed, so the remaining amount that should have been around 50 mg was used. I prepared it for him by lacing it into a bowl of cannabis and let him take care of the actual dosing and everything himself. He smoked the whole thing over the course of maybe the first five minutes.


He initially described feeling as though he was just coming up on an extremely intense and relaxing cannabis high. As it sank in we briefly discussed the mechanistic overlaps between psychedelics and cannabinoids and the possible explanations for this relationship. After a few more minutes he started describing visuals appearing with closed eyes, saying that they were less intense than the geometry of DMT but of a very similar nature. After a few more minutes he didn't seem much more altered still and hadn't described much more of a trip so I figured that we might have just shot a little too low for whatever reason, whether it degraded while sitting around or he torched it too much or what, so I just kept occasionally conversing with him about the workings of psychedelics and taking breaks of just letting him sit there and relax. He had his eyes closed most of the time because opening them would make him feel almost entirely sober again.


After maybe twenty minutes or so I asked if he wanted to put on any music or anything, and he started picking some things to listen to. At this point he became slightly more talkative and divulged a bit of his trip to me. It turned out, contrary to what I thought, he had definitely hit the mark and beyond and had been having a full-blown experience. He has not had a DMT breakthrough yet and hasn't really read any literature on it, but I knew that he knew when he started talking about closing his eyes and finding that he was suddenly transported somewhere entirely different. He said that he could repeatedly go back and forth between these other worlds and complete normalcy just by opening and closing his eyes, and not only that this had been happening, but that it still was while he was explaining this to me with his eyes closed. As he did so he also started taking different poses and talking about the overwhelming amounts of energy flowing out of him, and how the music had begun driving the trip as well.


He continued going into other worlds for at least an entire hour, feeling great and loving the music the whole time, and in the end only stopped when he decided he had had enough for now and was ready to gently come down. He was very grateful for the experience and definitely seemed to enjoy it more than any other trip I've seen him have lately. He also did not ever describe any sort of body load at any time.


So that's the end of that. I think I'm going to try a similar dose myself soon based on this. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

MET isn't bad, but it seems a bit dull to me. Tonight however, after smoking some MET, I decided to smoke a small amount of MPT, then some DPT. The MPT made it a little more colorful and interesting, but the DPT really added what was missing.


MET with DPT is a wonderful combination. It feels like a more complete experience than either alone. It's much more powerful than MET alone, less dark and weird than DPT alone, and more visual and euphoric than either by itself. The MPT contributed too, but it was a minor component in the experience.

More MET than DPT. I smoked 25mg MET freebased with baking soda and 7mg  MPT. I didn't weight the DPT, but I'd guess it was somewhere around  15mg. So 2 parts MET to 1 part DPT seems about right. I recommend the  MET first, then slowly adding DPT.


I think the addition of MPT isn't necessary because it's similar to MET, and DPT should add enough character to the trip. It certainly doesn't hurt to add some though. I'll probably keep things simple and save my MPT to smoke by itself.

Earlier this week I tried MET for the fourth time. Previously I had smoked it at 20, 30, and 35 mg, all to varying degrees of relatively threshold effect. This time I decided to go all in and smoke 50 mg, a dosage that someone else I had shared with had already claimed gave them a powerfully hallucinogenic and euphoric experience lasting over an hour. Lately I have been in the mood of trying to simply enjoy my trips without monitoring so much after a long period of writing in-depth reports for basically every one of my experiences, so I really wasn't keeping notes like that or anything for this trip either, and unfortunately it had a fairly strong amnesiac effect for me too, but this is what I can recall of the experience right now....


I smoked the 50 mg of MET layered between cannabis in a bong while leaning back in my recliner in my living room; I want to say it only took me two hits to finish everything off that I had loaded, but it's hard to recall now and I may have taken a third at least for good measure. I was perfectly comfortable to finish taking my hits fully and calmly place the bong down on the table next to me, though there was indeed a sense of urgency near the end as the effects were quickly appearing in a very DMT-like way.


As I still had the bong in my hands I could see the world with eyes open beginning to transform, large streaks of rainbow neon lights bursting through the seams of reality into the room around me, flashes of illuminated geometry arranged into some kind of alien carnival design, and a subtle distortion rippling over my entire field of vision as a dim, transparent vine-style mandala pattern played with my vision from behind and started incorporating increasingly complex maze designs into its textures. The visuals overall had an artistic design that resembled 4-HO-MET much more than either DMT or psilocin would for me, particularly in terms of their hedonsitic and wide-reaching color patterns and noticeably technological designs, but notably they were still more like these two natural tryptamines overall than like 4-HO-MET for me, in the sense that MET, DMT, and psilocin for me all seem to produce their visual experiences by creating extremely complex but subtle and transparent patterns that slowly build up to the point of being fully overwhelming as the trips become really intense, whereas with 4-HO-MET, I find the open eye visuals that first appear to be of relatively lower complexity but almost completely opaque, extremely vibrant and sharp in a way that makes them especially nice for recreational trips aimed at getting visuals. On the other hand, the MET visuals felt better suited to me for going deep, at least compared to 4-HO-MET.


Shortly after I had set the bong down and had started seeing all these open eye visual effects unfold, I closed my eyes as I generally would for the peak when smoking DMT. This is the part that is hardest for me to remember now unfortunately, but what I do recall is pretty significant.... Primarily, where I found myself was in a sort of transforming, extending out in all directions infinite hallway which I also experience regularly on DMT, where the hallways are comprised of human or humanoid hallucinations arranged in various poses extending back away from me, and as they shift poses and behaviors the hallways completely rearrange themselves, and in addition, with the strongest version of this effect that I have experienced on DMT there is a sort of synesthesia that accompanies the experience, one where I can feel my body merging into and becoming these transforming hallucinations, usually with an erotic vibe, and this was happening this time on the MET as well. The difference is that when DMT does this for me the trip is extremely intense in pretty much all ways, already a total sensory overload and really emotional experience for me, which makes this incredible and hedonistic experience mostly just a cool afterthought for me lost in the madness of everything else going on, whereas on this MET experience the visuals were as I said very powerful but still not yet overwhelming on the level of DMT's for the same trip, and the headspace was almost completely lucid and calm other than the feeling of extreme intensity, and these things together caused the erotic synesthesia to completely dominate the experience as a whole, as I saw beautiful female entities drift past me while reaching out to me and rip my sense of self apart in the most bizarre and blissful ways without any distraction. The experience was so intense that at the heaviest point I felt that I was almost pushed to a spontaneous orgasm, but I didn't quite make it.


Once I had reached that point I got about as satisfied as I felt I was going to get from it, I opened my eyes again and scanned the room, and shortly after quickly moved to my bedroom to lie down. The visuals with open eyes were still more subtle than 4-HO-MET, but still very powerful nonetheless and definitely more complex than that, with my room still pulsing and twisting and shining in all kinds of brilliant neon color patterns to the point that my body was starting to shake a bit just from the sensory overload. I was a bit too heavy to do much with it still at first, but I think about twenty to twenty five minutes after dosing got a sudden rush of energy as I normally do, so I got up and enjoyed dancing to a few songs while I could, though this was late at night and I was still quite tired. After I wore myself out I sat down and started reflect on life and my recent behaviors while enjoying the slowly dwindling visuals and body high until I was completely down about two hours after starting.


Overall, I loved this experience, though I wish I could remember more of it in detail. Future experiences will help with that I'm sure.... For now, I'll just say that it definitely feels a lot like DMT to me but more easygoing, orgasmic, and filled with bright neon colors similarly to how 4-HO-MET is compared to psilocin for me, and I would even say that this trip furthered an earlier instinct I had that some qualities of MET could superficially be compared to a DOx chemical much like I often feel 4-HO-MET has some superficial similarities to a 2C-x chemical, though again with less focus as I still find MET to focus more on the DMT-like qualities overall. It's not as powerful of a trip in general as DMT for me so far but it is a very similar trip that is more recreational and long-lasting, so that alone makes it definitely very interesting in my book, and I am now highly interested to see what else it will be able to show me with more trials and higher dosages.


However... that's all I've got for now. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I'm pretty glad to have gotten my hands on what I have. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Honestly, I'm very quickly falling in love with the base tryptamines here, they're all completely fantastic and impressive psychedelics when used right as far as I can tell.... I'm sure you won't go wrong with MPT and MiPT, they're two of the most impressive hallucinogens I've sampled yet personally. However, if you do get a chance to get your hands on MET, I absolutely would recommend it too! Of all of them, MET is probably the one that feels the most like DMT to me overall, but still lighter in terms of ease of use and recreational value, but not power.... It's certainly still a very powerful psychedelic overall despite it's comparatively easier nature, just like 4-HO-MET is compared to psilocin, just one with a bit of a different focus. I think it's something a psychedelic veteran like yourself in particular would really appreciate....


What I really want to know right now myself is just how far it can be pushed into breakthrough territory.... Think I'm gonna aim for more like 60-70 mg next time. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Could someone please post reagent test results for MET? I am unsure of the identity of my sample and it seems there are no published test results for MET (despite many people supposedly having tried it!)

So, reading this thread MET seems to be a more recreational, lighter on the mind DMT?


If so, would it be accurate to say, 4-aco-dmt is to DMT as 4-ho-met is to MET? *generally *​speaking

Pretty much so.


Its very hedonistic, and hard to say why...8)


I've made "changa" with MET last time when I was freebasing it because I was tired of dealing with a sticky wax. 


Equal amounts of sodium carbonate (dried baking soda) was mixed with MET fumarate in a large metal spoon, a small amount of purified water was added and the mixture was heated very gently underneath using torch lighter. After few minutes of mixing, the spoon was submerged in a glassware filled with 96% isopropyl alcohol. The glass vessel was put in a water bath to allow evaporation of IPA, extra amounts of soda were eventually left sticked on walls of the glass as the evaporation was going on.

When only little amount of liquid left, dried smoke mix (damiana, passion flower, lemon balm, sage) and a corresponding amount of Harmala seeds extract were added. It was thoroughly mixed and the remaining IPA was fully evaporated by spreading it on a glass sheet and allowed to air dry. Was left with an aromatic herb mix.

*Make sure to not ever use open fire when evaporating solvents! When making such blends for the first time, you must account the fact that Harmala seeds extract is a MAO inhibitor and posses certain health risks, so always start your experimentation with low dose.*


Result upon vaporizing? Gentle, calm, powerful... Gets really nice and deep, I can do it all day literally. Feels very meditative, healing.

Have not gone for a breakthrough yet and just have been maintaining the steady high for hours. Very nice afterglow afterwards, deeply satisfying experience! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Yeah I didn't call it DMT lite for no reason! I'll never ever forget the days I spent iM'ing it with MXE my gawds! The couple of times I added some O-desmethyltramadol with hydroxzyine from an IM vial of it......SO EUPHORIC! Obviohsly! I can't wait to try some again someday! I'm sure it pairs really nice with O-PCE!

You can definatly plug this, as well as DPT. I would say a good starting dose plugged is 30mg for either. If you have DPT HCL this is the most potent way short of using a needle or converting to freebase.

Not necessarily. The brownish DPT around for so long is much less effective plugged than snorted.

Snorting isn't too bad. It sucked the first time and then I got used to it. I've seen other comments around BL saying DPT isn't as effective plugged as snorted. Now I wonder if it's just this specific batch, only when there's certain other molecules present, or what...

I've never tried snorted. I tried to smoke the HCL like twice in 2012 and decided to try plugging it. like 25mg had me in space. 


Fast forward to 2014/2015 and I start fucking with DPT again. I probably went though a gram-two grams, only plugging. Doses usually from 15mg-50mg. 50mg was about top out territory for a single dose for me, I'm talking full on immersive DPT experience (esp. with mxe or ket). I really liked to stack doses though. LIke plug 20mg and meditate and say hello to DPT (cuz out of all the RC's I've done, that one and 2c-e scare me the most). I could keep plugging more doses (usually like 30mg) with no real diminishing affects. A lot of times on the 2nd or 3rd dose I would mix in a 2c-x. 


Most I ever plugged was like 120mg with a shitton of MXE and MDMA. Without the MDMA I prolly woulda dosesd some etizolam, but with the MDMA I was just like "okay yah, this is probably some of the most intense wild visions I've ever had but fuck it, it's cool. I'm pretty sure I wrote a report about that in the DPT thread or in some PD social a few years back.


My main point being, yah, that batch is probably not good then. If you can't plug 50mg DPT and be in an almost overwhelming experience something is wrong.

Hey guys. Just got my MET. It says from my vendor that it's a fumarate salt... it smells extremely strong of vinegar... or like a sour swimming pool. Was wondering if anyone else had similar experiences with the fumarate?

MET acetate would smell like vinegar. I'm not sure what fumaric acid smells like, but all of the tryptamine fumarates I've ever encountered did not smell acidic.


There sure is a lot of commentary here on the rectal dosage of DPT. I can't imagine that they're all that comparable

True. It *could* be a vendor mix-up, and it's conceivable that you were sent 4-ACO-MET. Be cautious if you have yet to try it. The dosages are not equivalent

I tried the 10 minute sodium carbonate tek and the oil collected on the surface like DMT does but then disappeared into the cloudy solution before I could get to it, very strange.


more research is needed. I’ll let you know if I manage it.


I saw your post before trying which is why I tried with such a small amount first, thanks for the heads up.

Silly idea, but some stuff like aluminium salts, phenols, etc precipitate then go back to solution if you use sodium or potassium hydroxyd, but precipitate ok with amoniac.

Just to test it, would you try a bit with nh4oh ?

Could you potentially make MET infused vape juice in the same way people are making DMT vape juice? 


And man I forgot again, is this stuff that much nastier to smoke than DMT?

Sorry for double post another question, I know this stuff is relatively new, is there ANY reason imaginable that it would be dangerous to mix with MDMA? I'd like to use the MET infused vape juice on the tail-end of candyflips this summer, sounds like a good combo.

There should be no reason for it to be dangerous to mix with MDMA, as it is a serotonin agonist and not reuptake inhibitor or releaser.

Would love to hear about it if you've had any success since this post!


Tried making a tiny bit of freebase 5-ho-met this evening using sodium carbonate, just a tiny bit on a spoon the ghetto way, its all dried now but im not sure when i'll actually try vaping it.


EDIT: *4 ho met

Wait, how would you turn MET into 5-HO-MET?  Do you mean freebase MET?

My bad , I mean't 4-ho-met. I've had some 4 ho met sitting around for ages that I'm 99% sure is fumarate so thought i'd try and convert that fumarate to freebase before actually get and waste a bunch of MET if it doesn't work well. I know they're not the same, but it seems converting tryptamines to freebase from fumarate isn't always the easiest. Consulting the entire internet I can't any success stories of turning MET fumarate into freebase let alone brew up a working vape juice with it.

I had moderate success converting some of the MET I just got into freebase. I got about 80mg of freebase from 200mg of MET fumarate, which is a 50% yield.


I put the MET in a shot glass and added a few ml of potassium hydroxide solution and stirred it a little bit. Then I extracted it a few times with 91% isopropyl alcohol. Isopropanol isn't miscible with potassium hydroxide in water and forms a layer on top. I evaporated the alcohol and ended up with some brownish liquid MET freebase.


I vaporized a small amount in an oil burner and it was good. It was potent and the vapor wasn't nasty.

Very interesting! What made you choose that process over using sodium carbonate? Yours is the first actual success story i've read on getting any freebase out of the fumarate.

I tried using sodium carbonate the last time I had some MET and didn't get good results. This time I wanted to try a different method and I already had the potassium hydroxide.

Since freebasing has proven frustrating for do many people, why not nebulize? If dissolved in something like propylene glycol and used in a nebulizing vape rig, the temperature would not approach that where it might degrade. Onset might be slower than with true vaporization, but I don't think think that would be an issue since it doesn't have DMT's instatolerance issue. It wouldn't be necessary to freebase if used this way, I wouldn't imagine, especially if using a bowl-style instead of wicking nebulizer. Seems safer, too, as the risk of nasty accidental pyrolization byproducts would be greatly reduced.

Seems all the other takes people didn't have success with sodium carbonate either, thats so strange that it would just not work well for some things. Wonder what the chemistry-logic behind this is?


Also, any idea why yours came out as a liquid? I'd just be concerned that liquid would be leftovers from the process if it started as a solid?

It's not uncommon for freebase tryptamines to be a liquid. DPT freebase is usually liquid. I think it has to be exceptionally pure to crystallize. That's probably why nobody is selling it already in freebase form.

That's interesting. I've had luck with EPT, the only one I've attempted it with. While I don't read a lot of reports about it on the forums, I have read several articles in fairly well-known magazines where the use of DMT vape pens in public/concert/festival settings was mentioned. Since I got the idea from a friend overseas that had successfully it by suspending the DMT in a PG/VG solution, I just assumed that was the route most people were using. From reading the forums, it sounds like DMT is tricky, because of the instant tolerance and long time needed to get it into solution. It took me eighteen hours to get EPT in solution, if I remember right. If I experiment more, I'll post on it.

This is common. Heck, with many tryptamines it's more common to end up with a liquid freebase than a crystal. It's quite a pain. The liquid works fine, but it's a pain to weigh and work with, often just easier to use to make enhanced leaf imo.

Here's an anecdotal report of an adverse reaction that you can take for  what it's worth. I've been meaning to write this up for a while. tl;dr  vaporized MET fumarate may have caused lung irritation and bronchitis.


A  friend and I were both pretty much completely recovered from what was  either a bad cold or mild flu. Symptoms were largely gone, but our  energy levels weren't where they normally were. We had been planning a  psychedelic experience for the last two weekends, but had been  sick/busy. On Sunday evening, we decided that the short-acting,  lightweight, friendly, non-challenging experiences that many simple  tryptamines like MET provide wouldn't put too much of a strain on us. 


I  have vaped MET fumarate (and several other tryptamine fumarates)  several times before using a dual quartz coil vape pen to no ill effect,  as has my friend. I'm aware that fumarate salts are unhealthy to  vaporize, but I'm also aware that the actual amount of moles of maleic  anhydride produced is quite small if not inconsequential. The one and  only time my friend vaporized MET before, they mentioned to me that it  felt bad in their lungs, a detail that I forgot about over the  intervening months. I've come across a few other reports of vaporized  MET feeling "caustic" or otherwise harsh when vaporized (would link to  them, but that violates Bluelight rules.)


This time, I used a new  vape pen with a bucket style heating element which my friend was  unfamiliar with. After loading it up, they attempted to inhale before  the powder had melted, and ended up inhaling and ingesting MET  particulate. This engendered an instantaneous coughing fit, followed by  the use of an inhaler. They again mentioned that it felt bad in their  lungs, and that they would never vaporize it again. When I vaporized my  portion, it felt more unpleasant than I remembered, but not especially  noteworthy. I felt like this was probably due to the larger dose, caused  by the marked increase in efficiency of the new vaporizer. 


My  experience started off familiar and pleasant, but quickly escalated into  what felt similar to late stage sourness that I often get from  mushrooms. Just a dark and oppressive, but nonthreatening heavy  atmosphere--utterly unlike the warm positivity I had always experienced  from MET before. This is possibly due to the increased dose, possibly  due to some residual oxidized tryptamines in the bucket vaporizer, or  maybe it just was what it was. I listened to some music and decided to  go for a roll in the hay, which made for a strange experience (as the  vibe was one of separation and alienation instead of warmth and  connection.) The peak was over quickly and was quite manageable even  though it was entirely unpleasant. My friend barely got above baseline,  having inhaled rather than vaporized most of their dose. 


The  following day, my friend was very ill, far more ill than they had been  the week prior. The first day was bad, the second day was worse--the  fever, shaking, and chills made them consider going to the emergency  room. Instead, they went to their GP and were prescribed strong  antibiotics with a best guess diagnosis of bronchitis. The next day,  they began to recover, eventually recovering ten days later. This was  the sickest they have been in their life, apparently.


The next  day, I found myself feeling like I needed to cough, my diaphragm  squeezing little spasms of need, producing nothing to show for it. The  same continued the next day, and the next day. Fourteen days later, I'm  still feeling like I need to cough. I don't smoke or vape anything on a  regular basis, so this is unusual.


Is any of this indicative of  vaporizing MET fumarate as hazardous? Nope. Bronchitis follows a cold,  and cold symptoms can persist for weeks after the infection is gone.  Occam's razor would suggest that this is the more likely explanation.  Still, the instantaneous sensitivity of my friend to the vapor both  times and the dramatic turn of their health immediately afterward really  stuck with me, and I'd be lying if I wasn't puzzled by my persistent  cough. Alone, this still isn't significant, but before I ever with the  other reports of adverse reactions to vaporizing MET on other forums, I  thought I should make mention of it here just in case. For the life of  me, I can't see why MET would be any worse than any other vaporizable  tryptamine.


Needless to say, I won't be following through with my plans above to try it in a nebulizer - I'll stick to other tryptamines. It's a crying shame, too, because I quite liked vaporized MET and other ROAs haven't yet been worth the trouble or expense.

Thanks for sharing that account.  I imagine DMT, which is quite caustic, could severely irritate or even slightly burn the lungs, especially if most of a dose was inhaled.  I haven't seen MET, or know whether it's a freebase or salt you had, or whether a salt, if it was one, would also be caustic, but I can imagine such an event maybe causing some damage leading to infection or a worsening of infection.

zomg I forgot how fun this place was.  can't believe my login worked after a decade or whatever.  you crazy burnouts.


anyway I recently tried MET for the first time, oddly enough that it took this long given my history.  but here it is available so I gave it a try, smoked.


it comes on slowly compared to other substances, which is nice because you aren't overwhelmed.  then it builds and builds over several minutes, mind-melting and physically orgasmic as rushes of pleasure shoot through your brain and body. even an hour later I feel them beyond the cannabis I smoked as well.


to be honest I think this would make a great booster for other substances the way I used 5MEO DMT or salvia previously, but BETTER.

no dark corners,which is both a plus and a minus depending upon your intent, but also feels very organic somehow: the simplicity of the tryp?  I dunno.

Hey, I have been struggling to get my MET fumerate into freebase for smoking. Did you start with freebase or convert it. Looking for advice as the usual methods don?t seem to work for me and many others before.

Hey, went on a funny one and diliberately locked myself out my old account and changed the email address. I still have not had any luck. Maybe I will try your method which a tiny bit like you said. Previous attempts to get it to crash out may have been using too much liquid. I saw a red oil appear and then before I could collect it, it vanished.

Hey guys, I have 1000 mgs (1 gram) of MET fumerate on the way. ive cruised through this thread and see some ppl had trouble freebasing MET? can I vape it as is in a meth bubble? I want to vape 100 mgs of it while peaking on oral 4 aco DMT.... how is this for IV use? i like IV tryptamines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Im thinking if i cant get it to vape in fumerate form, i may try the simple "Foily" method that locals around here use with cocaine hcl. they use sodium (bi) Carbonate with the drug, and a drop or two of h20 to form a paste, this paste is then vaped directly. an instant freebase im assuming...                                                                                                         What is the best for converting tryptamines to bases? sodium hydroxide? ammonia like freebase cocaine is sometimes done? or baking soda like the crack form of freebase?  Im interested in seeing what this compound does when vaped properly. Id like to avoid IV if possible

I believe the reason for trouble vaping is that it comes as a fumarate salt and not a freebase.  If this is the case, then it's readily dissolvable for IV/IM, but not efficient to vaporize.  You'd need to convert it to freebase.  I'd like someone else to chime in though as I'm speaking from memory and haven't tried any of it.

Everyone says its lighter then nn DMT as well. Can i get a breakthrough on i..t? If i smoke 100 mgs or give myself an IV injection, surely i can push it too DMT levels? especially if i hit it peaking on oral 4 aco dmt.... and maybe hit a whippit if possible

There was a new MET trip report added to Erowid not too long ago where they broke through from smoking a high dose. They said it's as strong as DMT if not stronger.

Got my MET in the mail. Looks like Mars soil. rusty red fumarate powder......tried vaping it as is with no success. how is it orally? i might go that route. does it burn to sniff? I  may just take a large dose of 4 aco dmt complimented with oral MET

I think the main issue is lack of user reports of successfully converting MET to freebase, lots of cases of people having difficulties with the teks that work for DMT fumarate. Why? I'm not sure, but I bet its relatively simple chemistry.


Also, on the note of smoking/vaping fumarate, I posted this in another thread but I think it's useful here as well. I emailed psychonaut wiki about adding a warning about smoking fumarate (lots of posts about this around), and he was telling me that its actually misinformation, here is the reply:


*"I have previously investigated this topic and concluded that there is unlikely to be any harm from conversion of fumarate into maleic anhydride upon vaporisation and inhalation and this conclusion has been seconded by qualified chemists with whom I have discussed this issue.


Assuming a typical dose of 20mg for most fumarate salt compounds that would be used through vaporisation, for the hemifumarate salt (the most likely form of this salt in this context), 20mg of the compound would include 4.2mg of fumarate, but for simplicity's sake and  as a catch-all for cases where a 1:1 ratio may have been used lets say that would be 10mg of fumarate being added. If we assume a 100% conversion rate for all of the fumarate into maleic anhydride (which is extremely unlikely, but that's beside the point for this example) this would yield maleic anhydride levels which are above the safe exposure level for humans; however, maleic anhydride is readily hydrolysed into maleic acid in the presence of water, which is safe to the extent that it's even used as a sour flavouring, and thusly there is by a very large margin sufficient water present in the lungs to hydrolyse 10mg of maleic anhydride so therefore vaporisation of fumarate salts at levels that would be reasonably possible for any of the relevant compounds on PsychonautWiki should be of no concern."*


REGARDLESS, fumarate is very difficult if not impossible (given the average users resources and dexterity) to vaporize properly. I read a very easy to understand explanation of why this is; freebase works because freebasing a chemical increases the range between the temperature at which the substance vaporizes and when the substance burns. Effectively, you get a way more generous window for error in getting the vaporization temperature right, avoiding burning it. Fumarate has an incredibly small window of temperatures at which is vaporizes readily and burns, so you need to be incredibly precise. On top of all this, fumarate from user reports is not pleasant at all to inhale, but this could just be because they are likely burning a lot.

I have yet to try MET, for some reason. It sounds really lovely though. Perhaps I should get some.*


Heh heh, yes i deleted all my posts from those years ago, after April was busted by the DEA, believing I could erase all evidence of human consumption from the net.  ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I've aquired 250mg furmerate. I'm not going to freebase it. How is this substance orally/plugged/nasally? I assume duration plugged/nasally is about the same as DPT? And what dosage +- compares to let's say 100mg nasally/plugged DPT?

I'm afraid that I wouldn't consider MET to be comparable to DPT. A lot of people have said that it's DMT-like, but my experience is that it's much, much, much, much lighter. It's gentle and a little visual with a nice emotional quality to it, just really wonderful stuff. It has never rocked my world, and that has been when vaporized. I have tried both insufflated and rectal dosing, and found them to be pleasant but rather lackluster compared to vaporization. I feel like it would take a lot of rather expensive material to get anywhere with them via rectal (which would be expensive) and probably more than I would physically want up my nose anyway.


I had good luck vaporizing the fumarate salt. Although my freebase obviously worked better, it was harder to weigh and manipulate. I'm not particularly worried about the practically insignificant amount of maleic anhydride that may be released by vaporizing the fumarate, but I agree that the risk of harmful pyrolization byproducts produced by this ROA isn't negligible. In a perfect world, it would be inexpensive enough to use a proper dose orally without having to take a reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor.

I keep reading on and on in this thread looking to find just a few more instances of insufflation. Since snorting the ACO's and the HO's is pretty much my favorite way to ingest these trypts, and I have a nose of steel, I'll be trying the same dose that Dondante first tried. 15 mg.


There's NO way it can be any more painful than snorting 2C-I. That was like catching a sledge hammer in the face.

I didn't find it to be painful via this route, just impractical. Maybe it will be different for you. Some people have had strong effects from MET, but I (a lightweight) have found it hard to get to a desired level of effects from vaping 3x that amount. The most I've insufflated was ~20mg iirc, and I didn't feel much. Rectal was easier to manage dose-wise, but also proved to be disappointing. It just provided some mild stimulation. I think I would need a vastly higher dose to get anywhere, and that's not practical financially and not pleasant nasally.

i never understood why so many people snorted certain chemicals proven long ago best vaporized or orally ingested


and insufflation is harder on the system than smoking 


yeah it's cool to snort sh*t but other than that a stupid idea when it comes to base tryps and 4 subs

Have you ever done a bump of 4-ACO-DMT? Or the other trypts? It's literally the best way to do a 4 hr microdose, or just have a banging come up. 4 mg is perfect for academic endeavors and studying, and surprisingly effective during training. If the required dose is over 10 mg for an effect via the nose, then insufflation is not practical IMO. It should be potent enough to not require a volume of powder that would destroy your sinuses for days after the event. I'm trying to feel this one out and see if it meets my criteria. If 15 mg works out, I'd bet the next escalation would be ingestion or plugging for me personally, unless I can convert the fumarate salt to a freebase.


Comeup (snorted) is 40 mins regardless of dose for the 4 subs, hits pretty strong (dose determines the strength of the experience really), but in my experience, you're in and out faster when you insufflate. Which is appealing to me for personal reasons, at certain times.


If I was going to smoke this shit, I'd need to convert the salt to a freebase to hit it properly. I have nothing against oral or smoking, but it's a matter of preference. Having only enough to do a few experiments with is restrictive, but them's the breaks!

I'd have to say that there is times where either could be preferable. Depends on the context, the situation, the drug, the volume of drug required and the duration of administration, purity etc etc etc. Many many reasons could be discussed. But for this particular case, preference and the state (fumarate salt) dictate the preferable ROI (Route of ingestion).

True enough, I shouldn't make sweeping pronouncements in an alcoholic haze- in fact I enjoy a light dusting of 5meoDMT insufflated, but only oh so oh so little.  Insufflate too much accidentally and wind up in a state of akathisia, your tongue popping in and out of your head like a cuckoo clock, hoping to hell it's going to stop.  Possibly.  ![:rolleyes:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f644.png)

 I do like your take on the whole nuance of when and why various ROI's are preferable over others given context. I'm guilty of posting while high and sometimes I read what I wrote and have to put my tail between my legs and apologize, or edit, or both sometimes haha. We're pretty much all open minded friends here on BL. Collaboration and open discussion is what makes this platform so attractive. Also, the types that frequent these Quasi underground forums is much more intellectual by and large than the traffic typically found on reddit. So for that, I appreciate your assessment whilst in the throws of an alcoholic haze. It's nice to just toss it up and see what comes back in the Bluelight Ethos. All positive vibes, playful judgment jabs at times, but generally agreeable and productive dialogue.


Anyway, to add my 5 mg up the schnoz experiment. It was definitely attempting to shift my state to a more ethereal realm. But the low dose and the grossness of the chem in my sinuses made me just stop there and re-plan my next psych use, appreciating the very subtle mood lift and slight energy increase, but no change in the + range to be reported (half a + maybe). Thought about going for another 10 - 15, but the rust like smell and the very prevalent after taste / sensation made me think that boofing at 10 - 20 mg would be a good next step. I'd pondered injecting trypts, but the only reasonable candidates would be 4-ACO-DMT, and my other fav, 4-ACO-MET at low doses. Anyway, my hedonistic junkey brain needs to just calm down and try boofing the 15 of MET fumarate first after a period of abstinence and see how things go from there. I won't expect much, but boofing is literally the next most effective way for pharmacological entities to pass into the blood stream bypassing first hepatic metabolism, since the colin is designed to reabsorb excess water from the... digested material which is moved into the area for just that reason. Re-absorption of water and nutrients which have been altered by the bacteria in the large intestine. This is the 2nd most effective ROA next to IV injection, from my first hand morphine slamming / plugging days. Plugging was almost exactly as potent, with a slightly (10 min longer) come up. I feel like this could be extrapolated to any other water soluble compound should it make it's way into your inquisitive psychonaut butthole. Hell, I may even try some particular amino acids ala boof some day. For science maybe? Was also planning injecting Acetyl-L-Carnitine as a way to upregulate androgen receptor density amongst a host of other positive physiological effects. It's an amino, so I'd say it should be pretty safe. So many experiments, so little time.

Just had my first go with MET (fumarate) a few days ago and to start off I think it's a fantastic chemical. I didnt weigh my dose I rather just treated it like DMT, and threw approx 40mg on a base of weed, covered with ash a dash of met and then again covered with ash.


I got an ember slowly going and took in two deep tokes. Immediately a dmt like tryptamine feel began to take hold and I was filled with a sense of trippy joy and euphoria. It wasnt very visual, but I suspect at higher doses it will become a bit more so. Instinct tells me that hitting MET and than dmt a few minutes in would lead to a very visually rich place.


In this instance I was happy with just the MET and I allowed myself to be swallowed by its embrace. My experience lasted easily an hour with maybe 2 hours of gradually declining trippiness. 


I look forward to trying more in a less improv setting.


A day later some ketamine fell on my lap, which I indulged in at a heavy dose and I hit the original pipe for any remaining residue, I crawled into bed and just melted happy.

I suspect that you would quite like MET, Xorkoth. I think it is really in the goldilocks zone of richness, emotionality, depth, pleasure, warmth, eroticism, and healing. I rarely take it because I have so little. It's one of the few that I really wish I had a lifetime supply of laying around, but sadly that's not the case.

You're very right I forgot to mention the enhanced eroticism, I def think it would be a great tool for intimacy

So a few weeks have passed and I've gotten to know MET much better. My 1st experience was by far the most intriguing, possibly because it was novel.


I can now say that MET is more DET like than DMT like. I have taken it up to approx 100mg (smoked/vaped) and even at that level there are minimal OEVs. It can get pretty active CEVs but still not comparable to DMT, DPT, psilos, 4-ho-met.. It's very relaxing and warm to me and everyone I've shared it with. One friend, who was actively on mushrooms at the time actually fell "asleep" mid trip. 


I would very much like to combo it with DMT at some point combining the peaks. The MET hits pretty strong initially and gradually gets stronger until the 15-20 minute mark, where it than slowly recedes. Main effects are almost always gone by 1 hr, and then I am left with about another hour of residuals. 


I've also tried DPT which is way trippier, uncomfortable, and fast paced. I find MET to be one of most gentle psychedelics in existence. It's very very nice, but if you're expecting to be transported to a different dimension or even a strong CEV journey you may be dissapointed

I'am glad if you enjoyed. I would like to ask some question if you are experienced with it. Did you use fumarate or HCL? Not really clear for me which is the better and why. I'm just got a few days ago 0,5 fumurate which is  brown dusty type nuggets. Can I smoke this? A little bit affraid to try because I was read about the inpurity a lot in this thread. Not so much information on other sites.  Your MET how is it looks?

My MET is the fumarate salt and is a light tan powder with small clumps. I cant speak for your material but mine smoked quite easily

I don't mean to double post as I just made a post about this last week.

But I was able easily convert MET Fumarate to a freebase oil using sodium hydroxide basified water and then a mixture of xylene and toluene(possibly just xylene or toluene would work alone) to capture the basiified MET.

This was then evaporated down and then collected and pit into a pressure vac (like for making thc shatter) for about 5 hours to.remove any resididual solvent.

The basified end product was EXTREMELY visual for me which caught me off guard....now I used this same method to convert some DPT hcl to freebase which worked amazingly well and had vaped sone basified DPT oil on a "ceramic flavor disc" in a bong with no water a few days before so it's possible that there was some residual DPT in the ceramic flavor disc.

I will report back when I try it in a fresh ceramic disc but it's possible that it's much more active as a freebase when vaped vs the fumarate. 

Also, my batch of MET was very very old which I got for free from a now defunct RC company and was completely red in appearance and made a red oil freebase.

It was very neat when I added the solvent and saw all the red move from the basified water to the solvent....the basified water was nearly clear after it migrated to the to the xylene/toluene.

Very very interesting. I havent found the fumarate to be very visual (mostly peripheral with color enhancement), and I've taken it to approx 100mg. so maybe I will give this a try. 


I dont find dpt to be particularly visual (OEV at least) but I do find it more visual than MET so I wonder if any residue may have colored the experience.


Also it's a "vacuum oven" I think you meant to say.


My biggest worry would be that toluene has a pretty high boiling point and difficult to remove at temps that wouldnt hurt the tryptamine. It is a bit surprising regarding your discovery of low solubility of tryptamines in naptha tho.

Yes it was a vacuum pressure oven I'm not sure but I set it to 125 degrees but I'm not sure if that was Fahrenheit or Celsius...it's whst the guy at the grow store told me he set his too for making shatter when I bought the unit back in the day and of course it let it go to maximum pressure.

It bubbled at first and I.let it go while I was sleeping and check it when I woke up and it was no longer bubbling which is how I used to make dabs when I grew weed for my old medical grow.

So far only DMT is suitable for extraction with naphtha...everything from DPT to most 4 subbed trips have very poor solubility in naphtha....this is why I've been experimenting with a mixture of xylene and toluene at 50/50 ratio just to be sure I'm.getting the based synthetic tryptamines.  I'm not sure if just xylene or just toluene work as effectively.

They should behave very similarly. If toluene works by itself that's what I'd opt for because xylene has a much higher boiling point at 138c compared to toluene 110c. Toluene is much easier to strip

I've had some nearly blindingly open eye visual MET trips and my father has actually broken through on it and lucidly described other worlds behind his eyes for almost an hour after smoking it. This is just from smoking the salt in a bowl of cannabis, too. There's definitely more potential in MET than I think most people appreciate, but maybe it just has a high threshold for piercing that veil for a lot of people.


[This is an Erowid report about it that I always liked.](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=112304) The most notable part here:


> What followed was one the most intense experiences of my entire life. Dwarfing all of 100+ previous DMT trips.

> 
> Obviously these trips are completely indescribable. All I can attest to was the level of intensity, detail, realism and colour was higher than anything I had ever had before. In a vain attempt to actually describe what was happening I would say I was staring into the face of a multi headed, multi bodied, almost robotic like creature with millions of eyes, perpetually changing shape and form yet remaining the same, that took up my entire field of Vision. It was realer and more detailed than anything in real life, and I was completely overcome by it. I was no longer aware of my body or the noise of the rain outside.

> 
> 
> I must have said ‘What the fuck!!!?’ Over and over again 100 times throughout the entire experience as what I was seeing was completely unfathomable to me. The intense part probably only lasted around 3 minutes, with a still relatively strong after effect lasting another 10 or 15 minutes, which I spent curled up repeating phrases like ‘what the fuck?’ ‘Jesus Christ’ etc etc. I have never ever ever experienced anything like it. The entire experience was completely overwhelming yet positive. I felt no fear, only awe.

I’m just coming down from 120mg (orally) of MET fumerate.


In my experience 120mg was not enough to produce intense results.


The headspace was minimal, but that was expected.


Visually there was very little going on, (no CEV) but one thing was peculiar, and I haven’t noticed this on other psychedelics.


Everything was slowly breathing, but then suddenly everything just completely stopped breathing for a fraction of a second, then continued. This kept happening many times in a minute. Like tiny fragments of the visual experience were cut out and replaced by a sober reality. Definitely new to me, and I’ve  been tripping, off and on, for 25 years.


Frames on the wall kept shifting angles in a glitchy manner.


Another thing that was unique to these visuals was that I could see a framed painting slowly morphing while everything around it was perfectly still. Again like only the focus point was in the trip, and everything else was not included.


Very strange, I’ve only experienced my whole environment being affected, but this time it seems that the visual distortion was quite specific.


Other than that, there was no musical enhancement, no deep thoughts, but the bodyload was, and still is right now, pretty huge.


Walking around is clumsy.


I definitely need to try a higher dose next time, I’m sure MET has a lot more to offer. The effective dose is just a lot higher than other tryptamines. So 120mg is in reality, not much what MET is concerned.


In comparison, only 16mg of 4-HO-MET was a full trip for me, so it’s not that I’m hardheaded.


It was my first experience with this molecule, so I haven’t tried any other ROA’s.

Yeah, I've known enough people who used base tryptamines now to know that the sensitivity to them varies widely, and that I'm not the only one who's come to that conclusion. I know other people who also get practically nothing that would really be considered psychedelic beyond a high from most of them, even when pushing to really high dosages. I personally get hallucinogenic effects very easily from every one of them that I've tried, which is a lot of them (DMT, MET, MPT, MiPT, MALT, EPT, DPT, DiPT, DALT). They're some of my favorite drugs because of it, among other reasons. MET's not my favorite for its hallucinations though, the thing I like best about it is the fact that it works as a good rapid-acting antidepressant for me. It reminds me of 4-HO-MET in that the visuals are very vivid for me but to some extent they feel like eye candy without as much depth as other types of visuals.


I also get unusual reactions to DMT though where I don't get as much out of it as other people tend to say and I actually really dislike the way it makes me feel most of the time, whereas I really like most synthetic base tryptamines. They tend to feel great to me and give me visionary effects very easily which makes them hard to not love. I wish some people could experience what I do from them but everyone's got their thing, I need dosages of 4-substituted tryptamines that Erowid would call very high or much higher than that and still tend not to have experiences as crazy as some people that make me jealous.

Yep, it's all super weird. I doubt that it's a metabolic enzyme thing because high vaporized doses don't get me where I feel they should despite bypassing 1st pass metabolism. Nonetheless, I still feel like I should test out taking a RIMA before N,N-MET sometime. I'm guessing it's probably something else, maybe a receptor morphology thing.

Absolutely, I get the same effect, and it seems to linger for several hours possibly a day. I love it too and I get a decently strong effect. It just does not get overtly visual OEV or CEV for me. I can't deny the CEVs but they arent crazy in my face. I actually find DET more visual OEV, equal or similar CEV, but I prefer MET for it's rich warmth.

Hmm this I find pretty interesting. I've only tried a few base Trypts, NMT, DMT, MET, DET, DPT, and DIPT. All trypts kinda share an underlying feeling but can be quite different than eachother. Besides the underlying tryptamine feelings, I wouldnt put DMT and say DPT in the same room. They are completely different to me.


Might be just me, but I love the low dose DMT for the body and I guess antidepressant effects. I feel like MET resembles the best part of the physical side of DMT and last a lot longer trip wise and antidepressant effect.


I wish I got real defined visuals from it, but I don't. Things get a bit wavy and colors look different. It never gets textured.


I've even combined it a few times with DMT (smoked), hoping to bring out METs visual character. While the two compounds came together comfortably, I still felt like those experiences were visually dominated by DMT.


If it is a matter of dose, I'll never reach it's breakthrough, though I really do enjoy MET.

I get this as well.


DMT used to be different, I used to love it, but since a few years, every time I smoke it, I feel completely alienated and confused afterwards.


I never thought of it as introspective, but now it sends me into the headspace of a vulnerable situation I found myself in, in the recent past. Like it makes me feel like I felt at that time, even though my mindset was great before. It ruins the rest of my day actually. I never see anyone mention this.


I just get really uncomfortable and feel very vulnerable, and absolutely confused now when I do DMT.


It’s been a year or so since I smoked it, but I left long periods in between before, and it was the same.


Also MET unfortunately did not have anti depressieve properties for me, in contrast to your experience, I felt pretty down the next day. Like I had a hangover.


The bruxism was annoying as well.


I Googled it, and bruxism can have something to do with either high, or low serotonin levels, I’m not sure why, tryptamines do not increase serotonin, they just bind to the receptors.


But this was only my first experience with MET, a different set will likely produce different results. And definitely will need a higher dose. 


4-HO-MET is wonderful for me though, but not healing in the way mushrooms are, but not challenging either, visually very intense for me.

So I shared MET with a group of cumbaya type hippies this weekend. They had guitars and were singing in a circle etc. I was surprised they were so enthusiastic being a research chemical but maybe it was because I described it as the closest structural analogue to dmt there is. 


It's so light and easy going, I probably threw down .25g among 4 people in two pipes, and they wanted more.


They all loved it and kind of melted into a love puddle. It didn't phase me, and I was a bit annoyed with their "I can see your purple aura man" type chatter so I got up to socialize. Came back in an hour to check in, they were fine, tho it had definitely morphed into more than a love puddle and I wasn't really welcome back.


I would call MET as much if not more of a enactogen/empathogen than a psychedelic.

Really psyched to be trying this molecule again soon. I used it a few times in the haze that enveloped my life for a decade so no clear perception of its effects any more. But I recall it being DMT like with some differences of which I will explore with more depth soon enough. I'm getting a remarkably friendly vibe from this little bag of powder ![😃](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f603.png)

Sorry I missed this, I've been really busy focusing on moving for the last few months.


I'm jealous you got to try DET, it's the only one of the straight alkyl chain combinations up to propyl I didn't get to try.


DMT feels specifically different from all other base tryptamines I've used to me in a way that I haven't put enough work into trying to accurately describe but it's easily recognizable to me when the feeling comes on. I figure it's just something about its pharmacology that it loses when you extend the tail bulk at all and that just doesn't really jibe with my body or brain chemistry. It just feels unpleasant and I want it to stop even when I'm fascinated with the trip. The synthetic base tryptamines I've tried can be very different from one another, but none of them seem to have that particular quality for me. I would like to be able to enjoy it more but the most recent time I tried, late last year, it was still that way. I haven't tried taking it orally yet though.


MET is great. I've probably used it the most of all of them except DMT at this point because of how often I wanted to smoke it for that antidepressant effect.

I'm sorry, I didn't see this before.


That is very unfortunate, but yeah, I can definitely relate. It usually feels very similar to me from one experience to the next and just feels very harsh and unenjoyable. I tended to come out of it thinking something like, "Is that really it?" Eventually I learned to stop expecting more for the most part. I'm still hopeful that one day it could turn out to be more to me though.


That's too bad you didn't get the MET antidepressant effect either. Bruxism is just something that can happen with psychedelics though, 4-HO-MET actually gives me really bad bruxism sometimes too. Pretty much any effects that are caused by serotonin are caused by it binding to serotonin receptors so psychedelics can potentially do it as well. Hope you have a better experience if you try it again or did if you already have.

In my experience people tend not to be that suspicious of research chemicals if you introduce the ones you have in a way that shows that you actually understand what they are and know what you're doing with them. I hear a lot about people being afraid of research chemicals (not without reason) but the people I've encountered more often seem excited to see that they're getting an opportunity to take a powerful drug they've never had before.


The comparison to DMT probably did help though. DMT is all the rage these days.

Eh, nothing too cool tbh. I smoked about 50mg over the space of an hour or so. It was fumarate salt and felt harsh and generated a shit ton of smoke. Did get some beautiful CEVs of the morphing translucent hexagon type and OEVS looked like migraine aura, but mainly a sense of intense physical rushing ala DMT and nice euphoria. Effects lasted for maybe an hour but I was on AMT and found it hard to know when I was down again. I will probably try higher dose, but all in all, a very enjoyable, manageable psychedelic. 


I did mix maybe 20mg in with 20mg of DMT and smoked that in a number of hits spaced over half an hour or so- definitely augmented the experience, DMT came out on top, but the physical euphoria was wild. Buzzing and vibrating, sonewhat reminiscent of 5MEODMT. My whole body felt liquid and like it was folding in on itself. My arms seemed like hollow balloon things that were just floating in space, legs felt like they immersed in liquid.

That sounds fun, thanks for the report. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 50 mg all at once gave me some pretty significant visuals, although it still wasn't particularly profound. It kind of reminds me of 4-HO-MET compared to mushrooms in that way. I don't mind using lower dosages of MET anymore because I don't really need it to be all that intense, and what happens even at lower dosages is usually still at least kind of interesting to me, and refreshing.


That's cool about the combo too. I've actually suspected for years now that MET might be a full or nearly full agonist at 5-HT2A receptors comparable to 5-MeO-DMT, and unlike DMT. This is mainly based off the observation that there is a scientific study that put psilocin at 16% efficacy and 4-HO-MET at 72% efficacy, and it put DMT at 40% efficacy, so the equivalent of MET if assumed to be equally stronger would be 96%. Since DMT and MET are so molecularly similar otherwise, I've wondered if perhaps MET is this way and if this might actually represent one of the more significant differences between the two psychedelics. I do actually find many synthetic tryptamines that seem to have higher efficacy than their natural counterparts to have more of a dissociative, "white light" kind of experience by comparison, which I would imagine could be an important component of 5-MeO-DMT's effect since there are multiple studies that put its efficacy around 100%, which is notably different from most other natural indole psychedelics.


Glad you liked the MET, would be interested to hear how that higher dosage goes too if you try it. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

[@Kaleida](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/377522/) - I am really struggling to freebase the MET I have. I don't suppose you have found a way. Didn't work with sodium carbonate. Turned to an oil and then went back into solution. Not luck finding a way myself.


I am going to try basifying with NaOH and pulling with Ethyl acetate

I'd love to help you [@Lostsoul2019](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/516429/) but I can't do that if you're set on freebasing, I've never done it before. I can tell you that I've actually never had any problems with just vaporizing the salts personally, I just layer them into bowls of cannabis and lower the flame slowly down onto a top layer of cannabis to melt the inside and they've worked fine for me. I can't technically speak to how they would compare to using the freebases though, I just know they've already worked fine for me, and that's considering that I actually seem to get a lot more out of base tryptamines than a lot of people already, so that might be saying something. If you're willing to try something like that maybe you could give it a shot, but I understand if you just want to freebase too.


I wish you the best of luck in whatever you do. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I know MET dosage is quite high, so I decided to potentiate the trip with moclobemide.


I took 150 mg of moclobemide, and about 40 minutes later, I insufflated 40 mg of MET fumarate. I spent most of the trip on a walk in the woods.


For a tryptamine, it was very gentle on the nose. I had no issues with ingestion, even though my nose is sensitive. The substance took quite a while to kick in for intranasal use, as I began to feel the first effects after 30 minutes. These were mainly bodily sensations, such as pleasant shivers and a lightness of movement. My mood improved, and a slight euphoria emerged. The peak was after ~45 minutes, and something more appeared - a typical, psychedelic headspace. It wasn't intense; I could easily talk with a sober person without arousing suspicion. However, passing strangers in the forest made me feel uneasy, and I preferred to avoid them. Driving was also out of the question at that time, but an hour and a half after ingestion, I got behind the wheel, and it was okay. The visual aspect was okay, but nothing extraordinary. The perception of colors did not change significantly; I was more focused on wavy vision and drifting.


If I were to compare these substances to something, I would say it's a less visual DPT. The dosage seems similar as well.


I experienced a medium bodyload that started just around the peak. It manifested by slight nausea and a tight stomach feeling.


Duration: 4-6 hours.


Overall it's a cool chem, definitely more than just a curiosity on my resume

Do most people here agree that smoking the fumarate salt is fine or should one try to make the base?


I'd just use a crack pipe, is that okay?

I suspect that the risks of smoking the fumarate salt are likely overblown, especially if you nebulize instead of pyrolize. That said, freebasing is likely to be much more efficient and liable to produce way fewer combustion byproducts. 

Smoking the fumarate salt out of a crack pipe is possible, but a lot of it is likely to get burned (which is likely not great for your health.) I tried it in ceramic coil vape pens several times long ago, and I didn't have great results. Freebasing it (or nebulizing it with a good vape juice, perhaps PEG400?) might be less potentially harmful as well as more efficient. All in all, it was underwhelming enough that I didn't keep chasing after it to try to optimize the experience. It always seemed like it was close to going somewhere incredible, but it never did.

I may want to try MET tomorrow.

Either by vaping the fumarate salt in a crack pipe or by snorting.

What would you recommend?


I'm not looking for a breakthrough - rather for a nice, cozy & therapeutic psychedelic experience.

Ii never tried snorting the fumarate, but thats probably the more bioavailable ROA among the 2, however because i find MET so mild, i want it in me as fast as possible, i woukd personally go the smoking route

I’ve tried snorting fumarate, and it doesn’t work very well, at least at reasonable doses. It also burned way more than dpt, which I prefer to insufflate (I’ve always liked snorting DPT the best). I think the largest amount I tried was around 40 mg before I decided not to waste any more. I tried to smoke the salt as well, and it didn’t work very well. I had a bunch of freebase MET a few decades ago, and it was much more active than the salt I have now. I don’t have a lot of the salt left, so I’ll probably inject the rest one of these days…

MET freebase is one of my all time favorites. It is very powerful. but less pushy and disorienting than DMT. I wish I had more…

We ended up snorting 10mg of MET fum. first, which burned a lot & was very wet / clumpy & didn't dry well.


Felt not much from it & seemed not to work great.


Then we smoked 40mg in a crack pipe, which took some time & was a bit harsh. Worked well though.


It felt like a very managable light DMT dose with less "rush". We did smoke it while on 6-APB & 5-MAPB though.

N2O brought out pretty strong visuals.


Felt very nice.

It is very warm and rushy in the body. Glad n2o help w visual aspect.


I tried so hard to have a dmt esque breakthru w it, i gave up.


I still love MET and i wish it were easier to make. The disubstituted tryptamines are not as simple as one would wish

Yep, it's lovely stuff, but for most people it just never quite gets there, even when vaping quite a lot of material.

Tried MET fumarate last night for the second time.


We were already quite high on dissos (3-MeO-PCE + MXiPr) & wanted some more clear headedness upswing.


So we filled 30mg in an oil pipe, I heated it carefully, just to vaporize it.

It took some effort, but I was able to get some mild effects that way.

Heating it more than a few secs yielded a white smoke, which was pretty harsh, but managable. That smoke was more effective than the vapor.

I really need to basify some of it for the next time vaping it.


Then we snorted two 10-13mg lines, which worked well for me.

Burned like chili, was okay & stronger than the inhaling.


I really like the headspace it gives me.

Combining it with N2O is fantastic.

Euphoric spiritual vibrating energy through my body.


It really dominated the high dose dissociation.

We were able to talk clearly & think coherently.


I have a lot more to tell you, will update this.
