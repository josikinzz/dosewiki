5-MeO-NiPT, also known as 5-methoxy-N-isopropyltryptamine, is a psychedelic drug of the tryptamine family related to 5-MeO-DMT.
The drug acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor.
5-MeO-NiPT was encountered as a novel designer and recreational drug by 2014.

## Use and effects

5-MeO-NiPT was not included nor mentioned in Alexander Shulgin's book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved).

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

5-MeO-NiPT is a full agonist or near-full agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. It is inactive as a serotonin releasing agent and is very weak as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
Unlike most other N-monoalkylated tryptamines, 5-MeO-NiPT produces the head-twitch response (HTR), a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents, albeit relatively weakly. It also produces hypolocomotion and hypothermia in rodents. In combination with the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 however, 5-MeO-NiPT instead produces hyperlocomotion.
5-MeO-NiPT is an active metabolite of 5-MeO-MiPT and 5-MeO-DiPT.

## Chemistry

### Analogues

Analogues of 5-MeO-NiPT include N-isopropyltryptamine (NiPT), 5-MeO-NMT, 5-MeO-NET, 5-MeO-DiPT, and 5-MeO-MiPT, among others.
