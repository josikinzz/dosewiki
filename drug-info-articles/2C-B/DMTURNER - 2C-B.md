### SAFETY FACTORS

2C-B is highly dosage sensitive. Taking
an amount just slightly above the recommended dose can produce an intense
experience that most people find forced and unpleasant. With any substance
there are a few people who will exhibit unusually high or low sensitivity.
Therefore, in order to avoid an undesirably intense experience, many users
start with a small dose of 2C-B, around 8 mg., and work their way up.
### INTENSITY

2 to 7, varying with the dosage and
the individual's sensitivity to this compound.
### MATERIAL

2C-B (4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine)
is a psychedelic/empathogen developed by Alexander Shulgin. Shulgin has
invented around 200 psychoactive compounds including DOM (a.k.a. STP),
an ultra-potent psychedelic that appeared briefly on the street in the
late Sixties. Recently a large amount of 2C-B has been distributed under
the street name "Nexus." In the past 2C-B has also been distributed as
"Eve" and "Venus. "
### DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION

2C-B should be ingested, preferably
on an empty stomach. As mentioned above, 2C-B is extremely dosage sensitive,
and the amount required is so small that a sophisticated scale is needed
to accurately weigh a single dose. With "street" 2C-B it is hard to know
exactly how much is in a capsule. This is likely to cause some unexpected
heavy trips if 2C-B becomes a popular drug and dosage information and knowledge
is not made available. People who have a quantity of 2C-B often dilute
it in an inert powder before measuring individual doses to provide greater
accuracy.
In PIHKAL Shulgin lists the
dosage range as 16 to 24 mg. Another writing on 2C-B lists the range as
12 to 30 mg. Shulgin's descriptions of the effects of different dosages
can be summarized as follows: 16 mg. produces a "museum level" experience.
One can go about in public with slightly enhanced perception, such as may
be appropriate for going to a public museum, etc. 20 to 24 mg. will produce
a more psychedelic experience with visuals and intensified feelings
I've seen no literature on 2C-B which
recommends a dose above 30 mg. Gracie and Zarkov, who are very experienced
trippers, each took 40 mg. in error and had unpleasant experiences. Shulgin
reports on overdoses up to 100 mg. that produced frightening experiences
but caused no permanent damage. However, some people, like myself, have
an unusually low sensitivity to 2C-B and other substances in the phenethylamine
family. I find that I must consume 50 mg. to produce experiences that most
people obtain with 25 to 35 mg.
### THE HIGH

My experiences with 2C-B have been
quite varied. With a low, "museum level" dose, I experience what resembles
a speedy acid high hardly worth discussing. It is when I take a somewhat
larger dose that the unique aspects of this substance begin to manifest.
It is definitely an "up" experience. There is lots of physical energy.
The visual aspect can be extraordinary, with intense vivid colors and intricate
patterning that is reminiscent of mescaline visuals and seems charged with
electricity. In one experience the visuals appeared as complete chaos before
becoming a portion of a vast cosmic order. On a good dose of 2C-B I'm content
to just lay back for hours and trip on watching my mind.
On some occasions 2C-B has given me
visibility into what I will call the "assembly" or "machine" language of
the mind. As an example, if you see the number 3, the typical response
is to identify the symbol as the number 3, and think about its meaning
within the context you are seeing it. On a finer scale, many thousands
of neurons are connected in the brain's interpretation and identification
of the symbol and linkage to the stored memory of 3. While on 2C-B,
I've seen that only 80-90% of this mental "signal" comes back as 3,
the remaining 10-20% having connected elsewhere in the mind or run into
closed synapses, etc. I have found this awareness of the mind's "assembly"
language to be simultaneously insightful, discombobulating, and humorous.
2C-B is considered an empathogen and
many users have reported powerful and transformative empathogenic experiences
from its use. I've only had strong empathogenic content in about 25% of
my 2C-B experiences. However, I found this empathogenic quality to be very
deep and transformative, much more meaningful than the comparatively shallow
emotional bliss that I tend to experience on ecstasy. Where the feelings
of ecstasy can be repetitive or predictable, 2C-B allows me to continually
explore different types of feelings.
On the negative side, the 2C-B experience
has a tendency to feel "forced" in comparison with the more flowing nature
of ecstasy or LSD. When taking a large dose of 2C-B, one's ability to accept
whatever the mind presents, without trying to push away unwanted thoughts,
will reduce the likelihood of an unpleasant experience. 2C-B also seems
to produce a constant low-level agitation or interference in the mind.
I notice this if I try to quiet my mind to meditate or listen to music.
This slight "buzz' that is always present is quite distinct from the ocean
of luxuriantly transparent silence that often surrounds one during an LSD
trip.
Like ecstasy, 2C-B can not match the
depth, purity, or realism of the traditional psychedelics. However, it
is much more psychedelic than ecstasy, and its unique attributes make it
an interesting substance to explore. One of 2C-B's unique attributes is
that it simultaneously strengthens certain aspects of the ego or identity
while dissolving others. For myself and many friends who've used 2C-B this
has resulted in a highly positive influence on our self-image, both during
and after the experience, including the idea that the physical body is
a sacred manifestation of the creative consciousness.
Although I have yet to see this amongst
the 2C-B users I know, I suspect that for less balanced or grounded individuals
2C-B could strengthen negative aspects of the ego, thereby producing the
type of changes one often sees in amphetamine users.
2C-B is known for its ability to enhance
sexual perception and performance, and I've found 2C-B to work excellently
for this purpose. Whereas on ecstasy, although it is common to feel much
love, emotional closeness, and empathy for your partner, it can be difficult
to focus on sex or maintain an erection, and it's especially difficult
to reach orgasm.
With 2C-B, sexual feeling is greatly
enhanced. I can remain in an excited state for hours and the experience
of the sexual energy exchange is intense and electric. I've found that
with any psychedelic it's best to begin sexual activity either early in
the experience before awareness is too spread out, or shortly after the
peak. I consider mescaline and LSD to be the best psychedelics for aphrodisiacs,
although some people get too spaced out or emotionally involved to concentrate
on sex.
### COMBINATIONS

Ecstasy - 2C-B is frequently
combined with ecstasy. In therapeutic use the 2C-B is generally taken at
the tail end of the ecstasy experience. Many people have found that 2C-B
allows them to develop and retain the insights from the ecstasy experience
which would otherwise have a tendency to slip away. I've also had excellent
results taking a small amount of ecstasy (80 mg.) some 1 1/2 hours after
the 2C-B. This produces a trip with an incredibly deep empathogenic content
that I have never experienced on either of the substances alone.
2C-B combines quite remarkably with
Ketamine. See the Multiple Combinations
chapter.
2C-B may be significantly intensified
and possibly dangerous if combined with MAO inhibitors.
