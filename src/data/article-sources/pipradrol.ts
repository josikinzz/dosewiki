## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as diphenylmethanes. These are compounds containing a diphenylmethane moiety, which consists of a methane wherein two hydrogen atoms are replaced by two phenyl groups.

### Background

Pipradrol (Meratran)
11
was initially developed in the 1950s as an antidepressant, however, the adverse effects associated with its use and its abuse potential led to its withdrawal and international regulation
12
.  Pipradrol was made illegal in many countries in 1970s because of its potential for abuse. It is currently classified under the Misuse of Drugs Act as a Class C substance
10
.
Experimentation with the drug and its derivatives for recreational purposes has led to many cases of acute toxicity and has been linked to three fatalities. The social and in particular acute clinical harms of pipradrol derivatives have led to their control under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 in the UK in 2012
3
.
Interestingly, this drug has been studied for bactericidal properties, however, is not currently, used for this purpose
2
. In addition to this, it has shown favorable effects in postpartum depressive symptoms
6
.

### Indication

Used to manage fatigue
10
and depression
5
,
1
,
8
,
11
. Used as an adjunct therapy in the management of obesity
10
.

### Pharmacodynamics

Pipradrol (Meratran) is a psychoactive agent and a central nervous system stimulant that has proven useful in the field of psychiatry
10
.
Pipradrol was initially used as an adjunct in the dietary management of obesity as well as for the management of dementia symptoms. Numerous reports have been made on the properties of pipradrol, demonstrating its favorable effects in the treatment of depression and fatigue in addition to a variety of other conditions including narcolepsy, spasmodic torticollis, schizophrenia and in geriatric practice
10
.

### Mechanism of Action

D(1) dopamine receptor
Agonist

### Absorption

Rapidly absorbed
4
.

### Metabolism

Rapidly metabolized, and not found in plasma approximately 4 hours post administration
4
.

### Toxicity

Toxicity Data: Oral LD50 (rat): 180 mg/kg; Oral LD50 (mouse): 120 mg/kg; Oral LD50 (rabbit): 180 mg/kg
MSDS
.
The toxicity of this drug is dependent on the dose ingested, and is owed to its central nervous stimulant activity
3
,
4
.
Overdoses of pipradrol hydrochloride cause nausea, anxiety, insomnia and abdominal pain, however, these symptoms often disappear when the drug is withdrawn. In severe cases, convulsions may occur
5
,
4
.  This drug is contraindicated in anxiety, psychosis states, and schizophrenia, as it can worsen these symptoms. Hallucinations have been reported after taking this drug
3
.
Over the last decade there has been greater use of novel psychoactive substances (‘legal highs’) across Europe and the United States, including increasing frequency of reports of diphenylprolinol (D2PM) and desoxypipradrol (2-DPMP) use
9
.
There are increasing reports that D2PM (desoxy analogue of pipradrol) and  2-DPMP (a pyrrolidine analogue of pipradrol) are used in Europe as drugs of abuse. 2-DPMP has sympathomimetic properties similar to cocaine and, in addition, prolonged and clinically significant neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported
9
.  The binding and activity of D2PM at the dopamine re-uptake transporter, is also similar to cocaine, though it appears that D2PM has less potent biological activity

### Mechanism of action

Pipradrol and pipradrol derivatives are norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors
3
.
In a pharmacokinetic study, it was shown that pipradrol conditioned place preference (CPP)
13
was blocked by selective D1 dopamine antagonist, implicating that a rewarding effect of pipradrol may involve the activation of D1 dopamine receptors.
Pipradrol has a definite cerebral stimulating effect without affecting the blood pressure or respiration and has been used to counteract post-anaesthetic and chlorpromazine depression in man. Structurally related to phenylmethylamphetamine, a potent stimulant with a long half-life, pipradrol differs from amphetamine in that its action is more intense at higher centers, it does not exhibit pressor activity, there is no post-excitement depression, and this drug does not decrease appetite, as occurs with amphetamine

## Subjective Experience

Pipradrol was developed in the 1940’s and was used to treat a variety of mental
health conditions, including dementia and ADHD. Its abuse potential was such that
from the late 70s it was banned across a number of countries, including the United
States (schedule IV) and the UK (class C).

A sample fell into my hands more by accident than design. However, despite a lack of
reference data and its limited history of recreational use, for the purposes of this
book I decided to test it.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I weigh 60mg of the crystal like structures. They crush easily with a
credit card and I arrange them in three lines of approx 20mg each.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
I snort a single line. [4:47pm]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:05 I feel nothing other than a slight tingle, which could in fact be a
placebo effect. There is a hint of headspace developing: perhaps.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:20 I can now feel a little head stimulation, but nothing intrusive. I
insufflate the next 20mg, hoping for more.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
This is not painless to snort, but is not a serious problem either.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:40 There has been no change since the 20 minute mark. Given that the
first line must now be in full effect, and the second should be developing, I am
rather underwhelmed.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:45 The final 20mg is hoovered, taking the total to 60mg.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:50 I'm in that place again, the one which I can only describe as nice. It is
mildly pleasant, but nothing else. There is no excitement or intensity: just a
very minor glow and warmness.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I am hoping that this goes further, but not expecting it to do so.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 An hour in and I seem to be at the peak, which is broadly as described
on the 50 minute mark.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:00 The glow I referred to earlier continued for a while, and then faded. I
am now more or less back to base.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+16:00 I retired at the usual time and had a normal night. I experienced no
problem at all with sleep.
\`\`\`
Now, either I am a hard head, which I am not, or there is cross tolerance in play,
which I doubt, or this is extremely mild, at least at this sort of dose. It was very
disappointing.

Note that in the context of pipradrol as a medicine, Wikipedia states that:

\`\`\`
“Dosage is between 0.5 and 4 milligrams per day, typically taken as a single
dose in the morning as the long duration of effects of pipradrol (up to 12
hours) means insomnia can be a problem especially if it is used at higher
doses or taken too late in the day”.
\`\`\`
Given this statement, I wouldn’t want to push this any higher than I did with this
test. I almost certainly went too far.

My verdict, therefore, is that pipradrol offers too little to be of significant recreational
interest.

Pipradrol, also known by its brand name Meratran, is a mild central nervous system stimulant that acts as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Developed in the United States in the 1940s and patented in 1953, pipradrol was initially marketed as an antidepressant in the mid-1950s. It was subsequently used as an adjunct treatment for various conditions, including obesity, senile dementia, narcolepsy, and schizophrenia.
Despite its initial promise and relatively mild stimulant effects compared to stronger alternatives, concerns about its abuse potential led to its regulation and withdrawal from widespread use in many countries during the late 1970s. Pipradrol is now classified as a controlled substance in several nations, including the United Kingdom, where it is typically placed in less restrictive drug schedules due to its lower abuse potential compared to other stimulants.

## Dosage

Elixir "Alertonic" with Pipradrol hydrochloride content of 0.044 mg/mL was recommended to adults only, 1 tablespoonful (15 ml.), three times daily 30 minutes before meals for limited periods only.

## Side effects

Common side effects include insomnia, anorexia, tachycardia, and anxiety. Rarer side effects include dry mouth, tremor, hypertension, euphoria, depression, and very rarely psychosis or convulsions.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Pipradrol is a central nervous system stimulant that acts primarily as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Its mechanism of action involves blocking the reuptake of these neurotransmitters, leading to increased levels in the synaptic cleft and prolonged stimulation of postsynaptic neurons. Studies have shown that pipradrol's rewarding effects may be mediated through activation of the dopamine receptor D1. Unlike amphetamines, pipradrol exhibits a more intense action on higher brain centers without significantly affecting blood pressure or respiration. It also does not decrease appetite or cause post-excitement depression typically associated with amphetamines.

### Pharmacokinetics

Pipradrol is rapidly absorbed and distributed to the liver, kidney, and brain tissue. The drug is quickly metabolized and eliminated from the body, with approximately 3.5% excreted in urine and 5% in stool.

## History

Pipradrol was initially developed in the United States in the 1940s, patented in 1953, and marketed in the mid 1950s as the antidepressant drug Meratran. It was subsequently used as an adjunct for the treatment of obesity and management of senile dementia symptoms. There have also been numerous reports demonstrating favorable effects on a variety of conditions such as ADHD, narcolepsy, schizophrenia, and spasmodic torticollis. Pipradrol proved useful for these applications as its relatively mild stimulant effects gave it a good safety profile compared to stronger stimulants. It was also studied as an adjutant treatment for depression and schizophrenia although it was never widely used for these purposes.
Pipradrol was made illegal in many countries in the late 1970s, at the same time as many other drugs which had a history of abuse. Pipradrol is a 'phenidate' type molecule, being structurally related to the prescribed stimulant methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta and many other branded medicines). The relatively mild stimulant effects of pipradrol, at quantities used in commercial medicine at the time (Alertonic liquid and Meratran tablets were Australian examples), meant that pipradrol was scheduled under the less restrictive classes in most countries (i.e. Class C in United Kingdom and New Zealand) but was still considered of sufficient abuse potential to be made an illegal drug. It is now an obscure compound that is virtually unknown as an illicit drug of abuse, but is still used for some scientific research, often as a comparison drug for testing other stimulants against.
