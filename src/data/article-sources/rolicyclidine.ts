## Summary

Rolicyclidine, also known as PCPy, is a dissociative with effects similar to PCP. The drug is reported to have less stimulating effects than PCP while keeping similarities with hallucinogenic and sedative effects. In this sense, it has been anecdotally reported to be more similar to opioids regarding effects, or other central nervous system depressants.

## Classification
- **Categories:** dissociative, research-chemical, habit-forming, tentative
- **Also known as:** pcpy

## Dosage

### Oral
- **Common:** 4-8mg
- **Light:** 2-4mg
- **Strong:** 8mg+

## Duration
- **Onset:** minutes
- **Duration:** 2-6 hours
- **After Effects:** 1-8 hours

## Additional Information
- **Avoid:** All CNS depressants.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolicyclidine*

Rolicyclidine (PCPy) is a dissociative anesthetic  that is similar in effects to phencyclidine, but is slightly less potent and has fewer stimulant effects. It instead produces a sedative effect described as being somewhat similar to a barbiturate, but with additional PCP-like dissociative, anaesthetic and hallucinogenic effects. Due to its similarity in effects to PCP, PCPy was placed into the Schedule I list of illegal drugs in the 1970s, although it has never been widely abused and is now little known.
