## Subjective Experience

MXE began to appear on the markets at the end of 2010, and was to become popular
in a relatively short space of time. It has recently acquired something of a cult status;
due in part to production being banned at source (China), causing it to became
increasingly difficult to obtain.

At time of writing, its legal status in the United States is unclear, noting that it could
be considered to be an analogue of PCE or ketamine. In the UK it was the subject of a
TCDO in April 2012, and was classified in February of the following year. I was
fortunate to have obtained a sample just a few days prior to this ban.

This was one of my first dissociative adventures, and given its sudden disappearance
from the market, my only one with this chemical.

My regret in this context is that I was not able to explore it more deeply, as it was a
very positive experience.

Dissociation was not something I approached lightly, and I had read a number of
horror stories of people mixing dissociatives with alcohol. I was therefore a little
nervous in shovelling perhaps half of my 50mg supply down the hatch.

The action took just a short while to commence: considerably less than an hour.
However, as one of the first manifestations was to alleviate my anxiety, the rest of the
pill was rapidly consumed. For a period though, there was still a slightly scary edge to
proceedings, as everything around me was becoming rather strange.

What followed was a positively charged dissociation, under a mindset of the world
around me not being normal, and my perspective not being quite with it in this
realm. Weird is such a lame word to use, but it does capture the essence of the ride.
At the same time, I was absolutely comfortable with this.

I felt strangely high but not tuned in. I was able to fall into a period of introspection,
but also able to focus upon, for example, academic related pursuits on the Internet.
This was indeed significantly different to other forms of intoxication.

There was an Alice in Wonderland edge to life: I was fully conscious and aware
whilst everything around me had warped slightly, giving it an alien feel. I had
retained all my marbles, my clarity and my rationality, but I was witnessing reality as
though I wasn’t fully in it. Certainly, I enjoyed it.

Another positive came in the aftermath: I suffered no hangover or noticeable come-
down, with a mild afterglow lasting a day or two. I was sorry not to have sampled it
earlier.
