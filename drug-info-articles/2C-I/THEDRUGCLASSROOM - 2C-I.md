# 2C-I
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/2c-i/*

2C-I is a psychedelic phenethylamine and a member of the 2C family ( [2C-B](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/2c-b/) , [2C-E](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/2c-e/) , 2C-P, etc). It is less popular than 2C-B. Its derivative, 2C-I-NBOMe (25i-NBOMe) has been more widely used.

The drug was sold by some shops in the early 2000s. Since then, it has been a niche drug and has seen little use.

We don’t know what a lethal amount of the drug may be. As such, it’s wise to use a dose in the “common” range and avoid combinations or frequent use.
