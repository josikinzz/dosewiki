## Subjective Experience

At the time of research, leonurus sibiricus was a widely available legal botanical, and
was largely sold as a mild relaxant. Internet descriptions like the following were
commonplace:

\`\`\`
“Leonurus sibiricus, commonly known as Siberian motherwort or
Marihuanilla, is an herbaceous plant native to Asia, including southern
Siberia, China, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. It grows wild in the coastal
regions of Brazil as well as Chiapas (Hofmann et al. 1992, 47)”
~ entheology.com
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
“In South-America and Mexico Leonurus sibiricus has been used as a
substitute for cannabis. That's why the plant was nicknamed Marihuanilla
("little marijuana"). It induces a state of relaxation and has a pleasant taste”
~ herbsofthegods.nl
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
“The effects of Marihuanilla can be described as mildly narcotic, though not
especially pronounced; thus it is sometimes mixed with other herbs and
smoking blends to heighten its potency” ~ entheology.org
\`\`\`

Despite these positive references, my expectations were not high, which is the reason
this experiment had been hanging around on my to-do list for months.

The vendor I finally sourced from provided the following description:

\`\`\`
“Leonurus Sibiricus (Marihuanilla) A popular herbal preparation in South
America and Mexico. Famous for having a delicious flavor and a calming,
full bodied relaxing effect. Mildly narcotic in effect, it is often used as a
substitute for illegal drugs.” ~ potseeds.co.uk
\`\`\`
With the promise:

\`\`\`
“Each gram of our extract is equal to 50 Grams of dried herb. A lot of
vendors offering 50x extract, but it’s very common to take 50g of fresh
material and sell it as 50x. Again, we use 50g of dried material to get 1g real
50x extract” ~ potseeds.co.uk
\`\`\`
The substance arrived in the small packet pictured on the previous page, and had a
gritty quality to it. It had a distinctive odour, which is difficult to put a name to: a sort
of stale fruity spicy smell, but not unpleasant.

I placed a large pinch of it into a bong, lit up, and inhaled.

There was no particular burn, and it was not especially unpleasant to smoke. I took
three hits, and returned to my desk.

Almost immediately there was a noticeable psychoactive effect. It was absolutely
nothing like as strong as cannabis, but nonetheless it was there. It was quite sedating,
but I was in no way stoned.

As I had expected nothing at all, this was a pleasant surprise. It was mild, offered a
strange mental clarity, and had a distinct calming effect. There was no nausea or
anything of that nature.

I ought to add that I had not consumed any psychoactive materials for a week or two,
so I was very detoxed. This probably helped, but regardless, the chilled feeling, which
lasted an hour or so, wasn’t a placebo effect.

One final observation is that this was followed by a restless night’s sleep, during a
period in which I had generally been sleeping well. This could be unconnected, but is
worth bearing in mind.

ADDENDUM
Some of the sources I consulted during preliminary investigation referred to
marihuanilla’s use as a potentiator for cannabis and other substances. The general
feel I experienced during the experiment suggested that this may indeed be an
interesting area of exploration.

## Summary
Leonurus sibiricus, commonly called honeyweed or Siberian motherwort, is an herbaceous plant species native to China, Mongolia, and Siberia. It has verticillaster inflorescence. It is naturalized in many other parts of the world, including South, Central and North Americas.

## Description
Leonurus sibiricus is an herbaceous annual or biennial with upright stems that grow from 20–80 cm (8–30 in) tall. Plants have long petioled basal leaves that are ovate-cordate in shape. The leaves have toothed  margins and are incised with deeply cut lobes. Typically one or a few flowering stems are produced from short tap-roots. The lower stem leaves are deciduous and wither away as the plants begin blooming. The petioles of the leaves, midway up the stems are 2 cm (0.79 in) long. The flowers are produced in many flowered verticillasters, produced in whorls around the top half or more of the stem. The flowers are sessile with 8 mm (0.31 in) long calices that are tubular-campanulate in shape. The corolla is white or reddish to purple-red, with an upper lip that is oblong in shape and longer than the lower lip. When flowering is done, brown oblong shaped nutlets are produced in good number. Blooming occurs from July into late September, but flowering can occur year-round when climate permits.
This species' habitat within its natural range is stony or sandy grasslands or pine forests.
