*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-Chloromethcathinone*

4-Chloromethcathinone (also known as 4-CMC and clephedrone) is a stimulant drug of the cathinone class that has been sold online as a designer drug.
4-CMC produces similar effects to mephedrone, and has been sold as an alternative in countries where mephedrone was scheduled.

## Adverse effects

### Short-term

4-CMC produces similar side effects to mephedrone, including: increased blood pressure, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and anxiety.

### Neurotoxicity

Its chemical structure closely resembles para-chloromethamphetamine, raising concerns about its potential to readily induce cell death of serotonergic neurons. However, no neurotoxicity of this kind has been found to occur, but studies involving mice do indicate that it is neurotoxic through other mechanisms, similarly to other cathinones. 4-CMC is cytotoxic and induces oxidative stress, more so than 4-MMC.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

4-CMC mainly acts as a serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent (SNDRA), and partially as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI), with similar potency to mephedrone

## Legality

4-CMC is an Anlage I controlled drug in Germany.
Sweden's public health agency suggested classifying 4-Chloromethcathinone (klefedron) as illegal narcotic on June 1, 2015.
As of October 2015, 4-CMC is a controlled substance in China.
4-CMC is considered a Schedule 1 substance in Virginia.
In December 2019, the UNODC announced scheduling recommendations placing 4-CMC into Schedule II.
