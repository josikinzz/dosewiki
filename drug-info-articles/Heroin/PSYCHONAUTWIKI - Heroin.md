**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) , [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or other [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Diacetylmorphine** or **morphine diacetate** (also known as **diamorphine** and **heroin** as well as colloquially as **H** , **dope** , **smack** , **junk** , **brown** , **boy** , and others) is a semi-synthetic [opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) substance of the [morphinan](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphinan) class. It is a derivative of [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) , a natural product of the opium poppy ( *Papaver somniferum* ). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Heroin is known for its highly addictive properties and it makes up a large portion of the illicit traffic in narcotics.

Heroin was first synthesized from morphine by a British chemist in 1874 and was introduced as a commercial product by the Bayer Company of Germany in 1898. Although the name heroin is a trade name, it has since been widely adopted for all intents and purposes and may describe a recreational depressant that may or may not contain pure diacetylmorphine.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) , [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) .

In its pure form, heroin is active at doses of 5 mg and above; however, the substance is most commonly found in a preparation containing significant impurities. These impurities can result from including processing faults during synthesis, the addition of harmful or benign cutting agents, or the substitution of significantly more potent and dangerous analogous substances such as [fentanyl](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Fentanyl) adulterated into the end-product before distribution. The heroin found on streets may have a significant variation in purity, but on average is about 5%. This makes accurate dosing particularly difficult.

It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## History and culture

Diacetylmorphine was originally synthesized by C.R. Alder Wright in 1874 when attempting to combine morphine with various acids. The synthesis was achieved through boiling anhydrous morphine with morphine alkaloid with acetic anhydride.

Although the name heroin is a traditional trade name for a Bayer product containing diacetylmorphine, the name has since been widely adopted for all intents and purposes and may describe a recreational depressant that may or may not contain pure diacetylmorphine.

## Chemistry

Heroin, or morphine diacetate or diacetylmorphine (diamorphine hydrochloride), is an opiate and an ester of morphine. Heroin and other molecules of this class contain a polycyclic core of three benzene rings fused in a zig-zag pattern called a phenanthrene. A fourth nitrogen containing ring is fused to the phenanthrene at R 9 and R 13 , with the nitrogen member looking at R 17 of the combined structure. This structure is called morphinan.

Heroin, along with other morphinans, contains an ether bridge between two of its rings, connecting R 4 and R 5 through an oxygen group. Heroin contains two acetate (CH3COO−) groups bonded to R 3 and R 6 of its structure, and a methyl group located on the nitrogen atom at R 17 . On the same ring containing the 6-acetyl group, heroin contains a double bond.

Heroin's chemical structure is closely related to morphine. Heroin is the 3,6-diacetyl derivative of the diol [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) , meaning it contains acetate functional groups at the same locations hydroxy groups are found in morphine (3,6). Heroin is analogous to the other morphinans including [dihydrocodeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dihydrocodeine) , [codeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Codeine) , [ethylmorphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ethylmorphine) , [hydrocodone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hydrocodone) , and [oxycodone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Oxycodone) .

## Pharmacology

Heroin itself is an inactive drug, but it is metabolized into [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) when inserted into the body. When taken orally, heroin undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism via deacetylation, making it a prodrug for the systemic delivery of morphine. When the drug is injected, however, it avoids this first-pass effect, very rapidly crossing the blood–brain barrier because of the presence of the acetyl groups which render it much more fat-soluble, and thus more potent, than [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) itself.

Once in the brain, it is deacetylated variously into the inactive 3-monoacetylmorphine and the active 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM). 6-MAM is found in some commercially prepared batches of black tar heroin, often found on the west coast of the United States. It is then deacetylated into morphine, which binds to [μ-opioid receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid_receptors) . Heroin itself exhibits relatively low affinity for the μ receptor, suggesting that much of the psychoactive effects of the substance come from the metabolites of heroin rather than the diacetylmorphine itself.

The recreational effects of this compound, including [cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria) and [physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) , occur because opioids structurally mimic endogenous endorphins which are naturally produced within the body and are also active on the μ-opioid receptor set in the brain. The way in which synthetic opioids such as heroin structurally mimic these natural endorphins results in their [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) , [pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) and [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiolytic) effects. This is because natural endorphins are responsible for reducing pain, causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. The endorphins can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or general excitement.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - This leads to the trademark "nodding off" effect seen in heroin users, where the head falls, the eyes close, and the user slips uncontrollably into momentary unconsciousness. This can lead to falling into microsleeps while sitting or standing up.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - The physical euphoria experienced on this substance is extremely intense when compared to other opioids such as [codeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Codeine) or [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) . The sensation itself can be described as extreme feelings of intense physical comfort, warmth, and all-encompassing bliss.
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)**
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)** - Heavy dosages of heroin can result in [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) which leads onto fatal or dangerous levels of anoxia (oxygen deprivation). This occurs because the breathing reflex is suppressed by [agonism](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonists) of [µ-opioid receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid_receptors) proportional to the dosage consumed.
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**

- **[Decreased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_heart_rate)**
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Itchiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Itchiness)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - This effect can be intense enough to lead to vomiting at high doses. When severe, the nausea and subsequent vomiting can cause dehydration in the user.
- **[Orgasm suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orgasm_suppression)**
- **[Pupil constriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_constriction)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - The cognitive euphoria experienced on this substance is extremely intense when compared to other opioids such as [codeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Codeine) or [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) . The sensation itself can be described as powerful and overwhelming feelings of emotional bliss, contentment, and happiness.
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)** ### Visual effects
 
- #### Suppressions
 
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)** - At high doses, the eyes un-focus and re-focus uncontrollably. It appears to be caused by issues in depth perception, as by closing one eye the issue can be temporarily alleviated.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** - One may experience a state of semi-consciousness and [hypnagogia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnagogia) during heavy dosage nodding which results in dream-like states and up to level 3 [imagery](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lucid_dreaming#Internally_sourced_sensory_input) . This is often accompanied by ill-defined [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) . ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_acuity_suppression)**
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)** - Some users experience rumbling in the ears and/or tinnitus with this substance. Effect may last for long periods after the experience due to the ototoxicity of opioids

## Forms

#### Black tar heroin
**Black tar heroin is dangerous to inject**
 
It's not practical to make black tar heroin sterile, for example, by heating a solution with a lighter for a minute. Black tar heroin injection is associated with *Clostridium botulinum* infection. [Prion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion) : "For prion elimination, various recommendations state 121–132 °C (250–270 °F) for **60 minutes** or 134 °C (273 °F) for at least 18 minutes." A pressure cooker reach 120 °C at full pressure. However, we don't recommend black tar heroin injection even if you own a pressure cooker with a PSI meter due to lack of safety data.
This form of heroin is diacetylmorphine acetate, a product of heroin production that does not require further acetylation. It differs in texture from powder heroin in that it is black, gooey, viscous, and a texture ranging from quite similar to wet asphalt and a hard rock of material. It is commonly produced in South America and is found on the western coast of the USA.

The actual chemical contents of black tar heroin can vary from the white powder form. Black tar might contain a variable mixture of morphine derivatives, predominantly 6-MAM (6-monoacetylmorphine) which is another result of crude acetylation that occurs in the clandestine manufacturing process.

When injected into any type of tissue, this form of heroin results in an increased risk of wound botulism . Wound botulism can be fatal and leads to amputations and death at a higher rate of black tar heroin users. Because of the consistency of the substance (tar-like), it can pose a greater risk for collapsing, damaging, or infecting veins. This damage to veins leads to a higher chance of subcutaneous and intradermal injection which is not advocated from a harm reduction point of view. For users who do choose to inject this substance, it is advised to follow the procedures found in the [safer injection guide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Safer_injection_guide) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

Like many other opioids, unadulterated heroin at appropriate dosages does not cause many long-term complications other than physical and psychological dependence and [constipation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Constipation) . Outside of the extremely powerful addiction and physical dependence, the harmful or toxic aspects of opioid usage are exclusively associated with not taking [the necessary precautions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_use) in regards to [its administration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Injected) , [overdosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage) and using impure heroin products that contain harmful additives.

Heavy dosages of heroin can result in severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) which can result in dangerous or even fatal levels of anoxia (oxygen deprivation). This occurs because the breathing reflex is suppressed by [agonism](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonists) of [µ-opioid receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid_receptors) - this effect is proportional to the dosage of the substance consumed.

Due to the nature of the unregulated drug market, illicit heroin is of widely varying and unpredictable purity. A user may prepare what they consider to be a moderate dose while actually taking far more than intended in the event of obtaining a purer product than they are used to, or may be cut unknowingly with more potent and dangerous substances such as [fentanyl](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Fentanyl) . Depending on drug interactions and numerous other factors, death from overdose can take anywhere from several minutes to several hours and is a direct result of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) leading onto anoxia (oxygen deprivation) resulting from the breathing reflex being suppressed by [agonism](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonists) of [µ-opioid receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid_receptors) . Some sources quote the median lethal dose (for an average 75 kg opiate-naive individual) as being between 75 and 600mg.

Heroin can also cause nausea and vomiting; a significant number of deaths attributed to opioid overdose are caused by aspiration of vomit by an unconscious victim. This is when an unconscious or semi-conscious user who is lying on their back vomits into their mouth and unknowingly suffocates. It can be prevented by ensuring that one is lying on their side with their head tilted downwards so that the airways cannot be blocked in the event of vomiting while unconscious (also known as the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) ).

In case of a suspected or known overdose, it is advised to administer a dose of [naloxone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Naloxone) intravenously, intramuscularly, or nasally to reverse the effects of opioid agonism .

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) such as [volumetric dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_dosing) , when using this substance to ensure the administration of the intended dose (especially due to the unusually high risk of an overdose this substance presents.)

#### Bodily harm

Many opioid drugs, especially oxycodone and heroin , are known to be [ototoxic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ototoxicity) , causing hearing loss, tinnitus and balance issues. In some cases the damage can be irreversible.

Opioids can cause [urinary retention, or difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating) and [constipation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Constipation) with chronic and repeated use. Some users find relief in blowing hard into their palm or doing squats before using the toilet, as this compresses core muscles onto the bladder.

### Dependence and abuse potential

As with other [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , the chronic use of heroin can be considered extremely addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological and physical dependence among certain users. When psychological or physical addiction has developed, mental and physical [withdrawal symptoms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids#Discontinuation) and cravings may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of heroin develops with prolonged and repeated use. The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects, with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly for instance. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same psychoactive effects of a previously lower dose. After heroin tolerance has developed, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Heroin presents cross-tolerance with all other [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , meaning that after the consumption of heroin all [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) will have a reduced effect.

The risk of fatal heroin overdoses rise sharply after a period of cessation and [relapse](/w/index.php?title=Relapse&action=edit&redlink=1) , largely because of reduced tolerance. When users dose their old doses, they no longer have the physical tolerance to handle the sedative effects of heroin and overdose occurs. To account for this lack of physical tolerance, it is safer to only dose a fraction of one's usual [dosage](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage) if using after a prolonged period of sobriety. It has also been found that the environment one is in can play a role in tolerance: in one scientific study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the drug in contrast to a familiar environment.

Studies have shown that the subjective [cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria) and [physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) of heroin use, which is the reinforcing component of addiction, is proportional in its' intensity to the rate at which the blood level concentrations of the drug increases. Intravenous injection is the fastest route of drug administration, causing blood concentrations to rise the fastest. It is followed by smoking, suppository (anal or vaginal insertion), insufflation (snorting), and ingestion (swallowing).

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Alcohol** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. Place affected patients in the recovery position to prevent vomit aspiration from excess. Memory blackouts are likely
- **Stimulants** - Stimulants increase respiration rate which allows for a higher dose of opiates than would otherwise be used. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the user and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Benzodiazepines** - Central nervous system and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present. The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position blackouts/memory loss likely.
- **DXM** - Generally considered to be toxic. CNS depression, difficulty breathing, heart issues, and liver toxicity have been observed. Additionally if one takes DXM, their tolerance of opiates goes down slightly, thus causing additional synergistic effects.
- **GHB** / **GBL** - The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position
- **Ketamine** - Both substances bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the user falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
- **MAOIs** - Coadministration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) with certain opioids has been associated with rare reports of severe adverse reactions. There appear to be two types of interaction, an excitatory and a depressive one. Symptoms of the excitatory reaction may include agitation, headache, diaphoresis, hyperpyrexia, flushing, shivering, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor, diarrhea, hypertension, tachycardia, seizures, and coma. Death has occurred in some cases.
- **MXE** - MXE can potentiate the effects of opioids but also increases the risk of respiratory depression and organ toxicity.
- **Nitrous** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position. Memory blackouts are common.
- **PCP** - PCP may reduce opioid tolerance, increasing the risk of overdose.
- **Tramadol** - Increased risk of seizures. Tramadol itself is known to induce seizures and it may have additive effects on seizure threshold with other opioids. Central nervous system- and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present.
- **Grapefruit** - While grapefruit is not psychoactive, it may affect the metabolism of certain opioids. Tramadol, oxycodone, and fentanyl are all primarily metabolized by the enzyme CYP3A4, which is potently inhibited by grapefruit juice . This may cause the drug to take longer to clear from the body. it may increase toxicity with repeated doses. Methadone may also be affected . Codeine and hydrocodone are metabolized by CYP2D6. People who are on medicines that inhibit CYP2D6, or that lack the enzyme due to a genetic mutation will not respond to codeine as it can not be metabolized into its active product: morphine.

## Legal status

- **Italy** : Heroin is a Schedule I drug.
- **Latvia:** Heroin is a Schedule I drug.
- **New Zealand:** Heroin is Class A in New Zealand. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Norway:** Heroin is Schedule I in Norway and illegal to buy or possess without a special license. There have been some projects to establish needle rooms in Norway by the government where heroin addicts are allowed to get fresh needles for injecting heroin. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Portugal:** The personal use of heroin was decriminalized by Law 30/2000 on July 2001. Possession of less than 1g is not regarded as a criminal offense although the substance is liable to be seized and the possessor can be referred to mandatory treatment. Sale or possession of quantities greater than the personal possession limit are criminal offenses punishable by jail time. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
