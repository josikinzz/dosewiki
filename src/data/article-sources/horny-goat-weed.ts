## Subjective Experience

Horny Goat Weed is often claimed to be an aphrodisiac and an aid to treat erectile
dysfunction. Even established health sites weigh in on this aspect, with Webmd.com
for instance tentatively stating that “Horny goat weed contains chemicals that might
help increase blood flow and improve sexual function”. Wikipedia adds that “the
herb has been used for this purpose in traditional Chinese medicine”.

However, I have also encountered occasional references to antidepressant-like
effects. This will be the focus of my research, although for completeness I will
document any change pertaining to libido (noting that I don’t suffer from erectile
dysfunction).

Regarding supply, at time of writing this is widely sold as a herbal supplement and as
an ingredient with other herbs. I purchased my sample of four 1000mg capsules
from Amazon.co.uk, and was encouraged by the label, which stated the following:

\`\`\`
“Horny Goat Weed Extract. No added chemical fillers or extras 100%
Natural Just as Nature Intended”.
\`\`\`
Establishing dose wasn’t straight forward although there were a few references here
and there. For example Rxlist.com offered “3-4 caps orally 90 minutes before sexual
activity“, whilst Examine.com specified an estimated human dose of “900mg Icariin
for a 150lb person“ for “testosterone boosting effects”.

I am in fact more or less this weight, and given that the vendor claimed that the
sample supply contains 30% icariin, the dose broadly equates to three capsules. This
is what I will go for.

\`\`\`
I pop the capsules at 3:30pm with fizzy water. An hour later I feel warm and
flushed, and a bit foggy. Certainly there is an effect although I wouldn’t say
this was necessarily psychoactive.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
On 90 minutes I am in the same space. I have a warm flush, with my face
feeling hot, and I feel slightly dazed. It wouldn’t be too far off the mark to
suggest that there are perhaps similarities to a sugar rush.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Regarding libido, there isn’t much to report. I have possibly more energy at
my disposal, but there is no significant increase in sexual arousal or drive,
compared to normal, even when testing via a couple of stimuli.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
It is reasonable to state that there is a problem here. I have significant
exposure to much more formidable chemsex drugs, such as
methamphetamine and mephedrone (see the chemsex segment in Section 1 of
this book), which could well be setting the bar far too high for this experiment.
I didn’t expect to be anywhere near to that sort of benchmark, and I am not,
but nonetheless, I feel that any effect in this area is quite minor. I note though
that perhaps a higher dose might yield a better return.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
After a couple of hours the flush and haze persists but it is possibly not as
intense. I remain aware of a difference to my normal status, but this appears
to be energy related rather than psychoactive.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I decide to check my blood pressure and heart rate. The former is fairly
normal, but strangely my BPM is a little lower than usual. This of course could
account for the slight fuzziness, although not the flush, at least in terms of a
reason I can imagine.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
During the course of the evening the effects fade slowly. I feel back to baseline
by the time I retire to bed (9.30pm).
\`\`\`
Overall I remain undecided regarding its status as a psychoactive. I wasn’t
stimulated, but I did feel a sustained head rush and was a little hazy for some time.
Certainly it isn’t an experiment I would repeat, as I felt that I got little of value from
the experience, and although there was something to it, I would probably classify it
as somewhat disappointing in terms of recreation.

  "wikipedia": `# Epimedium
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimedium*

Epimedium, also known as barrenwort, bishop's hat, fairy wings, horny goat weed, or yin yang huo (Chinese: 淫羊藿; pinyin: Yínyánghùo; Wade–Giles: Yin²-yang²-huo⁴), is a genus of flowering plants in the family Berberidaceae. The majority of the species are endemic to China, with smaller numbers elsewhere in Asia and a few in the Mediterranean region.
Epimedium species are deciduous or evergreen hardy perennials. The majority have four-parted "spider-like" flowers in spring.
The species used as a dietary supplement is Epimedium grandiflorum. It contains icariin, which is a weak PDE5 inhibitor, in vitro. Its clinical effects are unknown. While there is little clinical evidence to date, as sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil–sold under the brand names Viagra, Levitra and Cialis–are all based on (stronger) PDE5 inhibitory action, it is thought to have erectogenic properties and is found in some men's sexual health supplements.

## Description

Species of Epimedium are herbaceous perennials, growing from an underground rhizome. Their growth habits are somewhat variable. Some have solitary stems, others have a "tufted" habit, with multiple stems growing close together. There may be several leaves to a stem or the leaves may be solitary, produced from the base of the plant. Individual leaves are generally compound, often with three leaflets, but also with more. Leaflets usually have spiny margins. The leaves may be annual, making the plant deciduous, or longer lasting, so that the plant is evergreen. The inflorescence is an open raceme or panicle, the number of flowers varying by species.
Individual flowers have parts in fours. There are four smaller outer sepals, usually greenish and shed when the flower opens. Moving inwards, they are followed by four larger petal-like inner sepals, often brightly colored. Inside the sepals are four true petals which may be small and flat, but often have a complex shape including a nectar-producing "spur" that may be longer than the sepals. There are four stamens.
One of the common names for the genus, bishop's hat, arises from the shape of the flowers, particularly where the spurs are longer than the sepals.

## Taxonomy

The genus was given its name by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, in describing the European species E. alpinum. The name is a Latinized version of a Greek name for an unidentifiable plant, epimedion, that is mentioned in Pliny's Natural History (xxvii.57). The meaning of the original name is unclear.

### Species

As of November 2024, Plants of the World Online accepted the following species and naturally occurring hybrids:

### Horticultural hybrids

Some artificial hybrids are cultivated in gardens. These include:

E. × cantabrigiense Stearn, hybrid between E. alpinum and E. pubigerum
E. × perralchicum Stearn, hybrid between E. perralderianum and E. pinnatum subsp. colchicum
E. × rubrum Morr., hybrid between E. alpinum and E. grandiflorum
E. × versicolor Morr., hybrid between E. grandiflorum and E. pinnatum subsp. colchicum
E. × warleyense Stearn, hybrid between E. alpinum and E. pinnatum subsp. colchicum
E. × youngianum Fisch & C.A.Mey, hybrid between E. diphyllum and E. grandiflorum

## Cultivation

Some varieties and hybrids have been in Western cultivation for the last 100 to 150 years. There is now a wide array of new Chinese species being cultivated in the West, many of which have only recently been discovered, and some of which have yet to be named. There are also many older Japanese hybrids and forms, extending the boundaries of the genus in cultivation. The majority of the Chinese species have not been fully tested for hardiness nor indeed for any other aspect of their culture. The initial assumption that the plants would only thrive where their native conditions could be closely replicated have proven to be overly cautious, as most varieties are proving extraordinarily amenable to general garden and container cultivation.
The cultivar 'Amber Queen' is a recipient of the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

### Propagation

While they can be successfully propagated in early spring, epimediums are best divided in late summer, with the aim of promoting rapid re-growth of roots and shoots before the onset of winter. Several breeders (in particular Darrell Diano Probst, Tim Branney & Robin White) have also undertaken their own hybridization programmes with the genus.  Various new nursery selections are gradually appearing in the horticulture trade, the best of which extend the colour and shape range of the flowers available to the gardener.

## Chemistry

Epimedium wushanense contains a number of flavonoids. 37 compounds were characterized from the underground and aerial parts of the plant. Among them, 28 compounds were prenylflavonoids. The predominant flavonoid, epimedin C, ranged from 1.4 to 5.1% in aerial parts and 1.0 to 2.8% in underground parts.
