# Fluoxetine
*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00472*

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as trifluoromethylbenzenes. These are organofluorine compounds that contain a benzene ring substituted with one or more trifluoromethyl groups.

### Background

Fluoxetine is a 2nd generation antidepressant categorized as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).
2
It gained FDA approval in 1987 and although it was initially intended for the treatment of depression, today it is commonly prescribed to manage depression in addition to various other pathologies.
13

### Indication

Fluoxetine is indicated for both acute and maintenance treatment of major depressive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and bulimia nervosa; however, it is only indicated for acute treatment of panic disorder independent of whether agoraphobia is present.
12
Fluoxetine may also be used in combination with olanzapine to treat depression related to Bipolar I Disorder, and treatment resistant depression.
12
Fluoxetine is additionally indicated for the treatment of female patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).
18

### Pharmacodynamics

Fluoxetine blocks the serotonin reuptake transporter in the presynaptic terminal, which ultimately results in sustained levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in certain brain areas.
13
However, fluoxetine binds with relatively poor affinity to 5-HT, dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, muscarinic, and histamine receptors which explains why it has a far more desirable adverse effect profile compared to earlier developed classes of antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants.
13
2

### Mechanism of Action

Sodium-dependent serotonin transporter
Inhibitor

### Absorption

The oral bioavailability of fluoxetine is <90% as a result of hepatic first pass metabolism.
13
In a bioequivalence study, the Cmax of fluoxetine 20 mg for the established reference formulation was 11.754 ng/mL while the Cmax for the proposed generic formulation was 11.786 ng/ml.
11
Fluoxetine is very lipophilic and highly plasma protein bound, allowing the drug and it's active metabolite, norfluoxetine, to be distributed to the brain.
13

### Metabolism

Fluoxetine is metabolized to norfluoxetine by CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 upon ingestion.
13
8
Although all of the mentioned enzymes contribute to N-demethylation of fluoxetine, CYP2D6, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 appear to be the major contributing enzymes for phase I metabolism.
8
In addition, there is evidence to suggest that CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 mediate O-dealkylation of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine to produce para-trifluoromethylphenol which is subsequently metabolized to hippuric acid.
9
10
Both fluoxetine and norfluoxetine undergo glucuronidation to facilitate excretion.
13
Notably, both the parent drug and active metabolite inhibit CYP2D6 isozymes, and as a result patients who are being treated with fluoxetine are susceptible to drug interactions.

### Half-life

The half life of fluoxetine is significant with the elimination half-life of the parent drug averaging 1-3 days after acute administration, and 4-6 days after chronic administration.
12
Further, the elimination half life of it's active metabolite, norfluoxetine, ranges from 4-16 days after both acute and chronic administration.
12
The half-life of fluoxetine should be considered when switching patients from fluoxetine to another antidepressant since marked accumulation occurs after chronic use.
12
Fluoxetine's long half-life may even be beneficial when discontinuing the drug since the risk of withdrawal is minimized.
13

### Toxicity

In a report that included 234 fluoxetine overdose cases, it was concluded that symptoms resulting from fluoxetine overdose were generally minor and short in duration.
5
The most common overdose adverse effects included drowsiness, tremor, tachycardia, nausea and vomiting, and providing the patient with aggressive supportive care was the recommended intervention.
4
5
Despite this evidence, more severe adverse effects have been linked to fluoxetine ingestion although most of these reports involved co-ingestion with other substances or drugs as well as other factors.
4
For example, there is a case report that details a patient who ingested 1400 mg of fluoxetine in a suicide attempt and as a result, experienced a generalized seizure three hours later.
4
In a separate case, a 14 year old patient ingested 1.2 g of fluoxetine and subsequently experienced tonic/clonic seizures, symptoms consistent with serotonin syndrome, and rhabdomyolysis, although the patient did not experience sustained renal injury.

### Mechanism of action

The monoaminergic hypothesis of depression emerged in 1965 and linked depression with dysfunction of neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline and serotonin.
13
Indeed, low levels of serotonin have been observed in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients diagnosed with depression.
3
As a result of this hypothesis, drugs that modulate levels of serotonin such as fluoxetine were developed.
13
Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and as the name suggests, it exerts it's therapeutic effect by inhibiting the presynaptic reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin.
2
As a result, levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) are increased in various parts of the brain.
13
Further, fluoxetine has high affinity for 5-HT transporters, weak affinity for noradrenaline transporters and no affinity for dopamine transporters indicating that it is 5-HT selective.
13
Fluoxetine interacts to a degree with the 5-HT
2C
receptor and it has been suggested that through this mechanism, it is able to increase noradrenaline and dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex.

### Pharmacological action

Unknown

### Actions

Inhibitor

### General Function

Translocates drugs and phospholipids across the membrane (PubMed:2897240, PubMed:35970996, PubMed:8898203, PubMed:9038218, PubMed:35507548). Catalyzes the flop of phospholipids from the cytoplasmic to the exoplasmic leaflet of the apical membrane. Participates mainly to the flop of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, beta-D-glucosylceramides and sphingomyelins (PubMed:8898203). Energy-dependent efflux pump responsible for decreased drug accumulation in multidrug-resistant cells (PubMed:2897240, PubMed:35970996, PubMed:9038218)

### Specific Function

ABC-type xenobiotic transporter activity

### Gene Name

ABCB1

### Uniprot ID

P08183

### Uniprot Name

ATP-dependent translocase ABCB1

### Molecular Weight

141477.255 Da

### Curator comments

The level of CYP3A4 enzyme inhibition caused by fluoxetine is not thought to be clinically significant, according to official prescribing information.
