## Subjective Experience

Etizolam is my sleep aid of choice. I use it just occasionally, usually to kill a stim or a
trip. It works well, with little or no lag the following day. It comes on quickly, and is
effective even at 0.5mg.

However, on one occasion I consumed 2mg, and I learned the meaning of the term
hypnotic. I slept for 14 hours, and when I awoke, I was zombified. I felt good; floating
in a zoned-out headspace. A walk outside was extremely pleasant and the day passed
in a splendid haze. Despite this seductive positivity I instinctively knew that, given its
addictive tendencies, this was not a habit to get into.

That story perhaps serves as a reminder of the general nature of benzodiazepines:
overdose is a very serious hazard and many people struggle with long term addiction,
which is extremely difficult to shake off. Be careful.

Note: The general consensus appears to be that 1mg of etizolam equates to about
10mg of diazepam.
