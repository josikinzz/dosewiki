2-Methylmethcathinone (2-MMC, ortomephedrone) is a recreational designer drug with stimulant and euphoric effects. It is a substituted cathinone derivative, closely related to better known drugs such as 3-methylmethcathinone and 4-methylmethcathinone (mephedrone). It was first identified in Sweden in 2014, and has subsequently been reported in other European countries such as Poland and Spain.

## Chemistry

2-Methylmethcathinone's chemical name is 2-(methylamino)-1-phenylpropan-1-one. It is one of many substituted cathinones, synthetic chemicals derived from the natural chemical cathinone, found in khat. 2-MMC is a positional isomer of 3-MMC and 4-MMC.

## Pharmacology

2-MMC is a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agent, with higher preference for the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters. 2-MMC is expected to have similar characteristics to other cathinones, although studies show 2-substituted cathinones are weaker compared to 3 and 4-substituted ones. This is potentially due to steric hindrance.
In a study comparing various aryl-substituted methcathinone analogs in rat brain synaptosomes, the following values were found.

## Legal status

2-MMC is controlled as a schedule I substance in the United States (under hallucinogenic substances) as it is a positional isomer of 4-MMC.
2-MMC is controlled in Germany under the NpSG (New Psychoactive Substances Act). Selling, production with the purpose of sale, and administration are punishable. Possession is illegal, but not penalized.
2-MMC is illegal in Poland. Although it is not included in the list of psychotropic substances, it falls under the group of psychotropic substances of group I-P as an isomer of 3-MMC and 4-MMC (mephedrone).
It is illegal in the United Kingdom as a class B drug.
