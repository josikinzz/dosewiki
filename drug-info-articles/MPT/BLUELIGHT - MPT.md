I'd be more curious to try MPT but I also really want to try this stuff (still need to try my sample of DiPT).

^^^

yeah last night that occurred to me, why no MPT, 5-MeO-MPT, 4-HO-MPT etc.


i guess one could expect lesser oral activity, shortened duration, and what not. i vastly prefer DiPT to DPT, in fact the two are not even in the same league as far as im concerned. and it seems every ring substitution of DPT was a failure for one reason or another. dosent mean i wouldent want to taste MPT though, ayyy i havent even tried MET yet!

A friend told me its very feasible and even found a report on it (I believe in german). It is supposedly a drop in activity (around 80-100mg iirc). But it sounds good.


just to make clear I'm talking about MPT in this post.


My reasoning is DMT is great. MET is superb, if not a little 'light'. DPT is great if not a little heavy. Maybe a cross between those would be great also?

There is a public thread about MPT at hyperlab.info. Posted by "Erny", who is also a bluelight member, I think. I hope it's allright to post this


Here is a machine translation:

"MPT, 100 mH, [yuzer] of №1 100 mH of base were dissolved in the water with the aid of vapors of the drops of hydrochloric acid and it is drunk to the empty stomach. The first effects appeared in approximately 20 minutes. Appeared the weak [DET]- descriptive input physiology, which disappeared with the output in the plateau. Action was strengthened after 40-50 minutes it very rapidly and approximately reached maximum. On the body the substance acts faster as any [DET], while to the head - it is faster as [MET], i.e. gives classical [triptaminovuyu] empathy and sensation of the magic of proceeding, truth is weaker than at the analogous dose Of [mETa]. This substance yet not too strong, but the associated sensations into tele-, resembling tryptamines with large alkyls on the amino group, a little shade basic effects and mix at this level. [Vizualka] with the open eyes not very rich, predominates the green color (in [METe], as in [DMT], it predominates orange). With the closed eyes the evidently sufficiently beautiful things, similar to the not very large number of fungi. Music is received well, but strong emotions it does not cause. In the emotionalism this substance is strongly inferior To [mETu], in it not enough [triptaminovoy] dramaticism. Plateau very short perhaps of minutes 20, then action rapidly begins to weaken, and hardly it suffices to +1 after 2 hours. After 3 hours there remains only afterglow, through 3,5 already it is possible quietly to go to sleep. As a whole it seemed by some indistinct. It is necessary to try to smoke it."


and another one, that uses another route of administration

"MPT, 60 mH V/m (60 mH of the base, transferred into [gkh]) Effects appear for the 2nd minute and smoothly are strengthened during the following 10 minutes. [Vizualka] with the open eyes not very interesting and reminds EPT and DPT, although is somewhat more colorful/more living. With the flowers and the plant forms, but not the naked geometry. Peripheral effects at the entrance are considerably weaker than in first two. Nauseas it was not at all. As a whole the physiology proved to be considerably weaker than it was expected, problems with a feeling of equilibrium it was barely, “drunk” hydroxybutyrate-like motor coordination, characteristic for tryptamines with long alkyls on the amino group was present, but sufficient- after all weak. The noticeable weakening of painful sensitivity it was not. State is a little [snopodobnoe] and is absolutely calm. CEV[y] with the closed eyes resemble super-doses DET (200-300 mH) and partly the small doses of fungi, it is more “visions”, than chaotic geometry and [fraktalov]. Experiences have sufficient- after all the removed nature, in contrast to “the psychoanalytical” To mET, fungi and to [izhe] with them. Plateaus the maximum of minutes 20, after which effects smoothly fall, in the hour already +1,5, after 2 hours +1 maximums, and after 3 hours practically nothing. Afterglow is good and is pleasant, but is brief. It was pleased considerably more than the first time it is oral with 100 mH."

The fact it's being in the open web means you can take it and publish here, for example, providing the authorship, but I am not happy at all with that mashine translation.


Btw, I do not share the amusement with DPT I can see here. This is one of the worst psychoactive tryptamines I ever tasted. It has nothing in common with DMT or mushrooms. Rather a pointles GHB-like state with visuals that are, indeed, quite strong. I can not even name it a psychedelic. Dissociative, maybe? A sort of tryptamine narcosis. Every person I have communicated personally about it think the same. As everyone at behigh.org/inv. Surprisingly, Bluelight thinks different.

I've never heard DPT described as a pointless GHB-like state.  Many people report it to be among the most profound, magical and psychedelic substances in existence.

^Yeah, Bluelight thinks different, Erowid thinks different, and the market thinks different (it seems to be almost universal on vendor lists with even moderate selections.) People's reactions to DPT do vary widely more so than with other psychedelics, even between doses in the same individual. Still, it's bizarre that everyone at behigh.org/inv would think something so at odds with the consensus about it. It's quite deep; there's even some evidence (below) that it is a much more effective therapeutic medicine than the high and mighty LSD for alcoholics.  I can't imagine GHB-like drunkenness would be good for alcoholics. 


The article is [here](http://pdf-library.radio879.com/PDF/Indole/Dipropyltryptamine%20in%20Psychotherapy%20Robert%20A.%20Soskin%20Ph.D..pdf)


Some quotes from that article:


In 6 years of experimentation at the Maryland Psychiatric Research

Center, the value of DPT as a therapeutic adjunct has been tested in the

treatment of over 100 subjects, including alcoholic patients,6, 12 neurotic outpatients, and terminal cancer patients. ...


...A pilot study employing DPT as an adjunct to psychedelic

therapy with alcoholics showed a favorable success rate comparable to results

achieved with LSD on a similar population.' Ninety-two percent of the 51

patients were located for 6-month follow-up, and 47 percent of these patients

were independently rated by a social worker as essentially rehabilitated

according to measures of global adjustment. Thirty-eight percent of the

patients had remained totally abstinent at the follow-up period. ...


...Discussion of the uses of DPT would be incomplete without mention of

its usage as an adjunct in psychotherapy of terminally ill patients. The

objective of the treatment approach is to facilitate the occurrence of a

psychedelic peak experience within the framework of brief, intensive

psychotherapy to help relieve depression, anxiety, fears of death, and

psychological isolation. The treatment procedure originally developed at

Maryland Psychiatric Research Center for use with LSD consists of a 6-12-

hour preparation stage lasting 2 or 3 weeks, a high-dose -SPT session, and

several postdrug interviews to integrate the experience. I The drug-free

interviews generally focus upon current matters such as unresolved conflicts

between patient and family members, problems of confronting and accepting

diagnosis and prognosis, and discussion of philosophical and theological

issues. Family members are actively brought into treatment by giving them an

opportunity to discuss their feelings about the approaching death and

encouraging them to increase the extent of their interaction with the patient.

Pilot work with DPT suggests that it has an advantage over LSD in that its

shorter duration of action makes less demands upon the limited energy

resources of seriously ill patients.

yeah, I was going to say DPT has been traditionally used to initialize peak experiences. The notable studies were done on alcoholics. It has a PROFOUND effect on the human mind.


DPT is intense as all shit... be prepared for an industrial style DMT trip ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Everyone?  Who are you talking to, anyway? ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) I don't think I've ever encountered anyone who would hesitate to call it a psychedelic of the highest order.  Even if they didn't like it.

^^lol! tru that.  the 2 substituted DMT analogs I've wanted to try are MPT and MALT.  Hated both dipt and dpt.  I cant understand where this religeous thing about dpt comes from, it's NOTHING like dmt whcih is very spiritual.  dpt reminds me of how 5meodet is described but with decent visuals.  I would not call it dissociative as those IMO feel good, maybe dysphoric is better descript.

I find it funny how all the "negatives" you list about DPT are the very reasons I think it is simply the best psychedelic out there. Especially the fact that it is nothing like mushrooms.


On Topic: Wasn't it 4-Ho-MPT that shulgin reported to be no different from psilocin? or am I mixing up? (too lazy to check)

Yes, I know about Grof, alcoholics and erowid. That was Goebbels in hell who invented your DPT. I have tried it 3 times, with 100 mg orally, 80 mg i/m and 100 mg i/m. When thinking if there is anything worse in the tryptamine world, only 5-methoxy-AMT comes to mind. 


DPT is about nothing. 2C-B vulgaris is much much more profound, spiritual, insightful and even visually rich.


If you like DPT that much, perhaps, you would like EPT more. It resembles DPT in some ways, but is a psychedelic without doubt.


Of the four persons who tried MPT, I was the only one to appreciate it positive. One had none effects at all with 100 mg per os, two others said it was just like DPT, i. e. a poison of the same sort.

yes I would love to try EPT for the same reason I'd like to try MPT (it would be a gentler version of DPT I'd wager from my experiences with MET).

I would love to try either MPT or EPT.  I've wondered for a long time why they weren't out there yet, and just assumed I didn't understand the chemistry/economics and logistics of the synthesis enough to understand.


Erny, unless you're a really big guy, those doses of IM DPT are pretty high. Previously in the B&D DPT thread I even asked if anyone else found DPT to shift qualities at higher doses to a more 5-MeO-DMT-like spectrum of effects (this has happened to me during an unexpectedly intense 60mg dose, and a 70mg dose, whereas I (170lbs) usually use it at 50mg.) I personally like 5-MeO-DMT on occasion, but the negatives you describe about your high dose DPT experiences share a lot in common with the negatives many people describe in their 5-MeO-DMT experiences.  It's worth considering that maybe you've only seen one side of DPT.

![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) 


so far dmt and dpt have been the best.


I didnt get too much out of MET.


Anyone have any guess on what EPT should be like?

DPT shares nothing in common with 5meodmt IME.  It has an unpleasant body high and is devoid of euphoria where as 5meo while not as good as dmt/ayahuasca has a euphoria comparable to E/dmt sorta IMHO.  As far as i'm concerned no N,N-Tryptamine with the same sub @ both N-position is really any good other than DMT of coarse.

To each their own. I think DPT is as perfect as a psychedelic can ever get. It is the only one that had such a lasting positive effect on my life (taken in combination with Ketamine, who did the majority of the work, to be fair). 


I'd definitely be up for trying EPT and DET, but that's only because of their short duration (I presume?). I don't see the need for a "gentler" DPT - the fact that it hits you like a train is one of its good points.

I don't think so. Otherwise I wouldn't have tried 100. 100 were really a bit too much. Two propyls is just a wrong go.


Ethyl in EPT brings the third dimension into flat DPT experience. And a tryptamine warmth. And reduces the side effects too. Again, two different persons said it's like DPT.


DET effects vary from one person to another, for me it's only little more potent than MiPT. Some people state it is quite strong and visually rich, others - moderately so. Few feel almost nothing at all. It's side effects are quite noticeable, though not to the extent of DPT where they are annoing to horrible. I do not feel comfortable with them in doses higher, than 120 mg taken in a form of hydrochloride orally, especially on coming up. But there is a way to elongate and calm it down a little: 200 mg of the freebase as large crystals and in a gelatine capsule is a good way to trip on DET.


MPT feels like a hybrid of psilocin (more so, than DMT) and DPT. It's side effects are moderate, even in comparison with DET. It is definitely more visual than MET, yet of a different genre. Tropical verdure grows everywhere around you when in darkness. It looks the same upon closing the eyes, only start to morph, very much like visual effects of mushrooms. In higher doses CEV's move forward visions and complex scenes, not just plain geometry.


This chemical is capable to open the mind the way mushrooms do, though is, of course, inferior to them. There is some empathy present, and sense of harmony, though not a real sense of presence. That is the case when the dose is moderate to strong, not sure about higher ones. The state is a little dream like, and not that emotional as mushrooms or MET.


The most profound effects last only 1,5 hours when it is administered orally, about 40 minutes if the route of administration is i/m. The whole trip is 2 to 4 hours, and a little shorter, than MET.

I noticed with MET, my mindstate at the time of dosing *significantly* altered the visual nature of the trip...an aspect of the phenomenological experience of the drug that is **entirely** lacking from DMT (dmt is like a strap-in you're going for a ride rocket trip).


I guess DET may be even more pronounced than MET in that aspect?


Interesting thoughts, erny.


but, I agree with ps00d, 100mg IM of DPT is a **huge** fucking dose!


ps Can I ask how many experiences have you had with these chemicals? I might remind you that the experiences are highly variable (as you probably know) and that if you've only tried some chemical a handful of times you really don't have a good grasp on the character of the drug (it wasn't until I had tried MET roughly a dozen times that I could make what I felt were substantively valid comparisons of similarity/dissimilarity to DMT, which I've tried hundreds).

50mg IM was enough for the room to look like it would shake itself apart (so I mostly just kept my eyes closed!), so I can't even begin to imagine what 100mg IM would be like, other than requiring a 'what the fuck!' comment at some point ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

100 mg wasn't anything like a walls shattering dose. And my attempt to find any spiritual content inside this chemical described vividly in TIHKAL or erowid, when going up from 80 mg to 100, had no success. It is the same as trying to meditate on vodka. Only cloudiness would result.


And yes, I've forgotten about one girl at [https://www.behigh.org/inv](https://www.behigh.org/inv), who had visions of the sort described in TIHKAL, along with heavy body load at 50 mg i/m. And another one, that found it nasty at first, but later said she is willing to return there. So, we have 1,5 girls there out of dozen people, who have found something beyond GHB in DPT. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

This seems to correspond to what people said before about DPT turning 5-MeO-DMT like at such high doses. That could be part of what caused so many difficult or unpleasant experiences for you. DPT doses seem to vary quite a bit depending on ROA or who you ask. Always made me worry a bit about it, though I'd love to try it and DiPT at some point soon.

Last night I ingested 150mg of moclobemide, waited 40 minutes, and then insufflated 10mg of light yellow MPT fumerate. Purity and identity have been confirmed via GC-MS. There was a painful burn as expected, but it was significantly less severe and nauseating than DPT fumerate, MET fumerate, or DMT freebase. 10mg produced a slight shift from baseline. I waited twenty minutes and then orally ingested an additional 40mg by pouring it into my mouth. The taste was unpleasant, but not earth-shatteringly so. Within fifteen minutes I was at a plus three and felt a number of tryptamine signatures; most notably kundalini-type body vibrations that caused me to purr like a cat, shiver, and inadvertently trill my speech. There was a feeling that everything looked like a "filthy southwestern carpet." Outright visual distortions were rare and were mostly notional in nature e.g. things would look exactly the same as if I was sober yet they would appear utterly ridiculous. MPT is very light and good natured with less of a pull toward the heavy/negative than DPT and much sharper than dull and dumb MET, yet lacking the transcendental glory of DMT. The duration was a bit over two hours after which I took 15mg of 2C-B with two female friends, and we walked around the streets at night. I was wearing a giant pair of pants, which were given to me by an old schizophrenic friend. I felt that "New York City is a museum of disgusting" and ended up scrounging around under a bridge eventually finding a single child's shoe which I brought home and brewed sangria inside of. My two friends and I ravenously drank sangria from the abandoned child's shoe and then went to bed together.


I am acutely aware of the danger in mixing a MAOI with a phenethylamine. MPT is not being sold as a RC, please not not PM me for a source.

Gonna search for my files, I had two additional experiences with MPT, one in nature and one i.m., latter was close to earth shattering at least on the aesthetic part. Just coming back from a horrid bipolar episode, not sure if I find my notes again in the mess around here...

Thought I'd bump an old thread, maybe someone out there has experience with this one. I got a gram of MPT freebase on the way and wondering if anyone has vaped/smoked this. There isn't much info out there on dosage or experiences. Was thinking of dissolving in acetone and spreading on some damiana herb and then smoking that in a metal pipe with a screen (once the acetone evaporates off of course). Worked well in the past if you get the concentrations right so you can get the right amount in a single hit. 


I got a meth style pipe and could try using that instead but I find them to be a bit of a hassle, or at least never got the technique down. Guess I could try vaping off foil too. Anyways, advice appreciated. Not sure what to do with this exactly and what to expect.

I just smoked and snorted about 50mg of freebase MPT, a little bit at a  time, over about an hour or maybe a little longer. I vaporized it in a freebase pipe. The MPT seems very  pure. Its white and fluffy, didn't burn much when I snorted it, and has a  mild sweet flavor when vaporized. I have some experience with three  other base tryptamines, DMT, EPT, and DPT. The first 15 or 20 milligrams  I smoked was a  pretty solid dose. The rest of it I consumed made it a  bit stronger and presumably prolonged the effects. To sum it up, MPT is  very nice, with colorful visuals, a mild headspace, and very little body  load.


The visuals were beautiful. With eyes open, my vision was  sharp and clear and colorful, with hints of patterns forming everywhere.  When I closed my eyes, I saw fractals and paisley patterns in bright  shifting rainbow colors. It's not as visual as DMT, but the visuals were  still very pleasing.


The headspace doesn't seem to have the  depth of DMT or DPT. It's more on the level of EPT, but with less  confusion and anxiety. I'm not sure if there is a potential for a full  on breakthrough like with DMT or DPT. It was pretty clearheaded.


The bodyload wasn't bad at all. I didn't experience any nausea. Other than feeling cold, there was no discomfort.


I  think MPT is pretty good, but not mind-blowing. I would say the overall  feel of the trip is closer to DMT than to the other base tryptamines  I've tried, but they seem to all be pretty different from each other. I  think MPT would be great to combine with another psychedelic. I'll  probably smoke some the next time I take acid. MPT and DPT would  probably make a great combination too.

I've tried it couple of times and it seems to be pretty light and weak in action unless mixed with MAOI. I also use freebase and smoking/vaporizing route is the only way I've tried it. It doesn't seem to last too long even with MAOI, maybe 3-4 hours of noticeable effects.


MPT brings up waves of euphoria, both bodily and cognitive, color amplification and some floaty feeling for me. There's a report - [http://bluelight.org/vb/threads/815...-(MPT)-(DMT)-Experienced-Self-Excited-Circuit](http://bluelight.org/vb/threads/815634-(Harmaline)-(Mescaline)-(4-HO-EPT)-(MPT)-(DMT)-Experienced-Self-Excited-Circuit) , but I also took mescaline, 4-HO-EPT and DMT on that trip.


All and all I like MPT, but it is not enough to impress me, so I've been using it as an addition to other psychs. Let us know how your experimentation will go, I'd be interested! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**cj187**, how was snorting it? Noticeable effects compared to smoking?..8)


I also heard that the freebase is quite unstable but I've had my baggie for more than 6 months already and have been opening it and it still appears the same color and potency as the day I got it.

I can't really compare snorting it to smoking it. I smoked some first, then started snorting it. I don't know how much of the effects were from smoking and how much was from snorting it. I would imagine it's about 3 or 4 times less potent but longer lasting like with DPT or EPT. What I can say about it is that it hurt less than DPT HCl. I expected it to burn a lot because it's freebase. I only snorted a few mg at a time though, and I was already tripping which may have dulled the pain.

I appreciate the info and reports volsam and cj187. Eager to try this. Interesting that you snorted this, I didn't realize that was an option. Was under the impression that freebase chemicals don't readily absorb when snorted, so perhaps your effects were more from smoking? Anyways, don't want to speculate too much about things I'm not very certain about. Those reading should be aware that freebase and salt forms may not produce comparable results when snorted. I think I'll target 30 mg for my first experiment smoking. Should be able to get all the smoke in a single hit. Seems reasonable dose at least when compared to DMT. Hope to contribute to the info that's out there in a week or two.

I can't say how effective it was, but I think it did work because the duration was longer than a normal smoked tryptamine trip. Next time I'll try just snorting it.


I was just reading the MET thread and saw that somebody got decent effects from snorting 15mg of MET freebase, so I assume that it would also work with MPT.


I also plan to try taking MPT orally at some point.

Thanks for the report cj187, and thanks for adding on Volsam, that's some interesting stuff. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) It's fascinating to hear that the effects of MPT sound quite different in some ways from what I'm used to with 4-HO-MPT, but the same is also true with MiPT and 4-HO-MiPT, and really the others to their own extents, and I would also agree that different tryptamine bases are quite different from one another.... Despite having some definite tryptamine class similarities, this really is a remarkably varied group of molecules, with some pairs of chemicals barely even seeming like the same kind of drug.


Looking forward to trying this one more than ever now, and to any other reports anyone has to submit. :D

Its white and fluffy, didn't burn much when I snorted it, and has a  mild sweet flavor when vaporized. I have some experience with three  other base tryptamines, DMT, EPT, and DPT. The first 15 or 20 milligrams  I smoked was a  pretty solid dose. The rest of it I consumed made it a  bit stronger and presumably prolonged the effects. To sum it up, MPT is  very nice, with colorful visuals, a mild headspace, and very little body  load.

I would say the overall  feel of the trip is closer to DMT than to the other base tryptamines  I've tried, but they seem to all be pretty different from each other. I  think MPT would be great to combine with another psychedelic. I'll  probably smoke some the next time I take acid. MPT and DPT would  probably make a great combination too.

You can snort DMT freebase even, it apparently burns like the dickens but it certainly is effective.

I haven't tried MET, but I plan to get some, along with some MALT once my vendor starts selling it.


Today I tried MPT again. I decided to snort it, and weighed out 15mg to see how it compares with smoking it. It burned pretty bad this time. I guess I didn't notice it much last time because I was already tripping. I went through about 2/3 of it, then gave up because it was painful. Snorting freebase works, but I wouldn't recommend it.

Gotta say, I am very impressed by this one. Prepared my dose using 30mg of freebase MPT, dissolved in acetone, absorbed into 60 mg of damiana leaf and dried off. Was a challenge to get all the smoke in one hit but was surprisingly smooth and pleasant and could barely notice the presence of a chemical. Expected a blastoff but not really like that. 


Came up in intense waves and took a while to reach peak immersion. Not particularly visual at all but very perceptual even with eyes open as if gazing through. Light in a way but capable of depth. It was certainly a strong enough dose but not a complete flooring dose. I felt centered in a way throughout and didn't wish for it to be stronger. Made me very aware of my aches and pains in my body and odd energies in my field. A deep desire to be clean and healed deeply and to my core was the mindset of trip. Took it at 11:10 pm and still tripping lightly now 2 hours later. The stronger effects faded after 1 hour, afterglow trailed on. Pleasantly I might add. Glad I got to experience this one and will repeat.

Very interesting, thanks for sharing!   I have a gram of this, haven't tried it yet.  I want to try it smoked, and orally, and maybe rectally.  There isn't much to go on in terms of anecdotes yet, despite it being available for a bit.  So thanks. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

God this has been one of those threads to discuss everything but the item in question. a DPT/DMT hybrid, hard to see that not working and indeed the effects (50mg smoked) were very good. Probably write something up but much nearer to DMT in action than DPT though the duration more like that of the latter; it seemed quite light and easy in nature but perhaps dosage might change that.

Have gone through smoking another 100mg of it. MPT freebase is somewhat nice when smoked with Harmaline taken orally prior to smoking. Wavy intoxicating feeling of being super spacey. 


Character and substantiality is lacking in this chem imo, especially when taken without MAOI.

I've tried this chem 2 more times since I last posted about it, this time with plenty of 3-MeO-PCP in my system. My dosages where 30 mg and 50 mg MPT freebase smoked on non-psychoactive herb. I enjoyed the inner expansiveness of it. Gotta say, the 3-MeO-PCP did very little to amplify the effects. With other psychedelics like 1p-LSD or DPT the 3-MeO-PCP potentiated the effects very strongly,  almost alarmingly so. With MPT it seemed to suppress the visuals even further. It might be interesting to speculate on the binding affinities responsible for this difference. 


I experienced a kind of staticky weekly-fractilized inner blackness. Rich and vast. Pleasant for meditation and later for making some music. It really was on the tame side, but that wasn't a drawback for me. It was kind and good natured. Might be a good psychedelic for people starting out and learning to get comfortable with tripping.

I have combined 3-MeO-PCP with 4-HO-MiPT and I found it to make the tryptamine feel very superficial and almost in the background, it was weird.  But, like you, 3-MeO makes LSD much, much stronger.

Vaporized another 80mg of MPT along with cannabis, also on the same day orally took 600mg Agmatine, 300mg Phenibut and 15mg of Isopropylphenidate. The experience was pleasurable with a lot of body euphoria and pleasant sensations and became quite erotic and hedonistic ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

I finally got around to trying this one.... I have to say, I was actually pretty impressed with it, though that's not too surprising given that 4-HO-MPT has been my favorite research chemical so far. Anyway, I wrote a report if anyone wants to check it out. It can be found here:

You totally can! The trick is to have some sort of dissociative in the mix like a few boxes of whip its or some K/MXE, this will stop the pain in its tracks. If you snort some lines and then smoke some too it is a much more crisp experience that lasts a good bit longer! I'd assume this would apply well to any tryptamines you want to snort.

I smoked this for the first time the other day, at only 15mg, and had a light yet profound experience.  I just posted a TR:

I'm surprised there aren't more reports on this, since it's been available a while.  Personally I love it, it's quite mild compared to many other base tryptamines, very friendly and warm and slow-moving when smoked compared to most as well, which is nice.

It surprises me too. I think a lot of people overlook the unsubstituted tryptamines and just try the 4-subs.


I took some MPT orally today. I wasn't sure how potent it would be but I  ended up going with 115mg of the freebase in a capsule. That dose was  good, pretty much what I was hoping for. About 40 minutes after taking  it I started to feel the full effects, and the plateau lasted around 3  hours. Now, almost 7 hours after taking it, the effects have mostly worn  off but I still feel it a little bit.


It was fairly strong in some ways, but still mild and easy to handle compared to most other  psychedelics. There might have been a little more body load than when  I've vaped it, but for the most part I was pretty comfortable. I went on  a bike ride and it was nice. It felt effortless, like I was just  floating around. Watching the first episode of Planet Earth II was  great. The scene where the iguanas are trying to not get eaten by snakes  is really intense when you're tripping! 


I would say it's worth  it to take MPT orally if you want the effects to last a while. You have  to take several time as much as you would vaping it, but it lasts  several times longer, so it's not a waste at all.

Interesting. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Have you tried plugging it?  Generally plugging lasts almost as long as oral but with a substantially lower dose.

No, I haven't plugged anything before. It always seemed unnecessary to me. I don't think plugging MPT freebase is a good idea. I licked a tiny bit of it off the scoop I used and felt a tingly burning sensation on my tongue for a few minutes. Maybe you could neutralize it with vinegar or get the fumarate salt for plugging.

Oh well yeah you'd drop the freebase in a shot glass or something and add an acid dropwise while stirring until it dissolved as an HCl/citrate/whatever salt, then squirt it in there.  I used to do that with AMT freebase because I much prefer it plugged due to shorter come-up and lack of nausea.  Although with AMT the dose isn't really reduced, unlike with almost any other drug.


I really prefer taking something like 2C-E rectally too... not only is the dose cut in half, but the come-up is easier and the bodyload is less.

It's definetly best to plug 2c-E, the comeup is smooth and i would have incredibly powerful experiences off 20mgs. When i look back those are some of the trips i hold closest to my heart.


Id probably give plugging or orally a go when i dose MPT.

4-ho-MPT is hands down my favorite 4 sub so i just know that this one will be fantastic. Will definitely be looking into grabbing some up soon.

I recently heard another report of oral MPT use, 50 milligrams of the freebase. Apparently it was effective and enjoyable. Given how much I love 4-HO-MPT, and how much I hate smoking things, I'd really like to give oral MPT a shot myself one of these days.

I've noticed that my freebase MPT has degraded a little bit. It's still a  sparkly crystalline powder but its color has changed from white to tan  over the past 2 years.


The oxidized MPT is some nasty stuff to  vaporize but you can avoid it if you're careful. I heat the pipe very  slowly then remove it from the heat whenever I see the MPT starting to  vaporize. The impurities will be left behind in the pipe as long as it  doesn't get too hot. Don't try to get every last bit of MPT or you'll  end up vaporizing some of the bad stuff and burning your throat.

Where have you stored your MPT?  I got mine at least 2 years ago, and have been storing it in an amber vial in the freezer, and it still looks sparkly white.

I have now taken MPT orally four times. Bear in mind that while it seems like I may have somewhat below average sensitivity to 4-substituted tryptamines, it also seems like I may actually have above average sensitivity to base tryptamines.


The first time was at 50 mg. This proved to be a dosage that was low but pleasurable, and alike DMT and most of its direct analogues, despite the fact that it was a low dosage, certain aspects of still felt kind of more like higher dosages of other psychedelics. Overall, it reminded me a lot of a modest dosage of 2C-C, not quite as visual, euphoric, or stoning as you would want that to be for a complete experience but thematically similar in most ways, but also threatening to push deeper than that does. The most memorable thing about the experience was a few hours in after smoking some strong cannabis, closing my eyes and seeing an assortment of transparent, glowing corridors inhabited by a large number of shadow people moving around them from a somewhat bird's eye perspective, but I was in a social setting by that time and chose not to allow the effect to develop further. I recall that the experience lasted at least four or five hours in total and perhaps faded a little bit beyond that but it's been a little too long to remember exactly now.


The second time was at 75 mg. This dose was significantly stronger than the 50 mg one, but still not at the level of what one might go into something so similar to DMT expecting, but that being said, it had significant similarities to my 50 mg oral experience on MiPT. It was not as euphoric or stimulating as that, or as brightly colored and opaque in its visuals, but its geometric visuals were significantly more complex and its visionary effects were significantly more three-dimensional, but still largely feeling constrained to the mind's eye, and it had a deeper feeling to it overall than the MiPT did. Some feelings of relation to 2C-C also continued, but the increased intensity overall was pushing it beyond that. I enjoyed the experience but still felt it needed to be pushed further, but could very well be rewarding when it was. I don't believe this experience lasted all that much longer than the first one, but at least a little bit so probably.


The third time was at 100 mg. At almost exactly thirty minutes after dosing, I suddenly experienced a very strong mind's eye geometric visual of a complex spiraling tunnel of transforming shapes, and immediately the shapes became covered with an assortment of realistically detailed imagery such as somewhat mysteriously shiny silver bird feathers or twisting vines with leaves growing off of them, an effect similar to the initial visuals I experienced with my one smoked experience with 40 mg, so I knew I was finally getting somewhere. Around forty-five minutes to an hour in, sitting down to meditate and closing my eyes immediately revealed an internal forest I now sat at the base of watching birds fly around in beautiful geometric arrangements in the sky. A shift in perspective found me floating above the forest, watching dragons dive through the canopy and around mysterious temples littering the surrounding environment as I rose up through the sky, beyond the clouds, and into the sun. Opening my eyes reveals the universe rendered in the room around me, stars like gnats and planets the size of globes surrounded by all sorts of complex organic geometries. I find myself staring down upon an island covered by lush jungles on an alien world, alien plants surrounded by alien creatures of totally unfamiliar yet natural beauty, unfolding naturally as it does. Then I find myself watching psychedelic cobblestone covered in these alien plants spontaneously form in front of me and form their own spirals beckoning me into a void at the end of my perception. I find myself floating in this void, a baby, with loving protectors staring down at me from an unseen space, safe, simply being and not being. I am back at the apartment, filled with lust, and head to the bedroom and quickly drift off again. There is an orgy going in my head that produces tessellated geometric explosions with every orgasm. Every last ounce of sexual energy is drained until suddenly it flips and we have all become dolls in a child's dollhouse, and realize that we never have actually been anything different. Finally comforted, the child puts us back into her mind. I get up to take a shower and as I am in there, I feel her excitement explode out of me to the point that it rivals the earlier orgasms in intensity. After this the trip begins to subside, but slowly. It remains powerful but only in post-peak ways and takes around seven or eight hours to start really vanishing and was still at least lingering by nine or ten. I felt nearly manic for at least a week afterwards, similarly to my first experience with oral MiPT.


The fourth time was also at 100 mg. Unlike the first three experiences, this time I purged around forty-five minutes, and I am suspicious that this may have lost me at least a tiny bit of the dosage. The effects were more muted compared to the previous trip than I would expect even from the loss of some novelty compared to the first time at this dosage, but they were ultimately powerful and satisfying nonetheless. Open eye visuals were weak most of the experience or at least I never payed attention enough to give them the time to develop, but some beautiful closed eye visuals and visions occurred that were less complex than the previous trip but similar to higher dosages of mushrooms I've taken before, but larger, more realistic, and more hedonistic. I decided to take a hot bath and meditate on these closed eye visuals while smoking cannabis and repeating a mantra of letting go of being myself, and suddenly experienced the hallucinations intensifying to a crushingly intense point and then popped out into complete ego death, simply becoming the hallucination I was experiencing, and that hallucination was of myself staring in the mirror and feeling complete and utter contentedness with who I am, and "I" in that moment became that feeling, which was (in retrospect) absolute bliss, and then I returned to reality in my bath in a fit of hysterical laughter. The experience trailed intensely for many more hours but never again became as significant as that, or if it could have, I didn't care because I was too distracted by what had already happened. I believe it lasted at least nearly as long as the previous 100 mg experience though again at lower intensity.


That is all.

Wow that third experience sounds amazing.  I have only vaped this twice, and the first time was a special, meaningful experience to me that was important to have at the time, though the experience was also mild (only 25mg).  The second time was also 25mg was unremarkable.

It was a pretty remarkable and significant one, for sure. Some of it was very obviously personally relevant while some of the more esoteric stuff I'm still enjoying trying to connect the dots on.


I remember that first experience of yours, it did sound quite nice. It's too bad the second one fell short but I will note that I've often gone through the same with tryptamines, the same dosage being used twice for the first experiences being great the first time and lackluster the second time. Luckily it's only been a dosage-related issue for me so far, tryptamines are always pretty fulfilling as long as I just take enough. Have you had any more plans for MPT or just had it shelved for a while now?


My 40 mg smoked experience was intense enough to be more memorable than my 50 or 75 mg oral experiences, but it was significantly less memorable or meaningful than either of my 100 mg oral experiences, and also had significantly more body load post-peak, both that uncomfortable muscle tension feeling as well as a racing heart, neither of which bothered me on any oral dosage so far. I'll probably still try smoking a lower dosage again some time and, when I'm feeling masochistic enough, maybe also a higher dosage going for something equivalent to a smoked DMT breakthrough, but ultimately, after these experiences I honestly find it hard to imagine wanting to go back to that compared to oral. I also feel the same way about MiPT and feel that I will about all the others including DMT once I try them orally too though, for what that's worth; I've pretty much realized that smoked/vaporized psychedelics are really just not my thing in general, I pretty much prefer the flow of oral psychedelics no matter what. I really couldn't have asked for more from MPT taken orally than I've gotten so far, though that doesn't mean I won't go back hoping to find more.... I'm not saying anyone else will necessarily be as lucky as I am, even the older reports by Erny if I remember correctly highlight a particularly high variability among users in the responses to oral base tryptamines, but if anyone has considered using it this way I highly recommend giving it a shot, it could pay off quite well.


I think my next goal will be 125 mg... but I probably won't do it until I have a better setting than normal where I can solo trip but still have more room to stretch my legs than I would have at home, to counter any potential body load if it does come.

That third trip does sound remarkable Kaleida. Love the way you describe the visuals throughout it so detailed. Can almost feel like I was there while imagining it in my mind. After this I'm 100% picking up this chem a couple of vendors i know are stocking it. I will deff be eating it and working up to a 100mg dose like you did, seems like the best method.

I don't have any immediate plans but I certainly intend to keep exploring it further.  After reading of your success with eating it I think I will eat it next, perhaps at 50mg.

MPT does have some nice closed eye visuals. That's one of the notable things I've noticed about it. I usually don't have a lot of CEVs on most psychedelics, but on MPT I mainly see a lot of cool visuals with my eyes closed but not a lot of OEVs.

Yeah, I would agree that closed eye is where it really shines with this one; I had fantastic open eye visuals on that strongest trip but that's mainly because I was hallucinating so hard it largely didn't matter if my eyes were open or closed, and it was still much more visionary than it was traditionally sensory. That being said, I do still get really nice open eye geometric-type visuals from it, but they're more so nice because of their DMT-like complexity rather than because they're particularly prominent or attention-grabbing on their own, and the closed eye ones still tend to be better and more developed. I feel the same way about DMT and most base tryptamines, for the record.


That's actually another difference from 4-HO-MPT: I find their open eye visuals similar but 4-HO-MPT's are a bit less developed but also significantly more prominent and dominant than MPT's, with less, but still not no focus on the closed eye visuals. Again, similarly to how psilocin compares to DMT for me, so I'm not too surprised.

Yeah in my significant trip with this, I had some perspective changes on some LED light effects I was looking at (the pattern looked like it was inside the wall instead of glowing on the surface of the wall) but with eyes closed I went on a narrative inward journey that was mediated by the images.

Wow, that does sound really special! I wonder if maybe you have atypical enzyme levels allowing these base tryptamines to be so much more effective than they are for some other people? If so, maybe a RIMA might be the way forward to unlocking the magic for people that get lighter effects?

I don't hesitate to say it was one of my best trips ever. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) But just one of many to come on it, I hope!


This is a very unscientific statement, but I honestly would not be at all surprised if I turned out to have a relatively lower MOA-A level. Psychedelic drugs that I have so far seemed to be somewhat unusually sensitive to include the base tryptamines, 5-substituted tryptamines as well to at least some extent, simple phenethylamines, and MDMA somewhat, whereas 4-substituted tryptamines, lysergamides, and maybe also amphetamines I generally seem to need pretty normal or higher than normal dosages of, which all seems relatively consistent with what I know about how combining with MAOIs seems to mostly impact these drugs or with what I know about their observed metabolism and how slight structural changes can alter it. As always there could be a totally different explanation too but it seems at least feasible.


I wouldn't necessarily recommend that others go out and start mixing novel drugs with enzyme inhibitors based on this observation and theory alone, but given that people already have and likely will continue to do take MAOIs with synthetic base tryptamines anyway, I will certainly look forward to see if them doing so does actually start to bridge the gap in this way. I will note though that the fact the base tryptamines are orally active at all does at least suggest to me they are attacked less by MAO-A than DMT is already, and I actually keep finding that they tend to last a really long time when taken orally to add on to that too, generally longer than the corresponding 4-substituted tryptamine, which kind of surprised me.


Safe travels as always, everyone. ❤

Open eye visuals were weak most of the experience or at least I never payed attention enough to give them the time to develop, but some beautiful closed eye visuals and visions occurred that were less complex than the previous trip but similar to higher dosages of mushrooms I've taken before, but larger, more realistic, and more hedonistic. I decided to take a hot bath and meditate on these closed eye visuals while smoking cannabis and repeating a mantra of letting go of being myself, and suddenly experienced the hallucinations intensifying to a crushingly intense point and then popped out into complete ego death, simply becoming the hallucination I was experiencing, and that hallucination was of myself staring in the mirror and feeling complete and utter contentedness with who I am, and "I" in that moment became that feeling, which was (in retrospect) absolute bliss, and then I returned to reality in my bath in a fit of hysterical laughter. The experience trailed intensely for many more hours but never again became as significant as that, or if it could have, I didn't care because I was too distracted by what had already happened. I believe it lasted at least nearly as long as the previous 100 mg experience though again at lower intensity.

How long was the duration for the oral 100 mg and did you still feel functional enough to walk around,etc?

I plugged 40mg of the fumarate last night. Took it in a few doses over an hour. It didn't dissolve very well and even though the MPT came as an off-white powder, there were these brownish particles that almost looked like sand floating in the solution. Slight discomfort upon plugging but nowhere near as bad as 2C-B, for example.


It took 20-30 minutes to reach the peak. It was somewhat malleable in that if I sat down and focused on something or closed my eyes, it was quite psychedelic, but if I stood up and walked around I didn't feel very intoxicated. At one point I walked outside and I was questioning whether I was even on anything. However when I sat down and examined anything its shape and sense of scale would be quite distorted and textures became much more apparent. I also noticed an effect where the center of my vision became much more prominent. There was a sort of visual swirling effect that started to drag other senses in along with it—this was quite novel compared to the other effects, but in a strangely familiar way. This effect was only briefly present and didn't develop further but I think at a higher dose it would be quite encompassing.


When I really focused on the MPT it was more psychedelic than say 100mcg of ALD-52 or 8mg of 5-MeO-MiPT (using those as a frame of reference since I explored those dosages recently), but the MPT experience also seemed easier to snap out of. With the 5-MeO-MiPT in particular, I felt like I was part of the experience, whereas with the MPT I felt like I was just observing the experience. At one point on the MPT it actually dawned on me that the headspace felt quite dissociated, but without the obliteration of emotions that comes with an NMDA receptor antagonist dissociation.


About 2 hours after the last dose I noticed that the experience seemed to calming down. I stopped keeping track of time after that but I think about an hour later I felt fairly normal. So perhaps the plugged duration is about 3-4 hours. That's almost a perfect duration for me so it's somewhat disappointing that it doesn't dissolve very well. I think if the oral duration is fairly similar I would just eat in the future.

**Theta:**


Thanks much for the report, ecstasylover, I'm glad to hear it went well. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Your experience sounds pretty relatable to the ones we've had so far, especially on the lower end of the dosage range. The time course you described sounds relatively similar to both smoking it for us but a little slower and as you know we find these things to change less than expected between smoking and oral and that extends to MPT, so I'd say you've got a shot at least. I'd say on a higher dosage there's a chance you may feel it trailing for longer, but this is also true for us both orally and smoked, and the heavier effects still mainly seem to last the first few hours.


The way you describe the versatility of it is something we tend to find more common in base tryptamines in general compared to 5-methoxytryptamines and 4-substituted tryptamines, and is also part of what makes me sometimes compare them to phenethylamines within the tryptamine world (a fun fact I also like, early scientific papers on DET described it as producing a syndrome more similar to mescaline than LSD). I would also agree that it is relatable to dissociatives - and have called phenethylamines particularly relatable to dissociatives in the same way too, for the record, but I think MPT is on the stronger end of that spectrum more alike amphetamine psychedelics than the average simpler phenethylamine we've taken - and think it's interesting that you contrast it to NMDA receptor antagonism-induced dissociation as well; I like thinking about the fact that dissociation seems to be caused by glutamate yet that means that NMDA receptor antagonists should actually produce effects directly opposite to at least a portion of the standard dissociation-associated syndrome, that produced by glutamate acting as an agonist at NMDA receptors, so theoretically, what this specific effect we call "dissociation" in this context actually is might be better exemplified by drugs like psychedelics than by the drugs we actually primarily call dissociatives, and this might be becoming especially obvious now as we find more and more of the drugs like psychedelics that are potent enough in this way, via high enough 5-HT2A receptor efficacy or synergy with 5-HT1A receptor mediated disinhibition or whatever reason(s) it happens to actually be, perhaps like MPT for example, allowing them to produce effects that are closer subjectively to those we normally associate with the levels produced by NMDA receptor antagonists, yet with distinct differences due to them not simultaneously antagonizing NMDA receptors. Once again, just putting it out there as food for thought; it seems fairly a consistent with a lot of what we know about various tryptamines and psychedelics in general and our personal experiences with them.


Looking forward to the next one, and thanks again for sharing. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hey, sorry we never got back to you about this, I just saw it now when checking ecstasylover's post.


We definitely felt altered until at least nine or ten hours after dosing, but much more subtly in decreasing waves of intensity in the later hours to where it was mostly a lingering high with the occasional burst of trippy mental imagery or something like that, but the peak was at least I want to say an hour and a half or two hours and some stronger effects did remain for at least a couple hours after that. I wish I could give you more accurate answers than that, but we didn't attempt to track it at the time and it was a good while ago now.... We might have to do that one again soon and actually make a report of it this time.


The trip at that level was engaging enough that I wouldn't want to have to do anything but trip, but we didn't really feel severely inhibited in any way that I can recall. We calmly wandered around the apartment for a lot of the experience just marveling at the hallucinations and thinking about life. I do recall there being some of a DMT-like bodily heaviness, which is pretty standard for us with base tryptamines, but it wasn't completely immobilizing for us even at that level.

Good to hear it's orally active I may try that next time. It's some nice material, a little underwhelming but still pleasant and some nice aphrodisiacal qualities I thought. I vaped a few 20 mg doses last night. Will this effect my tripping tolerance like 4-aco-dmt or is it like DMT or 5-meo-dmt where it doesn't have any effect? Could you do this stuff two days in a row like DMT or will tolerance set in fast? I was think about dropping acid this week and now a bit worried this will cause tolerance issues. It has a nice next day glow too, everyone seems to be on the look out for mood enhancement. Overall I'll give it a B though larger dose experiments in the future may raise the grade

I am also surprised by its mildness, considering it's DMT on one side and DPT on the other (methylpropyl).  And DMT and DPT are two of the most intense, balls to the wall psychedelics in existence.

I recently acquired some MPT **fumarate**, and I am interested in researching it orally or intranasally. Has anyone tested this particular salt with one of these RoAs? I don't know if [@Kaleida](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/377522/) 's report was with freebase or with the fumarate salt, and it seems quite important as potency (per gram) and pharmacokinetics could differ quite a bit.

In any case, if I do not find any conclusive answer, I will research it considering the report was about fumarate (so as I underestimate the dosage in the worst case).

Yes, I have had mixed success with the fumarate salt orally. Threshold effects at 80 mg, I think  I reached my desired intensity at 120 mg, still very lucid but a definite emotional psychedelic headspace, not much in the way of visuals, but I want to revisit it when I have time just to more accurately feel out its character, hopefully I'll haev a report up then.

I would say start from 60-75 mg and work your way up, but depends on your own size and sensitivities etc.

That describes my 25mg smoked experience.  Very lightly visual, I probably could have acted relatively normally, but listening to music, I had inward visionary-style journeys that were very emotional in nature.  The culmination was a seeming meeting with a recently deceased friend who I had some anger towards, and a mutual forgiveness, which was very powerful.  If I would have been talking to someone with eyes open instead, I probably would have said it was not very active and an underdose, though.


It's odd to me how mild MPT is, when DMT and DPT are two of the most powerful psychedelics in existence.

But 4-HO-MPT on the otherhand is a very powerful 4-sub and one of my favorite from the bunch. But yes my MPT experiences were pretty mild as well in comparison to other Tryptamines. Id like to take 125-150mg oral dose of MPT at some point in the future and see if it takes me anywhere tho. Kaleida's high dose oral report was wonderful when she took the 100mgs.

She's sensitive to base tryptamines and 5-MeO subs in general, but 100mg of N,N-MPT seems like a reasonable dose based one what little I've found on it.

Rather a pointles GHB-like state with visuals that are, indeed, quite strong. I can not even name it a psychedelic. Dissociative, maybe? A sort of tryptamine narcosis. Every person I have communicated personally about it think the same. As everyone at behigh.org/inv. Surprisingly, Bluelight thinks different.

I acquired 250 mg of MPT fumarate some time ago and tested it yesterday. The dosage wasn't entirely clear to me, but I knew it was high, similar to other basic tryptamines. I decided on an oral intake of 200 mg, and 45 minutes earlier I took 150 mg of moclobemide to enhance and prolong the experience.


The first effects appeared after 45 minutes, along with quite a strong body load. The substance took a while to kick in, and at first, it was nothing more than subtle disturbances in the visual perception Weak CEVs, weak psychedelic mindspace as well. The trip leaned more towards the sedative category than energetic. MPT was just average in every aspect for me, except for one - the body load. Even though I'm generally resistant to psychedelics bodyload, it bothered me quite a bit here. Strong nausea occurred, but without vomiting. Towards the end of the trip, gastric problems arose, but I don't rule out that it wasn't because of MPT.


I'm slightly disappointed. It seems to me that with this substance, we're dealing with a glass ceiling, and probably 50 mg would give the same effect as the 200 mg I took. My intuition tells me that above 50 mg, only the body load increases, and the main effect remains unchanged. Someday I'll try taking the remaining 50 mg nasally. Perhaps mixed with something else because this substance alone, in my opinion, doesn't have much to offer.


I tried to get the most out of this trip so around the peak, I smoked a bit of JWH-210, inhaled some nitrous oxide, and took ketamine. Then it became enjoyable, and even slight CEVs appeared. But JWH-210 and ketamine were dominating the trip and MPT was just an addition from that moment.


The duration of MPT was around 4-5 hours, but I remind you that I took moclobemide. Without moclobemide, it probably would last around 3 hours.

So I've gotten somewhat familiar with this compound, 4 trials over the period of a month or so. At first, I wasn't particularly impressed and almost wrote it off. As the person before me stated, I found it to be just "average". However, I have since found that it combines very well with both DMT and Ketamine. Last night I was going pretty deep with K, which I rarely do. Me and homie decided to take a rip of the mostly empty (MPT lol) pipe, but we got 2 pretty solid rips each. Maybe an hour or 2 later, we are like "why are so rocked?" Oh yeah it must be the MPT. Everything was very colorful and we were even getting open eye visuals at that point whereas with the Ketamine or MPT alone, I don't think I would have that. Duration by itself was maybe 2 hours smoked (I guess I didn't take the best notes), but with ketamine, it seemed to extend the duration. With the DMT combo, it seemed the DMT was extended. Anyway I didn't really have much of the material so this is probably the extent of my experimentation with the substance. All in all, I did like it.

Quite inspired by your post I decided to convert my remaining MPT fumarate (around 50 mgs) to freebase, along with a little less than 200 mg of MET fumarate. What I was left with was 140 mg of MPT+MET freebase mixture, MET being around 77% of the mixture, though.


What I can say, smoking this can for sure eventually lead to a breakthrough like experience. The trip was very similar to DMT and I can't really talk about any differences here, except for:

- the taste was much worse than DMT (I literally vomited during smoking)

- duration of the trip is about 4 times longer than DMT

- dosage for effective dose is about 2x higher than DMT

I probably loaded maybe 50mgs at a time. I did not weigh it, though I always start slow.

Duration is definitely longer.

I typically like the taste of tryptamines


Glad you had a breakthrough.


I love myself some MET, wow wow. but i could never bring it to breakthrough, and I've def taken 100mgs at a time hahah


Youre math seems spot on. well done
