**DMT** is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound of the tryptamine family. It acts as a partial agonist for several serotonergic receptors. DMT has a high affinity for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor in the brain where it mimics the effects of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT). Its presence is widespread throughout the plant kingdom and occurs in trace amounts in mammals (including humans) where it is thought to function as a trace neurotransmitter.

It acts as a short acting smokeable psychedelic that provides a short trip of only five to ten minutes in length. Despite this short duration, it is still universally considered by anybody who has tried it in a positive environment to be the most incredible experience a human being could ever possibly go through.

It is so vastly different from anything else a person has previously experienced that not even the most extreme of sober circumstances could ever come close in terms of profoundness and intensity.

DMT is broken down by the digestive enzyme monoamine oxidase through a process called deamination and is therefore inactive if taken orally unless combined with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) such as harmaline or a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA) such as harmine. This is how DMT is taken traditionally within Southern American tribes, through a mixed brew known as Ayahuasca, which has its own dedicated guide [here](http://www.disregardeverythingisay.com/post/16326142673/ayahuasca-broken-down-and-described).

The DMT experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of DMT can be broken down into two components both of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - the body high of DMT can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft, and all encompassing glow. It maintains a consistent presence that quickly rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. It is capable of becoming very powerful at higher doses and remains for up to half an hour after the trip itself.
- **Changes in gravity** - at higher dosages physical feelings of being catapulted across vast distances at incredibly high speeds are common.

**Cognitive Effects:**

The head space of DMT is described by most as extremely sober and clear headed in its style when compared to other commonly used psychedelics such as LSD, psilocin or even ayahuasca. It contains a limited amount of typical cognitive effects.
The most prominent of these typical effects generally include:

- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Removal of cultural filter**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Rejuvination**
- **Direct communication with the subconscious**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**
- **States of unity and interconnectedness**

DMT in its smokeable form is perhaps the least psychologically intoxicating psychedelic. It is due to this lack of mental intoxication that many people describe DMT not as something which feels not like a drug induced trip but a genuine experience that is actually happening to them. It’s worth noting that many people report that DMT contains less personal insight in comparison to orally active psychedelics such as ayahuasca, LSD and psilocin due to its short acting nature.

**Visual Effects:**

*Enhancements*

DMT presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally include:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, the effects experienced are detailed below:

- **Visual drifting** (*Melting, Breathing, Morphing and Flowing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion and static in its appearance.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition**
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of psilocin than LSD. It can be comprehensively described as structured in its organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, equal in blurred and sharp edges and equal in rounded and angular corners. At higher dosages, the geometry is significantly more likely to result in states of Level 7B visual geometry over Level 7A.

The geometry present with smokeable DMT is often considered to be the most profoundly intricate and complex set of visual geometry found within the entirety of the psychedelic experience. In comparison to orally active DMT (ayahuasca) they are significantly more digital in appearance and contain a colour scheme which is similar to LSD but a structured style that is closer to high dose psilocin.

*Hallucinatory States*

- DMT produces a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of any other commonly used psychedelic. These effects include:
- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - this particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively religious, spiritual, mystical or transcendental nature in their overall theme.

**Auditory Effects:**

The auditory effects of DMT are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- **enhancements**
- **distortions**
- **hallucinations**

**Progressive Stages:**

Now that I’ve at least vaguely discussed the basis material for everything seen during such an experience, I can now walk you through the four different stages of a DMT trip and explain to you what they are like.

**The First Stage: Taking Off**

The first step of a DMT trip is the come up that leads onto breaking through. This is something that seems to have at least a few different ways of presenting itself to a tripper as they start to smoke DMT.

The first thing that a person notices however is an extremely distinct set of visual enhancements and most noteably an increase in visual acuity and colour intensity.

This is followed by a sudden onset of high level 3 geometry, the body high and the feeling of your body being pleasantly tugged in all directions at once from the inside.

This is often accompanied by a soft crackling sound and an extended tone that quickly increases in volume and pitch proportionally as the visuals increase. This sound becomes all enveloping abruptly ends as one of a few different “take off” options are experienced.

These include, but are certainly not limited to:

- feelings of suddenly being pushed through and onto the other side of a membrane,
- the room in front of you splitting in two down the middle leaving a gaping infinite chasm filled with incredibly fast moving visuals as you separate from your body shooting directly into it at light speed
- increasing geometry simply becoming so all enveloping that absolutely nothing of the room is left any more.

This all happens within the space of about 30 seconds to a minute and leads directly onto the second stage of a DMT trip.

**The Second Stage: The Waiting Room**

Almost immediately after a person has smoked enough DMT to have “taken off”, they often find themselves spending a brief amount of time in what is described to feel like a psychedelic “waiting room” or a “loading screen”. This can take any form but generally takes the shape of a tunnel or space comprised of fast moving geometry that lasts approximately 10 – 20 seconds and feels distinctively different from the main bulk of the trip.

This distinctive feeling has led me to speculate that this is some sort of psychedelic loading screen and it’s during this moment that the trip ahead of you is being generated and planned out.

The waiting room starts off quickly but immediately begins to slow down and form into the third and most important stage.

**The Third Stage: The Other Side**

Once the waiting period is over and the trip has been generated the user will feel that they have broken through onto the other side. It is here where literally anything can happen to you, but despite this most trips seem to follow some extremely common archetypes and plots that happen almost universally across people who have tried DMT.

These generally consist of visiting in an alternate reality that feels so real it seems to be better defined than real life. Usually, this is with a single or multiple external autonomous entities in front of your line of sight. These entities appear to have been waiting for your arrival, usually completely unsurprised by the tripper’s sudden appearance into their dimension.

They immediately begin to greet and welcome you with open arms, giving off a sense that they are deeply concerned with what they have to show you in the short amount of time that they have before you comedown.

At this point it is pretty common for the tripper (unless they are very experienced) to be completely overwhelmed by the nature of what is happening to them despite feeling completely sober mentally, often screaming and shouting in amazement as the entities encourage you to stay calm, not to give into astonishment and to simply try to pay attention to what is happening. It’s here that they start to communicate with you using a variety of different methods such as directly manipulating what you can see and view, by telepathically beaming information into your thoughts, by using a visual language comprised of pure linguistic meaning and mathematics or any combination of the above. It’s through these that they teach you their message or show you what they want to show you.

This message is often something personal to you or something that only applies to the logic of the universe in which it was taught in making it impossible to integrate and apply it into your everyday life.
These entities often appear to be all-knowing and although they can take any form, commonly experienced entities are present. These generally include bodiless super intelligent humanoids, aliens, elves, insectoids, giant spheres, beings of light, plants and complex robotic machines.

Just as quickly as the DMT hits you, after several minutes it begins to leave you at the final stage of the trip.

**The Fourth Stage: Coming Down**

The final stage is experienced as the sensation of being pulled further and further away from the scenario in which you were placed as the entities often wave goodbye and encourage you to come back when you next get the chance.

Once this is over you immediately find yourself back in reality with strong level 4 - 5 visual geometry. This is accompanied by an incredible sense of euphoria and awe which washes over every part of your mind and body. The moderate to mild geometry stays for a further 10 – 15 minutes before disappearing completely, leaving a strong body high that stays for up to an hour. This afterglow feels like a warm fuzziness and leaves behind a sense of well being and mental clarity that can last up to weeks after a good trip.

**Health Effects, Potential Addiction and Tolerance:**

Similar to other psychedelic drugs, there are relatively few physical side effects associated with DMT acute exposure. Various studies have shown that in reasonable doses in a careful context, it presents no negative cognitive, psychiatric or toxic physical consequences of any sort. In mice, the median lethal dose (LD50) of DMT when administered intravenously is 110 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg). This means that 6600 milligrams (6.6 grams) of pure DMT would be required for a 60-kilogram (130 lb) person to reach the 110 mg/kg LD50 value of mice. This is roughly 110x the commonly used dosage of 60mg.

DMT is not physically addictive and many users experience a frequency self-regulating quality to the drug.

In terms of tolerance, smoked DMT tolerance builds very rapidly but also decreases rapidly. You should wait at least one hour between trips to allow tolerance to go down.

**Legal issues:**

- DMT is classified as a Schedule I drug under the UN 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, meaning that use of DMT is supposed to be restricted to scientific research and medical use and international trade in DMT is supposed to be closely monitored. Natural materials containing DMT, including ayahuasca, are explicitly not regulated under the 1971 Psychotropic Convention.
- DMT is classified in Canada as a Schedule III drug.
- DMT is classified in New Zealand as a Class A drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975.
- DMT is classified in the United Kingdom as a Class A drug.
- DMT is classified in the United States as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.

If you are motivated to experience this drug, it is completely possible to make through some very simple kitchen based chemistry described in detail [here](http://disregardeverythingisay.tumblr.com/post/15411034779/simple-dmt-extraction-technique). The recipe requires only legal and freely available ingredients (all of which can be found through Google). 
 Keep in mind, however, that this is extremely illegal and I am in no way responsible for your actions.

**Misconceptions:**

Before I finish this article off I am going to address the extremely common misconceptions and borderline mysticism that surround this drug all over the internet. These misconceptions are the widely held belief that DMT is naturally produced in the pineal gland and is routinely released every night when we dream, at the moment of birth and at the moment of our death. There is not yet any conclusive scientific evidence that it is released during dreams, birth and death. Despite this however, many people on the internet claim it to be fact on a regular basis.

These ideas were first hypothesized by Rick Strassman in the book DMT: The Spirit Molecule and have since been popularized by the likes of Terrence Mckenna and Joe Rogan.

This is not something that the scientific consensus supports but as I mentioned earlier, it has been conclusively proven that trace amounts of DMT have been found in the blood, urine and cerebreal spineal fluid of some mammals including humans. A great little list of them can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyltryptamine#Endogenous_DMT). DMT has also been found within the pineal glands of rats, but this does not mean we have any reason to believe that it is released during birth, death and dreams.

Stopping the spread of pseudoscience and misinformation across the psychedelic community is important if we want our position to be taken seriously so this is not something that should be tolerated.

**Conclusion:**

The things experienced on this drug are incredible and completely logic defying, if a single object could be somehow brought back into the real world from such a place nothing would ever be the same again as the sheer impossibility of these things would instantly break reality.

DMT is the drug that people are looking for when they buy and smoke salvia without knowing what to expect. It is in my opinion the pinnacle of the psychedelic experience, yet despite this, very few people outside of the psychedelic community have heard of it and even fewer have actually gone ahead and tried it. It’s said that DMT is not only stranger than you suppose but it is stranger than you *can *suppose. There is literally nothing that could ever truly prepare you for it until you’ve tried it for yourself.

### INTENSITY

9 to 10

### SAFETY FACTORS

5-MeO-DMT is an MAO inhibitor. See
list of items not to take with MAO inhibitors on page 19. Since DMT takes
effect almost immediately, users normally lie down or sit in a reclining
position prior to taking a hit. One will neither be able to stand up, or
have the ability to recognize their surroundings if they get a good hit.
### MATERIAL

N,N-Dimethyltryptamine and
5-Methoxy-Dimethyltryptamine are naturally occurring psychedelics found
in a variety of plants around the world, several of which are native to
the Amazon region. These alkaloids, which are usually found together in
the plants, are also found in the human brain as neurotransmitters, as
well as m our blood, urine, and spinal fluid [1].
DMT is produced in the human pineal gland which is correlated to the "3rd
eye" or Ajna Chakra in the Indian spiritual system. Meditative states attained
by yogis who concentrate on the 3rd eye may be the result of increased
DMT levels. DMT is produced in heavy concentration in the glands of some
tropical toads, such as Bufo Alvarius. Some people actually make a practice
of squeezing out this venom, then drying and smoking it to get high.
N,N-DMT and 5-MeO-DMT are also
manufactured synthetically, as separate compounds, and sold on the underground
market And although it's quite rare in the psychedelic underground, synthetic
DMT is used much more often than DMT from natural sources.
### HISTORY

There are several plant sources of
DMT, many of which have uniquely different histories of use. Normally DMT
is not active if taken orally. It must be either smoked or snorted for
any psychoactive effects. To obtain a full strength DMT experience, one
must take the entire dose into their system in a short period of time.
Two sources of DMT, Anadenanthera
peregrina and Virola theiodora, are made into snuffs, commonly
known as Yopo and Epena, respectively. The natives of the Amazon region
have ingenious methods for getting a good dose of these snuffs. One method
calls for a "snorter" through which they inhale with both nostrils at once.
The most effective is a snorting device for two people. This device has
a tube going from the mouth of each person to the nose of the other Rather
than snorting, once the device is loaded, one person "blows'; the DMT snuff
into the other's nose, getting a large amount deep into the nasal cavity.
The person who received the first hit must quickly blow a dose into the
other person's nose before falling into a tryptamine trance, "trypping."
Elsewhere in the Amazon, DMT-containing
plants like Psychotria veridis are included in brews known as Ayahuasca
or Yage. These brews include Banisteriopsis caapi, which is a source
of Harmala alkaloids, and occasionally plants from the Belladonna family.
The combination of Harmala alkaloids and DMT is amazing. The Harmala alkaloids
intensify the DMT "tryp," and in my opinion produce a deeper, more spiritual
experience. The Harmala alkaloids which are MAO inhibitors, also allow
the DMT to be active when taken orally.
How the natives discovered this combination
boggles the mind. The healers and shamans that work with Ayahuasca claim
that the spirits of the plants talk to them, telling them which plants
to use in their brews, and which plants will heal various diseases. I believe
their claims, since they certainly didn't have modern technical knowledge
to predict the results of such combinations. And it's unlikely they could
have tried all of the combinations of the thousands of plants growing in
the Amazon jungle. I've also noticed increased synergy with plant consciousness
in my own DMT experiments.
### DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION

The dosage for 5-MeO-DMT is 5 to 10
mg. The dosage for N,N-DMT is about 40 mg. Smaller amounts will
produce some perceptual changes but will not bring one to the unique dimensions
normally reached on DMT. The entire dose of DMT needs to be consumed in
a short amount of time. If one doesn't get enough within the first 60 seconds
they won't get much higher by smokmg more.
Synthetic DMT usually comes in a crystalline
form as an off-white to brownish or yellowish powder. Smoking DMT can be
tricky. I load the DMT into a glass pipe with a fine mesh stainless steel
screen. The flame should be kept about 1/2" away from the DMT. Toking very
slowly, I draw in enough heat to melt and then vaporize the DMT. The flame
should never touch the DMT as burning it will destroy some, as well as
producing a nasty taste. I've found that the slower the DMT is vaporized,
the more I seem to get out of it. I've also found it helpful to place a
small amount of ash in the bottom of the pipe bowl. This will work to hold
the melted DMT before it is vaporized to prevent it from running through
the screen and down the stem of the pipe. One can also use a hash oil pipe,
but it's easy to burn your mouth with a concentrated hit of hot vapor.
The smoke has a harsh, plastic-like taste, and tends to make people yak.
I've had to train my lungs not to cough it out. Although it's harsh comma
in, it doesn't expand like cannabis, and the smoke cools quickly.
Glass pipes can be difficult to find.
Many head shops don't sell them since they are often used for crack cocaine.
A pipe made of another material will work, but does not allow one to look
into the bowl to monitor the melting/vaporization of the DMT, and to see
if it's leaking through the screen and running down the stem of the pipe.
I also enjoy watching the intricate patterns of the DMT recrystallizing
inside the stem, and more importantly, once enough has collected on the
inside of the stem, I can heat up a glass pipe for a few good hits.
Sometimes DMT comes soaked into parsley
flakes or cannabis. This is frequently done with 5-MeO-DMT since the amount
required for one high, 5 to 10 mg., can only be weighed on a sophisticated
scale. In this case one must smoke the DMT by burning the parsley or cannabis
This will work, but not quite as well as vaporization.
Plant material containing DMT requires
some method of extraction prior to use. Most of the plants containing DMT
are scarce in this country, and instructions for a pure DMT extraction
are hard to find. Typically, DMT-containing plants are used in a brew,
in combination with Harmala alkaloids. This way one need not be concerned
with getting the entire dose in a short amount of time, and a simple water
extraction should suffice.
### THE HIGH

The highs from N,N-DMT and
5-MeO-DMT are similar yet have some distinct differences. The typical DMT
tryp is an order of magmtude more potent than a trip on the traditional
psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin or mescaline). When smoking DMT the high
comes on within about 30 seconds. Within the next 30 seconds I am propelled
to a high as intense as the peak of a 1000+ mcg. acid trip. Generally by
this point I will be completely out of my body and unaware of my physical
surroundings. This intense part of the experience, although seeming timeless
while I'm in it, lasts only 2 to 5 minutes. I then drift back quickly to
regular consciousness. On 5-MeO I am back within 20 minutes, with N.N.I
am back in 30 minutes. In the Sixties DMT was called "The businessman's
lunch trip."
What one will experience on DMT is
impossible to predict. It can range from heaven to hell, cyberspace to
jeweled palaces, fear or personified evil, visions of jungle animals, contacts
with extraterrestrials, links with ancient spirits, or adventures with
fairies and elves. The DMT user should be prepared for anything. On a full
dose of DMT (or Ketamine) one can not guide the tryp with the mind or thoughts
the way an LSD trip can be guided. One can, however direct the tryp by
what I will call the "intent of the soul" or will.
Many users, including myself, have
felt possessed by various spirits while on DMT, as if becoming a medium
and channeling alien thoughts. This can be quite heavy. It has been generally
positive for myself and the people I've smoked DMT with, but I've heard
stories from others who have expenenced the opposite extreme.
On DMT the perception of time slows
to nearly a complete stop. During this stage one may feel that they are
not breathing, or that their heart has stopped. However, this is due to
one's state of perception. Many users report being aware of millions of
vibrations and sounds going through the universe and their bodies, the
body often bursting with energies they never knew existed. One can let
these feelings flow through them, or if appropriate, direct the movements
to some type of dance, yogic exercise, or drumming. These "physically manifesting"
energies are gentler on N,N-DMT than on 5-MeO-DMT.
DMT frequently produces changes in
the facial expression of the user, which can appear quite bizarre to an
onlooker. It would seem as though the human face has the potential for
a far greater number of expressions than we normally use, possibly even
the ability to carry on sophisticated communication through facial expression.
DMT acts as a catalyst to awaken this realm of movement by exercising the
muscles involved and realigning the underlying energies. It's also possible
for this realignment of energies to take place in other areas of the body,
occasionally instigating a shamanic dance.
In recent years DMT has become quite
notorious in the psychedelic underground, primarily through the writings
of Terence McKenna. And despite the fact that it is rare and highly sought
after, once it becomes available to those who are seeking it, very few
people use it frequently after a short period of initial use. I've assumed
that many people have joy rides for their first several trips, then have
an experience which is extremely frightening or intense, leaving them intimidated
about continuing DMT use. However, I like a friend's recent explanation
for this observation better: "DMT gets progressively 'weirder' as you keep
smoking it."
What I've described about DMT so far
can be applied to both varieties. However, some characteristics of the
two are quite different. I had been using 5-MeO-DMT for a few years before
obtaining any N,N-DMT. After I first tried N,N-DMT I concluded
that 5-MeO-DMT feels like sheer force, whereas N,N-DMT feels like
sheer perfection.
5-MeO-DMT is the more potent of the
two in terms of: the size of the dose required, how quickly it comes on
and how forcefully it blows apart my universe. On 5-MeO I can literally
feel my mind exploding and expanding outward to encompass first the area
near me, then the planet, and eventually the cosmos. This takes place over
a span of 15 seconds or so.
5-MeO does not produce as spectacular
visuals as N,N-DMT. Most frequently for me the 5-MeO visuals are
intensely complex, multidimensional, and quickly-moving geometric designs.
These, however, are primarily in black and white, checkerboard style. At
times there is some color, and on occasion the visuals are abundantly colorful,
especially with large doses. I've found taking a hit of 5-MeO just before
having an orgasm to be most enjoyable, and this often makes the visuals
abundantly colorful. However, getting the timing right on this can take
some practice.
5-MeO increases pulse rate and blood
pressure, more so than N,N-DMT, but not to the extent as a whiff
of amyl nitrite. 5-MeO can also produce breathing irregularities which
may take some getting used to. If one does not get a good dose of 5-MeO
all they will feel are some bodily symptoms, and a slight alteration of
consciousness especially in the visual field. A small dose of N,N-DMT
will stili produce a psychedelic trip, but without the intensity and depth
of a full-dose experience.
N,N-DMT comes on a bit slower,
less forcefully, enchanting the smoker with its magical nature. I've often
found myself transported to a fairy tale world where little gnomes pop
out of nowhere, laugh, and smile at me. On N,N-DMT I've never had
to worry that the universe is too small to contain me and that I might
crash into its boundaries when my mind has expanded all the way. Where
5-MeO-DMT can awe or frighten with its incredible power N,N-DMT
tends to delight with its brilliant, magical, and hypnotic nature. This
is not to say that N,N-DMT experiences can not be frightening. In
a way they can be the most frightening of all psychedelic experiences,
since they leave a portion of the ego intact while allowing access to realms
of discarnate entities and awesomely powerful psychic energies. Almost
everyone I've known who has used N,N-DMT repeatedly, eventually
encounters deeper fear than they've ever felt before.
The visuals produced by N,N-DMT
are spectacular. I see more swirling, kaleidoscopic universes per square
millimeter of visual space than on anything else. The detail and intricacy
of the patterns and the brilliance of the colors is also unsurpassable.
The visuals are usually a mixture of kaleidoscopic-geometric forms, archetypal
symbols, and outlandish and unimaginable images of people, places and things.
The images also "move" and are arranged in a manner which is different
than the traditional psychedelics and in keeping with N,N-DMT's
enchanting nature.
If one smokes a smaller amount of N,N-DMT,
say around 20 mg., they will tend to experience only the visual aspect
of the high, without getting in touch with gnomes and discarnate entities.
Following is a friend's description of DMT visuals produced by smoking
20 mg. doses every 20 to 30 minutes. "The vibration is still very strong
at this level and objects in the room become cartoonish and jeweled with
rotating 'pools' of interlocked spiraling gems on wall surfaces and ceiling.
At the peak of the 20 mg. tokes, brilliantly changing latticework becomes
apparent within. A gooey liquid of phosphorescent brilliance knits itself
into neon lattices of emerald green and iridescent blue against a molten
gold background. Always changing, always new, always novel, these geometric
storms of shape and color never cease to amaze me with their beauty and
intricacy; something one can FEEL as well as see. Clouds of molten gold
liquid, boiling, seethe into arabesques and chainwork networks. Each node
of each net and lattice form a jeweled point of incredible pure color,
all rotating and pulsating through the eyes, brain, and stomach, as one
becomes a transparent electric ghost deciphering mysto-glyphs for eternity!
"
This next experience comes from a friend
who smoked a full-strength dose. "The stuff hit me instantaneously.
MILLIONS of brilliantly colored little 'skull clowns' swarmed me in a most
visionary way while emitting crickling, tinging sounds which looked like
violet sparks coming out of their mouths. These tiny skull clowns were
laughing most musically as I died in the light. Melt down - feels like
drowning and being electrocuted at the same time. Some fear is good though,
and pretty soon the skull clown swarm had laughed me through death to a
place of jeweled coiling roots and capillaries, swaying endlessly in a
gem lit sea... The glowing, ember-like afterimage instantly swirls and
shatters into blue and red sizzling domes that pinwheel ecstatically into
a Creative, God-Thing with a trillion jeweled eyes that dissolves into
an atomic ocean. This is the multi-eyed God that is my Creator, Master,
Destroyer. I am nothing compared to this Thing which has no ego boundaries
whatsoever and can turn into anything it damn well wishes, even death itself
if it wants to!"
DMT visuals are best in diffused sunlight,
in contrast to something like mushrooms whose visuals are best in a pitch
black forest. With DMT I've had excellent results adjusting my venetian
blinds so that grids of sunlight are bouncing around the room. Since all
psychedelics greatly enhance visual perception, I enjoy trying them with
as many different visual stimuli as possible: a pitch black room, a desert
sunset, full moonlight, blacklights, strobes, Pink Floyd concerts, raves,
multi-media images, and lasers.
N,N-DMT also has a unique "selective
anesthetic" property to it. Both body and mind feel simultaneously stimulated
and anesthetized, as though every other nerve were switched full on or
full off.
I've also been noticing an attribute
of DMT and psilocybin mushrooms (which are essentially long-lasting tryptamines)
which set these substances apart from other psychedelics such as LSD or
Ketamine. With LSD, Ketamine, or any other synthetic psychedelic, I typically
feel that I am interacting with my mind, and a universal process of consciousness
change where the self-identity is dissolved and then reformulated. These
same processes occur with DMT and mushrooms. However, with these substances
I often get the sense that I am also interacting with an intelligent entity
who is vastly superior to me in knowledge and breadth of consciousness.
This entity seems to be quite aware of what's transpiring in my mind, and
is able to instruct and to tailor the experience so that it's personally
suited to me.
With DMT one tends not to go through the personality breakdown
and rebuilding process that takes place with the traditional psychedelics.
Or if one does go through it, the process is so quick they tend not to
notice it happening. Under the force of DMT one must relax, release, and
let it come over them. Trying to resist DMT's overwhelming influence and
the inevitable dissolution of the identity will be unpleasant, and it won't
work. A DMT tryp tends to be out of body, out of personality, and sometimes
outside of the mind. For these reasons some people I know who've used DMT
do not consider it a good tool for psychological development. The DMT experience
can be like a quick trip to the void or the funhouse. Since it is so different
than normal reality it can be difficult for the user to bring any of the
tryp back to daily life. However, this changes significantly when DMT is
done in combination with the Harmala alkaloids.
### THE DMT HIGH WITH HARMALA ALKALOIDS

Harmala alkaloids potentiate DMT,
not only in intensity and duration, but also in content and quality. The
Harmala alkaloids also make DMT orally active, this being the method by
which DMT is traditionally consumed in the Ayahuasca brews of the Amazon
region. I have only recently begun experimenting with ingested DMT, and
these experiences are described later in the chapter DMT
~ Water Spirit. The Harmala alkaloids also intensify smoked DMT,
and I have described this method of administration below.
Prior to smoking or ingesting the DMT
one should wait until they are feeling the effects of the Harmala alkaloids.
This will prevent the DMT from being metabolized prematurely. (See chapter
on Harmala alkaloids.) Harmala only slightly
intensifies 5-MeO-DMT. Therefore, one still needs to smoke 5 mg. or so
to get a powerful high. It does, however, prolong the normally 2-3 minute
peak to 10-20 minutes, with the total experience lasting between 40 minutes
and two hours.
N,N-DMT is significantly intensified
by Harmala. Smoking 15-20 mg. of N,N-DMT while on Harmala will produce
an experience as intense as smoking 40 mg. of N,N-DMT by itself.
This is especially useful because it's difficult to smoke 40 mg. of harsh
tasting DMT. Harmala will also extend the N,N-DMT experience to
about 30 to 40 minutes total.
The high of both types of DMT while
on Harmala is a much slower process. I don't feel "blown out of my mind"
quite so quickly. The focus of the experience becomes personally involved,
rather than the feeling that I'm a voyager in some alien realm. I tend
to experience an increased awareness of my mind, body, and subtle energy.
I often feel that my body and Being are "embraced" by an ancient earth
spirit. And this earth spirit is instructing me to become aware of, and
open up, many lines of communication that exist between my mind, body and
the extemal world. In combination with Harmala the DMT high does not "disappear,"
leaving me suddenly back in normal reality. I have more time to absorb
the experience and make it a part of me.
The combination of 5-MeO-DMT and Harmala
produces the most powerful experience I have ever felt. This tends to be
both physically and mentally overwhelming. I've had some good journeys
with this combination but I've also become violently nauseous and experienced
extreme discomfort, and I've witnessed other people go through sheer misery.
One friend who ingested 5-MeO + Harmala felt he had entered into an ill-intentioned
pact with a spirit, and while trying to fight his way out of the pact,
went into convulsions and bit the inside of his mouth. Since there is such
a high percentage of intensely unpleasant experiences with this combination
I've recently reverted to taking 5-MeO-DMT alone, and most acquaintances
of mine who've used this combination have done likewise.
Some users feel that the DMT high is
"warbly" in combination with Harmala and lacks the "Diamond Consciousness"
of DMT alone. Since Harmala slows the onset of 5-MeO-DMT so drastically,
I've found that I lose much of the brilliance that can be experienced using
5-MeO-DMT alone. However, I don't find that Harmala produces any degradation
of the N.N. DMT experience. N,N-DMT is like a rocket to another
dimension, with or without the Harmala alkaloids.

## Subjective Experience

Despite invoking what is possibly the most intense of psychedelic experiences, DMT
is found naturally within the human cerebrospinal system and elsewhere. Indeed, it
is frequently suggested that it is excreted by the pineal gland (in the centre of the
brain). Outside the human organism it is also present in mammals and many species
of plants, seemingly permeating nature itself.

Whilst I had previously engaged DMT as an ingredient of ayahuasca, smoking the
raw molecule produces a radically different and less gentle type of experience.
Unfortunately, smoking an effective breakthrough dose to achieve this is frequently
reported as being a difficult operation to execute.

The trick is to vaporize the crystals, rather than to burn them, which is apparently
easier said than done. Nonetheless, I set about the task with diligence and patience.

\`\`\`
BREAKTHROUGH ATTEMPT #1
For this attempt I obtained a glass pipe, courtesy of Amazon, for a grand total
of £5.95 (see image above). I began the experiment at 10am.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
I placed 20mg of DMT into the pipe, and carefully heated the bottom of the
bowl with a lighter. As smoke began to appear, I inhaled, slowly. Nothing
happened; so I repeated several times until the crystals had all disappeared.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
There were no hallucinations and no trip. There was an extremely mild
psychedelic type headspace, which lasted an hour or so. That was it.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
My conclusion was that I must have burned the DMT, or even swallowed some
of the crystals before they melted. This was an abject failure.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
BREAKTHROUGH ATTEMPT #2
Further research led me to buy a VaporGenie. This was a much more
expensive device, but contributors across multiple forums claimed great
success in using it to breakthrough. Regardless, it still sounded like a fiddly
exercise to undertake.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The experiment began at 7:30pm. I placed 22mg into the chamber of the
VaporGenie on top of a damiana ash bed, and sprinkled some further ashes on
top. On heating I inhaled, trying not to suck the flame deep enough into the
device to touch the DMT. I held the smoke nervously for 10 seconds and then
exhaled. I saw smoke dissipate into the air as I did so.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I knew that I was under some sort of influence almost immediately. I lay
down, placed my head on to a cushion and closed my eyes, largely because I
was chicken and didn’t want to see the world actually disintegrate before me.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The problem was that it didn’t. I missed the breakthrough again, and I missed
the famed chrysanthemum too (the alleged prelude to entering the main
hallucinogenic event).
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
However, what I did see were some glorious CEVs. There were concave
adornments on the walls of wherever I was. They were morphing a little, but
were largely stable and were of rich beautiful colours.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
As I opened my eyes to check the real world status this vision immediately
disappeared. There were no OEVs of any significance, so I closed my eyes
again. Unfortunately, I couldn't reach the same clarity or intensity as
moments ago. However, what I had seen was somewhere; not just patterns,
but actual walls with indented window type alcoves (but without
transparency). It was like some grand medieval castle-like interior, but bright,
perfect and extremely colourful.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I was feeling fine, and not so scared, so I lit up again, inhaled, and held for
another ten seconds. This time I didn’t notice any smoke or vapour.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I embraced the notion that closing my eyes was a little like tuning into a
frequency. I simply chose to go there. It was a strange feeling.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
I searched for the other-worldly interior again. There were CEVs but not
enough to frame the place. I suspect that the DMT may well have been largely
used or burned on the first hit.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I chased it three more times over the next 10 minutes, but all I could find was
the headspace and the colours.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I opened the pipe: only ashes remained.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I actually got somewhere with this attempt, but not far enough. However, I
was encouraged sufficiently to promise myself that I would try this again soon,
using the same technique, but being more careful with the flame, and perhaps
holding the smoke for longer.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I would say the duration of the main play was around 6 minutes, as generally
advertised.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
As an experience it was perfectly fine, with interesting visuals, a nice
headspace, a certain contentment, a short duration, no body load, and some
afterglow. Without having some knowledge of where DMT can lead when fully
charged, I suspect that I would have been extremely happy with this, but I was
disappointed not to have broken through. I was determined to be bolder next
time.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Note that my subsequent sleep pattern was a little disrupted with several
wake-ups and some weird vivid dreams. Retro checking on the Internet, I
learned that this is quite a common phenomenon. This continued into a
second night, with sleep cycles broken by dreams which were sometimes not
very positive.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
BREAKTHROUGH ATTEMPT #3
This time I measured 35mg and mixed it with the remaining ashes from
Attempt #2. I prepared in the same manner and initiated the experiment.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I misfired again, but I instantly understood why. I felt powder enter my mouth
as I inhaled. This was DMT and ash; unvaporised. I had inhaled too strongly,
and it was apparent that the chemical was not entrenched sufficiently below
the ash, which itself was not heavy enough.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The experience itself was much like a re-run of the second attempt, but the
visuals were more intense. Was that the initial framing of the famed orange
chrysanthemum I saw during the first few seconds? Perhaps, but it dissipated
very quickly, just as it started to form.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I felt a strange analgesic numbness of the body as I lay on the ground, and
again failed to recapture the same visual intensity once I had opened my eyes.
There were OEVs, but the real action was on the back of my eyelids.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
Subsequently, Sleep was again disturbed, with strange vivid dreaming.
\`\`\`
Retrospectively, I feel that I should try to compare this with salvia divinorum, which
was the source of my first alien-reality type of encounter.

My experience of smoking salvia was of being pulled into a bright and lucidly
coloured out-of-body domain, which comprised sharp threatening echoed shapes,
framed on my original field of vision. I felt that my mind was being dragged outwards
into this abyss, as I struggled in absolute terror. This is considered by many to be a
form of delirium. However, given that oral consumption produces a different
response, I wouldn’t classify it as such.

DMT produced similarly wonderful colours, but it presented an actual locale, the
timeline was ordered, and there was no fear. Also, at the doses I sampled, I had the
capacity to proactively tune in to this construct, rather than being suddenly
wrenched into an inferno.

This intelligible character of ordered enfoldment is, in fact, the major difference
between DMT and the other psychedelic chemicals I have so far tested. With DMT I
wasn’t experiencing a variation of where I was at the moment I inhaled, but rather, I
found myself in entirely different surroundings, which had appeared from nowhere. I
had my faculties intact and my mind was rational, but I was transplanted into an
unknown setting, which appeared to comprise some sort of other-reality. This wasn’t
random patterns or shapes or bright lights, it was an actual place. This, of course,
renders it astonishing.

At some point in the future I will be drawn to a 4th attempt.

## SYNTHESIS
The demethylation of the iodide salt: Under an inert atmosphere, a solution of 0.40 g N,N,N-trimethyltryptammonium iodide in 5 mL THF was treated with 1.5 mL of 1 M LiEt3BH in THF and held at reflux temperature for 9 h. After cooling, the mixture was acidified with dilute HCl and the THF removed under vacuum. The residue was suspended in dilute NaOH and extracted with Et2O. The extracts were pooled, and the solvent removed under vacuum to provide a residue of 0.12 g N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) as a crystalline solid, with a mp of 57â59 Â°C. IR (in cm-1): 732, 740, 811, 859, 1011, 1037, 1110, 1171. The MS is discussed below.

The demethylation of the chloride salt: A hot aqueous solution of N,N,N-trimethyltryptammonium iodide was treated with an excess of freshly precipitated AgCl, and all was boiled gently for 15 min. The mixed silver halides were removed by filtration, and the filtrate stripped of H2O as rapidly as possible. To the residue there was added a small amount of MeOH follow by acetone until the crystallization of N,N,N-trimethyltryptammonium chloride was complete. It had a mp of 193 Â°C (80%), and it is considerably more water soluble than the starting iodide. This salt was pyrolysed under hard vacuum and the residue distilled. This distillate was dissolved in a small amount of methanol and acidified with dilute nitric acid. A small amount of insoluble material was removed by filtration, the aqueous phase washed with CHCl3, made basic with aqueous NaOH, and extracted with CHCl3. The solvent was removed under vacuum, and the residue treated with a hot solution of picric acid. This was decanted from a little insoluble material, and slowly cooled to provide the picrate of DMT as yellow needles with a mp of 167 Â°C. An aqueous suspension of this picrate was made basic with an excess of aqueous NaOH, extracted with Et2O, and the solvent removed under vacuum to provide a pale yellow residue that crystallized. This was pressed on a porous plate and washed with petroleum ether to give N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) as an off-white solid with a mp of 47 Â°C.

The demethylation of the thiophenolate salt: A suspension of 2.5 g N,N,N-trimethyltryptammonium iodide in 25 mL MeOH was brought into solution by heating, and treated with 1.0 g Ag2O. The mixture was heated for 10 min on the steam bath, the solids removed by filtration and washed with an additional 20 mL MeOH. The methanol solutions were treated with 1.0 g thiophenol and the solvent was removed under vacuum. The resulting viscous oil (2.12 g) was heated with a flame to the reflux point and there was extensive bubbling. After 5 min, the light colored reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, dissolved in 50 mL CH2Cl2, and extracted with two 25 mL portions of dilute HCl. These were pooled (pale yellow color), made basic with 5% aqueous NaOH and extracted with 3Ã25 mL CH2Cl2. After removal of the solvent from the pooled extracts, the residue (an amber oil, 1.04 g) was distilled at the KugelRohr. A white oil distilled over at 130â140 Â°C at 0.1 mm/Hg, and crystallized spontaneously. This distillate weighed 0.77 g, and was recrystallized from boiling hexane after decanting the solution from a small amount of insolubles. There was thus obtained 0.40 g of dimethyltryptamine (DMT) with a mp 67â68 Â°C. The distillate contained about 3% of 2-Methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-Î²-carboline (parent peak mass 186, major peak mass 186) as an impurity which was lost upon recrystallization.

(from tryptamine and ethyl formate) A suspension of 1.0 g tryptamine in 50 mL ethyl formate was held at reflux for 15 h during which time the mixture became homogeneous. The volatiles were removed under vacuum, yielding an oily residue of the formamide. This may be purified by distillation but this unpurified product can serve satisfactorily in the following reaction. This residue was dissolved in 50 mL anhydrous THF and added, dropwise, to a solution of 1.0 M LAH in THF (40 mL, 40 mmole) which had been diluted with another 50 mL THF. After the addition was complete the reaction mixture was heated under reflux for 15 hours. Reflux was continued as a solution of 40 mL 1.0 M freshly distilled ethyl formate in THF was added dropwise over the course of 2 h. Heating was discontinued and the reaction mixture was quenched by the addition of excess solid sodium sulfate decahydrate at room temperature. The reaction mixture was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under vacuum to yield 1.15 g pure N,N-dimethyltryptamine as an oil which solidified upon storage in the freezer. The material can be recrystallized from hexane to give white crystals with a mp 67 Â°C.

(from indole) To a well stirred solution of 10 g indole in 150 mL anhydrous Et2O there was added, dropwise over the course of 30 min, a solution of 11 g oxalyl chloride in 150 mL anhydrous Et2O. Stirring was continued for an additional 15 min during which time there was the separation of indol-3-ylglyoxyl chloride as a yellow crystalline solid. This intermediate was removed by filtration and washed with Et2O. It deteriorates at a significant rate at room temperature, and should be used as soon as possible after preparation. The diethylether in this synthesis can be replaced advantageously with tert-butylmethylether (TBME) which works well as a solvent in this reaction, but which avoids the potential danger associated with peroxide formation. The above indol-3-ylglyoxyl chloride was added to 20 g anhydrous dimethylamine in 150 mL cold, stirred anhydrous Et2O. When the color had largely been discharged, there was added an excess of 2 N HCl, the mixture was cooled, and the resulting solids were removed by filtration. These were recrystallized from EtOAc to give, after air drying, 14.6 g (79%) indol-3-yl N,N-dimethylglyoxylamide with a mp of 159â161 Â°C.

A solution of 14 g indol-3-yl-N,N-dimethylglyoxylamide in 350 mL anhydrous THF was added, slowly, to 19 g LAH in 350 mL THF which was well stirred and held at reflux temperature under an inert atmosphere. After the addition was complete, reflux was maintained for an additional 16 h, the reaction mixture cooled, and the excess hydride destroyed by the cautious addition of wet dioxane. The formed solids were removed by filtration, washed with hot THF, the filtrate and washings combined, dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and the solvent removed under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in hot petroleum ether. On cooling, crystals of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) were formed, filtered free of solvent, and air dried, weighing 11.1 g (91%). There have been reports of byproducts from this LAH procedure when performed in Et2O that can compromise the purity of the final product. To obtain the HCl salt of DMT, the residue was dissolved in anhydrous Et2O and saturated with anhydrous hydrogen chloride. The resulting crystals were recrystallized from benzene/methanol to give N,N-dimethyltryptamine hydrochloride with a mp of 165â167 Â°C. The yield from 14 g of the amide was 13.3 g of the salt.

There are several comments to be made as to salts, melting points, and spectra.

As to salts, this last recipe above, taken from the literature, is the only claim of a valid hydrochloride salt of DMT. In the original synthesis, by Manske, the following description appears. âThe hydrochloride could be obtained only as a pale yellow resin which, when dried in a vacuum desiccator over potassium hydroxide, became porous and brittle.â I have found no attempts at its synthesis in the literature, and I have personally had no success at all. The picrate salt is well defined, used mostly for isolation and purification. The oxalate is used occasionally in animal studies. Early human studies involving the injection of solutions of the hydrochloride apparently made by dissolving DMT base in dilute aqueous HCl, and neutralizing this with base to achieve an end pH of appropriate 6. The fumarate is the salt specifically approved by the FDA for human studies, and this was the form used for human intravenous injection employed in the recent New Mexico studies.

As to melting points, some in the literature are of plant isolates and other are of synthetic samples. A brief and incomplete survey has revealed the following numbers, all in Â°C: 44, 44.6â46.8, 46, 47, 48â49, 49â50, 56â57, 57â59, 58â60, 64â67, 67 and 67â68. The 58â60 and 64â67 values are from the Aldrich Chemical Company, for samples bearing the purity claims of âpurissâ and 99+% âGold Labelâ resp. The Merck Index gives the very early, very low values of 46 Â°C and 44.6â46.8 Â°C and claims claimes that the bp is 60â80 Â°C with atmospheric pressure being implied. It is clearly in error on both matters. No evidence has been published suggesting polymorphism. The published mp values for the trimethyl quaternary iodide span the range from 188 Â°C to 233 Â°C, including in-between values of 197 Â°C and 216â217 Â°C. This physical property is of limited value.

As to spectra, the EI-MS of DMT presents no surprises. MS (in m/z): C3H8N+ 58 (100%), indolemethylene+ 130 (10%); parent ion 188 (4%). A remarkably consistent feature has been mentioned earlier. With tertiary amines such as DMT, the 130+ mass ion is usually the second or third most intense in the spectrum. A companion 131+ mass ion is very small. However, when isomers are observed that may have the same atomic composition, but which are secondary amines, there is a prominent 131+ peak, always exceeding the 130+ peak in size. As an example, NET, with the same molecular weight, had the same major amine ion fragment at the mass of 58, but at about a half this height is a 130/131 ion pair with the 131+ being the major one. DMT had a CI-MS (with NH3) with the expected M+1 at mass 189 and a fragment at mass 166.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 250 mg, orally) âIt was inactive.â

(with 350 mg, orally) âCompletely without effect either physiological or psychological.â

(with 100 mg, via the buccal mucosa) âNumbness at the site, but no central effects.â

(with 20 mg, intramuscularly) âI began to see patterns on the wall that were continuously moving. They were transparent, and were not colored. After a short period these patterns became the heads of animals, a fox, a snake, a dragon. Then kaleidoscopic images appeared to me in my inner eye, fantastically beautiful and colored.â

(with 30 mg, intramuscularly) âThere was eye dilation and, subjectively, some perception disturbances.â

(with 50 mg, intramuscularly) âI feel strange, everything is blurry. I want my mother, I am afraid of fainting, I canât breathe.â

(with 60 mg, intramuscularly) âI donât like this feelingâI am not myself. I saw such strange dreams a while ago. Strange creatures, dwarfs or something; they were black and moved about. Now I feel as if I am not alive. My left hand is numb. As if my heart would not beat, as if I had no body, no nothing. All I feel are my left hand and stomach. I donât like to be without thoughts.â

(with 75 mg, intramuscularly) "The third or fourth minute after the injection vegetative symptoms appeared, such as tingling sensation, trembling, slight nausea, mydriasis, elevation of the blood pressure and increase of the pulse rate. At the same time, eidetic phenomena, optical illusions, pseudohallucinations, and later real hallucinations, appeared. The hallucinations consisted of moving, brilliantly colored oriental motifs, and later I saw wonderful scenes altering very rapidly. The faces of people seemed to be masks. My emotional state was elevated sometimes up to euphoria. At the highest point I had compulsive athetoid movements in my left hand. My consciousness was completely filled by hallucinations, and my attention was firmly bound to them; therefore I could not give an account of the events happening to me. After 3/4 to 1 hour the symptoms disappeared, and I was able to describe what had happened.

(with 80 mg, intramuscularly) âMy perceptual distortions were visual in nature and with my eyes closed I could see colored patterns, primarily geometrical patterns moving very fast, having sometimes very deep emotional content and connotation. My blood pressure went up and my pupils were dilated.â

(with 30 mg, smoked) âI spread it evenly on a joint of Tanacetum vulgare and melted it with a heat lamp. In about 30 seconds a strong light-headedness starts, with a feeling of temporal pressure. Some yellowing of the visual field. There was nothing for me to do because I had to turn complete control over to the drug. Off the plateau in 3â4 minutes and the fact that the radio was on became apparent. I was out in a few more minutes.â

(with 60 mg, smoked) âWe did it together. Swift entryâhead overwhelmedâelaborate and exotic. Slightly threatening patternsâno insightâslight sense of cruelty and sharpness between us, but enjoying. His face, as before with MDA, demonic but pleasantly so. He said he saw my face as a mask. He asked me to let him see my teeth. I laughedâaware that laughter slightly not-funny. Heavy, massive intoxication. Time extension extraordinary. What seemed like 2 hrs was about 30 minutes.â

(with 60 mg, smoked) âRapid onset, and in a completely stoned isolation in about a minute for about three minutes. Slow return but continued afterglow (pleasant) for thirty minutes. Repeated three times, with no apparent tolerance or change in chronology. Easily handled. The intoxication is of limited usefulness but the residues are completely relaxing,â

(with 100 mg, smoked) âAs I exhaled I became terribly afraid, my heart very rapid and strong, palms sweating. A terrible sense of dread and doom filled meâI knew what was happening, I knew I couldnât stop it, but it was so devastating; I was being destroyedâall that was familiar, all reference points, all identityâall viciously shattered in a few seconds. I couldnât even mourn the lossâthere was no one left to do the mourning. Up, up, out, out, eyes closed, I am at the speed of light, expanding, expanding, expanding, faster and faster until I have become so large that I no longer existâmy speed is so great that everything has come to a stopâhere I gaze upon the entire universe.â

(with 15 mg, intravenously) âAn almost instantaneous rush began in the head and I was quickly scattered. Rapidly moving and intensely colored visuals were there, and I got into some complex scenes. There were few sounds, and those that were there were not of anyone talking. I was able to continue to think clearly.â

(with 30 mg, intravenously) âI was hit harder that I had ever been when smoking the stuff. The onset was similar, but the euphoria was less.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
No matter which system might eventually prove to be the best, the use of a chemical assignment of drug structure to the active components allows some form of clinical challenge to the native use in the field. DMT and 5-MeO-DMT are the mainstay chemicals in most snuffs, and can be introduced into the product from any of several plants.

A major plant source for one of the best studied of the snuffs, cohoba, are the ground beans of the Piptadenia peregrina. There are two alternative generic names, Anadenanthera and Mimosa, which may represent the same, or similar, plants, but this is the stuff for battles between botanical taxonomists. There are several species in this classification, and the alkaloid content amongst them is most variable. With P. peregrina and P. macrocarpa, the major contents of the beans and their pods appears to be bufotenine, its N-oxide and the oxide of DMT. It may be only the pods of the seeds that contain the DMT. And the bark seems to be the major source of N-methyltryptamine, of 5-MeO-NMT (its 5-methoxy analogue) and of 5-MeO-DMT itself. The species P. colubrina has been reported to have bufotenine in its seeds as the only active component. This plant, in Argentina, occurs in only two major species P. macrocarpa and P. excelsa, and the composition seems to parallel that of the Amazonian counterparts. Other forms, (P. rigida, P. paraguayensis, and P. varidiflora), are without any alkaloid content.

The native intoxicant search becomes even cloudier as one goes from snuff to decoction. There are several drinks, sometimes described as ânarcoticâ and sometimes as hallucinogenic or dream-inducing, that come from closely related plants. The roots of the acacia-like tree, Mimosa hostilis, are reputed to be the source of the drink jumera, or vihno de jurema. But the only alkaloid present, originally called nigerine, has proved to be DMT, and this is not orally active. There are pasture grasses, such as reed canarygrass, that can produce a central nervous system disruption in grazing sheep. Chemical analyses of these plants (such as Phalaris tuberosa, P. arundinacea, and P. aquatica) have revealed the presence of alkaloids like DMT and 5-MeO-DMT, but these compounds require intravenous administration to duplicate the toxicity symptoms. The observation of 5-MeO-NMT being present does not help explain the toxicity. How can something that is not orally active be orally active? A possible explanation is the presence of another indole with a one-carbon shorter chain. This is gramine, or 3-(N,N-dimethylaminomethyl)indole which is synthesized in the plant with an entirely different set of enzymes. Its human pharmacology is not known. A related homologue, one carbon longer, is the three-carbon chain compound 3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]indole, produced by the Upjohn Company. It has been studied clinically under the code name U-6056, at levels of up to 70 milligrams in 10 subjects, by i.m. injection. There were no reports of visual, auditory or tactile disturbances. Physically, there was a slight increase in blood pressure and anad pulse rate. Certainly there were no psychological effects. It, however, is a synthetic laboratory product and does not have any botanical source.

The drink ayahuasca is also a DMT-containing decoction, but the presence of some harmaline-containing plant is required to make it active by mouth. This area is discussed under harmaline, although there is some information to be found in the 5-MeO-DMT commentary section. And, there are several species of Acacia found in both Africa and Australia that contain DMT, but there is no native medical use that suggests psychotropic action. These concepts are the part and parcel of two chapters in the first part of this book, âDMT is Everywhereâ and âHoasca vs. Ayahuasca.â There is no reason to repeat it all here. Most of this is part and parcel of the chapter, âDMT is Everywhere.â Letâs not repeat it here.

In the early clinical studies of DMT and DET, frequent use was made of schizophrenic patients, in the belief that if these drugs imitate the mental disorder in normal subjects, the use of schizophrenic population might be especially informative, either through some enhanced response or a loss of effect. One clinical study with a group of female patients (with 1.0 or 1.5 mg/kg DMT being administered, presumably by intramuscular injection) showed a delayed onset (doubling of time), a relative freedom from autonomic effects, and an absence of hallucinations. I truly admire the logic patterns that allow the construction of a research study that will have it either way. Positive effects, our hypothesis is supported. Negative effects, our out hypothesis is supported. Do schitzies schitzys get better or do they get worse? See? We were right.

A study conducted on 40 normals, this in Hungary some 30 years ago, found that the administration of 40 mg quantities to be symptom free. With several of the experimental subjects in this study, the DMT was preceded by the administration of 1-methyl-d-lysergic acid butanolamide (UML-491), a potent serotonin antagonist. This was given either orally (1â2 mg 30 to 40 minutes before) or intramuscularly (0.5 mg 10 minutes before). This served to greatly intensify the effects of the DMT, with intense and agitated hallucinations, highly intensified colors, and a more extreme loss of time and space perception. It was assumed that UML-491 was inactive, but recent trials indicate that there can be central effects produced. It is discussed in the entry for LSD.

DMT is the only psychedelic tryptamine that has recently been taken through the Kafkaesque processes for approval for human studies (via the FDA, the DEA, and the other Health agencies of the Government) and is one of the few Schedule I drug that is being looked at clinically in this country today. It has been studied in Albuquerque, New Mexico New Mexico, in Albuquerque. The first published results of this study show a smooth grading of subjective effects as a function of injected dose. The lowest dose (i.v.) was 0.05 mg/kg, about 4 milligrams, and it could not be distinguished from placebo. At 8 milligrams, there were the physical effects without the mental. At 15 milligrams (the threshold psychedelic dose) nearly all subjects had visual hallucinations, but the auditory changes were rare. At 30 milligrams, the effects were overwhelming both in speed and in intensity. The rush, the freight-train as several subjects call it, was well underway well before the 45 second infusion was complete. A study of repeated administrations of dosages of 16 mg i.v., at half-hour intervals, were made to explore the possible development of short-term tolerance and none was observed tolerance, showed that there was none observed.

In the definition of DMT either as an endogenous psychotogen or, equally appealing, as a natural neurotransmitter, it would be desirable to show that the body does not build up tolerance to it (otherwise the psychotic would spontaneously repair, and the brain would spontaneously shut down). To address this, four subjects were given some 50 mg of DMT intramuscularly, twice daily, for 5 days. The blood levels that were achieved, and the picture of autonomic effects (both in mydriasis and in cardiovascular function) were not changed. No tolerance was seen. The psychological conclusions were a little bit less convincing. Several said that the âhighâ was diminished, but others seemed to feel a maintenance of subjective responses. The jury is still out on this one.

Thanks to the existence of ever-increasingly sensitive scientific instruments, the search of body fluids for possible psychedelics has brought forth a number that appear to be natural components of the human animal. DMT has been reported to be in the urine of schizophrenic patients, and so have 5-MeO-DMT, bufotenine, and its demethylated homologue N-methylserotonin. The levels are increased with the administration of monoamineoxidase inhibitors. A methylating enzyme has been found in blood, capable of forming DMT in plasma, and it is present in both normal subjects and schizophrenics. It is not surprising that studies comparing DMT blood levels between patients (psychotic depression, acute and chronic schizophrenia) and normal subjects have shown no differences. The ubiquitous nature of DMT touches upon a couple of delicate points. It was first a man-made compound, synthesized in Canada in the early thirties. Then some twenty years later it was discovered in the plant world as a natural product. This puts a delicate weapon in the hands of the ânatural is better than syntheticâ argument often voiced. Then, as mentioned here, it has proven to be a natural, normal component of human metabolism, making the wording of Federal Drug law interesting, as the section in the Schedule I hallucinogens implies (in a phrase that lacks a verb and hence a specific meaning) that the possession of any quantity of any form of any listed substance (such as DMT) is illegal. Our brains are illegal?

The principal reason that DMT must be administered administer parenterally is its rapid and efficient metabolism. It can be oxidized to the N-oxide. It can be cyclized to Î²-carbolines, both with and without an N-methyl group. It can be N-dealkylated to form NMT and simple tryptamine itself. Best known is its oxidative destruction, by the monoamine oxidase system, to the inactive indoleacetic acid. There is a wild biochemical conversion process known for tryptophan that involves an enzymatic conversion to kynurenine by the removal of the indole-2-carbon. A similar product, N,N-dimethylkynuramine or DMK, has been seen with DMT, when it was added to whole human blood in vitro.

Several simple substitution derivatives of DMT are known. Those that are known to be psychedelic have their own recipes, of course, but the others will be summarized here. The 1-methyl homologue of DMT (1,N,N-trimethyltryptamine) can be prepared from DMT in KOH and DMSO, with CH3I. It forms a picrate salt which melts at 175â179 Â°C, and bioxalate, mp 174â176 Â°C. It is more toxic than DMT in rats, but has an identical serotonin binding capacity. The compound with a methoxy group substituent at the 1-position is called Lespedamine, 1-MeO-DMT. With an NO bond, this should be classified as a substituted hydroxylamine. I would love to know if anyone anywhere has ever tried smoking it. I suspect it might very well be active, but it is, to my knowledge, untried. I wonder why it deserves a trivial name, vis., Lespedamine? Two additional ring-substituted derivatives of DMT come from the marine world. 5-Bromo-DMT and 5,6-dibromo-DMT are found in the sponges Smenospongia auria and S. echina resp. I have no idea if they are active by smoking (the 5-Br-DMT just might be) but they are quantitatively reduced to DMT by stirring under hydrogen in methanol, in the presence of palladium on charcoal. A very closely related sponge, Polyfibrospongia maynardii, contains the very closely related 5,6-dibromotryptamine and the corresponding monomethyl 5,6-dibromo-NMT. I had the fantasy of trying to scotch the rumor Iâm about to start, that all the hippies of the San Francisco Bay Area were heading to the Caribbean with packets of Zig-Zag papers, to hit the sponge trade with a psychedelic fervor. This is not true. I refuse to take credit for this myth.

The demethylated homologue is N-methyltryptamine (NMT) and it is also widely distributed in nature. It has a synthesis in an entry of its own.

Both the N-hydroxy (N-HO-NMT) and the 2-hydroxy (2-HO-NMT) analogues of NMT are found in another legume Desmanthus illinoensis, but have not been pharmacologically evaluated. Another provocative mono-alkyl analogue of DMT is N-cyclopropyltryptamine, made from indole-3-oxalylchloride and benzyl cyclopropylamine with eventual hydrogenolysis of the benzyl group; mp 180â182. This compound, as with the 5-methoxy (5-MeO-NCPT) and the 7-methoxy (7-MeO-NCPT) counterparts, is a potent monoamineoxidase inhibitor, and it has also been reported to have hypoglycemic activity. The 2-methyl-homologue of NMT was made from 2-methyl-3-(2-bromoethyl)tryptamine and methylamine. This is 2-Me-DMT 2,Me-DMT (or 2,N,N-TMT). Both it and tryptamine itself (T) have their own entries.

Before this is closed, a couple of points need be made regarding nomenclature. Older literature uses alpha for the 2-position of the indole ring. Thus, alpha-methyltryptamine, in early literature, refers to the indole-2-methyl, not to a side-chain methyl derivative. Throughout PiHKAL, the numbers are devoted to the indole ring, and the alpha and beta terms to the side-chain. And the use of the letter N refers to the side-chain amino nitrogen atom. The pyrrole nitrogen is the indole position 1. And finally, I found in my old files a news announcement (dated March 25, 1974) that Hercules Chemical Company intends to build a big DMT plant in the Southern United States, with an annual capacity of 800 million pounds a year. In the industrial world, DMT can also stand for dimethylterephthalate.

## Effects
The effect depends very much on the set and the setting. Blood pressure and pulse increase, pupils dilate. Detachment of the body from the mind and ego dissolution are common, near-death experiences also occur relatively often, especially when high doses are consumed. The perception of time changes greatly during intoxication. A few minutes can be perceived as very long and intense. In addition, different feelings such as fear, euphoria, etc. can be experienced within a short period of time. Consumers report immersion in very "bizarre" worlds in which connections between being, environment and matter arise. With DMT, this phenomenon is also visually pronounced, i.e., images are linked with oneself, matter and being in one's own society. Physical perception can also be influenced, in that one feels weightless or thinks one is falling.
When swallowed, DMT is only effective in combination with MAO inhibitors. MAO inhibitors (e.g. harmine) are substances and drugs that prevent the enzyme MAO from breaking down the body's own messenger substances such as adrenaline, dopamine, serotonin etc. as well as foreign alkaloids such as caffeine, cocaine, morphine. The psychoactive potion ayahuasca and changa are such a combination. After the consumption of MAO inhibitors, the consumption of certain everyday foods such as cheese is life-threatening.

## Dosage
Ayahuasca is a shamanic herbal potion made from DMT-containing chacruna leaves (Psychotria viridis) and the harmaline-containing ayahuasca liana Banisteriopsis caapi. Harmaline is an MAO inhibitor. MAO inhibitors are substances and drugs that prevent the enzyme MAO from breaking down the body's own messenger substances such as adrenalin, dopamine, serotonin, etc. as well as foreign alkaloids such as caffeine, cocaine, etc.. MAO normally also degrades the active substance DMT even before it can enter the central nervous system via the blood-brain barrier.
Changa is a mixture for smoking of DMT-containing plants (but usually mostly crystalline DMT) and herbs that act as MAO inhibitors.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
The risk associated with the use of DMT is mainly psychological and depends on the personality structure of the user. The perceptual changes during a trip can be so intense that especially inexperienced users feel overwhelmed by the flood of impressions. The perception of sudden emotional outbursts can also be perceived as rather disturbing and overwhelming. At high doses, such psychological side effects can be felt for days to weeks. If the rules of the set and setting are not followed, there can be false reactions, loss of orientation, panic, paranoia and horror trips. Physical side effects include nausea, vomiting, increase in heart rate, slightly accelerated breathing, increased blood pressure, pupil dilation, increased salivation, tremors, restlessness, headaches and movement disorders.

### Long-term Risks
Permanent disturbances in self- and reality recognition are possible. The view of the world can be permanently called into question, which can make it difficult to cope with everyday life. Latent (hidden) psychoses can be triggered.

## Safer Use
- Only consume when you feel good. If you are afraid of the strong effects, do not use. Do not use if you are afraid of the substance.
- Do not use DMT alone! Take it in a safe atmosphere and together with experienced people you trust.
- Take DMT while sitting or lying down, as physical perception and ability to move are impaired during intoxication.
- Dose carefully at first. If there is no effect, increase the dose the next time. Do not add more on the same day.
- The consumption of MAO-inhibiting foods such as matured cheese, smoked fish or meat, sauerkraut, tofu, chocolate etc. should be avoided before and after consumption.
- People with high blood pressure should not consume DMT.
- A trip with DMT should remain an exceptional experience. Make sure you take long breaks from using DMT and talk to others about your experience so that it can be processed.

*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/dimethyltryptamine-dmt/*

Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is an intense naturally-occurring psychedelic that’s also found endogenously in the human body. It’s not as popular as LSD or psilocybin, though its use has grown over time.

The most popular route of administration is inhalation, but it’s also frequently taken orally in ayahuasca-like preparations.

It has at least been used for centuries.

---

Dimethyltryptamine = N,N-Dimethyltryptamine; DMT; N,N-DMT; Dimitri

PubChem: 6089

Molecular formula: C12H16N2

Molecular weight: 188.274 g/mol

IUPAC: 2-(1H-indol-3-yl)-N,N-dimethylethanamine

---

## Dose

#### Inhalation (most common route of administration)

Light: 10 – 20 mg

Common: 20 – 40 mg

Strong: 40 – 60 mg

#### Oral

Common: 30 – 60 mg

DMT is typically inactive orally. This changes when it is combined with an MAOI. An example of this combination is ayahuasca, which contains Banisteriopsis caapi (MAOIs) and Psychotria viridis (DMT).

An analysis of 16 ayahuasca preparations found the following concentrations per 100 mL:

- Beta-carboline (MAOI) average: 158 mg 
- Range: 20 – 401 mg
- DMT average: 29 mg 
- Range: 25 – 36 mg

Another analysis yielded a similar result, with a 100 mL dose providing an average of 24 mg of DMT.

The concentrations in ayahuasca can vary significantly.

---

## Timeline

#### Inhalation

Total: 10 – 15 minutes

Onset: Under 30 seconds

The effects can begin in as little as 15 seconds. Peak effects arrive between 1 and 2 minutes.

#### Oral

Total: 3 -4 hours

Onset: 00:30 – 00:45

## Experience Reports

[Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_DMT.shtml)

---

---

## Effects

#### Positive

- CEVs and OEVs
- Spiritual or otherwise meaningful experiences
- Euphoria
- Mood lift
- Auditory hallucinations

#### Negative

- Increased heart rate
- Increased blood pressure
- Fear
- Anxiety
- Paranoia

#### Full dose experiences

Taking DMT at a full dose (one capable of yielding a “breakthrough” experience) leads to highly variable effects. Although there’s a lot of variation, we can place the effects/experiences into groups and a general outline can be provided.

Among the common elements of an experience are:

- Full replacement of normal reality with an “alternate universe.” 
- This may contain visual effects as well as seemingly sentient, intelligent, or powerful entities.
- Complex rapidly changing “kaleidoscopic” imagery 
- Present with eyes open or closed.
- Colors are frequently said to be brighter and more intense than when sober.
- Some auditory changes, mainly in the form of distortions. 
- Whining, whizzing, and crinkling sounds.
- Whispers are sometimes reported.
- Auditory effects are less common and less prominent than the visual alterations.
- Dissociation from the body and a disconnection from normal reality.
- The experience is ineffable. 
- It’s difficult to put the effects into language and it may also be difficult to fully remember/process what occurred.

Transient anxiety is often a part of the experience, at least during the beginning portion. This can transform into euphoria, laughter, amazement, and confusion. Even though it’s not the most common response, it’s certainly possible to experience fear and anxiety during the entire effect period.

A user’s sense of time is distorted such that they may not comprehend time or it may feel like they’re in the DMT space longer than they actually are.

**Levels of an experience**

Benny Shanon’s stages of the DMT experience

The stage you reach depends on factors like dose and personal response.

1. Bursts, puffs and splashes of colour
2. Repetitive, multiplying non-figurative elements
3. Geometric designs and patterns
4. Designs with figures
5. Rapid figurai transformations
6. Kaleidoscopic images
7. Well-defined, stable, single figurative images
8. Proto-scenes
9. Full-fledged scenes
10. Interactive scenes
11. Scenes of flight
12. Celestial and heavenly scenes
13. Virtual reality
14. Supreme light

Rick Strassman’s categories

Strassman grouped the experiences by their potential core thematic element.

- Personal – Encounters with one’s own personal issues, often difficult to accept.
- Transpersonal – An experience novel in intensity and quality but formed from the subject’s previous experience. May be a mystical or near-death-type experience.
- Invisible worlds – Encounter with autonomous, freestanding realities sometimes appearing to be inhabited by alien beings capable of interaction.

He reported over half of volunteers given a high-dose had at least one “invisible worlds” experience.

**Progression timeline**

When the effects first take hold they tend to be described as an energetic “rush” and vibration. People report it feels like they’re being rocketed to a new location.

Your head may feel like it’s intensely vibrating. Coinciding with this effect may be sounds, usually of a high-pitch, such as whining, crinkling, or crunching.

The initial period can contain transient anxiety.

From here, the user progresses towards a detachment and dissociation from their body and environment. This leads to a breakthrough which is sometimes preceded by a short waiting period.

Waiting period

While this isn’t present for everyone, there’s sometimes a short transition phase between the “rush” and the actual breakthrough. During this period you may see complex imagery and feel like your moving, such as heading down a tunnel.

It’s possible for someone to end at this phase, often with the feeling that they’ve just barely missed entrance to a complete experience.

**Examples**

Once someone is in the full effect period (the breakthrough), here is just a short list of the things that have been reported:

- “Vivid colors”
- “A merry-go-round with people in 1890s outfits”
- “Clowns”
- “Circus imagery”
- “A sense of annihilation of personal identity”
- “Feeling loves”
- “Realer than real”
- “Reptilian or insectoid alien beings”
- “High-tech machine-like objects”
- “Crocodiles raping and crushing the experiencer”
- “A great, impersonal power behind all things”
- “A ballroom with crystal chandeliers”
- “A fantastic bird”
- “The inside of a computer’s boards”
- “DNA double helices”

**Entities**

The entities can appear in many ways. Here are some examples: dwarfs, elves, imps, spirits, gods, stick figures, clowns, reptiles, mantises, bees, spiders, and cacti.

Some users report there’s just a “presence” of an entity.

How they interact with the user varies. Sometimes they’ll laugh and welcome the user. Other times they’ll probe and examine the user. And in some cases there is no interaction.

Much of the time they’re benign or considered helpful, but they can occasionally be antagonistic.

It’s often reported the entities don’t feel like a part of the user. This may just be a feeling.

Users frequently describe them as wise, powerful, or loving.

Benny Shanon’s groupings

- Mythological beings – Such as gnomes, elves, fairies, and monsters of all kinds.
- Chimeras or hybrids – Typically half human half animal or transforming or shapeshifting beings, for example human to puma, to tiger, to wolf.
- Extraterrestrials – These are particularly common for some experients and may be accompanied by spacecraft.
- Angels and celestial beings – Usually winged humanlike beings that may be transparent or composed of light
- Semi-divine beings – May appear like Jesus, Buddha, or typically Hindu, Egyptian, or pre-Columbian deities
- Demons, monsters, and beings of death – Such as the angel of death

#### Low doses

A low dose can lead to mood elevation and anxiolysis, sometimes in the absence of any hallucinogenic activity. Depending on the exact dose, a non-breakthrough amount may also lead to objects vibrating, enhanced colors, and basic geometric designs.

In one study, a dose of 0.05 mg/kg (IV) led to mood elevation without hallucinogenic effects.

#### Ayahuasca

The term traditionally refers to B. caapi. It’s come to refer to a combination of B. caapi and P. viridis, the latter of which contains DMT.

Using DMT in this form greatly alters the effect. The timeline is extended to 3 – 4 hours and ineffability is usually less prominent. While the peak intensity (in the sense of fully replacing reality with something ineffable) is reduced, it can be as intense or more intense when it comes to the emotional and psychological impact.

Normally the full effects of ayahuasca are overlaid on normal reality, whereas inhaled/injected DMT is far more dissociative.

#### Medical

There isn’t much data on its potential medical utility and what does exist often involves ayahuasca, not DMT itself.

Some preliminary data suggestive of efficacy exists for anxiety, depression, and addiction. Much more data needs to be collected.

Depression

Animal research in rats found DMT could increase swimming (“antidepressant” effect) in conditions used to look for potential antidepressant effects.

An open-label trial for ayahuasca in patients suffering from depression found it could improve depressive symptoms up to 21 days after one dose.

A preliminary study involving three females found 2 ml/kg of ayahuasca led to a significant decline in HAM-D scores for up to 14 days, but not 28 days.

Anxiety

One study looking at the ritualistic use of ayahuasca for substance dependence noted a correlation with reduced anxiety scores.

Research has also pointed to chronic ayahuasca use being correlated with lower panic, but not state or trait anxiety.

Addiction

There is some evidence for efficacy in addiction, but most of the positive reports are anecdotal.

Informal data from an ayahuasca center in Peru claimed 67% of 175 patients exhibiting substance dependence avoided relapse for 2 years after undergoing the treatment protocol.

An observational study of ayahuasca treatment among First Nations people in British Columbia yielded some positive data. It only involved 12 ayahuasca-naive people who were given ayahuasca during two sessions guided by a traditional healer.

Data from a 6-month follow-up revealed a correlation with significant improvements in ratings of empowerment, mindfulness, hopefulness, life meaning, and outlook.

There were self-reported declines in cocaine, tobacco, and alcohol use.

#### Endogenous roles

So far there are only proposals about what it could be doing, assuming DMT has an identifiable endogenous role.

Most proposals fall into these groups:

- Connection to altered states of consciousness, psychosis, and dreams
- Connection to immunoregulation, anti-inflammatory action, and neuroprotection.
- Connection to mood, anxiety, and stress regulation.

#### Tolerance

Tolerance largely doesn’t occur with DMT. It can be used multiple times in a given day.

One study found four closely-spaced DMT doses on the same day didn’t lead to subjective tolerance.

A paper in the 1970s found LSD-tolerant individuals given DMT didn’t display much cross-tolerance.

---

## Chemistry & Pharmacology

#### Chemistry

DMT is a simple tryptamine hallucinogen. It’s structurally similar to melatonin and serotonin. It’s also similar to other hallucinogens, including 5-MeO-DMT.

The drug is found in humans, other animals, and throughout the plant kingdom. Some popular sources include Psychotria viridis, Diplopterys cabrerana, and Mimosa tenuiflora.

#### Pharmacology

The primary mechanisms of interest are 5-HTR agonism, Sigma-1 agonism, and TAAR1 agonism.

Serotonin receptors

Binding has been demonstrated at 1A, 1B, 1D, 2A, 2B, 2C, 5A, 6, and 7. Affinities range from 39 nM to 2.1 uM.

Agonism is known to exist at 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C.

5-HT1A isn’t believed to contribute to the psychedelic activity. It could actually work against DMT’s effect. Pindolol, a 5-HT1A partial agonist, was found to increase the effect of DMT by 2-3x in a study of sub-hallucinogenic doses.

5-HT2C isn’t believed to notably contribute to the psychedelic effect. Tolerance also develops at this site. The EC50 for inositol phosphate formation is 49 nM.

5-HT2A is probably a core mediator of the psychedelic effect, but not all actions are attributable to this site. The EC50 is 983 nM.

Sigma-1

DMT is an endogenous Sigma-1 agonist. This is believed to potentially contribute to psychoactivity (although there’s little evidence) and it could also lead to physiological effects.

It has an EC50 of 14 uM. Higher concentrations like 100 uM can lead to voltage-gated sodium channel inhibition tied to Sigma-1 activation.

The required micromolar concentrations of DMT could be achieved with intentional use. Endogenous activity at this site would require some form of storage/release mechanism in the brain (see: “getting into the brain.”)

There’s a hypothetical connection between the Sigma-1 action and antidepressant effects of DMT or ayahuasca. Some antidepressants are indeed high-affinity Sigma-1 agonists.

Agonism at this site may also be neuroprotective.

TAAR1

Activation of TAAR1 has been shown. TAAR1 is more responsive to tyramine and DMT than serotonin. In one rat study, tyramine exhibited nanomolar affinity and 1 uM of DMT was nearly equal to the activity of tyramine.

Since it appears activity is possible with nanomolar concentrations, TAAR1 might be connected to a regulatory action of endogenous DMT on mood and anxiety. It could also contribute to low-dose DMT’s mood effects.

Other

Binding to SERT and VMAT2 has been demonstrated.

- Ki (inhibition of 5-HT uptake) 
- SERT: 4 uM
- VMAT2: 93 uM

DMT causes a temporary rise in prolactin, growth hormone, and cortisol.

mGlu2 receptors may be important for DMT’s action as they work presynaptically to reduce glutamate release. An agonist, LY379268, was found to decrease the discriminative stimulus of DMT. An antagonist, LY341495, boosted the impact of low-dose DMT.

mGlu2 colocalizes with 5-HT2a in cortical regions.

**Pharmacokinetics**

MAO-A typically destroys DMT at a rapid pace. It can become undetectable in blood around an hour after administration.

Two of the primary metabolites are indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and DMT-N-Oxide. Some of the IAA may be coming from metabolism to N-methyltryptamine.

Pathways other than MAO-A exist and when MAO-A is inhibited, they become more important. For example, when the enzyme is inhibited in rats, there’s a greater formation of DMT-N-Oxide.

This change in metabolism could be useful in studies, including those looking at endogenous DMT. Measuring IAA isn’t particularly helpful given it can come from multiple sources, so it’s useful to measure DMT-N-Oxide.

**Endogenous**

DMT has been reported to occur naturally in humans and there’s sufficient evidence to say it’s an endogenous chemical. A lot of the reports find it’s sporadically detectable.

Although the finding doesn’t immediately apply to humans, DMT has also been detected in rat pineal gland.

Synthesis

The biosynthesis is believed to begin with tryptophan, which then becomes tryptamine. Through the use of the INMT enzyme, N-methyltryptamine is formed. INMT then catalyzes the final formation of DMT.

Some high expression areas for INMT are the lungs, thyroid, and adrenal gland. The brain generally lacks notable levels, but the pineal gland does have INMT.

Areas that contain INMT also often contain the enzymes necessary to catabolize DMT, limiting the amount that would be released into blood.

Getting into the brain

It’s not clear where the drug is primarily produced, but even if it occurs outside of the brain, there’s a hypothesis for how it may enter and accumulate in the brain.

Under this hypothesis, peripheral DMT would cross the blood-brain barrier (which is known to be possible). It could enter neurons via the serotonin transporter and then enter synaptic vesicles through VMAT2.

This sort of activity, if found to occur, would allow DMT to act in the intracellular space or be released at a larger concentration in response to a given stimuli.

Some support for this hypothesis exists in the form of evidence that DMT isn’t quickly eliminated from the brain after administration. In rats, radiolabeled DMT remained in the brain for at least 7 days post-injection.

---

## History

#### For centuries or longer

DMT has been used in the form of ayahuasca-like brews and in the form of snuffs. Snuffs typically contain DMT as a minor constituent, not as the primary drug. There is some evidence for snuff use dating back thousands of years.

Europeans reported ayahuasca (possibly just B. caapi) use during the 1700s. Prior to that point, we don’t really have evidence of ayahuasca being used. Based on the available evidence, it’s likely DMT-containing brews have been used for at least a couple centuries, but not necessarily millennia like is often claimed.

Amazonian tribes use ayahuasca (with or without DMT) to receive help from protective spirits, to receive insight into the causes/cures of disease, to see the future, to send messages to other groups, to prepare for war and hunting, and to discover enemies and their intentions.

#### 1900s

Following the Amazon rubber boom, multiple syncretic ayahuasca-using religions appeared in Brazil. They blended Brazilian cosmological beliefs, Catholic and European traditions, and traditional beliefs/knowledge from South America.

Santo Daime appeared in the 1930s. It was formed by Raimundo Irineu Serra, a Brazilian rubber tapper. He encountered the brew through contact with indigenous peoples in Acre, a Brazilian frontier state.

Barquinha formed through a split with Santo Daime in 1945

Santo Daime became more active in urban areas and eventually internationally after the 1970s.

The Uniao de Vegetal (UDV) was formed in 1961 by Jose Gabriel da Costa, who was also a rubber tapper.

#### 1931

DMT was synthesized by Richard Manske, a chemist working in Canada.

#### 1950s – 1960s

Reports of endogenously detectable psychoactive tryptamines began to appear. Bufotenin was initially found, followed by reports of DMT and 5-MeO-DMT.

The INMT enzyme was then detected as well.

Dozens of studies ended up looking at the presence of DMT and other drugs in human biological samples.

#### 1950s – 1960s

Research, initially with snuffs, found that South American peoples were sometimes using combinations of beta-carbolines and DMT. This led to the hypothesis that beta-carbolines activated DMT when used intranasally or orally.

Ultimately this hypothesis was supported by human experiments involving ayahuasca and ayahuasca-like preparations.

#### 1955

DMT was first definitely isolated from a plant. It came from Anadenanthera peregrina, which was used to prepare a snuff.

At least a partial isolation may have occurred in 1946 by Brazilian chemist Oswaldo Goncalves de Lima, who isolated an alkaloid from Mimosa tenuiflora.

De Lima’s work was followed up in 1959 by American researchers who showed DMT’s presence in M. tenuiflora root bark. That source gave a 0.57% yield.

#### 1956

Stephen Szara, a Hungarian biochemist, reported on the hallucinogenic effects of pure DMT for the first time. He synthesized the drug in his lab and injected it.

He then gave it to a couple medical colleagues, which progressed to 30 other individuals, mostly doctors.

One user reported, “the whole room is filled with spirits…I feel exactly as if I were flying.” Another stated, “In front of me are two quiet, sunlit Gods.”

Psychotic individuals were also given DMT in an experiment connected to Szara.

#### 1960s

Although psychedelics rose into the West’s public consciousness at this time, ayahuasca was largely absent. DMT did receive some attention, but it wasn’t one of the most popular psychedelics.

Some discussion about the drug came from Timothy Leary and Ralph Metzner, who tried inhaling and injecting it.

A 1966 article from Leary brought DMT to the attention of quite a few people. It was called, “Programmed Communication During Experiences With DMT.” It included a report from the philosopher Alan Watts.

#### 1967

Six snuffs from South America were examined and found to mainly contain 5-MeO-DMT, with DMT as a secondary drug.

#### 1968

DMT was found in the leaves of Diplopterys cabrerana, an ayahuasca admixture plant in Ecuador.

#### 1970s

Testing confirmed DMT was inactive orally, even when using as much as 1 gram. This was despite significant psychoactivity with IM, IV, and inhalation.

However, people began to find that combining it with an MAOI could lead to effects.

Jeremy Bigwood reported 100 mg of DMT with 86 mg of harmaline was effective. This combination led to:

DMT-like hallucinations…very similar to…a DMT and harmaline-containing ayahuasca brew that I had previously experimented with.

#### 1980s

Further tests with DMT and MAOIs found the combination was reliably effective. A threshold of around 20 mg for DMT was determined, with the ideal amount being 30 – 40 mg or more.

#### 1980s – 1990s

Terence McKenna helped popularize the drug and in particular the inhalation route of administration.

He frequently talked about his experiences and was enthusiastic about DMT.

#### 1990s

Jonathan Ott, an ethnobotanist, reported that combining 120 mg of harmine with 30 mg or more of DMT yielded good effects.

#### 1990s

Rick Strassman, a medical doctor, began investigating DMT. He picked the drug because it was short-acting, naturally occurring, had potentially inadequately explored roles in humans, and was relatively obscure.

He conducted his research at the University of New Mexico Hospital Clinical Research Center.

Dozens of volunteers received hundreds of doses.

His opinions as well as results from the research were presented in DMT: The Spirit Molecule, a book released in 2000. It helped to popularize the substance.

#### 1996

Brazilian law was adjusted to allow for the use of ayahuasca. This followed a legal challenge from the UDV.

#### 2005

The UDV in Brazil was reported to have an estimated 9,000 members, 1,200 of whom were adolescents.

#### 2006

The US Supreme Court ruled the UDV could use their “hoasca” brew despite it containing a Schedule 1 drug. This ruling was based on provisions of the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act that allowed the Native American Church to use peyote.

Similar cases have appeared in other countries.

#### 2000s – 2010s

Interest in the drug increased, partly due to individuals like Joe Rogan, Graham Hancock, and Rick Strassman discussing it. Strassman’s book led to a documentary, DMT: The Spirit Molecule, in 2010.

This has led to more ayahuasca ceremonies in the West, more people travelling to South America to use ayahuasca, more people extracting the drug, and more people using it, generally via inhalation.

#### 2017

LSD and psilocybin remain more popular than DMT, but it has become more common.

Ayahuasca has spread to many countries and has even received some mainstream attention.

DMT is sometimes synthesized, though it’s often extracted from plant sources, something that requires little chemistry knowledge.

---

## Legal Status

#### US (as of January 2017)

Schedule 1

#### Other countries (check your local laws)

It is typically illegal.

Laws pertaining to plants vary. They’re often legal to posses, while extracting DMT will usually be illegal.

---

## Safety

Most of the acute concerns are psychological. People with ongoing psychiatric problems would be wise to avoid the drug.

It does increase blood pressure and heart rate, which is something to be aware of if you have a compromised cardiovascular system.

#### LD50

**Mice**

- IV – 47 mg/kg (potential human equivalent of 3.81 mg/kg)
- IP – 32 mg/kg (potential human equivalent of 2.59 mg/kg)

Neither of those potential human equivalent LD50s appear accurate, though there’s also no reason to inject ~250 mg of DMT.

#### Deaths

It doesn’t appear there have been any deaths from DMT alone.

#### Long-term use

There may be cardiovascular problems associated with heavy chronic 5-HT2b agonism.

Rats exposed to ayahuasca preparations for 14 days showed altered aortic structure, including thickening of the walls of the aorta.

Some of the only available data comes from long-term users of ayahuasca. They often take the drug every other week and have done so for years.

**Hoasca Project**

An examination of 15 long-term adult members of the UDV in Brazil suggested ayahuasca was not correlated with any negative psychological effects.

**Adolescents**

40 adolescents from three UDV churches in Brazil were examined. They were 15 to 19-years-old and had taken the drug ritually at least 24 times in the past 2 years.

Most (25/40) began under the age of 13. Only 1 person reported having used ayahuasca outside of a religious context.

39/40 felt their use had a “profoundly positive influence on their lives.”

Testing suggested a non-significant trend towards lower scores for anxiety, self-image problems, and inattentiveness.

#### Risky Combinations

Stimulants, other psychedelics, and tramadol when using DMT by itself (not ayahuasca).

#### Overdoses or otherwise problematic cases

**Case 1**

- 42-year-old male
- No history of psychiatric illness
- Long history of substance use disorders
- 3 weeks pre-admission 
- Began using DMT
- Had taken it around 10 times
- Recent stressors included unemployment, eviction from apartment, and death of his mother.
- Brought to ED by police for psychiatric evaluation.
- In ED 
- Agitated and underweight 
- Agitation addressed with medication.
- Disoriented to time
- Delusional reference of being “navigated by the stars”
- Also religiously themed statements
- Thought processes noted to be loose, disorganized, and tangential.
- Over next 12 days 
- Reported delusions of a paranoid and grandiose manner.
- Said he could read minds and orchestrate distant events/persons by adopting specific body postures.
- Was hyperverbal and intrusive.
- During later interviews 
- Said DMT was “real interesting…like traveling to another dimension.”
- Said he interacted with “aliens” on the drug.
- By day 14 
- Was denying his previous delusional beliefs, recognizing they were drug-induced.
- Judgement improved.
- Six month follow-up 
- Symptom and drug-free.
- TDC opinion 
- DMT may or may not have been responsible. If it was, it may have triggered a temporary period of psychosis, which doesn’t seem impossible given the right conditions.

**Case 2**

- 24-year-old male (South Australia)
- Six months pre-admission 
- Developed a complex delusional spiritual belief system and was pursuing enlightenment.
- Wanted to open his internal “third eye.”
- He became aware of DMT through friends, internet forums, and the DMT: The Spirit Molecule documentary.
- Began collecting leaf tips, bark, and seeds from acacia and Phalaris aquatica plants. 
- Dried the material, ground it, and then smoked it.
- Plant matter was used with increasing frequency leading up to his presentation with positive symptoms of schizophrenia.
- History of DMT, tobacco, cannabis, and methamphetamine use
- Family history of psychotic illness
- Admitted to hospital for first-episode psychosis
- TDC opinion 
- His way of using DMT is atypical. I’m not sure that he would have been exposed to notable levels of DMT by smoking plant material in that way.

  "wikipedia": `# Dimethyltryptamine
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyltryptamine*

Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), also known as N,N-dimethyltryptamine (N,N-DMT), is a serotonergic hallucinogen and investigational drug of the tryptamine family that occurs naturally in many plants and animals. DMT is used as a psychedelic drug and prepared by various cultures for ritual purposes as an entheogen.
DMT has a rapid onset, intense effects, and a relatively short duration of action. For those reasons, DMT was known as the "businessman's trip" during the 1960s in the United States, as a user could access the full depth of a psychedelic experience in considerably less time than with other substances such as LSD or psilocybin mushrooms. DMT can be inhaled or injected and its effects depend on the dose, as well as the mode of administration. When inhaled or injected, the effects last about five to fifteen minutes. Effects can last three hours or more when orally ingested along with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), such as the ayahuasca brew of many native Amazonian tribes. DMT induces intense, often indescribable subjective experiences involving vivid visual hallucinations, altered sensory perception, ego dissolution, and encounters with seemingly autonomous entities. DMT is generally considered non-addictive with low dependence and no tolerance buildup, but it may cause acute psychological distress or cardiovascular effects, especially in predisposed individuals.
DMT was first synthesized in 1931. It is a functional and structural analogue of other psychedelic tryptamines such as 4-AcO-DMT (O-acetylpsilocin), psilocybin (4-PO-DMT), psilocin (4-HO-DMT), O-methylbufotenin (5-MeO-DMT), and bufotenin (5-HO-DMT). Parts of the structure of DMT occur within some important biomolecules like serotonin and melatonin, making them structural analogues of DMT.
DMT exhibits broad and variable binding affinities across numerous receptors, showing its strongest interactions with serotonin receptors, especially 5-HT2A, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT2C, which are believed to mediate its psychedelic effects. Endogenous DMT, a psychedelic compound, is naturally produced in mammals, with evidence showing its synthesis and presence in brain and body tissues, though its exact roles and origins remain debated. DMT is internationally illegal without authorization, with most countries banning its possession and trade, though some allow religious use of ayahuasca, a DMT-containing decoction. Short-acting psychedelics like DMT are considered scalable alternatives to longer-acting drugs like psilocybin for potential clinical use. DMT is currently undergoing clinical trials for treatment-resistant depression.

## Use and effects

### Forms, routes, and doses

DMT is used either in pure form or in the form of naturally sourced materials. It occurs naturally in many plants, among the more notable species including Psychotria viridis, Mimosa tenuiflora, and Diplopterys cabrerana. The drug is often present alongside its close analogues 5-MeO-DMT (mebufotenin) and bufotenin (5-HO-DMT). It has widely been used as an entheogen or for shamanistic purposes in Central and South America, for instance among Amazonian peoples. This includes as the traditional beverage ayahuasca and other forms. Ayahuasca is boiled mixture of different plants, including a DMT-containing plant like Psychotria viridis, Psychotria carthagenensis, or Diplopterys cabrerana together with another plant known as Banisteriopsis caapi. A variety of different recipes may be used to make the brew. DMT is usually the main active constituent of ayahuasca, but ayahuasca is sometimes also brewed with plants that do not contain DMT. The drug is also found as a minor alkaloid in hallucinogenic snuffs such as those made from Virola or Anadenanthera plant materials but in which the major active drugs are instead 5-MeO-DMT and/or bufotenin. In addition to its use as an entheogen, DMT is widely used recreationally.
DMT is not orally active on its own and is given by parenteral administration, such as smoking, intramuscular injection, subcutaneous injection, or intravenous injection. Other routes like intranasal, buccal, or rectal administration have also been tried but were all reported to be inactive. The lack of oral activity of DMT is due to rapid metabolism by the enzyme monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A). However, when taken in combination with an irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) or a reversible inhibitor of MAO-A (RIMA) such as a harmala alkaloid like harmine or harmaline or a pharmaceutical RIMA like moclobemide, DMT becomes orally active with an extended duration relative to parenteral use of DMT alone. Certain plants like Peganum harmala and the Banisteriopsis caapi used in ayahuasca contain harmala alkaloids which allow DMT to become orally active. When oral DMT is used with an MAOI and the materials are not naturally sourced, the combination is known as pharmahuasca. Changa is a plant-derived form of DMT that is smoked. Smoking and intravenous injection of DMT have extremely intense but very-short-lived effects, whereas intramuscular injection and particularly oral administration with an MAOI have less intense but longer-lasting effects.

In his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved) and other publications, Alexander Shulgin lists DMT's dose as greater than 350 mg orally, 60 to 100 mg by intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or via smoking, and 4 to 30 mg by intravenous injection. He also reported that doses of 150 to 350 mg or even up to 1,000 mg orally and a dose of 100 mg buccally produced no effects, whereas doses of 20 to 80 mg intramuscularly, 30 to 100 mg smoked, and 15 to 30 mg intravenously were all active in producing effects. In terms of intramuscular injection, threshold effects occur at a dose of 30 mg and full effects occur at a dose of 50 to 100 mg by this route. Similarly, the dose for full effects with subcutaneous injection is likewise 60 to 100 mg. With regard to intravenous injection, a dose of 4 mg was indistinguishable from placebo, 8 mg produced physical effects but no psychoactive effects, 15 mg produced threshold psychedelic effects, and 30 mg produced strong psychedelic effects. Shulgin lists the duration of parenteral DMT alone as up to 1 hour.
In other more recent publications, different dose ranges of inhaled DMT of 2 to 100 mg or 15 to 60 mg have been described and typical doses have been reported to be 40 to 50 mg. Concerning intravenous injection and based on contemporary clinical studies, 15 mg has been described as a low dose, 25 mg as an intermediate or "good effect" dose, and 30 mg as a high or "ego-dissolution" dose. For intramuscular injection, a range of 50 to 100 mg with an estimated typical dose of 75 mg has been noted. The onset of DMT has been given as 10 to 15 seconds smoked, within 2 to 5 minutes intravenously, and within 2 to 5 minutes intramuscularly. In addition, its duration is given as 5 to 20 minutes (average 12 minutes) via inhalation, less than 30 minutes intravenously, and 30 to 60 minutes intramuscularly.
DMT by continuous intravenous infusion (i.e., an intravenous "drip", also sometimes known as "DMTx") has additionally been developed recently and can extend the duration of intravenous DMT to hours. The dose range for this route is 0.6 to 1.8 mg per minute, with 0.6 mg/minute being a low dose, 1.2 mg/minute being an intermediate or "good effect" dose, and 1.8 to 2.4 mg/minute being a high or "ego dissolution" dose. In addition to continuous intravenous infusion, DMT vape pens have been developed and distributed as an alternative to smoking.
Besides parenteral DMT alone, Shulgin also described the properties of oral DMT in combination with the MAOI and distinct ibogaine-like hallucinogen harmaline or in some cases Peganum harmala seeds in TiHKAL. This combination is a form of pharmahuasca and is similar to ayahuasca. Doses of 20 to 50 mg harmaline with 55 to 60 mg DMT both orally were associated with few to no effects. At higher harmaline doses, including 80 to 150 mg, combined with 35 to 120 mg DMT, both orally, clear MAOI activity occurred and more significant effects became apparent. More recent publications have defined the usually recommended doses as 50 mg DMT and 100 mg harmaline orally. Besides DMT with harmaline, the properties and effects of oral DMT in combination with harmine have also been studied by Jonathan Ott. He found that the threshold dose was 20 or 30 mg DMT and 120 mg harmine orally. Shulgin also reported in TiHKAL that 35 to 40 mg DMT and 140 to 190 mg harmine were unmistakeably active, whereas smaller doses of 30 mg DMT and 120 to 140 mg harmine orally were inactive. In notable contrast to harmaline, harmine does not have its own psychoactive effects when used at doses of up to at least 300 mg orally. In pharmahuasca, the harmala alkaloid is usually taken first and then DMT is taken 15 to 20 minutes later, although a shorter or longer interval may also be employed. The onset of oral DMT with an MAOI is within 1 hour and its duration is 4 to 6 hours.

### Subjective effects

Subjective experiences of DMT indubitably includes profound time-dilatory, visual, auditory, tactile, and proprioceptive distortions and hallucinations, and other experiences that, by most firsthand accounts, defy verbal or visual description. Examples include perceiving hyperbolic geometry or seeing Escher-like impossible objects.
Several scientific experimental studies have tried to measure subjective experiences of altered states of consciousness induced by drugs under highly controlled and safe conditions.
Rick Strassman and his colleagues conducted a five-year-long DMT study at the University of New Mexico in the 1990s. The results provided insight about the quality of subjective psychedelic experiences. In this study participants received the DMT dose via intravenous injection and the findings suggested that different psychedelic experiences can occur, depending on the dose. Lower doses (0.01 and 0.05 mg/kg) produced some aesthetic and emotional responses, but not hallucinogenic experiences (e.g., 0.05 mg/kg had mild mood elevating and calming properties). In contrast, responses produced by higher doses (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg) researchers labeled as "hallucinogenic" that elicited "intensely colored, rapidly moving display of visual images, formed, abstract or both". Comparing to other sensory modalities, the most affected was the visual. Participants reported visual hallucinations, fewer auditory hallucinations and specific physical sensations progressing to a sense of bodily dissociation, as well as experiences of euphoria, calm, fear, and anxiety. These dose-dependent effects match well with anonymously posted "trip reports" online, where users report "breakthroughs" above certain doses.
Strassman also highlighted the importance of the context where the drug has been taken. He claimed that DMT has no beneficial effects of itself, rather the context when and where people take it plays an important role.
It appears that DMT can induce a state or feeling wherein the person believes they "communicate with other intelligent lifeforms" (see "Entity encounters" below). High doses of DMT produce a state that involves a sense of "another intelligence" that people sometimes describe as "super-intelligent", but "emotionally detached".
A 1995 study by Adolf Dittrich and Daniel Lamparter found that the DMT-induced altered state of consciousness (ASC) is strongly influenced by habitual rather than situative factors. In the study, researchers used three dimensions of the APZ questionnaire to examine ASC. The first dimension, oceanic boundlessness (OB), refers to dissolution of ego boundaries and is mostly associated with positive emotions. The second dimension, anxious ego-dissolution (AED), represents a disordering of thoughts and decreases in autonomy and self-control. Last, visionary restructuralization (VR) refers to auditory/visual illusions and hallucinations. Results showed strong effects within the first and third dimensions for all conditions, especially with DMT, and suggested strong intrastability of elicited reactions independently of the condition for the OB and VR scales.
The effects of parenterally administered DMT have been described by Alexander Shulgin in his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved). The perceptual effects included feeling strange, closed-eye imagery such as beautiful colored kaleidoscopic images, fast-moving geometric patterns, and complex and wonderful scenes alternating very rapidly, open-eye psychedelic visuals such as moving patterns, patterns becoming heads of animals, and peoples faces seeming to be masks, perceptual disturbances and distortions, yellowing of visual field, and rare auditory changes. Other effects included feeling intoxicated or stoned, everything feeling blurry, feeling a rush, time dilation, loss of spatial perception, ego dissolution, feeling as if one has died or no longer exists, feeling like one has no body, feeling that one is moving at the speed of light, feeling like one is gazing upon the entire universe, and encounters with strange entities or creatures. Emotional effects included emotional changes, euphoria, imagery being associated with deep emotional content and connotation, feeling overwhelmed, anxiety and fear, feeling like one can't breathe, a sense of dread and doom, and wanting one's mother. Physical side effects included pupil dilation, tingling, trembling, numbness, sweating, lightheadedness, athetosis, slight nausea, and increased heart rate and blood pressure.
In addition to parenteral DMT, Shulgin described the effects of oral DMT plus harmaline or in some cases Peganum harmala seeds in TiHKAL. The effects were reported to include closed-eye imagery such as colors, infinitely repeated and wavy sheets of patterns, and kaleidoscopic images, visual changes like brighter colors and patterns and distortions, music enhancement, time distortion, clarity, insights, intoxication, emotional changes, feeling alive and excited, depression, despair, and feeling psychotic. Other effects included difficulty focusing on thoughts, short-term memory disruption, feeling cold, nausea, gait impairment or difficulty walking, and an afterglow. The preceding effects are variably due to both DMT and harmaline, with harmaline also producing its own hallucinogenic effects at sufficiently doses, for instance 150 mg or more.

#### Entity encounters

Entities perceived during DMT inebriation have been represented in diverse forms of psychedelic art. The term machine elf was coined by ethnobotanist Terence McKenna for the entities he encountered in DMT "hyperspace", along with terms like fractal elves, or self-transforming machine elves. McKenna first encountered the "machine elves" after smoking DMT in Berkeley in 1965. His subsequent speculations regarding the hyperdimensional space in which they were encountered have inspired a great many artists and musicians, and the meaning of DMT entities has been a subject of considerable debate among participants in a networked cultural underground, enthused by McKenna's effusive accounts of DMT hyperspace. Cliff Pickover has also written about the "machine elf" experience, in the book Sex, Drugs, Einstein, & Elves. Strassman noted similarities between self-reports of his DMT study participants' encounters with these "entities", and mythological descriptions of figures such as Ḥayyot haq-Qodesh in ancient religions, including both angels and demons. Strassman also argues for a similarity in his study participants' descriptions of mechanized wheels, gears and machinery in these encounters, with those described in visions of encounters with the Living Creatures and Ophanim of the Hebrew Bible, noting they may stem from a common neuropsychopharmacological experience.

Strassman argues that the more positive of the "external entities" encountered in DMT experiences should be understood as analogous to certain forms of angels: The medieval Jewish philosophers whom I rely upon for understanding the Hebrew Bible text and its concept of prophecy portray angels as God's intermediaries. That is, they perform a certain function for God. Within the context of my DMT research, I believe that the beings that volunteers see could be conceived of as angelic – that is, previously invisible, incorporeal spiritual forces that are engarbed or enclothed in a particular form – determined by the psychological and spiritual development of the volunteers – bringing a particular message or experience to that volunteer.
Strassman's experimental participants also note that some other entities can subjectively resemble creatures more like insects and aliens. As a result, Strassman writes these experiences among his experimental participants "also left me feeling confused and concerned about where the spirit molecule was leading us. It was at this point that I began to wonder if I was getting in over my head with this research."
Hallucinations of strange creatures had been reported by Stephen Szara in a 1958 study in psychotic patients, in which he described how one of his subjects under the influence of DMT had experienced "strange creatures, dwarves or something" at the beginning of a DMT trip.
Other researchers of the entities seemingly encountered by DMT users describe them as "entities" or "beings" in humanoid as well as animal form, with descriptions of "little people" being common (non-human gnomes, elves, imps, etc.). Strassman and others have speculated that this form of hallucination may be the cause of alien abduction and extraterrestrial encounter experiences, which may occur through endogenously-occurring DMT.
Likening them to descriptions of rattling and chattering auditory phenomena described in encounters with the Hayyoth in the Book of Ezekiel, Rick Strassman notes that participants in his studies, when reporting encounters with the alleged entities, have also described loud auditory hallucinations, such as one subject reporting typically "the elves laughing or talking at high volume, chattering, twittering".
Andrew Gallimore believes that entity encounters are real and genuine interactions with other-dimensional beings.

#### Near-death experiences

A 2018 study found significant relationships between DMT experiences and near-death experiences (NDE). A 2019 large-scale study pointed that ketamine, Salvia divinorum, and DMT (and other classical psychedelic substances) may be linked to NDEs due to the semantic similarity of reports associated with the use of psychoactive compounds and NDE narratives, but the study concluded that with the current data it is neither possible to corroborate nor refute the hypothesis that the release of an endogenous ketamine-like neuroprotective agent underlies NDE phenomenology.

### Physiological effects

According to a dose-response study in human subjects, dimethyltryptamine administered intravenously slightly elevated blood pressure, heart rate, pupil diameter, and rectal temperature, in addition to elevating blood concentrations of beta-endorphin, corticotropin, cortisol, and prolactin; growth hormone blood levels rose equally in response to all doses of DMT, and melatonin levels were unaffected."

### Endogenous production and effects

In the 1950s, the endogenous production of psychoactive agents was considered to be a potential explanation for the hallucinatory symptoms of some psychiatric diseases; this is known as the transmethylation hypothesis. Several speculative and yet untested hypotheses suggest that endogenous DMT is produced in the human brain and is involved in certain psychological and neurological states. DMT is naturally occurring in small amounts in rat brains, human cerebrospinal fluid, and other tissues of humans and other mammals. Further, mRNA for the enzyme necessary for the production of DMT, INMT, are expressed in the human cerebral cortex, choroid plexus, and pineal gland, suggesting an endogenous role in the human brain. In 2011, Nicholas Cozzi of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, and three other researchers, concluded that INMT, an enzyme that is associated with the biosynthesis of DMT and endogenous hallucinogens is present in the non-human primate (rhesus macaque) pineal gland, retinal ganglion neurons, and spinal cord. Neurobiologist Andrew Gallimore suggested in 2013 that while DMT might not have a modern neural function, it may have been an ancestral neuromodulator once secreted in psychedelic concentrations during REM sleep, a function now lost.

## Adverse effects

### Psychological reactions

DMT may trigger psychological reactions, known colloquially as a "bad trip", such as intense fear, paranoia, anxiety, panic-attacks, and substance-induced psychosis, particularly in predisposed individuals.

### Addiction and dependence liability

DMT, like other serotonergic psychedelics, is considered to be non-addictive with low abuse potential. A study examining substance use disorder for the DSM-IV reported that almost no hallucinogens produced dependence, unlike psychoactive drugs of other classes such as stimulants and depressants. At present, there have been no studies that report drug withdrawal syndrome with termination of DMT, and dependence potential of DMT and the risk of sustained psychological disturbance may be minimal when used infrequently; however, the physiological dependence potential of DMT and ayahuasca has not yet been documented convincingly.

### Tolerance

Unlike with other classical psychedelics, tolerance does not seem to develop to the subjective effects of DMT. Studies report that DMT did not exhibit tolerance upon repeated administration of twice a day sessions, separated by 5 hours, for 5 consecutive days; field reports suggests a refractory period of only 15 to 30 minutes, while the plasma levels of DMT was nearly undetectable 30 minutes after intravenous administration. Another study of four closely spaced DMT infusion sessions with 30 minute intervals also suggests no tolerance buildup to the psychological effects of the compound, while heart rate responses and neuroendocrine effects were diminished with repeated administration. Similarly to DMT by itself, tolerance does not appear to develop to ayahuasca. A fully hallucinogenic dose of DMT did not demonstrate cross-tolerance to human subjects who are highly tolerant to LSD; hence, research suggests that DMT exhibits unique pharmacological properties compared to other classical psychedelics. Contrary to earlier findings however, subsequent clinical studies employing DMT by continuous intravenous infusion (also known as DMTx) have found rapid and moderate acute tolerance development with DMT.

### Long-term use

There have been no serious adverse effects reported on long-term use of DMT, apart from acute cardiovascular events. Repeated and one-time administration of DMT produces marked changes in the cardiovascular system, with an increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure; although the changes were not statistically significant, a robust trend towards significance was observed for systolic blood pressure at high doses.

## Overdose

There have been cases of death with DMT. In terms of extrapolated human lethal dose based on animal studies and human case reports, the lethal dose of DMT relative to a typical recreational dose is estimated to be 50-fold in the case of oral DMT (as ayahuasca).

## Interactions

DMT is inactive when ingested orally due to metabolism by monoamine oxidase (MAO), and DMT-containing drinks such as ayahuasca have been found to contain monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), in particular, harmine and harmaline. Life-threatening lethalities such as serotonin syndrome (SS) may occur when MAOIs are combined with certain serotonergic medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. Serotonin syndrome has also been reported with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), certain opioids, certain analgesics, and antimigraine drugs; it is advised to exercise caution when an individual has used dextromethorphan (DXM), MDMA, ginseng, or St. John's wort recently.
Chronic use of SSRIs, TCAs, and MAOIs diminish subjective effects of psychedelics due to presumed serotonin 5-HT2A receptors downregulation and/or desensitization secondary to elevated serotonin levels. However, a clinical study of people with depression found that SSRIs did not diminish the effects of DMT and instead resulted in greater mystical experience, emotional breakthrough, and ego dissolution scores with DMT than in people with depression not on antidepressants. This was in contrast to previous research finding that SSRIs diminished the effects of serotonergic psychedelics.
The interaction between psychedelics and antipsychotics and anticonvulsants are not well documented; however, reports reveal that co-use of psychedelics with mood stabilizers such as lithium may provoke seizure and dissociative effects in individuals with bipolar disorder.
The serotonin receptor agonist methysergide (UML-491) has been reported to greatly intensify the effects of DMT.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

DMT binds non-selectively with affinities below 0.6 μmol/L to the following serotonin receptors: 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7. An agonist action has been determined at 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C. Its efficacies at other serotonin receptors remain to be determined. Of special interest will be the determination of its efficacy at human 5-HT2B receptor as two in vitro assays evidenced DMT's high affinity for this receptor: 0.108 μmol/L and 0.184 μmol/L. This may be of importance because chronic or frequent uses of serotonergic drugs showing preferential high affinity and clear agonism at 5-HT2B receptor have been causally linked to valvular heart disease.
It has also been shown to possess affinity for the dopamine D1, α1-adrenergic, α2-adrenergic, imidazoline-1, and σ1 receptors. Converging lines of evidence established activation of the σ1 receptor at concentrations of 50–100 μmol/L. Its efficacies at the other receptor binding sites are unclear. It has also been shown in vitro to be a substrate for the cell-surface serotonin transporter (SERT) expressed in human platelets, and the rat vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), which was transiently expressed in fall armyworm Sf9 cells. DMT inhibited SERT-mediated serotonin uptake into platelets at an average concentration of 4.00 ± 0.70 μmol/L and VMAT2-mediated serotonin uptake at an average concentration of 93 ± 6.8 μmol/L. In addition, DMT is a potent serotonin releasing agent with an EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration value of 81–114 nM and an EmaxTooltip maximal efficacy of 78%.
As with other so-called "classical hallucinogens", a large part of DMT psychedelic effects can be attributed to a functionally selective activation of the 5-HT2A receptor. DMT concentrations eliciting 50% of its maximal effect (half maximal effective concentration = EC50) at the human 5-HT2A receptor in vitro are in the 0.118–0.983 μmol/L range. This range of values coincides well with the range of concentrations measured in blood and plasma after administration of a fully psychedelic dose (see Pharmacokinetics).
DMT is one of the only psychedelics that isn't known to produce tolerance to its hallucinogenic effects. The lack of tolerance with DMT may be related to the fact that, unlike other psychedelics such as LSD and DOI, DMT does not desensitize serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in vitro. This may be due to the fact that DMT is a biased agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. More specifically, DMT activates the Gq signaling pathway of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor without significantly recruiting β-arrestin2. Activation of β-arrestin2 is linked to receptor downregulation and tachyphylaxis. Similarly to DMT, 5-MeO-DMT is a biased agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, with minimal β-arrestin2 recruitment, and likewise has been associated with little tolerance to its hallucinogenic effects. On the other hand, the lack of apparent tolerance of DMT and similar agents may simply be related to their very short durations.
As DMT has been shown to have slightly better potency (EC50) at the human serotonin 5-HT2C receptor than at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor is also implicated in DMT's effects. The drug shows pronounced biased agonism at the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor. Other receptors such as the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor and the sigma σ1 receptor may also play a role.
In 2009, it was hypothesized that DMT may be an endogenous ligand for the σ1 receptor. The concentration of DMT needed for σ1 activation in vitro (50–100 μmol/L) is similar to the behaviorally active concentration measured in mouse brain of approximately 106 μmol/L This is minimally 4 orders of magnitude higher than the average concentrations measured in rat brain tissue or human plasma under basal conditions (see Endogenous DMT), so σ1 receptors are likely to be activated only under conditions of high local DMT concentrations. If DMT is stored in synaptic vesicles, such concentrations might occur during vesicular release. To illustrate, while the average concentration of serotonin in brain tissue is in the 1.5-4 μmol/L range, the concentration of serotonin in synaptic vesicles was measured at 270 mM. Following vesicular release, the resulting concentration of serotonin in the synaptic cleft, to which serotonin receptors are exposed, is estimated to be about 300 μmol/L. Thus, while in vitro receptor binding affinities, efficacies, and average concentrations in tissue or plasma are useful, they are not likely to predict DMT concentrations in the vesicles or at synaptic or intracellular receptors. Under these conditions, notions of receptor selectivity are moot, and it seems probable that most of the receptors identified as targets for DMT (see above) participate in producing its psychedelic effects.
In September 2020, an in vitro and in vivo study found that DMT present in the ayahuasca infusion promotes neurogenesis, meaning it helps with generating neurons.
DMT produces the head-twitch response (HTR), a behavioral proxy of psychedelic-like effects, in rodents. However, its effects in the HTR paradigm in mice that are highly strain-dependent, including producing an HTR comparable to other psychedelics, producing an HTR that is much weaker than that of other psychedelics, or producing no HTR at all. These conflicting results may be due to rapid metabolism of DMT and/or other peculiarities of DMT in different species. Besides the HTR, DMT also substitutes for LSD and DOM in rodent drug discrimination tests.
DMT has been found to be a psychoplastogen, a compound capable of promoting rapid and sustained neuroplasticity that may have wide-ranging therapeutic benefit.
The cryo-EM structures of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor with DMT, as well as with various other psychedelics and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists, have been solved and published by Bryan L. Roth and colleagues.

### Pharmacokinetics

Closely coextending with peak psychedelic effects, the mean time to reach peak concentration (Tmax) has been determined to be 10–15 minutes in whole blood after IM injection, and 2 minutes in plasma after IV administration. The half life after IV injection is 9–12 minutes. When taken orally mixed in an ayahuasca decoction or in freeze-dried ayahuasca gel caps, DMT Tmax is considerably delayed to 107.59 ± 32.5 minutes, and 90–120 minutes, respectively.
DMT peak level concentrations (Cmax) measured in the blood after intramuscular (IM) injection (0.7 mg/kg, n = 11) and in plasma following intravenous (IV) administration (0.4 mg/kg, n = 10) of fully psychedelic doses are in the range of around 14 to 154 μg/L and 32 to 204 μg/L, respectively. The corresponding molar concentrations of DMT are therefore in the range of 0.074–0.818 μmol/L in whole blood and 0.170–1.08 μmol in plasma. However, several studies have described active transport and accumulation of DMT into rat and dog brains following peripheral administration. Similar active transport and accumulation processes likely occur in human brains and may concentrate DMT in brain by several-fold or more (relatively to blood), resulting in local concentrations in the micromolar or higher range. Such concentrations would be commensurate with serotonin brain tissue concentrations, which have been consistently determined to be in the 1.5–4 μmol/L range.
DMT easily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Studies on the llipophilicity of DMT have been contradictory – most studies find DMT to be either lipophilic or slightly lipophilic, but a 2023 study found it to be lipophobic.
DMT is primarily metabolized by monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) into indole-3-acetic acid and to a much lesser extent in the liver by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. When taken orally it is metabolized by MAO-A in the liver and gut, and is thus not orally bioavailable unless a monoamine oxidase inhibitor is taken (as is naturally found in the ayahuasca brew). When taken intravenously, DMT is primarily metabolized MAO-A in the circulatory system and brain. When smoked, a more substantial fraction (possibly as high as 10–20%) is metabolized in the liver by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19.
Detailed pharmacokinetic analyses for inhaling or vaporizing DMT appear to be lacking.

## Chemistry

### Appearance and form

DMT is commonly handled and stored as a hemifumarate, as other DMT acid salts are extremely hygroscopic and will not readily crystallize. Its freebase form, although less stable than DMT hemifumarate, is favored by recreational users choosing to vaporize the chemical as it has a lower boiling point.
DMT is a lipophilic compound, with an experimental log P of 2.57.

### Laboratory synthesis

The chemical synthesis of DMT has been described. It can be synthesized through several possible pathways from different starting materials. The two most commonly encountered synthetic routes are through the reaction of indole with oxalyl chloride followed by reaction with dimethylamine and reduction of the carbonyl functionalities with lithium aluminium hydride to form DMT. The second commonly encountered route is through the N,N-dimethylation of tryptamine using formaldehyde followed by reduction with sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride. Sodium borohydride can be used but requires a larger excess of reagents and lower temperatures due to it having a higher selectivity for carbonyl groups as opposed to imines. Procedures using sodium cyanoborohydride and sodium triacetoxyborohydride (presumably created in situ from cyanoborohydride though this may not be the case due to the presence of water or methanol) also result in the creation of cyanated tryptamine and beta-carboline byproducts of unknown toxicity while using sodium borohydride in absence of acid does not. Bufotenine, a plant extract, can also be synthesized into DMT.
Alternatively, an excess of methyl iodide or methyl p-toluenesulfonate and sodium carbonate can be used to over-methylate tryptamine, resulting in the creation of a quaternary ammonium salt, which is then dequaternized (demethylated) in ethanolamine to yield DMT. The same two-step procedure is used to synthesize other N,N-dimethylated compounds, such as 5-MeO-DMT.

### Clandestine manufacture

In a clandestine setting, DMT is not typically synthesized due to the lack of availability of the starting materials, namely tryptamine and oxalyl chloride. Instead, it is more often extracted from plant-sources using a nonpolar hydrocarbon solvent such as naphtha or heptane, and a base such as sodium hydroxide.
Alternatively, an acid-base extraction is sometimes used instead.
A variety of plants contain DMT at sufficient levels for being viable sources, but specific plants such as Mimosa tenuiflora, Acacia acuminata, and Acacia confusa are most often used.
The chemicals involved in the extraction are commonly available. The plant-material may be illegal to procure in some countries. The end-product (DMT) is illegal in most countries.

### Detection in body fluids

DMT may be measured in blood, plasma or urine using chromatographic techniques as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. In general, blood or plasma DMT levels in recreational users of the drug are in the 10–30 μg/L range during the first several hours post-ingestion. Less than 0.1% of an oral dose is eliminated unchanged in the 24-hour urine of humans.

#### Indolethylamine N-methyltransferase (INMT)

Before techniques of molecular biology were used to localize indolethylamine N-methyltransferase (INMT), characterization and localization went on a par: samples of the biological material where INMT is hypothesized to be active are subject to enzyme assay. Those enzyme assays are performed either with a radiolabeled methyl donor like (14C-CH3)SAM to which known amounts of unlabeled substrates like tryptamine are added or with addition of a radiolabeled substrate like (14C)NMT to demonstrate in vivo formation. As qualitative determination of the radioactively tagged product of the enzymatic reaction is sufficient to characterize INMT existence and activity (or lack of), analytical methods used in INMT assays are not required to be as sensitive as those needed to directly detect and quantify the minute amounts of endogenously formed DMT. The essentially qualitative method thin layer chromatography (TLC) was thus used in a vast majority of studies. Also, robust evidence that INMT can catalyze transmethylation of tryptamine into NMT and DMT could be provided with reverse isotope dilution analysis coupled to mass spectrometry for rabbit and human lung during the early 1970s.
Selectivity rather than sensitivity proved to be a challenge for some TLC methods with the discovery in 1974-1975 that incubating rat blood cells or brain tissue with (14C-CH3)SAM and NMT as substrate mostly yields tetrahydro-β-carboline derivatives, and negligible amounts of DMT in brain tissue. It is indeed simultaneously realized that the TLC methods used thus far in almost all published studies on INMT and DMT biosynthesis are incapable to resolve DMT from those tetrahydro-β-carbolines. These findings are a blow for all previous claims of evidence of INMT activity and DMT biosynthesis in avian and mammalian brain, including in vivo, as they all relied upon use of the problematic TLC methods: their validity is doubted in replication studies that make use of improved TLC methods, and fail to evidence DMT-producing INMT activity in rat and human brain tissues. Published in 1978, the last study attempting to evidence in vivo INMT activity and DMT production in brain (rat) with TLC methods finds biotransformation of radiolabeled tryptamine into DMT to be real but "insignificant". Capability of the method used in this latter study to resolve DMT from tetrahydro-β-carbolines is questioned later.
To localize INMT, a qualitative leap is accomplished with use of modern techniques of molecular biology, and of immunohistochemistry. In humans, a gene encoding INMT is determined to be located on chromosome 7. Northern blot analyses reveal INMT messenger RNA (mRNA) to be highly expressed in rabbit lung, and in human thyroid, adrenal gland, and lung. Intermediate levels of expression are found in human heart, skeletal muscle, trachea, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, testis, prostate, placenta, lymph node, and spinal cord. Low to very low levels of expression are noted in rabbit brain, and human thymus, liver, spleen, kidney, colon, ovary, and bone marrow. INMT mRNA expression is absent in human peripheral blood leukocytes, whole brain, and in tissue from seven specific brain regions (thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, amygdala, substantia nigra, and corpus callosum). Immunohistochemistry showed INMT to be present in large amounts in glandular epithelial cells of small and large intestines. In 2011, immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of INMT in primate nervous tissue including retina, spinal cord motor neurons, and pineal gland. A 2020 study using in-situ hybridization, a far more accurate tool than the northern blot analysis, found mRNA coding for INMT expressed in the human cerebral cortex, choroid plexus, and pineal gland.

### Analogues and derivatives

Numerous analogues and derivatives of DMT are known. Some examples include tryptamine (T), N-methyltryptamine (NMT), serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT), psilocin (4-HO-DMT), psilocybin (4-PO-DMT), 4-AcO-DMT (psilacetin), 4-PrO-DMT, bufotenin (5-HO-DMT or N,N-dimethylserotonin), and 5-MeO-DMT (mebufotenin; N,N,O-trimethylserotonin). Some further examples include methylethyltryptamine (MET), diethyltryptamine (DET), methylpropyltryptamine (MPT), dipropyltryptamine (DPT), methylisopropyltryptamine (MiPT), diisopropyltryptamine (DiPT), methylallyltryptamine (MALT), diallyltryptamine (DALT), and pyr-T (N,N-tetramethylenetryptamine) and their derivatives.
Some lesser-known DMT derivatives include lespedamine (1-MeO-DMT), 2-methyl-DMT, 4-MeO-DMT, 4-fluoro-DMT, 5-EtO-DMT, 5-TFMO-DMT, 5-methyl-DMT, 5-ethyl-DMT, 5-TFM-DMT, 5-fluoro-DMT, 5-chloro-DMT, 5-bromo-DMT, 6-fluoro-DMT, 5,6-dibromo-DMT, 4,5-MDO-DMT, 4,5-DHP-DMT, 5,6-MDO-DMT, 5-MeS-DMT, 6-HO-DMT, 6-MeO-DMT, 7-MeO-DMT, NBoc-DMT (NB-DMT), α,N,N-TMT (α-Me-DMT), and α,N,N,O-TeMS (5-MeO-α-Me-DMT).
Cyclized tryptamines containing DMT in their chemical structures include ibogalogs like ibogainalog and tabernanthalog; iboga alkaloids like ibogaine and noribogaine; lysergamides like ergine (LSA) and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); and partial ergolines and lysergamides like N-DEAOP-NMT, 10,11-seco-LSD, RU-28306, RU-28251, Bay R 1531, and NDTDI (8,10-seco-LSD), among others. β-Carbolines and harmala alkaloids like harmine and harmaline contain DMT's close analogue NMT embedded in their structures. Triptans like sumatriptan, rizatriptan, eletriptan, almotriptan, frovatriptan, and zolmitriptan, which are antimigraine agents, all contain DMT in their structures. Similarly, the pertine antipsychotics including alpertine, milipertine, oxypertine, and solypertine are DMT derivatives.
Bioisosteres of DMT in which the indole ring system has been replaced with a different ring system include isoDMT (an isoindole or isotryptamine), 2ZEDMA (an indolizine), and C-DMT (an indene), among others. The homologues of DMT in which the alkyl side chain has been shortened or lengthened by one carbon atom are gramine and dimethylhomotryptamine (DMHT), respectively. Further-extended homologues are also known.
Many of DMT's analogues and derivatives are serotonin receptor modulators and/or serotonergic psychedelics similarly to DMT itself.

## Natural occurrence

### Evidence in mammals

Publishing in Science in 1961, Julius Axelrod found an N-methyltransferase enzyme capable of mediating biotransformation of tryptamine into DMT in a rabbit's lung. This finding initiated a still ongoing scientific interest in endogenous DMT production in humans and other mammals. From then on, two major complementary lines of evidence have been investigated: Localization and further characterization of the N-methyltransferase enzyme, and analytical studies looking for endogenously-produced DMT in body fluids and tissues.
In 2013, researchers reported DMT in the pineal gland microdialysate of rodents.
A study published in 2014 reported the biosynthesis of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in the human melanoma cell line SK-Mel-147 including details on its metabolism by peroxidases.
It is assumed that more than half of the amount of DMT produced by the acidophilic cells of the pineal gland is secreted before and during death, the amount being 2.5–3.4 mg/kg. Contrarily, this claim by Strassman has been criticized by David Nichols who notes that DMT does not appear to be produced in any meaningful amount by the pineal gland. Removal or calcification of the pineal gland does not induce any of the symptoms caused by removal of DMT. The symptoms presented are consistent solely with reduction in melatonin, which is the pineal gland's known function. Nichols instead suggests that dynorphin and other endorphins are responsible for the reported euphoria experienced by patients during a near-death experience.
In 2014, researchers demonstrated the immunomodulatory potential of DMT and 5-MeO-DMT through the Sigma-1 receptor of human immune cells. This immunomodulatory activity may contribute to significant anti-inflammatory effects and tissue regeneration.

#### Endogenous DMT

N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a psychedelic compound identified endogenously in mammals, is biosynthesized by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) and indolethylamine-N-methyltransferase (INMT). Studies have investigated brain expression of INMT transcript in rats and humans, coexpression of INMT and AADC mRNA in rat brain and periphery, and brain concentrations of DMT in rats. INMT transcripts were identified in the cerebral cortex, pineal gland, and choroid plexus of both rats and humans via in situ hybridization. Notably, INMT mRNA was colocalized with AADC transcript in rat brain tissues, in contrast to rat peripheral tissues where there existed little overlapping expression of INMT with AADC transcripts. Additionally, extracellular concentrations of DMT in the cerebral cortex of normal behaving rats, with or without the pineal gland, were similar to those of canonical monoamine neurotransmitters including serotonin. A significant increase of DMT levels in the rat visual cortex was observed following induction of experimental cardiac arrest, a finding independent of an intact pineal gland. These results show for the first time that the rat brain is capable of synthesizing and releasing DMT at concentrations comparable to known monoamine neurotransmitters and raise the possibility that this phenomenon may occur similarly in human brains.
The first claimed detection of endogenous DMT in mammals was published in June 1965: German researchers F. Franzen and H. Gross report to have evidenced and quantified DMT, along with its structural analog bufotenin (5-HO-DMT), in human blood and urine. In an article published four months later, the method used in their study was strongly criticized, and the credibility of their results challenged.
Few of the analytical methods used prior to 2001 to measure levels of endogenously formed DMT had enough sensitivity and selectivity to produce reliable results. Gas chromatography, preferably coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), is considered a minimum requirement. A study published in 2005 implements the most sensitive and selective method ever used to measure endogenous DMT: liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization (LC-ESI-MS/MS) allows for reaching limits of detection (LODs) 12 to 200 fold lower than those attained by the best methods employed in the 1970s. The data summarized in the table below are from studies conforming to the abovementioned requirements (abbreviations used: CSF = cerebrospinal fluid; LOD = limit of detection; n = number of samples; ng/L and ng/kg = nanograms (10−9 g) per litre, and nanograms per kilogram, respectively):

A 2013 study found DMT in microdialysate obtained from a rat's pineal gland, providing evidence of endogenous DMT in the mammalian brain. In 2019, experiments showed that the rat brain is capable of synthesizing and releasing DMT. These results raise the possibility that this phenomenon may occur similarly in human brains.
Quantities of dimethyltryptamine and O-methylbufotenin were found present in the cerebrospinal fluid of humans in a 1978 psychiatric study.

### Biosynthesis

Dimethyltryptamine is an indole alkaloid derived from the shikimate pathway. Its biosynthesis is relatively simple and summarized in the adjacent picture. In plants, the parent amino acid L-tryptophan is produced endogenously where in animals L-tryptophan is an essential amino acid coming from diet. No matter the source of L-tryptophan, the biosynthesis begins with its decarboxylation by an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme (step 1). The resulting decarboxylated tryptophan analogue is tryptamine. Tryptamine then undergoes a transmethylation (step 2): the enzyme indolethylamine-N-methyltransferase (INMT) catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), via nucleophilic attack, to tryptamine. This reaction transforms SAM into S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and gives the intermediate product N-methyltryptamine (NMT). NMT is in turn transmethylated by the same process (step 3) to form the end product N,N-dimethyltryptamine. Tryptamine transmethylation is regulated by two products of the reaction: SAH, and DMT were shown ex vivo to be among the most potent inhibitors of rabbit INMT activity.
This transmethylation mechanism has been repeatedly and consistently proven by radiolabeling of SAM methyl group with carbon-14 ((14C-CH3)SAM).

## History

DMT derived from plant-based sources has been used as an entheogen in South America for thousands of years.
DMT was first synthesized in 1931 by Canadian chemist Richard Helmuth Fredrick Manske. In general, its discovery as a natural product is credited to Brazilian chemist and microbiologist Oswaldo Gonçalves de Lima, who isolated an alkaloid he named nigerina (nigerine) from the root bark of Mimosa tenuiflora in 1946. However, in a careful review of the case Jonathan Ott shows that the empirical formula for nigerine determined by Gonçalves de Lima, which notably contains an atom of oxygen, can match only a partial, "impure" or "contaminated" form of DMT. It was only in 1959, when Gonçalves de Lima provided American chemists a sample of Mimosa tenuiflora roots, that DMT was unequivocally identified in this plant material. Less ambiguous is the case of isolation and formal identification of DMT in 1955 in seeds and pods of Anadenanthera peregrina by a team of American chemists led by Evan Horning (1916-1993). Since 1955, DMT has been found in a number of organisms: in at least fifty plant species belonging to ten families, and in at least four animal species, including one gorgonian and three mammalian species (including humans).
In terms of a scientific understanding, the hallucinogenic effects of DMT were not uncovered until 1956 by Hungarian chemist and psychiatrist Stephen Szára. Szára, who later worked for the United States National Institutes of Health, researched DMT after his order to acquire LSD from the Swiss company Sandoz Laboratories was rejected on the grounds that the powerful psychotropic could be dangerous in the hands of a communist country. In his paper Dimethyltryptamin: Its Metabolism in Man; the Relation of its Psychotic Effect to the Serotonin Metabolism, Szara employed synthetic DMT, synthesized by the Speeter–Anthony route, which was then administered to 20 volunteers by intramuscular injection. Urine samples were collected from these volunteers for the identification of DMT metabolites. This is considered to be the link between the chemical structure of DMT and its cultural consumption as a psychoactive and religious sacrament.
Another historical milestone was the discovery of DMT in plants frequently used by Amazonian natives as additive to the vine Banisteriopsis caapi to make ayahuasca decoctions. In 1957, American chemists Francis Hochstein and Anita Paradies identified DMT in an "aqueous extract" of leaves of a plant they named Prestonia amazonicum [sic] and described as "commonly mixed" with B. caapi. The lack of a proper botanical identification of Prestonia amazonica in this study led American ethnobotanist Richard Evans Schultes (1915–2001) and other scientists to raise serious doubts about the claimed plant identity. The mistake likely led the writer William Burroughs to regard the DMT he experimented with in Tangier in 1961 as "Prestonia". Better evidence was produced in 1965 by French pharmacologist Jacques Poisson, who isolated DMT as a sole alkaloid from leaves, provided and used by Aguaruna Indians, identified as having come from the vine Diplopterys cabrerana (then known as Banisteriopsis rusbyana). Published in 1970, the first identification of DMT in the plant Psychotria viridis, another common additive of ayahuasca, was made by a team of American researchers led by pharmacologist Ara der Marderosian. Not only did they detect DMT in leaves of P. viridis obtained from Kaxinawá indigenous people, but they were also the first to identify it in a sample of an ayahuasca decoction, prepared by the same indigenous people.
In the 1960s, DMT was known as a "businessman's trip" in the United States because of its very rapid onset and short duration when smoked.

## Society and culture

### Popular culture

In the 2022 Australian film Everything in Between, the lead character smokes what is implied to be DMT in the opening sequence, which is followed by hallucination-like visual effects and an altered state of consciousness.

### Black market

Electronic cigarette cartridges or vape pens filled with DMT started to be sold on the black market by 2018.
Akasha Song previously manufactured and sold DMT on the dark web and is said to have been the largest DMT producer and seller in history.

### Legal status

#### International law

Internationally, DMT is illegal to possess without authorisation, exemption or license, but ayahuasca and DMT brews and preparations are lawful. DMT is controlled by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances at the international level. The Convention makes it illegal to possess, buy, purchase, sell, to retail and to dispense without a licence.

#### By continent and country

In some countries, ayahuasca is a forbidden or controlled or regulated substance, while in other countries it is not a controlled substance or its production, consumption, and sale, is allowed to various degrees.

##### Asia

Israel - DMT is an illegal substance; production, trade, and possession are prosecuted as crimes.
India - DMT is illegal to produce, transport, trade in, or possess with a minimum prison or jail punishment of ten years.

##### Europe

Belgium - DMT cannot be possessed, sold, purchased or imported. Usage is not specifically prohibited, but since usage implies possession one could be prosecuted that way.
France - DMT, along with most of its plant-sources, is classified as a stupéfiant (narcotic).
Germany - DMT is prohibited as a class I drug.
Ireland - DMT is an illegal Schedule 1 drug under the Misuse of Drugs Acts. An attempt in 2014 by a member of the Santo Daime church to gain a religious exemption to import the drug failed.
Latvia - DMT is prohibited as a Schedule I drug.
Netherlands - The drug is banned as it is classified as a List 1 Drug per the Opium Law. Production, trade and possession of DMT are prohibited.
Serbia - DMT, along with stereoisomers and salts is classified as List 4 (Psychotropic substances) substance according to Act on Control of Psychoactive Substances.
Sweden - DMT is considered a Schedule 1 drug. The Swedish supreme court concluded in 2018 that possession of processed plant material containing a significant amount of DMT is illegal. However, possession of unprocessed such plant material was ruled legal.
United Kingdom - DMT is classified as a Class A drug.

##### North-America

Canada - DMT is classified as a Schedule III drug under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, but is legal for religious groups to use. In 2017 the Santo Daime Church Céu do Montréal received religious exemption to use ayahuasca as a sacrament in their rituals.
United States - DMT is classified in the United States as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. In 2019, it was decriminalized, along with other naturally derived psychedelics, in the city of Oakland after a campaign by Decriminalize Nature.

##### Other

Russia - Classified as a Schedule I narcotic, including its derivatives (see sumatriptan and zolmitriptan).

##### Oceania

New Zealand - DMT is classified as a Class A drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975.
Australia - DMT is listed as a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 drug is outlined in the Poisons Act 1964 as "Substances which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale, or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of the CEO". Between 2011 and 2012, the Australian federal government was considering changes to the Australian Criminal Code that would classify any plants containing any amount of DMT as "controlled plants". DMT itself was already controlled under current laws. The proposed changes included other similar blanket bans for other substances, such as a ban on any and all plants containing mescaline or ephedrine. The proposal was not pursued after political embarrassment on realisation that this would make the official floral emblem of Australia, Acacia pycnantha (golden wattle), illegal. The Therapeutic Goods Administration and federal authority had considered a motion to ban the same, but this was withdrawn in May 2012 (as DMT may still hold potential entheogenic value to native and/or religious people). Under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1981 6.0g (3/16oz) of DMT is considered enough to determine a court of trial and 2.0g (1/16oz) is considered intent to sell and supply.
In December 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court lifted a stay allowing the Brazil-based União do Vegetal church to use a decoction containing DMT in their Christmas services that year. This decoction is a tea made from boiled leaves and vines, known as hoasca within the UDV, and ayahuasca in different cultures. In Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal, the Supreme Court heard arguments on November 1, 2005, and unanimously ruled in February 2006 that the U.S. federal government must allow the UDV to import and consume the tea for religious ceremonies under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
Also suing under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, three Santo Daime churches filed suit in federal court to gain legal status to import DMT-containing ayahuasca tea in 2008. The U.S. District Court in Oregon ruled in Church of the Holy Light of the Queen v. Mukasey (615 F.Supp.2d 1210) ruled that the religious group could import, distribute, and brew ayahuasca. A matter of religious freedom protected by the religious freedom law, the court issued a permanent injunction barring the government from prohibiting or penalizing the sacramental use of the religious drink.

## Research

### Depression

Short-acting psychedelics like DMT and 5-MeO-DMT show rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depression, potentially offering a more scalable alternative to psilocybin, though larger controlled trials are needed to confirm efficacy.
A recent Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antidepressant effects of SPL026, an intravenous formulation of DMT fumarate, in both healthy volunteers and patients with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder, using randomized, placebo-controlled and open-label dosing protocols. It found that inhaled 5-MeO-DMT (GH001) was well tolerated and produced rapid antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depression, with individualized dosing showing the highest remission rates.
A Phase 1 open-label study assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of intravenous SPL026 alone or combined with SSRIs in patients with major depressive disorder whose symptoms were not fully relieved by SSRIs.
In a phase 2a open-label trial, inhaled DMT produced rapid, well-tolerated, and sustained antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression, showing high response and remission rates within 7 days and lasting up to 3 months.
A single-day, open-label trial found that vaporized DMT produced rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depression, with up to 50% of participants maintaining remission one month post-dose.

### Endogenous role

DMT exists naturally in humans and other animals; it may play significant roles in mammalian physiology—potentially as a neurotransmitter, hormone, and immunomodulator—despite longstanding skepticism based on outdated or flawed evidence.
