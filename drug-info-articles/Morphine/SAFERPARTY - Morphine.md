## Effects
Due to its strong analgesic, antitussive and psychotropic properties, morphine is used to treat severe pain in emergency and palliative care.
Due to its depressant and sedative effect, the active substance is also misused as a euphoric intoxicant. In the context of opioid agonist therapy, morphine is used as a substitute for opiate/heroin addiction.

## Dosage
When consuming for the first time, low doses should be used, as the risk of respiratory arrest is increased.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Gastrointestinal complaints such as constipation are common side effects after taking opiates. Nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, lack of appetite, abdominal pain, sweating, skin rashes, itching, dizziness, headaches and fatigue are other common complaints. On the psychological level, confusion, nightmares and hallucinations may occur. Rather rarely, there is a drop in blood pressure, breathing difficulties and allergic reactions.
Overdoses with morphine are life-threatening, as the substance has a strong respiratory depressant effect (worsening breathing) even in low doses, which can lead to respiratory arrest and coma. Oral consumption of 0.3 - 1.5 g and intravenous consumption of 100 mg can lead to a fatal overdose. In opioid addicts, the lethal dose can be significantly higher. An overdose is treated by taking naloxone, an opioid antagonist.

### Long-term Risks
The consumption of morphine can lead to physical and psychological dependence after only a short time. Tolerance builds up quickly, which is why higher and higher doses have to be consumed. Strong withdrawal symptoms such as restlessness, irritability, depression, insomnia, sweating, cold shivers, vomiting, diarrhoea and painful cramps may occur. Like all opiates, morphine can lead to chronic constipation.

## Safer Use
- Opioids are highly effective drugs that should only be used for a limited time and at best under medical supervision.
- Start with a low dose and wait for the effect and tolerance before adding more. Do not exceed the maximum daily dose.
- If you inject opioids, dose even more carefully, as the range between desired effect (rush) and dangerous overdose is even more difficult to assess. Avoid injecting fentanyl; the risk of overdose is particularly high. Always use new (clean and sterile) injection material! Never exchange syringes, filters, water, disinfection swabs to avoid transmission of hepatitis and HIV.
- Do not rely on dosage information from colleagues who regularly use opioids. Due to habituation or dependence, their doses are much higher and can be fatal for new users.
- Take longer breaks (at least several days) between consumption.
- After a period of abstinence, take a much lower dose! The usual dose before the abstinence phase can otherwise quickly have life-threatening consequences.
- The simultaneous consumption of depressant substances such as alcohol, ketamine, GHB/GBL, nitrous oxide, benzodiazepines and/or other opioids is dangerous as there is an increased risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. The risk of suffocation is high!
- Refrain from citrus fruits (especially grapefruit) before or during consumption. The combination can lead to an increase in the effect of the opiate and/or to respiratory depression.
