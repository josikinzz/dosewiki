## Subjective Experience

Noopept was developed by a Russian pharmaceutical company in the 1970s, and is a
prescription drug in that country.

In recent years it has emerged as one of the most commonly used drugs in this class.
Its profile and popularity has been such that it has repeatedly attracted the attention
of the mainstream media.

This experiment was, in fact, my first experience with a formally recognised
nootropic. Given again that I purposely refrain from ever taking the same chemical
on a regular basis, it was a one-off exercise, which is counter to the usual modus
operandi for this class of drug.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I take two 10mg pills
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:20 A light head tingle is now developing. There is no body-load or any
other physical effect.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
T +1:00 I am experiencing a low level buzz, but no blur. There is no euphoria
or significant mood shift, but my disposition is generally good. I simply feel
content, so if a mood-shift is in play at all, it is slightly positive. There is
certainly no anxiety.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T +4:00 I take my afternoon power-nap, and I am able to sleep normally. Note
as background that last night was a late night.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+5:00 I take another 10mg.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+6:00 It is easy to forget that I have consumed a chemical, but at the same
time, I am aware of its effects when I do actually think about it.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Subjectively I believe that am experiencing some mental clarity and focus, but
the accompanying buzz is extremely mild.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+7:00 At this point I swallow another 10mg pill, bringing the overall dose for
the day to 40mg.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
In one respect this feels like the opposite of alcohol, with which vision (along
with perception) tends to be hazy. Vision under the influence of this chemical
seems to be clearer than usual, and if the experience itself is focused upon, I
feel a certain strangeness, which is not unpleasant.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Also unlike post-alcohol consumption, I am also able to work well, with
lucidity and a clear head.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+8:00 I take a final 10mg, and continue to feel more or less as I have for the
last couple of hours.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
At 50mg my total intake over the last 8 hours has been a somewhat heavy, and
is not recommended. To some degree curiosity rather than compulsion has got
the better of me.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Do I have the slight hint of a headache? Perhaps I have, but it is mild, and it
passes.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
From here, I drift slowly back to normality, before retiring to bed.
\`\`\`
Noopept probably does more or less what is described in the script. There is a strange
background feel about it, with visible clarity, and there is at least the perception of a
positive effect on mental functionality.

This is not really a stimulant, sedative or psychedelic, in the traditional sense, but
there is a distinct experience in play, albeit a mild one.

Notwithstanding its subtle nature, I found noopept to be one of the more noticeable
chemicals in this class.

## Summary

A common nootropic often attributed with temporarily increasing intelligence, concentration, focus, and memory recall. Daily use is reported to create dependency with withdrawls reportedly causing negative cognitive effects and ability. The nootropic is often taken in combinations or 'stacks' with other nootropics.

## Classification
- **Categories:** research-chemical, nootropic

## Dosage

### Insufflated
- **Common:** 5-10mg
- **Light:** 2-5mg
- **Strong:** 10mg+

### Oral
- **Common:** 10mg
- **Light:** 5mg
- **Strong:** 10-20mg+

### Sublingual
- **Common:** 5-10mg
- **Light:** 2-5mg
- **Strong:** 10mg+

## Duration
- **Onset:** minutes
- **Duration:** 3-6 hours
- **After Effects:** 1-8 hours

## Additional Information
- **Avoid:** Due to noopept modulating AMPA and NMDA receptors, dissociative drugs such as ketamine will have diminished effects. The drug is reported to have unpredictable potentiating effects on drugs such as alcohol, cannabis, psychedelics, and stimulants. Caution is advised when mixing.

Omberacetam, also known as N-Phenylacetyl-l-prolylglycine ethyl ester, is promoted as a nootropic and is a prodrug of cyclic glycine-proline. Other names include the brand name Noopept (Russian: Ноопепт), developmental code GVS-111.
Its synthesis was first reported in 1996. It is orally available. As of 2017, its metabolism and elimination half-life in humans were not well understood.
It has been evaluated for neuroprotective effects in treating brain injuries and stroke.

## Pharmacology

One oft-cited study (originally published in Russian) conducted on rats, suggests that Noopept works via the "antioxidant effect, the anti-inflammatory action, and the ability to inhibit the neurotoxicity of excess calcium and glutamate, and to improve the blood rheology". Studies in rats suggest, Noopept is a prodrug of the endogenous dipeptide cycloprolylglycine. Cycloprolylglycine is a modulator of AMPA receptors and exerts neuroprotective effects dependent upon AMPA- and TrkB-Receptor activation. In cell culture, cycloprolylglycine increases brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).
Some studies suggest that the pharmacological properties of Noopept are derived from its action as an activator of Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1).

## Dosage

Noopept is frequently dosed at 10–30 mg per day. However, there is no solid evidence indicating that any dose of Noopept is optimal. Few human trials have ever been carried out on Noopept, and as one meta-analysis notes, animal studies have used doses ranging from 0.1 mg/kg bodyweight to 10 mg/kg bodyweight. Furthermore, no long-term studies have been done to evaluate the lasting effects of chronic use at any given dose; the longest human study lasted for 56 days.

## Legal status

Hungary: As of 25 August 2020, Noopept is added to the controlled psychoactive substances list, prohibiting production, sale, import, storage and use.
Russia: Noopept in Russia is a drug of medicine and is available without a prescription.
United Kingdom: Contrary to popular belief, omberacetam is not illegal to produce, supply, or import under the Psychoactive Substance Act in the UK, which came into effect on May 26, 2016 because it neither works as a CNS (central nervous system) depressant, nor as a CNS stimulant. However, sale and supply for human consumption are prohibited.
United States: The Food and Drug Administration has issued import alerts for imports of omberacetam, considering it an analog of piracetam. FDA considers such racetam-family substances Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) that require new drug applications and adequate labelling before being imported. Similarly, warnings have been issued for claims of medical and pharmacological effects. Despite these FDA enforcement actions, omberacetam is sold in over-the-counter supplements in the US, with some products formulated with dosages greater than pharmaceutical levels.
