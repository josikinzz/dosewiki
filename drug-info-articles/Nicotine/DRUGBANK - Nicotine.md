## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyrrolidinylpyridines. These are compounds containing a pyrrolidinylpyridine ring system, which consists of a pyrrolidine ring linked to a pyridine ring.

### Background

Nicotine is highly toxic alkaloid. It is the prototypical agonist at nicotinic cholinergic receptors where it dramatically stimulates neurons and ultimately blocks synaptic transmission. Nicotine is also important medically because of its presence in tobacco smoke.

### Indication

For the relief of nicotine withdrawal symptoms and as an aid to smoking cessation.

### Pharmacodynamics

Nicotine, the primary alkaloid in tobacco products binds stereo-selectively to nicotinic-cholinergic receptors on autonomic ganglia, the adrenal medulla, neuromuscular junctions and in the brain. Nicotine exerts two effects, a stimulant effect exerted at the locus ceruleus and a reward effect in the limbic system. Itranvenous administration of nicotine causes release of acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonine, vasopressin, beta-endorphin and ACTH. Nicotine is a highly addictive substance. Nicotine also induces peripheral vasoconstriction, tachycardia and elevated blood pressure. Nicotine inhalers and patches are used to treat smoking withdrawl syndrome. Nicotine is classified as a stimulant of autonomic ganglia.

### Mechanism of Action

Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-4
Agonist
Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-7
Agonist
Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit beta-2
Agonist

### Absorption

Absorption of nicotine through the buccal mucosa is relatively slow and the high and rapid rise followed by the decline in nicotine arterial plasma concentrations seen with cigarette smoking are not achieved with the inhaler. About 10% of absorbed nicotine is excreted unchanged in urine.

### Metabolism

Primarily hepatic, cotinine is the primary metabolite.

### Half-life

Cotinine has a half life of 15-20 hours, while nicotine has a half life of 1-3 hours

### Toxicity

Symptoms of overdose include nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, flushing, dizziness, disturbed hearing and vision, confusion, weakness, palpitations, altered respiration and hypotension. LD
50
= 24 mg/kg (orally in mice).

### Mechanism of action

Nicotine is a stimulant drug that acts as an agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These are ionotropic receptors composed up of five homomeric or heteromeric subunits. In the brain, nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on dopaminergic neurons in the cortico-limbic pathways. This causes the channel to open and allow conductance of multiple cations including sodium, calcium, and potassium. This leads to depolarization, which activates voltage-gated calcium channels and allows more calcium to enter the axon terminal. Calcium stimulates vesicle trafficking towards the plasma membrane and the release of dopamine into the synapse. Dopamine binding to its receptors is responsible the euphoric and addictive properties of nicotine.
Nicotine also binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla. Binding opens the ion channel allowing influx of sodium, causing depolarization of the cell, which activates voltage-gated calcium channels. Calcium triggers the release of epinephrine from intracellular vesicles into the bloodstream, which causes vasoconstriction, increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, and increased blood sugar.

### General Function

Transporter that mediates the transport of endogenous and microbial zwitterions and organic cations (PubMed:10215651, PubMed:15107849, PubMed:15795384, PubMed:16729965, PubMed:20601551, PubMed:22206629, PubMed:22569296, PubMed:29530864). Functions as a Na(+)-dependent and pH-dependent high affinity microbial symporter of potent food-derived antioxidant ergothioeine (PubMed:15795384, PubMed:29530864, PubMed:33124720). Transports one sodium ion with one ergothioeine molecule (By similarity). Involved in the absorption of ergothioneine from the luminal/apical side of the small intestine and renal tubular cells, and into non-parenchymal liver cells, thereby contributing to maintain steady-state ergothioneine level in the body (PubMed:20601551). Also mediates the bidirectional transport of acetycholine, although the exact transport mechanism has not been fully identified yet (PubMed:22206629). Most likely exports anti-inflammatory acetylcholine in non-neuronal tissues, thereby contributing to the non-neuronal cholinergic system (PubMed:22206629, PubMed:22569296). Displays a general physiological role linked to better survival by controlling inflammation and oxidative stress, which may be related to ergothioneine and acetycholine transports (PubMed:15795384, PubMed:22206629). May also function as a low-affinity Na(+)-dependent transporter of L-carnitine through the mitochondrial membrane, thereby maintaining intracellular carnitine homeostasis (PubMed:10215651, PubMed:15107849, PubMed:16729965). May contribute to regulate the transport of cationic compounds in testis across the blood-testis-barrier (PubMed:35307651)

### Specific Function
