## SYNTHESIS
A suspension of 4.2 g LAH in 160 mL anhydrous THF under He was stirred, cooled to 0 Â°C, and treated with 2.95 mL of 100% H2SO4 added dropwise. This was followed by the addition of 6.0 g of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-methallyloxyphenylacetonitrile dissolved in 10 mL anhydrous THF, at a slow rate with vigorous stirring. The reaction mixture was held at reflux on the steam bath for 0.5 h, brought back to room temperature, and the excess hydride destroyed with IPA. Sufficient 15% NaOH was added to convert the formed solids to a loose, granular texture, and the entire mixture filtered and washed with THF. The filtrate and washings were pooled, the solvent removed under vacuum, and the residue added to 500 mL dilute HCl. This solution was washed with 2Ã50 mL CH2Cl2, made basic with aqueous NaOH, and extracted with 3Ã75 mL CH2Cl2. The extracts were pooled, the solvent removed under vacuum, and the residual pale amber oil distilled at 120â130 Â°C at 0.3 mm/Hg to provide 1.5 g of a white oil. This was dissolved in 8.0 mL of IPA and neutralized with 25 drops of concentrated HCl. The addition of 40 mL of anhydrous Et2O with stirring produced, after a few moments delay, a spontaneous crystallization of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-methallyloxyphenethylamine hydrochloride (MAL) as fine white needles. After standing overnight these were removed by filtration, washed with an IPA/Et2O mixture, then with Et2O, and allowed to air dry to constant weight. The product weighed 1.1 g, and had a mp of 153â154 Â°C. Anal. (C14H22ClNO3) C,H.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 45 mg) âI am basically favorably impressed. I believe the initial discomfort would be alleviated by taking two 30 milligram doses separated by an hour.â

(with 45 mg) âMuch too much too much. There are shades of what might become amnesia. I am losing immediate contact. I will not repeat.â

(with 50 mg) âA good level. I found myself totally caught up in the visual theater. Although I had trouble sleeping, I would willingly repeat the experiment at the same level.â

(with 60 mg) âExtremely restless. Am very impressed with all the activity. But if I repeated it would be at a lower dose.â

(with 60 mg) âFriendly territory. There is much kaleidoscopic âneonâ colors. Eyes closed very active. Eyes open there is considerable visual distortions seen in melted wax. Faces are distorted (friendly) but the sinister is not far away.â

(with 65 mg) âCompletely involvedâgood psychedelic stateâvisual entertainment with alternation (i.e., depth and movement) at the retinal levelâdetail in watercolors. Later in the experience (the 8 hour point) easy childhood memory recall.â

(with 65 mg) âBeautiful. To a +2 by the 1st hr and continued climbing. Intense +3 within 2 hrs. Quite strong body. Diuretic. Fantasy, imagery, erotic. Way up, good connections between parts of self. Slight slowing of pulse in 7th to 8th hour. Excellent solid sleep with strong, clear, balancing dreams. But not until after 12 hrs.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
This base, MAL, lies as a hybrid of two other compounds, AL and CPM. It is an olefin (as is AL) which means that it has a place of unsaturation in its structure. And it is an isostere of CPM which means that the carbon atoms are all in the same location, but just the connecting electrons (called the chemical bonds) are in different places. Actually there is yet a third compound in this same picture, called PROPYNYL. And yet, although all of them have extremely close structural similarities, there are such great differences in action that one does not dare to generalize. CPM leads largely to fantasy, MAL largely to visual imagery, AL is twice as potent as either of these but it doesnât show either effect, and PROPYNYL is almost without any action at all.

Speaking of generalization, I am glad that there are always exceptions. Some years ago, I had a most difficult experience with a strain of marijuana that was known by the name of DRED. The only word that I can use to describe my response to it is to say that I felt I had been poisoned. From this I warned myself to beware (and to believe in) whatever common name a drug might have been given. Fortunately, MAL did not live up to its name (at least for me), although some of the experimental subjects might disagree!

One additional compound was suggested by these parallels. Each of these three drugs can be viewed as having a negative something hanging out a-ways from the molecular center. With AL and MAL, this is the olefin double bond. With CPM this is a very strained three-member ring. What about an oxygen? The reaction between homosyringonitrile and methoxyethyl chloride produced the precursor to such a product (3,5-dimethoxy-4-(2-methoxyethoxy)phenethylamine) but the yield was so bad that the project was abandoned. This same grouping has successfully been put into the 4-position of the sulfur-containing analog, and the result (2C-T-13) has proved to be quite a potent and interesting material. Maybe someday hang a sulfur atom out there at the end of that chain.

The name methallylescaline actually is completely unsound. There is no union of a methallyl with an escaline. What is really there is not an escaline at all, but rather a mescaline with a 2-propene attached to the methyl of the methoxy on the 4-position. There is no way of naming the thing in that manner, so the only logical solution is to take off the methyl entirely, and then put the methallyl on in its place. The name of this would then be 4-methylallyldesmethylmescaline. That would have received the abbreviation MAD which would have been even more difficult to deal with. MAL is preferable.

**4-Methallyloxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine** (also known as **methallylescaline** and **MAL** ) is a synthetic [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) chemical class. It is reported to produce [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) and [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) effects comparable to that of other [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) analogs (e.g. [allylescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Allylescaline) , [proscaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Proscaline) , and [escaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Escaline) ) when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) .

The effects of methallylescaline were first described by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) in his book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) : A Chemical Love Story. He lists the dosage range as 40mg to 60mg orally and describes the duration of action to be 8 - 12 hours. Anecdotal reports portray that methallylescaline bears the most similarity to mescaline, although higher dosages can produce a strong [body load](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Body_load) .

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of methallylescaline, and it has little history of human usage. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

Methallylescaline, or 4-methallyloxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is a substituted [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain. Methallylescaline contains two methoxy functional groups (CH 3 O-) which are attached to carbons R 3 and R 5 of the phenyl ring.

Methallylescaline is substituted at R 4 with a methallyloxy chain. This three carbon chain consists of a R 2 methyl substituted allyl group with a double bond on the terminal carbon. This chain is connected to the phenyl ring at R 4 through an ether (oxygen) bridge.

## Pharmacology

Methallylescaline likely acts as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . The [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from methallylescaline's efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptors. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, methallylescaline is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating. For example, when taken in any environment it will usually encourage physical activities such as running, walking, climbing or dancing. In comparison, other more commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) are generally sedating and relaxed.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of methallylescaline can be described as proportionally intense in comparison to its accompanying visual and cognitive effects. It is manifested in a number of forms including an intense soft, warm glow that grows over the body and is capable of becoming extremely physically [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) . This is most similar to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) and is consistently manifested throughout the experience. This is contrasted by an intensely pleasurable yet sharp, cold electric tingling sensation which moves up and down the body. This is most similar to [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) and is also consistently manifested throughout the trip. The final physical effect noticed throughout the experience is an intense energetic pins and needles sensation that manifests itself in the form of a continuously shifting and tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves. This is most similar to [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) and is not entirely consistent throughout the trip.
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)**
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - Relative to other psychedelics, methallylescaline has been noted for the bodily or physically euphoric aspect that is vaguely reminiscent of other [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) like [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) .
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Nausea is commonly reported when consumed in moderate to high doses and either passes instantly once the user has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Muscle cramp](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_cramp)** - This is uncommon, but is more likely to occur if one is malnourished, dehydrated, or engaged in strenuous activity.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - Feelings of enhanced tactile sensations are consistently present at moderate levels throughout most methallylescaline experiences. If [Level 8A geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) is reached, an intense sensation of suddenly becoming aware of and being able to feel every single nerve ending across a person's entire body all at once is consistently present.
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)** - A notable side effect of methallylescaline is the occurrence of urinary retention, where users may experience difficulty urinating despite a frequent or urgent urge to do so. This effect can result in discomfort and frustration, as the physical sensation of needing to urinate persists without successful relief. It tends to be more pronounced at higher doses and may continue for several hours after the peak effects. While not universally experienced, it can be a significant concern for some users, especially if they are prone to bladder discomfort or if the urge to urinate becomes overwhelming without being able to find relief. Urinary retention can be managed with alpha blockers such as tamsulosin, which relax the muscles and promote urination.
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning)** ### Visual effects

#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry encountered on methallylescaline can be described as similar in appearance to that of [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) or [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) in the sense that its geometry is structured in its organization as well as natural and organic in style. However, in terms of its bright color palette and sharp edges, it is also similar to that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) and [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) .
 
The geometry can be comprehensively described as:
 
- **[Organic in geometric style](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Organic_vs._synthetic)**
- **[Equally abstract and algorithmic in appearance](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Algorithmic_vs._abstract)**
- **[Intricate in complexity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Intricate_vs._simplistic)**
- **[Structured in its organization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Unstructured_vs._structured)**
- **[Fast in speed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Fast_vs._slow)**
- **[Smooth in motion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Smooth_vs._jittery)**
- **[Equally large and small in appearance](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Large_vs._small)** - It has a variable size that spontaneously changes between large and small in appearance.
- **[Multicoloured in scheme](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Multicoloured_vs._monotone)**
- **[Glossy in colour](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Flat_shading_vs._glossy_shading)**
- **[Sharp and angular in its corners](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Sharp_edges_vs._soft_edges)**
- **[Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Level_8A_vs._level_8B)** - While the geometry produced by mescaline has yet to be fully characterized, the geometry gives off certain attributes which are significantly more likely to result in states of [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) visual geometry over [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) at higher doses.
 
#### Hallucinatory states

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational methallylescaline use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because methallylescaline is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Methallylescaline is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of methallylescaline is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Methallylescaline presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of methallylescaline all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

## Legal status

- **Canada** : Methallylescaline is not listed under the *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act* , so it is technically not illegal. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Germany** : Methallylescaline is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of November 26, 2016. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person, placing it on the market and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not punishable. The legislator considers it possible that orders of methallylescaline are punishable as an incitement to place it on the market.
- **Switzerland** : Methallylescaline is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis E.
- **United Kingdom** : Methallylescaline is illegal to produce, supply, or import under the Psychoactive Substance Act, which came into effect on May 26th, 2016.
- **United States** : Methallylescaline is unscheduled in the United States, but may be considered an analogue of [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) under the Federal Analogue Act. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Methallylescaline (MAL), also known as 4-methylallyloxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine and scaline families related to mescaline. It is taken orally.
The drug acts as a serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. It is closely structurally related to mescaline and to other scalines like escaline and allylescaline.
Methallylescaline was first described by Alexander Shulgin in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved). It was encountered as a novel designer drug by 2013.

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists the dose range of methallylescaline as 40 to 65 mg and its duration as 12 to 16 hours. As such, its dose range is relatively narrow. Moreover, the drug has been reported to have an unusually steep dose–response curve, such that a small increase in dose can result in an unexpectedly large increase in effects. Methallylescaline has about 6 times the potency of mescaline, which has a much higher listed dose range of 200 to 400 mg. Its onset is within 1 hour and peak effects occur within 2 hours.
Shulgin has described methallylescaline as a "mixed bag" in terms of experience reports. Its effects have been reported to include closed-eye visuals, "visual theater", open-eye visuals including visual distortions, visual depth and movement effects, kaleidoscopic neon colors, watercolors, fantasy, mental imagery, feelings of unreality, easy childhood memory recall, self-connectedness, eroticism, initial discomfort, overload, feeling overwhelmed, shades of possible amnesia, loss of contact, extreme restlessness, trouble sleeping, and enhanced dreams. It was also reported to produce quite strong body effects, diuretic effects, and slightly reduced heart rate. Some found it unpleasant and said that they would not repeat the experience, whereas others were impressed by it, found it enjoyable, and called it "beautiful". Many expressed that the dose they tried was too strong for them and that a lower dose would be better. Methallylescaline has been described as having relatively more visual imagery than other scalines like cyclopropylmescaline and allylescaline.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Methallylescaline acts as a potent agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. It also interacts with certain other targets, such as the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor.

## Chemistry

Methallylescaline, also known as 4-methylallyloxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is a substituted phenethylamine and scaline. It is a synthetic derivative of mescaline (3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine) with a methallyloxy group instead of methoxy group at the 4 position.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of methallylescaline has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of methallylescaline include mescaline, escaline, allylescaline, and cyclopropylmescaline, among others.

## History

Methallylescaline was first described in the literature by Alexander Shulgin in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved). It was first tried by Shulgin in 1981 and its hallucinogenic effects were discovered by him in 1982. The drug has an entry in PiHKAL, but not in Shulgin's 2011 book The Shulgin Index, Volume One: Psychedelic Phenethylamines and Related Compounds. It was encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe by 2013. Methallylescaline's pharmacology was described by Matthias Liechti and Daniel Trachsel and colleagues in 2021.

## Society and culture

### Names

Alexander Shulgin described the name of methallylescaline (MAL) as "completely unsound". This was because there was no union of a methallyl group with escaline. Instead, methallylescaline is mescaline with a 2-propene group attached to the methyl of the methoxy group at the 4 position. However, Shulgin expressed that there is no way of naming the compound in that manner. The only corresponding proper name would be 4-methylallyldesmethylmescaline (MAD). However, Shulgin found the acronym MAD to be disagreeable and ultimately preferred MAL.

### Legal status

#### Sweden

Methallylescaline is illegal in Sweden as of 26 January 2016.

#### United States

Methallylescaline is not directly scheduled under the Controlled Substances Act. However, due to its structural similarities with mescaline, it could potentially be prosecuted under the Federal Analogue Act if sold for human consumption.
