The Manufacturing Technologies Association (MTA) is a British trade association based in London representing the manufacturing technologies industry. The MTA sits at the core of the engineering based manufacturing sector and as an association works to support its member companies.
The association's key activities include, representing engineering based manufacturing and supporting the advanced engineering sector through lobbying, media contact and networking. Providing relevant and specific industry intelligence. Encouraging talent through funding and support for workplace training and education initiatives in schools, colleges and universities. Delivering the UK's major exhibition focused on manufacturing technologies – MACH (owned and organised by the MTA) biennially.
Membership of the MTA is open to companies involved with the manufacturing technologies sector and end users of such technology.

## History

The original Machine Tools Trades Association (MTTA) was formed in 1919, becoming the Machine Tools Technologies Association. Since its formation the association has evolved into a trade body with a global support network, promoting internationally competitive trade in manufacturing technologies.
