Modern humans must learn how to relate to psychoactives 
 responsibly, treating them with respect and awareness, 
 working to minimize harms and maximize benefits, and 
 integrating use into a healthy, enjoyable, and productive life.

Ethylphenidate (EPH) is a stimulant, with similar effects to methylphenidate (Ritalin). At lower doses it has productivity-enhancing and attention-improving effects. At higher doses its euphoric effects increase. It can be taken nasally, orally, or rectally. 
 
 Dosages depend on the effects desired by the user. When taken for increased productivity, doses range from 5-75 mg (oral or insufflated). Dosages for euphoric recreational experiences are perhaps twice as high. For example, 40 mg ethylphenidate taken orally might be considered "strong" for someone using it in a professional work environment, while the same person might find 40 mg to be "light" if taken recreationally at a party and 80 mg or more required for a "strong" dose.
 
NOTES #
 
As of late 2016, ethylphenidate quality/purity appears to vary widely, complicating accurate dosage information. There are large variations reported between doses and corresponding effects. In online forums, people have commented extensively on what they perceive to be quality variations from batch to batch. Variations in experiences of purity or dosage can sometimes be attributed to physical tolerance, experiential familiarity, and difficult-to-track changes in bio-psychological factors. Small variations in expectation, diet, sleep cycle, and history of use can result in unexpectedly large differences in intensity and character of effects of a drug. Although unlikely, some have suggested this may be caused or exacerbated by ethylphenidate being synthesized as a racemic mixture; the proportional amounts of l-isomer and d-isomer might vary from batch to batch. 
 
 People report increasing side effects and nasal problems with higher and/or more frequent doses.
 
CAUTION & DISCLAIMER #
 
Every individual reacts differently to every chemical.

Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Ethylphenidate**
- REGULATED: No
- STATUS: Not Approved ForHuman Consumption
- SCHEDULE: Un-Scheduled
 
Ethylphenidate is not specifically scheduled in the United States. However, it is likely that it would be considered a controlled substance analogue (of methylphenidate, a Schedule II substance), in which case, sales for human consumption or possession with the intent to ingest could be prosecuted under the [Federal Analogue Act](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/analog/analog.shtml) .
 
U.S. STATE LAW #
 
Utah #
 
Ethylphenidate is a controlled substance in Utah, along with its "analogs, homologs, and synthetic equivalents". See [http://le.utah.gov/code/TITLE58/htm/58_37_000402.htm](http://le.utah.gov/code/TITLE58/htm/58_37_000402.htm) . (thanks J) (last updated Mar 17, 2014)
 If you have information about the legal status of this substance in any U.S. state, please [let us know.](mailto:submissions%40erowid.org?subject=legal status of . . .&body=Legal Info For: Ethylphenidate)
 
INTERNATIONAL LAW #
 
Canada #
 
Ethylphenidate is not listed/Scheduled under Canadian law and Canada has no analog law. (thanks gl, eg) (last updated Oct 13, 2014)
 
Germany (Deutschland) #
 
6-APB, 5-APB, Buphedrone, 3,4-Dimethylmethcathinone, Ethylphenidate, 3-Fluoromethcathinone, Pentedrone, and alpha-PVP became controlled in July, 2013. See [http://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/fileadmin/dateien/Downloads/B/Betaeubungsmittelgesetz/27_BtMAEndV.pdf](http://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/fileadmin/dateien/Downloads/B/Betaeubungsmittelgesetz/27_BtMAEndV.pdf) and [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/btmg_1981/index.html](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/btmg_1981/index.html) . (thanks jl) (last updated Jul 21 2013)
 
Norway #
 
Ethylphenidate is not specifically listed as controlled in Norway. The laws in Norway are complex, and there are two main areas of law that cover psychoactive drugs. There is the "Forskrift om narkotika" (=narcotics regulation), which mostly covers chemical compounds directly, and the "Forskrift om legemiddelklassifisering" (=regulations of medication classification), covering plants and herbs. Although the narcotics regulation covers "Salts, stereo isomers, esters and ethers of substances and groups of substances listed in the narcotics regulation, assuming the substances has or are believed to have psychoactive effects.", ethylphenidate does not appear to be covered by these rules. Ethylphenidate is a clear analog of methylphenidate, but Norway's laws do not make ethylphenidate controlled because it is similar in structure to the medicine methylphenidate. (thanks pah) (last updated Sep 28 2014)
 
Sweden #
 
Ethylphenidate is in Appendix 1, illegal for most purposes, as of 2012. [http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Forordning-19921554-om-kont_sfs-1992-1554/](http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Forordning-19921554-om-kont_sfs-1992-1554/) . (thanks r) (last updated Jun 21 2013)
 
United Kingdom (U.K., Britain, England, Scotland, Wales) #
 
In April, 2015, Ethylphenidate was placed under emergency control as "Temporary Class Drugs", making it illegal to sell or manufacture without licensure. Possession is not yet illegal. See [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/circular-0152015-temporary-control-of-5-methylphenidate-based-nps/circular-0152015-temporary-control-of-5-methylphenidate-based-nps](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/circular-0152015-temporary-control-of-5-methylphenidate-based-nps/circular-0152015-temporary-control-of-5-methylphenidate-based-nps) .
