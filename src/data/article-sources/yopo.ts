## Quick Reference
- **Binomial / Botanical Name:** Anadenanthera Peregrina
- **Street Names:** Yopo
- **Major Active Compound:** Bufotenin
- **Indigenous Source:** South America
- **Form:** Seeds
- **RoA:** Insufflated
- **Personal Rating On Shulgin Scale:** ++

## Subjective Experience

Yopo seeds are sometimes confused with cebil seeds, presumably because they look
similar, and are both generally insufflated. They are not the same, although in terms
of active chemical composition they both major with bufotenin with variable but only
trace (considered ineffective) amounts of DMT and 5-MeO-DMT.

I prepared them both in the same manner: I toasted half-a-dozen in a pan until they
snapped like popcorn. Removing the shells, I then pulverised the kernel. I sampled
this raw, and also, mixed it with some lime powder.

I had anticipated pain largely due to descriptions of authentic use: one member of
the tribe blows it forcibly up the nostril of a colleague via a long pipe, who in some
accounts, then rolls around on the ground in agony. Self administered, I found that it
did indeed hurt: a lot!

The headspace emerged within seconds, and simple CEVs quickly followed. There
was no significant complexity but they were there, and they were fluid. The downer
was that the experience faded within 5 minutes or so. The afterglow lingered for
some hours.

Undoubtedly, I have plenty more work to do with these seeds, assuming that I can
overcome the enduring memory of the nasal pain.

A NOTE ABOUT 5-MEO-DMT
Although the experience invoked by the stand alone version of 5-MeO-DMT is
nothing like that of yopo, I did dabble (unsuccessfully) with it whilst writing this
edition. At the appropriate doses this drug can catapult you into the realms of the
indescribable, and it has a significant following amongst some aficionados of the
psychedelic experience.

However, the Internet is awash with warnings relating to its dangers, and checking
my copy of TiHKAL, it is clear that even Shulgin endured some fearful episodes with
it. The following is not untypical of the ominous references I encountered:

\`\`\`
“5-MEO-DMT use is dangerous. This compound is described as 4- to 10-fold
more potent than DMT and it may also cause strong side effects. Research
suggests it causes extreme serotonin reuptake inhibition and serotonin
toxicity in combinations with MAO-A inhibitor is likely and potentially fatal.
Some users reported that this drug caused panic attacks and anxiety that
lasted up to a few weeks after use. ”
~ Puya Yazdi, MD (Reviewed by Ana Aleksic, MSc (Pharmacy), published on drugs.selfdecode.com
\`\`\`
On insufflation of 9mg I experienced a body presence and a strange intense
headspace, which distorted and held my thoughts almost in a form of stasis. There
were no visuals or hallucinations. I suspect that I chose the wrong dose and wrong
RoA. I should stress that 9mg is higher than that commonly cited for vaping.

On vaping I probably heated too quickly, vaped too little, and might have had some
residue left in the pipe from a previous experiment with DMT. If this sounds rushed
and shambolic it is probably because it was. Either way, I felt a distanced sort of
headspace, visual clarity and not much else. I should add in my defence that if I went
unduly low with the dose it was because I didn’t have a sitter in place.

It should also be noted that this is indeed significantly more potent than DMT (and
thus requires a much lower dose), and unlike DMT, 5-MeO-DMT is a ‘one shot deal’,
meaning that only one toke is required.

In the light of the warnings referred to above if you do choose to engage I would
suggest and recommend that you approach it with the utmost caution.

THE THREAT TO PSYCHEDELIC FROGS & TOADS
5-MeO-DMT is famously secreted by the Colorado River toad (also known as the
Sonoran Desert toad). Unfortunately, it has recently been brought to my attention
that this species is facing a number of pressures, including over-collection, primarily
for the extraction of secretions for use by psychonauts.

Although not specifically related to 5-MeO-DMT, I would also refer here to kambô
ceremonies, and similar threats to the waxy monkey frog (Phyllomedusa bicolour).

I would strongly urge that these issues are taken seriously. For these reasons I will
not be pursuing either of these avenues.

## Summary

Anadenanthera peregrina, also known as yopo, is a perennial tree native to the Caribbean and South America. It is an entheogen containing 5-MeO-DMT and DMT, and is used in healing ceremonies and rituals. The tree is also a source of dietary calcium.

Anadenanthera is a genus of South American trees in the Legume family, Fabaceae. The genus contains two species, A. colubrina and A. peregrina. These trees are known to the western world primarily as sources of the hallucinogenic snuffs vilca/cebil and yopo/cohoba.
A 2024 molecular marker study of few hundred specimens sampled across Brazil and lowland Bolivia supports a four-species hypothesis (A. colubrina (Vell.) Brenan, A. macrocarpa (Benth.) Brenan, A. peregrina (L.) Speg., and A. falcata (Benth.) Speg) for the Anadenanthera genus as opposed to a two-species, four-variety hypothesis.
The main active constituent of Anadenanthera is bufotenin.
