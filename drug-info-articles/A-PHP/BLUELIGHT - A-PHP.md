Does anyone have any experience with this compound that they could share with me? Seems to be very little information out there at the moment

Seems to me the cleanest (least side effects) of the series, as compared to mdpv or apvp. 


Vape- oil burner and torch. Have safely vaped from 8 mgs up to 45 mgs. There is no need to try the higher doses as there is too much vapor to inhale and it is a bit of a waste. Very pleasant euphoria, somewhat of a  rush (at least the first hit you take, or if addicted).


IV- Have gone up to 25 mgs with tolerance, and it fills my head with, first a happy twitch, followed by a twisted goofy grin. Happy for a while, but the euphoria fades, into residual stimulation. 


In my opinion this stuff is awesome. The more you redose the shorter the euphoria part is. But it doesnt seem to have the brutal drawn out comedown stage like it's predecessors (UNLESS YOU ABUSE IT). With abuse and too much redosing, comes all the symptoms of the stims in this class. Paranoia, anxiety, etc...


After your allergy test, start small no more than 5-10 mg and work your way up to happy dose for you. Don't be a dumbass because I'd like this stuff to be available for longer than two months (not likely).


PS: I am the lab rat, not the chemist. It was a quite fluffy white powder, and it was definitely active. Anyone with real knowledge of how this particular molecule might work would be great. I imagine its a dopamine/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, but beyond that I am clueless because there is not much info on it.

I was at the play The Book of Mormon the other night and stupidly just put out a pile while I was sitting on the hopper that could've been anywhere between 25-70mg, I'm honestly not sure as I was in a hurry. When I got back to my seat after hoovering it up my schnozz(I usually IV or plug)and got back to my seat I was up there pretty quick. 


My head had an odd tingle and my chest felt weird. I kept having this sensation of a cool breeze blowing over me and my muscles felt like they were on the verge of locking up but didn't. It reminded me very much of when you do a too large shot of MDPV. I was nervous which is rare for me for about 20min and then it passed. 


This incident seemed to make me more sensitive as I got mild hints of these effects when consuming smaller doses.


All in all I still enjoy this and is one of the better PV replacements.

Yeah man no problem. I normally didn't snort it, other than tiny allergy test. If putting some out for my girl (she didn't enjoy vaping it) I'd normally put down around 15-20 mgs and that would be a decent hit. 


30mg orally in a capsule though, was actually a pretty clear headed, long lasting, working stimulation. It made me actually enjoy and think about the intricacies, of slaving away in a concrete complex for the corrupt overbearing government. 


A friend of mine claims to actually get minor visual type stuff going on, I think it's mostly just a brightness of color hues though. I'll have more to report here soon, and hopefully others will as well.

After trying nasally a few times, it really burns like hell. And wanting more of it is bad news if all you're doing is snorting it. I'd say your best bet for ROA would be vaping or oral. Sniffin it gradually over the day eventually had me blowing a little bit of blood out my snhoz. 


I'd say duration seems to be 3-8 hours, depending on roa. If you redose too much, potential for a few hours of residual stimulation is certainly a possibility. But if you put it down early enough, and wait it out, the comedown really isn't too bad, makes me very sleepy anyway. 


The initial action seems to be almost warm, comfortable, dopamine euphoria, which gently fades into a fairly clean stimulation. 


Overdo it, and you'll get all the classic symptoms of too much PV family. Paranoid delusions and all. Physically uncomfortable and tight chest. But this seems to take a little longer to go down hill than similar chemicals. If you're not used to the crazy paranoia it can bring, it can be pretty freaky. You just have to realize it's all just your mind being way overstimulated and pushed too far. Just put the shit down, eat a benzo if you have one and try and ride it out. 


Pushing it too far for multiple days, will leave you EXTREMELY lethargic when you run out, even after getting some good rest.  


Just go gentle and it's very pleasant

I've done this IV a few times at low 10-15mg doses and its not too bad. Has that MDPV taste once the plungers pushed and theres a decent rush. Of course as we all Know it's still not the same as its predecessor.

My favorite IV dose after building tolerance seems to be about 30 mg. It can be overwhelming at first, but gives a  good, almost sedating rush. Only lasts a couple hours, but it is pleasant and pretty benign. 


Have gone up to 40 mg, and as you would expect, it was a bit much. Nothing I couldn't handle though. I slowly worked my way up and only did these higher doses because of the lack of negative effects. I would suggest starting at no more than 5-15 mg at first.

Just read another report today that concluded: it's a passable replacement for alpha-pvp, though lacking. Much like Mdpv-->A-PVP 


Sounds like the most promising area so far for all the apvp-refugees.

tamarinds really hasnt chimed in on this yet? its no apvp but vaporizing works well decent rush. I only vaped the two grams of pvp i ever got so i went straight to that with this one. In the words of a wise man load bulb, hit, repeat. Not the same but worth giving a shot. Not too cracked out feeling. I have a feeling i may be up all night now, last hit 45 mins ago, rush is gone, but lingering stimulation is still there. I didnt weigh anything just loaded maybe 20-30mgs in a pipe and hit away whenever i felt the need. 3-4 big rips in a row get my heart racing good, almost worrisome levels, but heartrate comes down quickly enough. Nice clean stimulation with your mind staying focused in reasonable doses, then turn into a porn watching fiend after a little bit more.

Will have some further trials tomorrow, but for now it seems to be a really good Stimulant! ROA was intranasal btw (and along with 4-FA and EPH this is the most caustic stuff i've had to date). Never ever will i try this rectally ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

it's just the cathinone class with a 2-thiophene in place of the benzene. Same relationship as MPA and methamphetamine chemically. I guess it will be nearly as strong, but nobody ever made this before now (most RCs come from a patent or paper in reality) and the only paper on this is:


'[Synthesis and preliminary study of the activity of thiophene analogues of pyrovalerone on the neuronal uptake of the monoamines](http://bitnest.ca/external.php?id=%257DbxUgY%255CC%251A%2507%2506wgz%2506%2506SCX%2500M%2540w%257Da%2510H%250A)'


And they had a methyl at the 3 position to copy pyrovalerone.

I'm finding it to be quite lacking indeed in comparison to good A-PVP... It's in the same neighborhood, but is very light, maybe this tan clumpy batch is just weak. Im going to clean some up hopefully this week.

Gave a-PHP another chance today, the slight brown batch of friendly lab. I must say im not impressed dosong mostly nasal (added some inositol made it less harsh, but even so not very nice, sublingual too but this material might even cause tissue damage there abcesses and whatnot. After earlier triels I decided to take 30mg insufflated (I'm not into vaping), slight dopamine euphoria, but not as clear an calm energy as pentedrone, got quite stimulated but more restless.. Later in the afternoon another 18mg

Not much happening besides stimulation and slight euphoria, feed pushy in a way but head is quite calm.


No desire to do more.


Anyway I find Pentedrone much more euphoric and less pumped up.. I was wondering is this a-PHP really similar to MDPV? Are there any materials similar to Pentedrone that doesnt have the paranoia and extreme binging such as Pentedrone (for me at least a-PHP goes back into the storage for when times maybe tough, but hey maybe you really need to vape this, but not for me this one.

I deleted the post i made about a-PHP some days ago, which is because i also did MDPV the days before (and so surely had some remains of it circulating trough my system) making my comment about this new compound mostly worthless, as i think.


As for now, the one and only thing i definitely know about a-PHP is, that everyone should not snort or plug it, simply because it's far worse and caustic than Ethylphenidate or 4-FA! Honestly and without the slightest exaggeration, it fuck'd up my nose so bad i honk'd blood for a full week. So, if you have this at home and want to give it a try, avoid snorting and rectal dosing if you don't wanna experience the same shit like me! If i try it again (and i'm unsure about that for now), it'll be orally, which i also tried, but as said above cannot say much about because of what i wrote above. Damn, really...this stuff is so damn caustic that i dunno if it's worth trying!

Yeah Thc, think your right... Not too nice smell that lingers in your nose, didn't have too many damage but this time i mixed it with inositol, which helped, but still not worth the trouble, the state of the material already outweighs some positive effects

Lol, I was aware of what the musical is about. Was it awesome? It has got rave reviews everywhere. I don't know if it even skewers Mormons as I've read about Mormons who went to the show and loved it!


Not to be completely off topic. I ordered 1g of A-PHP and 1g of A-PHPP, will report with results.

Honestly and without the slightest exaggeration, it fuck'd up my nose so bad i honk'd blood for a full week. So, if you have this at home and want to give it a try, avoid snorting and rectal dosing if you don't wanna experience the same shit like me! If i try it again (and i'm unsure about that for now), it'll be orally, which i also tried, but as said above cannot say much about because of what i wrote above. Damn, really...this stuff is so damn caustic that i dunno if it's worth trying!

Gah... Really wish I had read this sooner. It really is awful, my sinuses are messed up big time. Worse than with ethylphenidate. I'm pretty sure I'm going to get a sinus infection if I haven't already... Any tips for encouraging sinus recovery? Or for minimizing damage from snorting caustic compounds? I'm usually not the one to snort things, at least it's not my preferred route. Definitely not going to snort anything for a WHILE now, unless it's some kind of medicine -_-


As for plugging, wouldn't it be fine? I always got the impression that plugging caustic chems was generally tolerated.

Is A-PHPP the same chemical as PV8? This naming system is very confusing.

Well I got my 500mg of a-PHP


This shit is crazy.


Just as intense as a-PVP. I lay out 20-30mg on foil and go to town.


So similar to a-PVP I think what I have may be it. But its not, its a-PHP.


Very similar, very.


Combining with MDPPP yields very strange results. The weird headspace combined with the extreme high of a-PHP.


Very high uncontrollable redosing. Careful

@ Wintermute: I hope you recover soon, as for me it took up to a week and it was really bad. Never had messed up my poor Nose that bad, honestly! As for aiding recovery, i used Panthenol lotion and another one containing Minth,Thyme and Vaseline, but i think the latter one is not really needed since the Panthenol lotion did a great job. I also used a Saline Nasal Spray to humidify the deeper parts of the Nose.


As for plugging: even though many ppl think just because with this Route the sting is sometimes not as bad as when snorting more caustic compounds, it surely also does damage to the mucous membrane, leading to serious infections and the like, which you really don't wanna have especially in this region.


I really wouldn't plug a-PHP, not even once!

Let me just point out that if you go overboard with this, especially vaping, you will get paranoid and delusional. 


Not surprising considering the family this chem belongs in.


Window peaking, tip toeing, pretending and the hail mary hit (thinking police are outside the door and still taking a hit). I am definately over doing it here. 20-30mg hits every 20 minutes. Attempting to stop redosing as I write this...


And yet the rush is strong going

I did find the temptation to redose with this more so than with apvp. I could put apvp down after two good hits on a pipe, with this, it is always one more.

Someone seems to think that alpha-PHP is the same thing as alpha-PHpP, which is wrong. alpha-PHP is **not** PV-8, it is **not** alpha-PHpP. The substance called alpha-PHP is also known as PV-7. Compared to alpha-PHpP/PV-8, alpha-PHP has heptan replaced with hexane. 


Look at the difference in their formal names: 


alpha-PHpP -> 1-phenyl-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-*heptanone*


alpha-PHP -> 1-phenyl-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-*hexanone


*I hope that this is clear for now on. These substances is not the same thing. 


Anyhow, in the swedish forum Flashback, alpha-PHP is considered to being very good. A few of the members are comparing it to MDPV and also said it is better than so. They describe it as: "...like MDPV but without all the negative effects.". I don't know if it is so that swedes has lower expectations of new designer drugs and therefore think that this is so extremely good. Perhaps that is the answer to why so many new substances is loved here in Scandinavia. 


The thread can be seen here if for those who is familiar with the language:

They most certainly aren't the same things. A-PHPp, I tried today, and it is much much smoother with far less body loud than A-PHP. (I have both)

Absolutely, I could translate some of the most essential posts. I will look at it tonight or in the coming days.


By the way, if there is something with my language that is unclear or hard to understand I would appreciate if you all told me, so I will be aware of what I am doing wrong. I am from Sweden but tries to learn english better but does not always know if there is something that is not correct. :D

Oh and in my experience so far A-PHP<A-PHPP, much smoother, less body load.


Much less hypertension with the latter as well


124/93 pulse 94


But when I was first doing it the blood pressure was a bit better and the pulse 70. Not to shabby.

IMHO it is not very good it's corrosive, hurts the nose, mouth tissue feels raw after sublingual.. I've tried sublingual and insufflated 10/20/30mg doses.. anyway some tight stimulation/body load, hardly any euphoria Pentedrone which most of the mdpv fans find underwhelming wins this by a mile much more euphoria and subtle stimulation, not very focussed but this certainly isn't either.


 I don't get what all the fuzz is about and where the fun is with this compound. Am I doing something wrong?

Like 15 mg in a hit is good for no blood pressure rise and a smooth feeling on the A-PHPp ( PV8 ) stuff, it also doesn't cause a feeling of flushing/heat raising. The A-PHP does indeed make you hotter, cause more pronounced tachycardia and more body load and more intense anorectic effects. I could eat on the A-phpp, not on the A-PHP. It's also way more stimulating/insomnia inducing. Crazy thing is they look almost identical. I really dislike the hyperthermia effects of the A-PHP


What they look like (white object is a white bic lighter for comparison:

Only worth vaping. Seems to be only worth it on foil as well.


Going to retry a newer hugher purity batch here soon

After trying a few ROA's, and going through alot of this stuff, I've got to say my favorites are IV and oral. After vaping and gaining some tolerance, vaping just becomes uncontrollably fiendy ,miserable, and useless. 


Oral is extremely smooth and comfortable, I just have to up the dose a bit. It's long lasting, and much less likely to cause super paranoia and negative effects. Good for working and endless energy. Orally I'd say a good place to start would be about 20 mg. Ive comfortably worked my way up to about 50-60 and that's just a solid hit for energy. 


IV is the method that causes the most pleasureable high for me. But if you push it too far, also the most terrifying high. I started with like 10 mg and have worked my way up to about 50 mg being my average strong hit. IV method  using higher doses is a great, powerful and long lasting feeling. And the comedown for me is so much smoother than vaping. 


When redosing IV more than every 3-4 hours or so Php will eventually cause very real hallucinations and an uncomfortable twitchy, and sweaty body high. I have pushed the dose higher than 70 mg IV in one shot and eventually it becomes a full blown very real and visual hallucination, where I saw insane shit that is not there. I was fine and back to relative normal within 20 mins, but it was probably the highest I've ever been on anything. 


When I learned to control redosing and find a  good strong hit for me, it is a very fun, pleasureable stimulant. But every time I took it too far, it kicked my ass completely. The worst side effects I got were visual/audio stimulation, poor motor control, sweating, and overstimulation. 


But I will be taking a good long break from pyrovalerones. They are fun every once in a while, but with daily use, eventually the primary effect of the chemical becomes psychosis.

Out of curiosity, since I mostly wanted to know this about MDPV and a-PVP, the two I've tried - but don't know anyone personally that's IVed either of them:


Did you get a bellringer with IV a-PHP? 


How'd the actual rush compare to smoking - stronger or just more comfortable for you personally? The reason I'm asking is usually IV is the preferred ROA, over smoking, with other drugs, like heroin, cocaine etc - but I've often heard, at least with MDPV, that people said IV had no advantage over smoking it, which seemed odd to me.


How's the duration compare to smoked too? (Remember I haven't tried a-PHP so I don't know how long smoked lasts either, I'm assuming similar to a-PVP, but it'd help if you said the time it lasts you specifically so I can see if it's longer or shorter than the time your IV lasted)


I'm guessing though you prefer IV and oral because they're the two extremes right - oral being the least rush but also the least side effects, smoothest and longest lasting - while IV being the most intense and strongest rush. Smoking and snorting being in the middle and so neither being suitable as you'd either be going for one or the other? Any experience with snorting for that matter? I don't think I really bothered with oral with a-PVP much or at all, I always went with vaping if I wanted the rush, and snorting if I was planning a night out and didn't want to be fiending the stuff every 20 minutes.

Stick the page in Google Translate - you'd be surprised at how much better the translations are these days, you can read the general gist of most languages through it now, I regularly read posts on flashback and the like with Google translate and have never had much problem understanding any of the weird word order it leaves behind, it's not well-written but it's very understandable. Some languages like Russian are still a bit messy when translated though, and look like how any translation site would spit out paragraphs when you stuck something in a few years ago.

IV a-php didnt necessarily give me a bell ringer. It was more like an orgasmic tingling that flows all over the body. It is much more powerful than smoking, and can be overwhelmig the first time. I started with I believe 20 mg the first time I shot it, and worked up. The initial rush lasts about 20 minutes or so, and then it settles into a comfortable stimulant feeling that lasts a good 3 hours and I don't feel like I NEED to take another hit right away. I haven't IVed a-pvp so can't compare. 


Vaping a-php seems like the awesome rush is more elusive after your first hit. I can still get it, but I have to build up to it with several hits. Vaping just makes me feel more desperate and compulsive, just endlessly hitting the pipe. The rush from vaping seems to dissipate within minutes, and I am very compelled to vape more. 


As far as snorting goes, I physically can't do it for php. It destroys my nose for a few days, even with a tiny amount.  


IME pvp lasts longer and is a bit less compulsive. I enjoy the powerful rush of php more, but it goes away quickly. 

Also, just spacing out hits more, I can get a much better high each time.

Perfect time to compare a-PVP and a-PHP.


a-PVP is stronger, lasts longer, more serious less fun, some sort of mystery magic, wayyy more paranoid, not as compulsive.


a-PHP first hit rush is impecable, more fun and weird, shorter lasting, way more compulsive, serious paranoia but not straight spook city like a-PVP.


I can see the jump from a-PHP to a-PVP to MDPV. The structural changes, the flavors, tints, shades, gradient dank hits. Big bloomin clouds.


Combining a-PHP and a-PVP might be fun. a-PVO and MDPV was fun sortof... a-PHP and MDPPP was meh and a-PVP MDPPP was nuts bad interesting. a-PVP Etizolam vaped together is best

30-40 mg depending on experience with stimulants


Though I like it more rectal, you should try 20mg rectal

Just got 5g of a-php and after my first attempt I gotta say it's no MDPV but it's really not bad at all. But nasal sinus feeling is harsh! wtf ouch harsh. Like the smell though.


Vaping any stimulant with etizolam sounds like pure genius and guaranteed poor decision making to follow. 


Last time I did MDPV was 2009. Had unlimited amounts of really awesome tan PV and unlimited GHB to mix. Etizolam and a-php is a poor substitute.


Do you ever get the full body muscle twitches? Used to hate those. Sort of.

well, i've ordered 3 grams of this and should be arriving soonish. can't wait to get my hands on it frankly. i've been fucking around with cocaine and ethylphenidate but this stuff sounds like it's really good, apart from the intense cravings, but i suffer that from just about every damn drug i do. 


i've never tried MDPV or most of the research chems out there that are stim related. does this drug cause heart palps? costocondritis?

They were really mild on the heart but far over rated and not that much fun. You *really shouldn't* have gotten freaking 3 grams, send 2.5 to a trusted friend to hold on to for your safety plz. Like I said not as much fun but can be quite moreish. Constant re-checks of heartrate showed they were pretty gentle compared to other stims but as I mentioned not great. If you like cocaine which it goes cocaine>ethylphenidate>by a long shot the other two mentioned (PV-7 and PV-8 ). I'm telling you, not much fun, but still moreish - **stay away from having all 3 grams on you at once**. Listen to Halif, these stims can start being the driver behind your steering wheel and they aren't ever on a road to somewhere pleasant, I promise!

It is nothing and nowhere as satisfying as PV, and PHP (I believe called PV-7 and PV-8 are inferior to everything in that whole line. Just have restraint and know you will be disappointed, and could very well be hooked and catatonic again. Don't. Do. It. Smoke some bud, and chill out my friend.

Thanks, man.

Given that I have no interest in binging, don't want to vape or inject, and don't want to involve myself in "seeking the rush," is there anything that PV-type chemicals have to offer me? I'm prescribed vyvanse (though I don't take it in the summer), and have ethylphenidate (and soon a few different fluorinated amps) which I sometimes use to stay awake or in combinations with psychedelics, empathogens, etc. but which I don't "abuse," at least in the sense that people seem to abuse mdpv and the like. 


Is there anything I'm missing out on with a-php, or is the fun in these compounds only in the downward spiral of binging and going crazy?

I've been sparingly using low dosages of MDPV for a few years now. For me, it's relatively "chill" compared to dexamph. It's nice, energy, focus and a sort of content euphoria, but I don't get how people can basically sacrifice their whole life for this. I always eat and drink well though, and sometimes skip maybe a couple of hours of sleep, but no whole nights. No nasty crash or something either, while MDMA provides a nice suicide Tuesday from hell.


I guess it's quite alright if you use it sparingly, e.g. once a month not in high dosages.


Edit: I have no experience with a-PHP, so I cannot comment on that.

Good information here, thanks. I'm still indecisive. I don't have any particular desire for a-php, but given that mdpv was banned while I was aware of but not involved in the RC community, and a-pvp was banned while I was involved in RCs but wasn't interested in RC stims, I'm nervous that aphp, pv8, etc will be banned soon too.


Such is life, I guess. Would you say that you prefer mdpv to d-amp? If they have different characters in your mind, what differences in setting would determine which you chose to use? (Assuming that you had access to both)

I was just checking out the batch I got. It's darker then I would have expected. Tan bordering on brown and has a solvent type smell coming off it. Very clumpy. 

Any  thoughts on cleaning or washing it? Doesn't appear to be the cleanest stuff possible. Any one have any luck doing this?


follow up:


This stuff is amazing but it puts a lot of strain on my heart. I can't imagine taking this without a benzo safety net.

Very synergistic with opiates, can't wait to try it with GHB. Benzos are great for coming down but they take to much

away from the speedy euphoria fun.

So my 3 grams of a-php have arrived. I chose php over pvp due to the reports that this stuff is easier going in terms of side effects. Have not tried it yet as I'm still high on heroin, but will report back once I do. Am looking forward to this very much. Powder is white/tan coloured.


EDIT: Okay wow I couldn't wait. Wow. Just wow. This stuff is fucking incredible. Urge to redose almost instantly, super euphoric for me anyway, am holding myself back from doing another line, but it's so damn good. Jesus. This is very very good. As for the causticness of the stuff, it doesn't seem too bad. Sure it stings a little, but nothing too intense. Nowhere near as caustic as ethylphenidate. Like literally nothing near as bad.. Whoever said that i should get someone to hold onto an amount of this stuff was completely right. I am literally restraining myself from redosing.


note before i dosed i had a huge ass coffee - i really wasn't expecting the a-php to end up through my letter box so quickly, but hey ho look it has. i think the coffee is inducing more peripheral side effects which aren't very pleasant, but again, if i don't think about them i quickly forget about them.


There is most definitely a very tweakerish edge to this drug. Slight paranoia but nothing too bad, wouldn't really call it paranoia, more like i'm just a bit jumpy. Don't feel like interacting socially in person with family - because i feel as though i would be quite tweaky. I can do it, it just seems to be annoying/difficult. I feel as though i've taken a nice dose of dexamphetamine, without the kind of "brain fog" - feels much clearer. Difficult to really focus hard on things too. My sentences also seem to be getting shorter and shorter lol, mUST HOLD BACK FROM REDOSING. I think the heroin flowing through me is making it a much smoother experience. 


The powder clumps up a fair bit so chopping it up is a little difficult, but possible. Sizzurp your batch sounds weird frankly, brown coloured? Mine is a tanned white colour, definitely bordering on the white rather than brown though. I think you need to give it a cleaning... or maybe i've ended up with something that isn't a-php, either way, whatever the hell i've got is incredible. 


I wouldn't say its straining the heart so much, little bit of pressure on the chest but nothing too unbearable. Extremely euphoric, music is sounding good - and i normally hate this kind of crap that's playing at the moment on the TV. 


I can see what people mean about the cardiovascular effects, even though I've got some heroin in me this stuff is still making me race- but not in a bad way. You 100% need some Benzos on hand if you're going to be using this stuff.


**NSFW**: 


![clCWwkc.jpg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FclCWwkc.jpg&hash=c0e7289e84f6f3b550fbd586ba7ba229)


that's the stuff i've got.^^^^


So just to add on to what's been going on really, this stuff seems incredibly potent as a stimulant frankly. My pupils are pinned due to the heroin, and the a-php is essentially blocking it from doing its job. I don't want to dose H or Benzos to put me to sleep because I'm scared I won't wake up. A valium would most likely do fuck all right now if the heroin isn't kicking  through. 


Eyeballing this stuff is not a good idea either. It's very very dose responsive. As it clumps up and is a pain in the ass to break up, a dose you think is small could in fact be large. That happened to me earlier tonight and though I did get a lot of euphoria, it came with the price of muscle tenseness especially, and some paranoia. It doesn't seem too be to heavy duty on the heart rate which is a nice thing. However it is long lasting, and I'm now in the limbo phase of whether to redose or just wait until the drug wears off. I'm going with the second. Time has FLOWN by since I started taking the php again, and I'm actually noticing a sense of amnesia to all this. I can't really remember what the hell I've been doing for the past 4-5 hours. I've just been browsing around online really, my memory seems to have gotten fuzzy since the big dose I took - dunno what that's about. 


This is definitely not one to be taken lightly at all. I could imagine sitting here redoing for days on end, but I'm not going to do that.

The shit I got looks way darker then that. My aphp is khaki. Here is a pic. 
![WD0BTuy.jpg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FWD0BTuy.jpg&hash=07482f6ae38848c047a97ff46522af8b)


Effects sounds the same. Euphoria is awesome with as expected cardio effects. 

Great with GHB. I always feel a litle tweaked out the next day after taking it. Maybe it's just lingering benzo in my system making me feel weird.

If I don't take GHB or a benzo then I am not going to use this drug. Too much stimulation and eventual sketch, stress or dread.


When it came to MDPV I hated the white stuff and LOVED the tan/grey clumpy stuff.


Just tried vaping this stuff for the first time. This stuff is meant to be vaped.... keep the doses small and no stress just euphoria.. so far no benzos or GHB and feeling good.

Very fiendy compulsive stuff when vaped!

**a-PHP -  Pleasantly euphoric into a clean stim**


IV 8mg was a very nice rush for me


Starts in about 10 seconds


20-40 seconds of a very very nice rush


20-40 minutes of feeling really good, but a bit scattered


Bit of a disappointing and uneasy feeling after that wears off 


Then another 2 hours of calm stimulation with the occasional bout of anxiety.


Pretty good stuff, will try insufflating at a party this weekend.

--


EDIT:


"Crash" was okay, mainly tired, weak and a bit sleepy yet still wanting to do something.


Added in a few things


T+2 - MXE 30mg + Noopept 30mg sublingual, followed by 2 glasses of wine. Helped the comedown and anxiety. 


T+2:15 - 10mg a-php shot - Wasn't anywhere near as good as the first, despite higher dosage. Brought back stimulation which is nice and clean now.

Tried this again today, 2 days after last time.


The rush is not quite the same. Not as good in that first minute after injecting as the very first time I ever tried it, but still had similar euphoria / energy in the next 20 minute, as well as the stimulation after.


Shroomyboom or anyone else who has IV'd stimulants similar to this know how long to abstain from using to bring back that initial rush?

Jesus, don't inject RCs, but especially don't inject either of these two chemicals, please. 


You need a rush (though it tastes fairly bad) smoke it, don't wanna smoke it but want a rush - remove needle from syringe with pliers or cut off end with good scissors - and plug it. 


**If you must IV it please tell me you're using a wheel filter. **


You're going to end up with a thrombus and only one arm. Don't mean to preach, but these two stimulants are the two which the LEAST is known about them. They were pretty gentle on the heart, but then again their rush was shitty to begin with. If you want a rush buy some ethylphenidate and plug it or smoke it. 5 mg of it smoked has me BLOWN, 1000x what these two could do, probably even IVed.


As for tolerance in these two chemicals, I had a gram of each and didn't really notice it. But then again the reush to begin with was mediocre to non-existent. I will admit that these two felt pretty innocuous on the heart compared to methamp/amp, they didn't really increase my pulse, and their raises in blood pressure was less then you would expect. They however are/were extremely moreish, for as I noticed mediocre effects. One thing I noticed about these two drugs is that they don't actually make you grind your teeth at all. I wonder what causes that (bruxism).


Ethylphenidate has an actual rush of euphoria, is pretty cheap, still pretty easy on the cardiovascular system IME - just don't snort or IV it as it's really fucking corrosive. I'd put it directly between Methamphetamine, and amphetamine euphoria wise (closer to methamp, more euphoric than amp by a good deal) with a far shorter duration than either. It also causes fairly intense bruxism.

^just want to comment on the above quickly, ethylphenidate is the first stimulant which has induced some kind of psychotic state in me. it's poison. i can vividly remember having a chat in my head regarding how "alice" was in control of my mind, but a dark evil force wanted to destroy alice - and i couldn't allow that to happen so i quite literally visually imagined destroying an evil looking village in my mind with my hand in order to protect alice and her good town, but as i grabbed and destroyed the evil village it regrew in other areas. that's the most vivid recollection of the psychosis - but i remember talking to myself A LOT about alice.... and having a genuine belief that this was how my mind worked. not to mention that i continued to snort ethylphen. luckily it ran out, or fucking god knows what my mind would've done.


holy christ.


i've now got my hands on a-pvp, and i can honestly say a-php has NOTHING on it. (note this was written during the first 30mins of the a-pvp experience in which i experienced a mind blasting euphoria).


its not even really comparable. a-pvp is **much** more euphoric. it seems like php has some kind of strange cardiovascular effects in comparison too. i'm noticing with the pvp i'm getting these tingles in my arm - no idea why i've been getting them recently but whatever.


note both were used by insufflation. 


a-php however is NOWHERE near as moorish as a-pvp. i think that i really should throw away these 3 grams of pvp i've obtained because i can see this getting out of hand quickly, while the php was more like a delicate treat every now and then.


dosage with php had to be very exact too. for some reason its side effects profile was very harsh in terms of muscle tension and such - though nowhere near as brutal on the heart as it's cousin, a-pvp.


goddamnit it's really difficult t+2 after an insufflated bump of a-pvp, the euphoria lasted around 30mins and i had to restrain myself from redosing as i felt the comedown initiating. however as i haven't redosed i started suffering a very nasty comedown, of which I'm still suffering, had to pop a flubromazepam - quite impressive for a drug to induce that kind of reaction in me, haven't had it before. a-php has never got me to the same level of euphoria as i experienced, but then again it didn't essentially explode my heart after a single tiny bump nor make me sweat profusely as i was. 


a-php seems to be much more functional... the euphoria isn't as sweet, but frankly, in terms of mitigating side effects a-php is the winner (but then again there are some fucking nasty side effects with php too). i'm going through phases of function ability with the PVP - but with PHP it was very functional. i could barely pick up my phone, not sure why, it was an odd sensation - i was almost scared of it. never happened on PHP. 


i think i preferred the php, but to be honest, i don't think i'll be ordering either of them again anytime soon.

2 days is what I would think to be a good enough break. If you use it too often, tolerance builds pretty quickly. But the two hours between doses in a single day is a decent enough gap. Any more often than that and it can get ugly. I highly suggest not using it any more than a couple times a day, and definitely going to sleep every night.

But only for 30 minutes?  I would stay far, far away from such chemicals my friends.  30 minutes of euphoria is just asking for a neurotoxic binge. 


Hmm, I suppose we will begin our RC stim tests with 4-fa, once we manage to get our paws on it.  I suppose it must be available somewhere on the clearnet, it would be such a fuss to have to get on the darknet for it, being unscheduled in my state and all.

i agree, i know that im new to bluelight, but iv been in the research chemical field since 2009, i just recently started doing so mild research again after being out for a couple years. obtained 2 grams of A PHP, purity was over 97% quailty chem. BUT, the side effects are not woth the experience , trust me, unless your using the proper vitamins, vasodilators, and hydration, the side effects are far worse then its predecessor. swim knows because swim is feeling physical side effects. if you do choose to research this chem make sure you only aquire a small amount. like a few have said, this is a brand NEW chem, and must be treated with the utmost respect. as for ROA id advise against vaperising as it causes chemicals that wouldent normally be actived by other ROAs and will cause bad physical side effects. be safe and smart.

it was functional in the fact i could put it down. lets put it that way. i've got an order for 3g's of pvp coming because php was just too friendly for my liking. i prefer the darker side of these chems - but its asking for trouble and i know it. when i ran out of my alpha-pvp @ 1 gram last week i was absolutely devastated it went so quickly frankly.


but touching ANY of these chems without benzos is asking for a shitload of trouble frankly.

The last of my supply was used in an almost 2 day binge, thankfully it wasn't that much. It was quite fun really and the comedown was far easier than expected, just annoying not being able to sleep. Once I decided to redose a few times, I found it extremely hard to stop. 


And yes I can relate to the comment about talking to people being some game that they are too slow to play. Only ever happened on this substance (never tried pvp, once mdpv never again). 


Doubt I'll be revisiting any of these chems, even though this one was okay.

Got .5 grams of a-php from a mate, this batch was light brown almost a mix of brown and salmon color, and mostly powder/clumps.  I've experimented with a lot of drugs, but never really anything close to this, other than coke/amphetamines, but i have a bucket list so i added this to it, and between the euphoric feeling, alertness and talkativeness, i decided to screw around with some.  I'm 24, 280 lbs 5'11'.  Over the period of 48 hours and continually re-dosing, first 4-5 times nasally, after that switched because I haven't taken drugs nasally more than a few times, i switched to vaporizing it, and then switching between vap/nasal.  Also smoking weed along with/in between, since our glass was crap the simplest way was to almost sandwich a bit of the powder in the weed and packed it in a one hitter.  It was fine, mostly just wasting too much since it's not really getting vaped and the desire to do it again tests your willpower.


Was very euphoric taken either way,  very talkative, alertness etc.  Reminded me of a purer better version of amphetamines, and like previously said, since i binged, i have had a continually high heart rate, elevated blood pressure.


I had a desire to go back for more when I vaporized, but not as much nasally.  Putting excess powder in your mouth (when you're lazy/messy like me) was numbing at first, but the second day I had dry mouth and chapped lips.  


Thought I would add this too, although it may just pertain to me, being on 100mg zoloft every day for the last few years;  when i started and when i went up from 50 to 100m for about 3-4 weeks i would constantly clench my jaw due to zoloft being an SRRI. i just can't stop grinding my teeth/clenching my jaw for the last 6-12 hours (still redosing up until about an hour ago)


Not related i also can't stop popping my ears, and like previously mentioned, paranoia, everything previously mentioned, and we'll see after I pass out how bad the comedown is, but as far as i've experimented over the past week, there is really no noticeable comedown (until you start doing a lot).


Had been frequenting this website since I found out about aphp, and since there is so little known about it just thought i'd share what my experience was.  I actually enjoyed taking it nasally, but either it being way to rough or my nostrils being too soft, a good old bulb and torch does the trick just as well.  Vaporizing it tasted like black licorice and chemicals.


Goodnight Bluelight people, i'll update about my comedown experience later today/tomorrow.

Benzos are ok if your trip is racy, or stim-like. Otherwise you might waste a trip by falling asleep. Benzos with stims is different. They get rid of vasoconstriction so you trip better.

You'll prolly feel like snortin' 20mg to 30mg every 60-90min or so. If you get the clumpy base just vap some and see where it takes you. Don't use as functional stim.

10g of " crystal a-PHP" arrived yesterday.


After smoking it all night I have realized that it is actually a-PVP.


The effects, the taste, the melt. All of it suggests a-PVP. 


I believe that vendors may be unknowingly or knowingly passing a-PVP as a-PHP. The brown clump powder a-PHP was very different than the "crystal a-PHP chunks".


I know a-PVP when I taste and feel it.

This is pretty disconcerting, if I remember correctly a-PVP is now an emergency scheduled drug! Though being able to tell the difference between such closely related compounds is pretty damn difficult, have you had a-PHP before?

I just know a-PHP from a sample i got a few months ago, and it was like tamarinds said, brown clumpy/rocky powder, so it seems he/she knows what a-PHP looks/feels like. But honestly, neither a-PHP nor a-PVP are worth it when there's the superior Peev that's, thanks to the upcoming Ban, even cheaper and, once again, oh-so-much better!

Got sent a few grams of this stuff by mistake, the brown rocky kind. I noticed with insufflation, a-PHP instantly clogs up your nose and gives sinus problems for like a week. Or at least for me, and that was after a single 30mg dose! Seems to make the inside of the nose feel like a glue stick. I was addicted to MDPV years ago and haven't touched it or a-PVP in forever and don't want to because I went to the ER and could never be responsible, been using high quality crystal meth as it doesn't give me the desire to redose or really any negative effects when used responsibly. a-PHP feels more gentle than MDPV/a-PVP though produced minor chest pain around the heart. Not sure what to do with the rest of this stuff since I prefer insufflation with pretty much anything. Vaping with anything seems more fiendish so I prefer not to. Terrified of needles so IV is out of the question and I doubt the oral route would be as euphoric. I'll consider vaping but is it worth it?

Hoping more people post their experiences on this stuff. 


Seems to be very limited info and anything would be helpful. I'll report back if I decide to mess with this using some other ROA.

I just got a different batch advertised as crystals (first brown garbage was advertised as crystals too.....) so the brown stuff must be impure or freebase - and I'm pretty sure it was damn soluble in water. What I've just seen is perfectly clear, 0 tint, crystals. Tastes similar to the brown stuff only evaporates cleaner, tastes cleaner and feels cleaner. Bleh to the other stuff.

Not sure that the brown is freebase because it seemed to have the normal effects when insufflated except for clogging my nose. Anyone remember the legendary tan MDPV? Maybe similar methods of synthesis were used. When MDPV was kinda new, the tan was more popular then everyone sold the white. aPHP is pretty new so it could be the same kinda situation.

This stuff is most certainly more potent so I'd disagree with that assessment. There is minimal residue when vaporized in comparison, and it tastes less strongly. I thought the tan mdpv *was* freebase (never used it/saw it). I would guess that either this is a different batch and the synth was washed more/more cleanly done, or it is chemically different somehow.

I got a batch that had an orange oil when a IV liquid was left for 24 hours on purpose. Terrible effects on the vascular system. This stuff is dangerous, I don't trust it. Even before I OD'ed CV I started to get a lump of blood, stigmata style, on my palm....Fucked my veins to hell. No more pyrovalerones for this one

Shooting every type of stimulant is particularly bad. They're powerful vasoconstrictors, shooting RCs that are under researched/not analytically verified for content is also a bad idea. Did you take precautions (.3 micrometer filters, bacteriostatic water for anything in solution, single syringe use)?


I find it no more vasoconstricting than ethylphenidate or meth/amphetamine - they all are powerful. In fact on this chemical my hands aren't cold and clammy like ethylphenidate or meth so it may actually be less intense of vasoconstrictor. I find this new batch especially pleasant (similar to meth) but less moreish, less anorexic, and less clammy and tense. Overall two thumbs up.

I had a really similar experience on eph too, after staying up all night playing gran turismo, hammering it a bit & then mixing it with bk-2c-b. A small boy called 'Henry' controlled my mind, he was obsessed with toy cars, I was laid out tripping, but it was no normal trip, I totally lost any sense of who I was for a couple of hours & regained myself as the bk-2c-b went from stimulant to psychedelic effects & the eph wore off.


You did too much. For me around 10mg or less oral dose feels fairly functional, no super euphoria & over-stimulation, but a nice alertness that lasts a while. Multiple 20-40-60mg doses in an evening is far too much, but easily done, it gets overstimulating & moreish at over 20mg for me. Just remember that psychosis if you have an urge to redose, stay awake for multiple nights, dose higher or mix any similar types of drugs with it. It does get evil quickly in high doses or mixed. You're going to get some psychosis if you hit any stimulant too much, if a heart attack doesn't get you first. eph doesn't give the same heart racing adrenaline rush as other stims, so it's easy to get carried away, but the psychosis is definitely there.


I'd rather control my doses on eph than try some totally brand new obscure stim rc. I'm looking forward to seeing a good clean stim, but how can you know when it's only been around a few months & only a few people have ever taken it?

**α-PHP compared to dextroampheatmine sulfate - can one replace the other?**


Hello everyone. I rarely post here, but do read from time to time. Seems like the best place to get info especially when one is interested in substances such as this (α-PHP), about which little has been published, sadly. I have a specific issue though, and would really like some input. I'm sure someone MUST know...


INTROIT

I have used stimulants for non-rec purposes for over ten years now. Tolerance is such that I was prescribed (like, legally, in an intimidating office overlooking the park, certificates on walls and what not) the following for the last five years: each month, a 30DSUP of d-MPD 10mg TID -or- MPD 20mg QID --plus-- Dextrostat 30mg BID --or-- Adderall 30mg TID (depending on availability and price, as I pay out of pocket). I took them as directed, per order of 'ad libitum' and PRN. Save for the early days of idiocy with friends, there had never been any issues with this. 

Some months ago I dismissed methylphenidate and am currently on Dextrostat 20mg TID. I use this for studying and teaching. As in the past, I take 15-50mg QD in two or three doses, depending on whatever. 


So now that that's out of the way. It's come to my attention that this α-PHP thing, while still legal, would be easier on my wallet, because the price for Dextrostat is now beyond profane, let alone that insurance will not cover it unless I have narcolepsy or am in hospice. What I want to know, IS THIS STUFF PRACTICAL for use as a stimulant for work and study? I mean to replace Dextrostat at 30-60mg QD? If so, how much would I need to take (by mouth) if I were to replace dex with this? What is a 20mg Dex dose in α-PHP and is there much of difference in duration of effect? I am familiar with this category but I am unsure what to expect from α-PHP specifically. I do not mind a bit of initial euphoria obviously... but that should fade and I'm talking about effects on vigilance, focus, cognition and mood. If anyone could be so kind as to provide a comparison? based on your experience with both? in terms of equidose effect subjectively...anything really. 


Thanks for reading, sorry for the length ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) I wanted to make sure I cover everything.

Pyrovalerones are much shorter-lasting than dexedrine, so if you wanted to replace dexedrine taken three times a day, you'd have to take a-PHP like every 2 hours. Also, keep in mind that these drugs are stronger dopaminergics than amphetamine which is a much more potent noradrenaline releaser than dopamine releaser, and noradrenaline is very important for wakefulness and concentration enhancing effects of amphetamine. Maybe this is not an ideal comparison but pyrovalerones are as useless for studying as methcathinone is.

Been experimenting with this stuff a few times each day, brown clumpy stuff. I was able to use insufflation without clogging my nose by making sure the powder is chopped as fine as I could make it with a razorblade or the side of a card. First dose was approx. 30mg since people say it's weaker than a-PVP or MDPV and needs a higher dose. I hadn't eaten much throughout the day yet I experienced pretty bad nausea for about five minutes and almost ran to the bathroom but managed to ignore it and it went away. I'm not sure if I got the strongest batch ever or what but even a dose that was 30mg or less was way too much, very tweaky feeling and couldn't keep my legs still for more than a second. Mild paranoia/anxiety and the dose lasted longer than I expected, like 2 hours or maybe longer, time seemed to go by faster than usual. Got back to baseline mostly and redosed less at 15mg or so to avoid the negatives. Paranoia and anxiety came back but now my body temperature got very high and I was sweating and noticed like a-PVP, I could smell that extremely disgusting chemical smell coming out of the pores of my skin. I haven't seen anyone else report this with a-PHP but I can't stand it. Took a shower with cool water and scrubbed my skin until the nasty smell was gone. I noticed what seemed like acne on my face on the cheek area but it's a bit itchy and wasn't there before I started messing with this chemical. I rarely ever have acne anyways so it seemed strange. Also, I got mad about something that someone did and it felt like my adrenaline went through the roof. I went outside and threw punches at this building nearby which is normal for me to do when I'm angry about something, but I noticed I was throwing punches every second as hard as I could hit and I didn't feel any pain at all. I was actually kinda scared of myself because I kept at it nonstop for over 10 minutes and it was hard to stop and control it. MDPV, a-PVP or any other stimulant never gave such a powerful kinda scary effect. I know if I were to hit a person like that, they could die rather quickly. I'm guessing this means something to do with norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor effects as I'm assuming a-PHP is an NDRI like MDPV and a-PVP. 


The negative effects were very bad even at what seemed like small doses. Would doing an acetone wash reduce these effects? No doubt this is a very strong chemical but I'd like more than sweating chemicals, jitteryness, anxiety, paranoia etc. These types of RCs like MDPV never really gave me the pleasant kind of high that amphetamine provides as others have related it to, not even close to the feeling given by methylphenidate either imo. I want the euphoric effects along with the least anxiety or side effects produced. Before my insufflation experiment, I capped up like 40mg, dosed higher since oral has a lower BA but I was hoping for those positive effects to come out of it, and surprisingly I didn't feel a thing from the oral route...

^ Since apparently it can be produced as clear crystals I'm sure the correct kind of wash will indeed produce them. Unfortunately we don't know what the brown stuff is/what it is soluble in. It could be just as soluble as a-php at the same temperature or something and need cold/hot filtration or a different pH and filtration in addition. Give it a try with acetone and a small bit and see what happens.


And you getting angry and hitting stuff has something to do with anger problems, not necessarily norepinephrine (though that can't be making it any better).

I have experienced a-PHP brown clumpy highly hydroscopic powder twice. 


Clear difference between that and crystal chunk a-PVP which Ive been smoking for 2 years.


The recent crystal chunk a-PHP was definately a-PVP. another year-provwn PV researcher agrees based on their independent research. There is more than just these 2 doubts floating around the internet. and honestly I cant complain crystal chunk a-PVP is my faviorite drug of all time

Well I got my gram. Im high for a night, forced to type with one hand. I got the white/dabs of yellow in the thick chunjs.


Pros:  Has legs. After  first few vapes out of an oil burner, still dont qute have that down. Am I suposed to twirl it like meth? I like vaping from just one pool. Had some issues there. Legs, I can putthe ipe down and do stuff, gradually increasing time between redose ti 1-1.6 hours now Im sllowing down for sleep. With a fun etiz vial flusj and all the diclazepam. There was a point I could've just stopped and slept last night, thats impressive. Oh, insufflation/waterline via 1cc oral syringe worked well too really getting it up into the sinuses and knowing how to keep it here. A bit more burn adds in the sinus synergy with the more felt norepinephrine reuptake felt up the nose. The key is those water flushes into the sinus, get it alll in. Minimal physical side effects.


Cons:  a 'functional stiiim by any means, More binge worthy imo. The effects seemed spacy, I could put down the pipe and do stuff, but random stuff.. I cant read shit on it, text looks like some Asian-hybrid  characters while goin on it. Im a fan of literature so.... thats about it. 


I liked it. A good put on a killer album written on hard drugs and stare euphoria. Oh and talking way too much at people, thats a universal con.


I went to check on the llittle plastic shit, olld, smokeshop container. Upon checking on it, I noticed it has bad become rock solid and all that yellow. There must f been some moisture still in the fucker! What' do I got to wrk with boys? let it dehydrate in open dry air, hope for the best? I sampled it, prolly not the most Im sitting om .5g dank to 1g wgo knows,


BeLove

Woahhh wtf? Bickering? Man you're taking too much if you're talking to yourself.  (If you mean me I was jokingly informing him that drug testing questions aren't allowed). 


As for 2g, man I'd be careful. This stuff is pretty damn moreish, I'd only order more than 1g if I felt like finding a friend to hold on to it, and honestly the thought of hitting them up just to get some and possibly annoying them is enough not to. 


This stuff makes EPH look like garbage though.... if it is in crystal form and not what was originally a tannish powder.

First time with this class of stimulant. Vaped 500mg over a 12 hr period with a 4 hour sleep in there. Initially(first few hours) a powerful mindset, anxiety, talkative, euphoric and moderately pro sexual. After a few redoses seemed to get better and better we all agreed.


This is by far the most fiendish substance i've used. Vaping off foil is fun but thats ALL you do the entire time. I'd do it again but definitely with a different ROA. If only alpha-php had a longer duration it would be perfect.

I'm new to research chemicals and I tried to find the answer by UTFSE but couldn't find it.   If one is to vape it (brownish crystals), how often do you hit the pipe?  (i.e., every 10 minutes, every hour, etc.)  How much should I load in the pipe (I got a scale).  Should a oil burner be use or a crack pipe?   Are the effects like crack or meth?   I've done 3 grams of crack in 12 hours but I never did any amount of meth.  Based on some comments above, sounds like 3 grams of a-php is too much to do in 12 hours.  What are the effects?  Am I going to be up for days?  Is my heart going to be beating 200 beats per minute for hours?  I don't want to overdue it.  Thanks.

^3 grams in twelve hours would probably kill you. I haven't tried this but I have a friend who loves it and one gram is good for 2-3 days of continuous use.

1-200mg in 12 hours would kill me... maybe less. 


One gram is good for 1 week.... binging with a little tolerance. Either you guys are getting not good stuff or need to STOP RIGHT NOW.


An initial dosage is 2-3mg for no tolerance, maybe 5mg with one.

I'm definitely interested in this chemical. I'm a fan of aPVP for being ape shit 3 days straight but definitely not for being a productive member of adult society. Love the feeling though, and the rush I get for 30 minutes after vaping the chemical is god like.


From a lot of the descriptions aPHP seems up my alley, however I purchased some MD-PHP (the PHP version of MDPV) and it was total crap, nothing positive about it whatsoever. I also tried aPBP which is one step in the opposite direction as aPHP on the alpha chain length. It was an awesome functional stim and mood lifter, almost zero paranoia or noticeable negative side effects, but you hit a ceiling very quick and there is no rush or in-your-face euphoria. 


I'll probably pass on aPHP, although not for any specific reason. Just wait, alpha-PHP will be banned soon enough, and then everyone will move on to the "replacement" which of course will be less than stellar and so on and so forth. Just like all the junk that tried to replace mephedrone like 3MMC which is a crap cathinone high with very large potential for heart problems. Hell, even the super pure large crystal batches of Meph weren't that great. Shifting baselines yo'!

Since a-PVP is, as i think, plain and simple as it is, shite as shite can be and the a-PHP at least having kinda unique properties to it the PVP is missing, even though it's nothing too spectacular, time and all the Research lead us to the conclusion that none of those have something what the superior "oh-so-evil" PV can't, especially while being less dangerous/harmful or whatever it is being blamed for (just bcuz it's just a fair bit more potent mg per mg).

NOT a good drug to get into IVing...(like any is)


Especially if you've got the shit version and not the better one (I've gotten two one that had horrible side effects and body load and other shit and one that was moreish as fuck and better than meth around here); though, honestly I'll be restraining myself from buying this shit or other stims as I don't like the withdrawn person it makes me at all. I dunno if it's just me but I find that an easy task and know I'm not really lying to myself saying it, maybe it's just from kicking other tougher shit.


BTW if you're high on this shit I'm surprised you don't need to be a perfectionist with typing. Usually stimulants make me so razor sharp that I'm a perfectionist at the expense of other more important things.

Nicklazz if i could find it, i'd definitely give it a try. Even though i know it'd lead to uncontrollable redosing and psychosis apparently i like learning everything the hard way. The way i see it the ultimate stimulants are Meth, Cocaine and MDPV so i'll have to try it, one day hopefully.


Lolwhatzdrugz i'd have to disagree on those dosages. From what i read A-PHP is significantly less potent then A-PVP. 3-5mg's sounds like MDPV dosages?

Really? As far as i'm concerned you are a crackhead for trying it. How can a substance have an Evil edge? Go smoke more DMT.

No. You're wrong or have bad shit. If you have crystal aphp 3-5mg works for sure. Sorry if that sounded too terse.

A-PHP is just as shitty as A-PVP is, probably even worse, especially when compared to it's superior Predecessor, the Peevee!

I would agree. Having gone down the rabbit hole numerous times with both MDPV and aPVP (smoked and snorted), and from what I hear about aPHP's effects profile, IVing it is just asking to become a slave to the chemical. But I've only IVed a drug once so I won't comment further.

No fucking joke ese! When I'm on a good stim high, I will literally spend 45 minutes on 2 paragraphs just making sure the spelling and grammar and punctuation is perfect down to the pixels in my screen!

Never done aPHP, but I have done plenty of  MDPV and aPVP. Never had the mysterious "Tan mdpv" that so many talk about, I've only had the pure white (it was later shown the tan batch had some other chemical impurities in it which led to the insane effects.)


I agree and disagree. I agree that MDPV is superior. I get a tad less paranoia, its a tad bit easier to sleep on, its not as fiendish, and the best part is it gets me creative and in the mood for writing music or doing something similar and not thinking about when my next hit from the pipe will be. 


That said, I don't think aPVP is a shit chem. I look at it like this (and I know this is a shitty analogy but bare with me): if aPVP was pure d-Meth, MDPV would be an X pill that was 80% d-Meth and 20% MDMA. Obviously the effects are nothing like those mentioned, but its an analogy. 


aPVP can be very fun, and I find that sexually it's superior to MDPV. As long as you don't end up sleepless for 3 days you'll be alright. 2 days of sobriety and back to normal world. 


I'll say though, hearing your room-mates walking up and down the stairs for 8 hours straight while they search through your car for drugs is a nightmare, especially when you get the courage to walk outside and they're all fast asleep. Oh and I promise you that all three: MDPV, aPVP and aPHP are worse for your teeth than doing meth. I'm going to write a little guide soon in BDD on staying healthy while binging on PVs. 


Can anyone comment as to the duration of the aPHP high vs. aPVP high? I've heard its a bit shorter, therefore a bit more fiendish, but I would love if someone could give me a semi-detailed breakdown. Also what is the difference in terms of the rush? I hardly get any rush from aPVP/MDPV, it mainly just waits about 1.5 minutes and then kicks in hard, but I don't consider that a rush.  Thanks!

Thanks for posting such a  detailed Point of View,honestly. I cannot leave that much input about the PHP/PVP as my research on them is limited but enough to say they're nothing too interesting, and even though PV's been told to be kinda "evil" Compound, it's, if threated carefully and with respect, the second best Stim there is, while Methylphenidate is, subjectively seen, much better, but this is bcuz i am diagnozed ADHD!

Correct me if i'm wrong. When it comes to potency: MDPV> A-PVP> A-PHP


The stuff i had was active at 5mg but i needed higher dosages for euphoric or rushing effects.

Hahaha if I even made it to 10 days on a PV, I would just be a brain in a vat.


The general current consensus on what causes "meth mouth" has to do with side effects of dry mouth, acidified salivia etc. Not the actual chemical itself destroying your enamel, say like a soda pop would. 


And since I don't have a PhD in chemistry, I won't go down that route. But from my lonnnnng term experience with meth, aPVP & MDPV (although not quite as  much with the MD) it seems the mouth-related side effects from the PVs are a little more harsh than regular meth. Its obviously subjective anecdotal evidence so take it with a grain of salt.... but I had been drinking soda multiple times a day, and occasionally binging meth for about 3 years, my teeth still looked pretty damn good almost no corrosion.


Got my first sample of aPVP, 3 days later I had gaps forming in between my teeth starting at the top. My dentist even seemed tripped out. Although I will concede, I generally stay hydrated more often while on meth... PVP makes me forget to do life. And lately I have made it a habit of brushing my teeth multiple times a day and using mouth wash after any vaped hit of an aPxP or MDPV... and I guess you may be right, the damage is MUCH slower now that I have implemented these strategies.


As far as potency goes (another user mentioned MDPV > aPVP > aPHP). This seems to be the case yes, however personally I find the potency difference between MDPV and aPVP to be minimal, albeit existent. 


While aPHP may be a little less potent, also keep in mind that it's effects profile is also different. When you increase the alpha chain past 4 carbons (4 right?) you lose potency and according to a few blue lighters euphoria as well. 


I have extensively tried a-PBP, which is a decrease in the alpha chain by 1 carbon, basically the opposite direction from aPVP ---> aPHP. I also found aPBP less potent than PVP, much less euphoric and had a very-easy-to-hit ceiling of effects. That said, it actually behaved a TON like methylphenidate, and was to date the ONLY functional PV-analog I have ever tried and never made me paranoid or over stimulated. When vaped it tasted similar to aPVP crystals, but with a hint of pine-sol. 


I'll stop because this thread is about PHP, and thats the one damn pv analog I haven't tried yet. Continue on nothing to see here....


As far

So the general consensus is that the Peev is and remains the superior Compound, and so there's no reason experimenting any further with the a-PxP's, eh?!

Yes it gets BAD. 


I would start a session by vaping 100mg hit after hit. Thene vaping 80mg every 10-15 minutes for 2 days. Then plugging 80-200mg every hour while smoking 60-80mg every 30 minutes for 3 days. The final 2 days of these sessions (x3) Id be plugging 100-200mg, orally 100-150mg and vaping 100mg nonstop. Id he a suicidal delusional Fed hating Life lovig wreck. 


I have a 3 year tolerance so be aware. My doses are stuoid and irresponsible. My D2 receptors are fucked and downregulated to the Max. Be Careful


Just ordered another 25,000mg so well see LOL

No. I hope nobody got that idea from my post, that's not what I was trying to convey. I hear from many people that aPHP is pretty damn euphoric and has a nice rush. There are also plenty of people who dislike it. Mephedrone was extremely popular and one of my favorite drugs, yet there were THOUSANDS of people online, and even people I gave samples to in real life who didnt care for it. Everyone's different. 


Although everyone agrees PHP has a shorter duration, and you end up taking hit after hit even worse than the other PVs. Not to mention that may a short, faster acting stimulant is closer to what you are looking for! Different strokes for different folks yo. Plus, while some people can still get illegals in their country, MDPV is actually a bit harder to get as far as illegals go.... although if you're dabbling in illegals you probably won't have much trouble finding some MDPV with a bit of digging. 


I will be ordering a gram of aPHP in the coming week and look forward to reporting on it.

Holy fucking shit! I am seriously glad you're still alive, but also seriously worried, and a bit perplexed that you aren't floating through the 23rd dimension yet hearing aliens trying to break into your house and call the cops on you! If I vaped even 50mg in one hit/session I would be a goner without benzos or seroquel. At least tell me you've had sex or masturbated while on such a high dose!?! I can't even imagine the godliness.......


May I ask, since you started abusing aPHP what, if any, long term physical side effects have you noticed on any part or function of your body? Just honestly curious. Be safe mate.


Edit: Realized he was talking about alpha PHP not MDPV.

As for the aliens he mentioned "paranoid shicozphrenia full blown" so... maybe aliens are breaking into his house.


And I think tamarinds meant aphp and not MDPV, but I could very well be mistaken.


Jesus... just got an order for 25g, I don't think I've done 25g of stimulants TOTAL (ALL OF THEM) EVER!!!!!

^ Yeah at least not 25g of stims that potent. I've definitely blown through at least 100+ grams of mephedrone at least. 


I didn't even realize he was referring to alpha-PHP not MDPV, which should have been obvious haha. 


Regardless, that's still extremely epic on some this is sparta type of levels.


Question for anyone:

What's the sexual enhancement/horny-ness factor caused by aPHP. Is it a solid increase? No change? Do you feel like Matthew McConaughey on it? Hard to stay erect or easy as hell? 


That's one of the main reasons I even dabble with the PV analogs in the first place, sex on them is some interstellar wormhole shit. Basically every time I have sex or masturbate while on PV, it's like the docking scene from interstellar where he spins the spaceship in circles to lock up with the space station, I feel like god damn Matthew McConaughey everytime. Yep, definitely like that.

Ive never vaped anything other than weed but made a light bulb for for my a-php experiments. I'm still learning how to do it most efficiently. My question is once it turns into an amber colored liquid, do I keep hitting it or is it done? I've vaping this amber liquid for a second or two and the vapor tastes like shit and kinda hurts my lungs.

For starters i do not suggest getting into vaping but since you're interested.. Do NOT waste your time with a bulb or a meth pipe, it's shit. Chasing on foil is the only way to go with this, takes abit to get the hang of but there are guides around. Chasing is way more addictive than the pipe also imo. Smoking the amber is fine, it's when it gets much darker to black is when you should definitely stop. I am far from an expert on chasing and PVP compounds but i know enough to become a psychotic fiend so i must be doing something right. Good luck, you'll need it.

^ Yeah, once it gets amber colored it becomes harsh and less effective, probably because its burning/degraded. I also admit that for the PV related compounds foil boats are much more effective. Just make sure to burn off any added lubricants/chemicals that were coated onto the foil during manufacturing before vaping anything off of it. If you don't let it slide and "chase" it, it will just burn and become harsh fast.

Im refering too a-PHP


Yes after 3 years of daily a-PVP and now a-PHP for the last 4 months. Ive definately done some organic brain damage. No doubt. still these symothoms disapear completely within 10 days of ceasing.except for the quickened pace of speech, strange body poses sitting and "extra careful" lifestyle. Id say these PVs have been benefivient. Rather than shooting H and dieing.


Im used to these doses. I do not recommend vaping 80mg off top going too town.


edit: I havr gone through 300g of a-PVP in 30 months nocluding the 85g I flushed

Interesting. I know MDPV has a good physical safety profile (when abused though, not the best mental one ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)  ). So I figure a-pvp and a-PHP aren't much more, perhaps less harmful if at all. 


While I agree that after a few days of sobriety, food and sleep you are back to 100%, however I have noticed that the 'paranoid' effects still persist a bit, almost as though your brain is still figuring out what reality is. 


What is the longest break from them you have taken, and how much back to baseline/normal were you by the end of the break?

Also in your opinion is a-PHP more paranoia-incuding, or less? Does the 'extra careful' behavior appear sooner, or later than PVP? 


If you don't mind me asking, having been using PVP and a-PHP for about 3 years now, have you been able to maintain a functional life in society, or has it been negatively affected. Obviously you consider it preventing you from shooting H a good thing, I'm referring to jobs, friends etc. I've found the PVs to be the most self destructive drugs I have ever done, more so than heroin, but thats just my personal view. Either way glad to hear you are alright and I appreciate all the info you've posted. 


by the way, 'extra careful lifestyle' cracked me up a bit, mainly because it's too damn true. I think I might start using that when my friends and I talk about this kind of stuff.

It has been the most negative thing you can imagine besides death for me. My Father recently told me hed rather me be addicted to Heroin. Instead of a crazed manic psychopath.


The PV famil was social the first 3 months. Then turned extremely antisocial. Exitement-anxiety-panic-paranoia-psychosis-catatonia. In that order as months progressed and doses upped. Sleep time decreased.


No way was I functional. I was trafficking psychdelics and PV to sustain myself. and just barely. I wouldnt drive 15 miles for $2000 I was that fucked.


a-PHP is just as paranoid producing as a-PVP using the doses I use. vaping 60mg in 30 seconds, then another 50-60 thrn another 50-60. then 100mg all in less than 10 minutes to "get the ball rolling Bobby" will have you layig down breathing deep to catch your breath staring at windows. Wanting too masturbate but your heart cant take it. You cant get hard. You cant stop looking at the window long enough to look at the porn on your phone in your lap. DP GB sextreme. I had no job all 3 years and just in the last 2 months (after getting kicked out of a rehab for ordering a-PHP, binging and then telling management about it) got a job. been working just over 2 months. the longest I ever have. No wonder people arnt abusing PVs as rampent. you cant have a legal day job vaping 24/7. multiple girls I loved have left me, as have friends and family. It aint been easy. I didnt get it until now. Nothing will change until I do.


The extra careful behaivor is my way of life now. I double check candles, ovens, cigarettes in the ashtray. I always buckle up un the car, check for license and inssurance. Use signal and smooth driving. I still speed like a maniac sometimes. In a way its got me OCD about adult things. Rent, responsibility, accountability.


But like tomorrow. 25,000mg. Gotta bulb, tube and lighter layed out ready.

I appreciate the thoughtful response man. Sorry to hear about some of the damage it's done to a few aspects of your life. PV's & a few other drugs have definitely fucked A LOT of things up for me in the past, and even as we speak. I won't pretend my drug-created problems are as bad as the ones you described, but by any non-addicts standards, I have fucked up way to seriously and way too much. Luckily somehow I always manage to pull myself back into reality and start functioning.


I promise I won't try and derail this thread after this post. But considering I have an order of aPHP just waiting for payment, I may reconsider.


A few years back I was basically drug free for almost a year and had an awesome job. So as not to bore you I'll try and shorten this. I ended up getting back on 2FMA which made me a bit more anti social and fucked up only a couple relationships with people, other than that it created zero problems. "Decided" that I was better than my job, and quit. Since I am very good with money I had a lot of cash saved up. My plan was to live with a few of my band-mates and get as high as possible for 4 months, then stop, get a nice prestigious job again and be like everyone else.  That plan didn't go as planned. Not as much getting high as I wanted, roommates ended up not being the best roommates, and I stayed jobless until the money dissipated. 


So I said fine, stopped the drugs again, got a great job and was building back up that bank account. Well about 8 months into my new job, they started understaffing, overworking people, and treating our clients like shit. They would make me blatantly lie to a client (we didn't record calls), not give me time to edit and update their websites, and when the client got mad, management would shame me and throw me under the bus for it. So the only way I ended up being able to deal with coming to work was my Suboxone hook. One thing lead to another, I ordered some MDPV (which at the time I had never tried) and my mind was blown. Called in sick 2 days straight. Was vaping on lunch break etc. But I was still the top employee. Well, something about the MDPV triggered me again, I said fuck this, I told my manager to her face exactly why she was a scumbag human (regardless of MDPV.... she was) and quit (luckily my resume of skillsets means I have no trouble getting employed), I didn't have as much money saved this time though, was burning through MDPV and aPVP, I would visit my family for a get together, or dinner/movie, and be blacking out, micro-sleeping talking about how I know quantum physics because I read wikipedia all night. 


Ruined a few more relationships, no close meaningful ones thankfully. That's when my car started having problems. And I decided instead of fixing it, taking it in to get fixed, or dealing with all the other shit in my life.... I would just sit inside, vape, masturbate or find someone who wanted to fuck, vape more and mix it with other drugs mainly benzos. 


A month of that and things were in shambles. I had spent more money while unemployed than while working daily. Yadda yadda, more bad things happen that are blatantly my fault for going on a bender.


Since then (that was a  while back) I have once again gotten another very nice job, and make sure to take care of my important life shit. However, I still do 2-3 day PVP binges or perhaps a benzo binge here and there. Because of that my money situation isnt as great as it could be, and I am more anti social. 


From what I have read on this thread, it seems aPHP has shorter duration and while the rush isnt as good, it seems to be more fiendish and makes you want to redose more. I can take a vape hit of PVP and not need any for a solid 3-4 hours if I focus on something. Perhaps I give myself too much credit for responsibility, and probably shouldn't order this 3 grams. 


Random question: If you had the option to get either aPVP or aPHP both at the same price rates (pretend pvp is legal), in 2 sentences, which would you end up buying regularly/all the time, and why?


Best wishes to you....seriously I mean it. It seems like you know that you chose this path, and I am not judging you in the least, just hope it all works out. If you ever need to chat or rant, get support or type, make beats or whatever the fuck, PM me I'm always down to help, hell even just shoot the shit. I promise I'm not an alien-cop building a digital sailboat to come find you via Wireless-N nodes. But seriously never hesitate I mean it.


Okay I'm done derailing this thread I promise ssooooory! :D

Derailing? This kind of shit needs to be said so people can know "if you think your 1g 5 day bender was crappy.... shit gets worse." 


Fortunately I could give a fuck about it when I'm not already spun ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) Will definitely think twice before ordering another gram, though I don't really feel the need to anyway.

I know ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) and thanks. But since I have yet to try php, I don't wanna clutter up this info thread with my life problems. Tamarinds is more relevant because he has been using php heavily recently. 


The Dark Side forums are also a good resource. And while suicide prevention is definitely #1 priority and extremely important, I prefer the non-kill myself topics. 


I'm just going to leave this here:

Hahahaha


For sure, a classic in the fucking crazy fucked up place that pyrovalerone derivatives can take you to. 


Luckily I have never experienced anything more than moderate paranoia (and no delusions) which resolved immediately upon cessation, but I have also never had a serious stimulant problem, just a few short benders. That post right there is definitely a YMMV (from mine) sorta thing as shit can definitely go off the fucking walls!

Keep it that way! You sound a bit like a mature, responsible recreational drug user good sir. Hats off to you. %)


I was able to stay responsible the past week-ish (meaning with copious drugs in my possession I refrained from disappearing from reality) and am still very interested in a-PHP, I'm gonna have some come my way next wek. Especially because I purchased 5 grams (at a very good price though) of MD-PHP, and it was dissapointing. Barely stimulating, barely to not at all euphoric, and extremely paranoia inducing. Increased sex drive a tiny bit, but when you take one dose after 24 hours of no use (and good sleep/eating habits), and within 3 minutes start hearing invisible people breaking into your house you gotta contemplate flushing it.


It was definitely very impure, and while it did taste/smell like all the other PV related compounds, who knows what it was or had in it. A recrystallization (still not really 'crystal' though) & mild purification with my buddy who's an actual chemist made it a tad more potent but no change in effect. 


But aPHP seems to be in a whole different ballpark. I can't wait to report in! And I'm going to do a bit more research on making sure I don't end up sitting in front of a plate or foil for 24 hours, that's not the goal here.

brietyurl]http://i58.tinypic.com/okaq3b.jpg[/url]


not the highest quality but biggest Ive seen. Good note to end on. c


couldnt even make it 24 hours. flushed 20g. vaped 2 wasted 2 on foil preemptively Fed just in case flushing. 


1 G in a stash spot so good the Fedz will have earned it if they find it.


Not like they comin LOL.

edit


blood pressure got up to 157/113 last night. 95 bpm.


was relaxed and stretching. my roomate hit 30 over 2 hours out of an ecig and stressed himself to 146/87 85bpm.


then he expressed detaiked narratives of his life. very reflective and meaningful.


I was uncontrollably lude and rude. Walking off and ripping some foil; still genuinely listening, door to the bath room closed of course. at one point I heard hin start crying, I flushed to foil (biggest hit yet to be taken) and visually confirmed I was listening. 


after he went to sleep i kept chugging. gotta be 50-75mg every foil hit. getting really "sex feeling" literally feeling like Im having sex. And then plugging 60mg average. masturbation after that duh. (if you are this kind of person I recommened doing this (YMMV☆) I dont remomend anyone off top plugging 80mg after a 60 hit.


Oh well. I gave it a true show and really tryed. But in the end ended up flushing. I pictured a girl I DEEPLY LOVE. and how Id be letting her down so bad, shes in recovery for H and I want to show her that there is a way out. If I can make it out anyone can LOL. jonesin for that RJ Reynolds now. chuggin along but nah done with that. bet I resist it this time.  got that heat FIRED UP. 


sometimes I wonder if IV PV users have it easier. No foil crinkling, no lighter flicks and FLASHES, no tube, no black marks, less time to be spotted. Way more stealth. not bout that needle though.


bout that 'briety


edit--


-didnt take a hit-


plugged over 150 feeling relaxed and ready for bed lol

IN MY OPINION. PHP's potential lies with the intravenous route and not because i love poking myself, this more than likely will apply to the Rectum also.


PHP's problem is it's pathetic duration coupled with the smoked route means you're head first in foil all night. The IV route gives stronger longer lasting rushes with more time inbetween hits making it not only safer but more recreational. I'll smoke untill i die (seriously) so this applies to myself. This is only realistic if you take the necessary precautions and are comfortable with the needle. 

Do not IV this shit.

With this, and tamarinds most recent post, I think I'll stick to the PVP. I don't do needles, and do not intend to spend the day in front of foil. One foil hit of PVP depending on dose can do me good for 1-3 hours. Then again, if I have copious amounts in my possession, my face is in the foil so long that I end up texting people things that let's just say..... I regret texting.

Lol, more like from other stupid experiences I realized fairly quickly I'd either inadvertently end up dead or I must end up far less casual with stuff I did and a good deal more responsible. I could definitely feel how this stuff could carry significant problems. I believe I mentioned this, and I think people who love stimulants *never* feel this way: I only want more when I'm spun as fuck and it's nearly over, but after two days overwith and with plenty of money to spend and a reliable source I don't really have strong feelings to order it, and a dislike of how withdrawn I become. I always think: I'll be able to get some shit done, but honestly never do a goddamn thing.... 


Problem is I also take it too far. Stimulants are functional with lower doses and when sleep is gotten EVERY night. Past 48 hours and redosing you can become a horny, dirty freak with little effort to get there or maintain that existence, but I usually give out after a week (with 10 hours of sleep) anyway and say fuck that.

5 days max before I started to pass in and out of consciousness and talking to people who weren't there. I however never became paranoid and delusional. Not that talking to people who aren't there isn't delusional, but I am truly fucking nuts for an extended period (lasted only an hour and actually stopped.....). Had no desire to buy the since shit (a few months ago), though I did get another supposed batch another vendor and flushed it two days later because it was definitely not of similar quality and made me feel shitty and uncomfortable but not paranoid in less than 48 hours which still took a little willpower as it was still moreish. This is how I know that some people are not selling aphp. Recovery from excessive tiredness and a general joy of life (assisted with low doses of NMDA antagonists, 5-8mg of 3meopcp max daily) took about a week or two.  The tiredness may have been inflated from tapering loperamide to now 4mg/daily.

I wish that the phpBB forum system had a feature where we could "branch off" to a new thread sort of like how reddit does, except I hate reddit's 'thread' layout, if you even want to call it that. 


Anyways, tamarinds seeing as how you are SoapMcTarvish incarnate and definitely a knowledgeable guy on these compounds I will take your word on that. 

However don't go making assumptions on what I have done before, just because I mentioned I have the ability to use it sparingly. I have vaped upwards of 50+mg in a hit before, repeated 3+ times. And I would hold my hits in too, which eventually made my lungs feel worse in 4 days than tobacco had in 7 years. I'm not claiming to be some bad ass or anything. I may have been born at night, but I wasn't born last night. 


The reason I made that comment in regards to alphaPHP was because I have heard numerous users here and elsewhere claim that because of the duration of effects, you are constantly coming back for hits more often than PVP. I know just how evil PVP can be, I would go to my car at lunch/break, drive around pull out my hidden foil, coast down a street with no people/cars in sight, pull over quick, take a couple huge hits.... stash the foil and head back into work. Luckily I am able to function when it's required, so while I felt insane, I acted normal. Drugs & work have been ebbing and flowing together for me for a couple years, just never the PVs. However some people react differently. I shared some of my PVP with my buddy who always uses methamphetamine. After just a few doses, he was trying to convince me that he could create a quartz crystal radio transmitter that worked across galaxies and his premise literally contradicted the reason quartz is used for certain applications (specific resonance.) He was convinced of this after merely reading a half of a sentence on wiki pedia. I spent 45 minutes arguinig with him about why what he was saying was scientifically incorrect, and if he would take a second to actually look up the information on it, he would know he was wrong. Woke up my fucking roommate because of it. Needless to say, I wont be giving my buddy a.k.a Thomas Fucking Edison any PVP again. He would NOT SHUT UP. I had to ask him to leave the room if he didn't stop talking. 


Now I definitely do not do that anymore, simply because of safety not even legal issues. The last thing I would want is someones death, or insurance payments on my mind.... while on a PVP bender. I also have a steady benzo supply, and they actually work quite well for me with PVP. They can help me sleep when needed, or if I keep taking more of each I end up in a giant euphoric memory-loss bubble, and come back to consciousness anywhere from an hour, to 6 hours later. I'm working really hard on changing my ways, and working on filling whatever that void inside me is with something other than drugs. I may move to a new city, get a new job, it may help a lot. I've been where I am too long and its toxic to me. 


**@lolwhatzdrugz**

I could write a 5000 page novel on the 'I'm totally going to be motivated this time when I take stims, I swear!' Some stims can definitely help get shit done, but most no. It depends on a few things though: the individual's personal psychology/motivation/fiending/etc and how much + the ROA in which  you dose.


1 time oral dose of Amp, or 2FMA and I will pump you out any coded app, or song you want by the end of the day. 

Put it up my nose? You can find me either masturbating, or creating playlists of music to listen to for my next snorting session. 


MDPV when vaped suprisingly didn't motivate me, but it made me VERY creative (had a tiny bit of an enactogenic side to it for me) and I wrote like 3 songs before the bag was gone 30+ hours later. 


PVP makes you think that's how its going to be. If you really put your mind to it, it'l happen, and it makes music much more impactful. Usually though, you'll find me masturbating, hopefully finding a partner for some real sex, creating playlists, taking care of non-fun things like bills, taxes, etc haha. I always tell myself "this next hit will be the doozy that get's me writing a new song, or working on my half-way done app' and the cycle starts over. Thats when I either pop a bunch of Klonopin and/or vicodins, and pass out within 15 minutes. Or I end up 50+ hours later, still sleepless, having eaten nothing but large glasses of whole milk and water the entire time; and just like you reality dissapears, I have conversations with fake people, except I don't even control what comes out of my mouth. 


Last time I did that was about 3-4 weeks ago. Like I said I'm trying similar to you, but I have to try harder, to make some lifestyle changes. More recently, PVP gives me the same amazing effects (minus a little bit of rush cause of tolerance, its the same batch and quality) but not much paranoia. Occasionally I'll hear a possible voice outside or something, or I will be a tad bit "Careful" but the PVP days I have done here and there the past week or two, weren't bad at all, and I banged through a huge sack. 


The key is getting a good 2 weeks sober, and drilling it into your brain what sober-reality is like. That what when you are spun its easier to stay composed.


I won't lie though, my most recent 1.5 day session, I got about 1 hour of sleep, hopped back on my computer at like 5 AM, and had a huge mental brake down about how bad I am fucking up my life..... and its not just the drugs. If you put me in charge of your stocks and watching your dogs consider me the best choice. But when it comes to myself, it's like if I pretend it doesnt exist it will go away... like parking tickets, radiator coolant changes, and then they snowball. Plus I'll admit, its been a bit longer than I'd like since I got laid last, and when you are going hard on PVP its the bomb. OF COURSE the day you run out and have to deal with the fiend/come-down day, I get hit up by 2 girls to hook up, and I literally deny them because I know for a fact I wont be able to get hard, or that the sex wont be enjoyable because I have no PVP left. That's some pathetic shit man.


hahaha. See I can't do NMDA antags, those give me INSTANT pvp-reality loss/psychosis for 5-8 hours, benzos don't help, nothing helps. I've made sure to not be doing those anytime soon. But to each their own!


To sum it up:


tamarinds: I know PVP is more evil, but my issue is fiendish-ness, & constantly dosing (and increasing paranoia with it). I can handle the evil urges most of the time, but I DO NOT want to be in front of the foil all day.... unless I specifically set aside a day to go hard. 


This post was probably the least harm reduction I've written, but hopefully somebody somewhere reads it and flushes their shit.

We do sound pretty similar, but I'm down to 4mg of loperamide and after saying "no fucking more" to a ridiculous opioid habit and quitting cigarettes (still toking an ecig) I feel I could kick crack and numerous other things at once (if I did them lol).

*That* was fucking funny. It's surprising people can go south so quick. I was probably never vaping more than 10mg, 20mg MAX in a hit, but I never once became delusional until 5 days/4nights up straight, which honestly with any other stimulant I WOULD NOT be fine (not completely true with ethylphenidate I made it close to that before passing out). But ethylphenidate made me feel a lot more paranoid but not to the level of actually feeling people were coming for me, just a generally uneasiness about taking out the trash at 3am but that's about it, barely noticeable but definitely still had in the back of my mind "that is a *completely* unfounded belief. I never got to the point of putting the slides/clips in my handgun/rifle and keeping them out just "in case," or something loony like that.

^ very interesting! The PVs are literally the only stims out of probably 20 I have done/abused that even give me any paranoia at all. I could stay up on EPH or 2FMA for 5 days and still be 100% alright in that department. Very interesting! I'm glad I never let my roomate with the guns do some PVP, but that has less to do with gun and more to do with him not being all there. 


Does loperaminde really work? Never been an opiate fan, just interested scientifically.


So in your opinion, which enhances music more php or pvp, and just how big is the duration difference?

pvp was sch1 before I ever tried it so I haven't a clue. 


Yup loperamide works for sure. 


The duration of aphp is fairly long, and it IS functional if you do 10mg and NO MORE for 3-4 hours. But then you get into "I need that next hit" and despite it's long duration are vaping it near constantly which is *really* unnecessary and that's when stuff goes south.

I used similar numbers of PV though I flushed a more equal ratio to my total usage than you Tamarinds. Probably flushed more in the midst of a complete paranoid desperation. It's craziness... I had 3 years with MDPV, 2 + with A-PVP and very little was enjoyed . Sheer mindcontroling compulsion. Mixing with the right helper sometimes struck gold. APHP follows the natural progression   from my experience.

So what about the white'ish PHP compared to the brown clumpy Stuff, is there kinda worth mentioning difference between those two? Just sampled the brown Goo which was decent but far less interesting than it's Parent Compound, i.e. PV (letting aside the PVP as it's just plain and simple, well, shite...) and it seems ppl prefer the white Synth, anyone around here having some 1st Hand Experience with both of 'em?

The white crystal is the same as powder a-PVP is to crystal chunk a-PVP


Much more exciting

I find vaping is best roa. But must have benzos and some beer in the system other wise it's too jittery and paranoid .have tried crystal and white powder.if put down 3-4 hours before bed sleep comes kinda easy.

yes the crystal had more euphoria and eventually, days later more paranoia and serious life thoughts.


powder and even browb crystal was less potent. more corrosive and not as amazing

Well i've to admit i really do like a-PHP after trying another Batch (Tan Powder)! It's not only superior to shitty a-PVP but also even better than MDPV itself. It's more rushy, euphoric as PV/PVP, of which i had various Batches (especially the Peev). It's unfortunately super corrosive, even worse than a-PVP and best when insufflated, just as the Peev is (which is on the other hand super easy on the Nose).

THCified it's post like ^ that make keeping your "Never again, i'm done with stim's" promise Impossible to keep. Not your fault, the flubro aint helping either. I will be receiving quarter G Etiz and Half a G A-PVP which should be a good beginner binge. If it's more potent than PHP i'll be happy. I'd like to try PHP again though, it is rushy, competes with meth easily. I think a decent Rectal dose with a tiny amount smoked on top and you're GOOD.

Hecticus, have you used MDPV or a-PVP before? How would you compare those to meth if you had to take a quick shot at a comparison? 


One of the things I love about a-PVP is taking a couple big vape hits, and then throwing on my headphones and listening to some awesome tunes. Feels like the scene in Fear and Loathing where he hits the bulb and floats away. Would you say a-PHP is more rushy than PVP or MDPV? I've heard it may be a bit more serotonergic as well, any thoughts on that? Thanks.

Crazy, I hated the brown shit I had once, and the better stuff was white powder. Though I also tried a white powder that sucked.


FWIW tried a-PVP recently, and it's fairly chill and euphoric compared to a bit intense ofa feeling of aphp. 


It also has a crazy delayed bellringer effect from like.... 3-4mg doses. I am curious wtf is causing that, though honestly it sounds higher pitched like nitrous. Nuts cause I was doing nitrous with it, and I heard the high pitch... and then did some apvp for the first time and it sounded like the whirl of nitrous mixed with a ball peen hammer hitting an anvil echoing off each other. Nutty.

Got my a-PHP in the other day and didn't get a chance to give it a shot until today. I would like to give a shout out to my block's postal worker, without you none of this would be possible ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


 Almost my entire purchase came as one giant rock. Never seen a rock that big before. Very light (I mean very very) orangish/pinkish colored crystal rocks. I have never seen a PVP batch with that tint before, but it resembled a-PVP in all other physical regards besides tint/shade.  I will base a lot of my comparisons on a-PVP which I have the most experience with and which is one of my favorite chemicals. I've gandered with 3-4 doses so far today ~15-20, maybe a tad bit less seems about 1 dose for me. Although when my actual GOOD scale gets back to my from a friend I can give a more accurate dose amount.

     These are just my basic first impressions thus far after allergy testing the product of course:


-Chemically is melts and vapes better than a-PVP and much better than the MDPV I have tried. However it takes about double the time for anything to start vaporizing and therefore taking big sized hits means sucking in almost twice as long as you are used to. 

-Tastes extremely similar to a-PVP, nearly identical. Melts similar, although doesn't trail quite as nicely, and personally in this one and only instance I have found the PV chems to work much better with foil for vaping.

-Vapor is extremely more harsh than anything else I have ever vaped. Usually after a PVP stint lasting 2-3 days my lungs start to ache a bit and I can feel the abuse they are taking. This stuff produced that same effect after 4 hits. By the end of the day when I was ready to go to bed my lungs felt blacker than Wesley Snipes after a vacation to the Bahamas. 

-Hunger is DECREASED more than with both a-PVP and MDPV but once you set the drug down, hunger comes back much quicker in comparison. Along with that, stomach discomfort seems increased a bit compared to the others. Stomach discomfort subsides slowly, and is a bit annoying to say the least. Usually any discomfort I get from ``

-Not much of a "rush" (for me at least), and any rush I did manage to capture was considerably less than with a-PVP. Comparable [or less than] an MDPV rush.

-Takes a tad bit longer than a-PVP to really start to set in, but quicker than MDPV. It took about 3 minutes for a "good" high to be noticeable, and about 7-8 for it to seems strong and peak-like.

-Definitely less potent per MG. Stimulation-wise I would say 10mg a-PVP == ~15+mg a-PHP

-Stimulating but not as tweaky a-PVP, especially at first. Keep in mind that some of us prefer the tweaky kind of stimulation. I didn't buy this stuff to study or work on it. I bought it for fun. After about 10 minutes when it's in full effect it certainly gets more tweaky, but still doesn't quite top out as high as a-PVP does in that regard.

-More head-high thrown in than a-PVP. 

-A bit less dry mouth than with a-PVP.

-I felt it was heavier on my heart than the other two PV's. Take that as you will however, I have been sober (besides a beer here and there) for about 15 days and I could be physically bias at the moment. 

-Sex drive mildly increased, less than both PVP and MDPV. I would place it similar to 2-FMA, maybe even a bit less. Although I will note that so far all PxP sex drive is much more carnal and animalistic than the sex drive I get from amphetamines or even cathinones. 

-Creativity boost seems the same as a-PVP, and less than MDPV. MDPV definitely gets my musical writing juices flowing considerably stronger than its non-MD bridged counter parts. 

-Anxiety per dose equal to a-PVP

-Paranoia per dose the same as a-PVP. Get to paranoid levels with fewer doses (keeping in mind I'm only 3-4 deep). Will report on benzo's and their effect later, I wanted to try aPHP vanilla first. 

-Euphoria definitely less than a-PVP, even MDPV I would say at the moment. Still euphoric I guess, but its much more subtle than I would have hoped. 

-Comedown was less crappy than a-PVP, and when I was away from the drug for 5+ hours with some friends jamming some music, I didn't become as irritable or fiendish as I did with a-PVP in the same situation. THAT SAID: it still has a shitty fucking comedown. Please understand this, it has a crappy come down, just not quite as crappy as PVP.


I'll report one more time probably in a day or so once I got a better feel for the chem. I wanted to write a first impression post because first impressions (especially after a sobriety period) can always end up being deceiving and I wanted you guys to see any differences between the two write-ups as well as just have the information at hand to reference. 


Update:

After a half a days worth of messing with this chem (vaping only) nothing I said above has really changed. As far as a "retrospective" thus far I would say.... [keeping in mind that its definitely possible I had a crap batch]


I can see why this would be considered the first go-to as an a-PVP replacement, and I can definitely see how a few people could prefer it over the other PVs, or say it has less come down. It's similar to a-PVP in a lot of respects, but doesn't have the same amount euphoria or rush. The "good" effects don't last as long as PV, and the residual seems the same. I personally found it actually a bit more paranoia inducing, although getting sleep and dealing with the comedown are a bit easier if you actually have the intention of not dosing again. a-PVP definitely has more of a "fuck it let's break shit!" mentality than this however, which I guess is a good thing?


 I much prefer a-PVP, but I would settle for this if need be I guess. I don't plan on getting anymore in the future, and remember to treat your lungs well, this stuff will make them ache! 


Peace.

what did it look like? what did it taste like? how did it burn when you vaped it, & what was the residue like that it produced from vaping?

Now you're asking more than I remember, but I threw it away rather quickly. The only good stuff was in the form of a white crystally powder.

So far not impressed at all after an almost day long go with the stuff.  The very first hit you take is the one and only time you will get any meaningful rush, followed by euphoria decent stimulation, sex drive increase etc as I mentioned in my previous post. After that the next few hits and doses are decent, but the pleasure you feel is really from that first 1-2 hits. After that, nothing besides harsh vapor even when burned correctly.

Iv'e tried a-pbp a few years back and remember it being about as euphoric, maybe more as it had my jaw going like.. well you know. Never played with their cousins. I have about have about half a point left out of a gram of php I got in the mail today. Did about a point before and through work.  I vaped nearly all of it in under five hours after work.  

I feel kind of, no reeally weirdly high that requires motion to really feel. If I get up and walk around a bit I feel it more. Light brown to tan and clumpy. I have the feeling I may have wasted a bunch after reading that it loses it if it turns amber.  I made a bulb and have been going to town but I heated it to the point it turned to the amber liquid. A gram of Prolitane lasts me longer when vaped.  

I honestly feel like I could sleep now.  I feel a serotonic component, but ,mostly dopamine with little norepep at all.  Morish, which is odd because the high isn't really that intense.  Like I said though, nearly all of it turned amber and the flavor changes from kind of soft and sweet to something different and a bit harsher. 

Iv'e read this entire thread while using and see that my batch may be inferior. I ordered from a decent vendor that I've gotten some good mxe and eti from but from what I've read here and given that I have no stim tolerance, it must not be that good.  

My lungs hurt a little but I could see how it could get bad.  I started with foil then made a bulb but then switched back over to foil and I cant say I can tell a difference.  The substance does have a decent little rush to it.  I stress decent and little, but enough to have me chasing 90% of a gram in under six hours. I agree that their does seem to be a ceiling with this one.  I remember being more buzzed off of pbp. I'm having no trouble typing and believe I could pull off work right now, stress "I BELIEVE". I may actually be a tweaking mess if I actually had to go in now.  Seriously though I would probably have an anxiety attack as I had some minor paranoia during work.

When I'm applying heat I cant seem to find a point where I'm getting decent hits without turning it amber.  Did I waste it all?  I don't ever post but I figured I throw my two cents in. I've had limited experience with meth, went on one good bender that was out of this world, super sexual.  I don't find any prosexual component with this.  I would turn into a porn freak on Prolintane, but I'm a sexual person. 

I recently started cymbalta so if anyone knows how that would play I'd be interested to hear it.  I took 30 miligrans of cymbalta about 15 hours ago.  It has a relatively short half life but has strangely muted my sex drive so It may be blocking any prosexual effects. I dunno. Thank you for all the info, all I had read before was that it was only good when vaped.  Now I'm wondering If I just wasted it.  Anyone beside skeeter notice that it gets destroyed when it turns amber.

While working I was quite stoned but was able to control my urges to talk and be goofy.  I was definitely high though as my judgement was impaired to the point that I was doing little lines and taking big foil rips in the john, which is just cray for me to do.  Stims make me brave though.  I do have the will to save this last half a point for the morning.  Maybe I'll get a decent rush out of it if I can figure out how to vape this right, I vape everything. I love the rush, but don't we humans all.  

What do you think I should do with this last half point, sublingual, insulfated, swallowed or vaped? Never put anything in my butt before so that makes me kind of nervous. Probably would end up hurting myself if it works as good as everyone says.

Send it my way, I'll make sure it gets dealt with properly. Don't worry I will give you constant updates. 


Thank you for your detailed post, it was a bit hard to read/decipher at times though, perhaps do a proof-read before posting. 


A-PHP can technically be cause decent, but in all honesty I definitely won't be buying more. It turns dark too quick, too hard to get any good rush or euphoria.


My guess is with the exception of a couple dozen people, most of those saying "aphp is the greatest evar" just have had no experience with good chems, and no frame of reference. But thats a judgmental generalization no doubt

Well this has been a new problem in over seas research chemicals, demdex mites. I found them in a-php and a-pvp. I wouldn't say from where cause it will be erased from the site. But the mites cause rosacea and oddly enough they grab on to your hair and eye lashes. I thought I was going nuts. I could see the powder had little tiny whAt look like public hair of an elf that is attach to a clump of the chemical. If you drop some in water and little black hair ,tiny ones float around, they are there. 

 They cause itching and attach to your skin, I don't want to think what shooting or snorting them does?.

I love the smell of most of these chemicals mixed it water. See I carry a nasal spray mixed with all kinds of stims I have tried over the months. A-php smells awesome to me to a none user it apparently smells like urine. 

   Be careful in the last 3 batch of a-php I found little hard that were attached to a microscopic worm, everyone thought I was crazy , till the doctors do I rd democracy mites on my skin attached to my arm hair, it came from a popular site that just changed it's name from a lady's first name starting g with D labs, to initials 3 consonants.

Assuming that's true, which I doubt given your description and diction.... why would you keep ordering more? I mean, if a drug is giving you, whether real or imaginary skin mites I would say it's time to chill out and take a break. 


What is a "democracy mite"?

Edit:I know that there is no sourcing but the company you speak of has ZERO quality control from what I understand.^


After 80+ hours without sleep God was kind enough to send three police officers into my work place on an unrelated matter causing me to freak out and destroy the remainder of my gram thus slowly giving myself a chance to regain my sanity. I was gifted 1000 mgs of the amber shaded crystals that turn white when busted up. I stayed away from vaping as I did( mostly) did with mdpv as I enjoy the act of consuming the drug as much as the effects. The crystal was really hard to insufflate. It reminded me a lot of the really good coccaine I used to get that seemed as if it wasn't all the way dry as when you try to bust up a lump it just sticks together in smaller pieces.

I know who you guys are speaking of and yes zero quality control. However being awake for 80 hours and flushing your stash has absolutely nothing to do with worms and mites being possible contaminants of a-PHP batches nor does it relate to their quality control. 


I have yet to come across a hydrophilic batch of a-pvp or a-php. However, I saw a couple MDPV batches like that. 


Anyways, I'm seeing way too many posts pop up about parasites and worms in their a-PHP or a-PVP. I find it highly unlikely, especially democracy mites attached to arm hair. 

Stop tweaking for 5 days, prime examples of why all the good chems got banned we can't control our shit. a-PHP was whack anyways, pretty worthless. Like the retarded incest bred cousin of MDPV.

If you read the wiki article than you would know that you cannot see them with the naked eye, and that most young adults have them, living on your face. A 2014 study had everyone they tested showing positive for mite dna. So your sniffing them all day. No big deal, if you literally saw a pubic hair than it was probably a pube. You need some sleep bro!

I just have to tell you how did the baking powder you add to mdpv and a-pvp not carry off in your problem with the aphp turning to Amber to fast. Adding baking soda is a must once anything turns in to mottle lava pv . Baking soda not just for... wait what else is baking soda for.lol. smoked A-php and pv-9  reasonantly and wonder if any one could direct me to any I.do on experiences of injecting.g pv-8. And why has no one e talked about pv-9 or 3,4-somethings-A-php?

Hey guys, sorry if this was already mentioned but I searched through a few pages to no avail: does anyone have any reagent test results for their a-PHP? 


I just got some but marquis result showed no reaction whereas I would have expected a yellow color change, though of course this may not be the case. The vendors site has people unanimously complaining that the product is not actually a-PHP (though it was some mild and generally enjoyable substance of unknown identity) so I figured I'd come around and ask about it. I have not personally assayed the substance yet, and I have honestly never consumed any cathinones of the MDPV/a-PVP variety so my thoughts on its effects probably wouldn't be all that useful in determining whether or not it was a-PHP.


edit: appearance is off-white chunky crystals (I know appearance cannot be used to identify a drug, just mentioning!)

Can anybody explain to me the effects on speech after abuse, or even just a 1 nighter? It may be due to disorganized thoughts but after a short fling i talk slow and have trouble getting the correct words out. This seems unique to Alpha-PVP and Alpha-PHP(the only ones i've tried). This effect would last up to half a day after or untill i slept, both for me and my friend. I've gone harder on other stimulants and have never gotten this effect.

Nothing like that, I have experienced an extreme uncomfort in my stomach if I dose on a full stomach. Like when you take a gagger of some good blow on an empty stomach. Notice this less with vaping more so with oral and intranasal ROA' s but still present overall.

Hey fellas


Im wondering is anyone else experience a really sharp tolerance increase?


Its my fourth day (spaced out every 2 days) with this chemical and it seems like the rush from the first hit is becoming less and the anxiety is becoming more. In the very beginning the rush was very very good and I was able to go for a little while on it without it becoming dull, but now like I said first hit and nothing is really happening and then I get shakey and anxious.

Welcome to the world of stimulant tolerance, this seems about right for most stimulants, you needa wait longer.

Wow then how do most of you guys use your stimulants? I am more of an opiate guy converted stims so Im new to this but I can't imagine anyone upkeeping a daily addiction if the euphoria taps out by the end of one standard binge? Do people really take constant breaks in between? I can't imagine thats how most stimulants are enjoyed, though Im apparently going to have to do that for this chem because I am at this point lacking any positive effects from it and anything close to a big-ish dose just produces extreme negative effects.

I am more of an opiate guy converted stims so Im new to this but I can't imagine anyone upkeeping a daily addiction if the euphoria taps out by the end of one standard binge?

Most heavy stimulant users just do it constantly regardless of the loss of euphoria even with high doses. It still postpones the inevitable crash so they get sucked into a loop.


IT's variable, generally even if I binge for a bit I'll take a couple week break to recover, otherwise it just isn't worth it.

After using roughly 500mg in the last 48 hours ive come to the conclusion the only way to enjoy is to limit yourself to either 100mg of either up the nostril or 100mg on foil. Or for a all nighter n next day er do 100mg of one the first night n the other night. With intraanasal all the euphoria and rush comes in those first 4 or 5 lines. Vape on foil im still missibg a llt of smkke but after a few real heavy n hits im not getting anywhere v ack to that level of blism

it can be made as crystals which are tan or the powder which is white.  powder is said to be less powerful.  hear that this compound can be pretty strong regardless.  using evidence from previous postings side effects compared to speed more than coke

As far as vaping goes, I always use Hookah Charcoal, never foil or glass bulb. Just drop your RC on the red hot coal; I use the tip of an E-xacto blade; and it is immediately and completely turned to a stream of smoke which I inhale with a glass tube. Works perfectly for the job and the coals are cheap. I usually get 6 pie-shaped pieces of coal out of one round briquette.

The crystals are hard to work with unless you're vaporizing it(something I refuse to do after mdpv). A pyrex dish and razor blade.are needed. A good comparison is the lumpy not so dry coke that is really hard to cut up but it is definitely worth the work as long as you're responsible.

I gotta say. I have vaped that stuff a shit-ton and the comedown is pretty chill.


sadly the euphoria lasted for me like 30min and was stimmed for max 2-3h.


i prefer a-pvp when I go raving since I vape before I go and feel no urge to redose or only do some small bumps of coke.

Female, 205 lb, first time trying alpha PHP ... I insufflated about 10mg of it. It burned like hell and it made me really nauseous for quite a while (which put me into a sour mood). It's very effective in that I feel "up" and "awake" but I don't like that everything around me is irritating me when normally it wouldn't. I have no motivation to do anything, but I'm very up, so basically I'm sitting here bored and getting pissed off. Also feeling jittery. It's not great.

any links to binding affinity or more information on the pharmacology of this fine compound? A friend of mine well versed in stimulants has observed a reverse tolerance effect. I've also read of speculation of there being some SE activity? This is probably the last stimulant i am going to try recreational, after years of stimulant abuse i am finding the experience more and more dull especially compared to something like mephedrone, methcathinone or even a classic psychedelic. Is this just my brain burning out or am i actually growing bored of the primary effects being simply euphoria, focus, and sometimes motivation? has this occurred with anyone else? 


I feel exactly like the poster above me... i mean i could do something but i don't even feel like doing anything but sitting here and getting frustrated about it. In any case i will be trying a-php soon as i must know how it compares to 3-4 CTMP.

This is absolutely my favorite stimulant these days. I have been off hard drugs for a long time (meth and cocaine), but recently I began getting that craving for a good stimulant. Not wanting to turn back to illegal drugs, I looked into the RC market and found a-php. I was skeptical that it would be effective, but it turned out to be amazing. There is very little euphoria, which is important for me after my past addiction to meth. It's just a nice clean stimulation that lasts for hours. I would equate it to having a lot of caffeine without the jitters. I previously posted a negative experience with a-php the first time I used it, because I made a mistake and it made me very, very sick to my stomach. I weighed out what I thought was 10mg on a digital scale without realizing that my scale only measures in hundreds of milligrams, and I insufflated that dose. I'm putting the bad side effects down to taking way too much by accident.


After that I decided to try vaping it in much smaller amounts out of a freebase pipe. It was wonderful. I immediately had a lot of energy and motivation. The only negative I have to say about this is that it seems to be very addictive. The desire to redose is ridiculous. I had only intended to dose a maximum of three times that night over the course of several hours, but I ended up having a 24-hour binge in which I ran through my entire supply. So, if you're considering using a-php, be aware that you'll need a lot of self-control. Maybe even separate out what you're going to use and put the rest away so you won't be tempted, and set a very strict time limit for yourself. I kept it by me and found it impossible after the first two doses to not keep hitting the pipe. I managed to counteract this somewhat by putting the amount of one dose in the pipe and then vaping it gradually over the course of a few hours, instead of hitting it all at once like I did the first few times. That way I was only putting a new bowl in every 4+ hours.


I'm lucky enough that I didn't suffer any of the crazy paranoia that can apparently present on a binge, and I think that's because I was very aware it could happen and made myself go to sleep before that could set in. If you're finding it difficult to sleep, I'd recommend a benzo to calm you down. I have some prescribed to me and 0.5mg of lorazepam does the trick. You'll want benzos on hand anyway in case you accidentally take too much and start to feel jittery and out of control, like I did when I insufflated it. Obviously, if you're having a serious overdose you need to go to the ER right away, but for a minor case of taking too much, a benzo or two should work. I hope this has been helpful and will aid in reducing harm to anyone else who is looking to try this.

Without going into my personal experience with this chemical, I'm here to tell/warn you about some properties of this chemical that I couldn't find mentioned in this thread yet, very much to my surprise. 


First of all, most of this very likely applies to all the similar ones like a-pvp etc.


The temperatures for the different states of matter are very close to each other and in crystal/powder form only slightly above room temperature. Once molten, the vaporizing temp is below room temperature. How the fuck has nobody noticed this yet? 


The complications/proof: Have none of you crushed some of it and then noticed a very thin film on the surface you crushed it on? The heat generated from the pressure from crushing it is enough to melt some of it. You can scrape the surface afterwards and you'll get your powder back. 


Ever put some on foil and melted it? Go ahead, keep it off the flame for HOURS and it will eminate a barely visible amount of smoke, only visible when theres no airflor in your room and in front of a black background. The same applies to the brown vapid residues, no matter how dark they are burnt. What ever is left behind and cant be vaporized has a slow chemical reaction with something in the air below room temperature. Is nobody concerned about that brown residue that can't be vaped? If you keep it on the flame until theres no more smoke, its nothing but charcoal. It makes me want to not take this in any other form but vaping, just to avoid this nasty stuff, whatever it is.


I was never high or hallucinating on anything and observed this throughout 3 days. Even the straws used for vaping at some point had smoke coming out of them a day after usage and nowhere near a heat source.


You can try your own batch quite simply: Put your index finger tip in the bag and take out whatever sticks. Rub it against your thumb to generate some heat and hold your finger in front of a dark surface. 5 seconds later I saw very thin, white smoke. Might take a little longer so don't look away after 5 seconds, look at least 30 seconds. 


At some point I even saw smoke coming from the folds of my wallet, upon investigation, I noticed very little remains of the powder because apparently I must have put a card back in before cleaning it but oddly enough I don't remember it. 


If you do thick and heavy inhales and exhale some smoke aswell, be wary where you exhale it on. The smoke is very thick and wet and solidifies immedietaly on whatever it hits. You can coat your furniture with this stuff.


If your room temperature is 25°C+, I would store it in the refridgerator. Though I don't know how this reacts to colder temps, so do your research first.


If this has already been talked about in here, my apoligies but I thought skimmed every page quickly.


And to just throw in my evaluation of this: I would consider it purely a stimulant that needs tapering for thecomedown and cannot be taken multiple days in a row (sleep deprivation, zero appetite, havent had a single urge to have a smoke ever since my first line and I used to smoke multiple cigs before that day). Residual stimulation keeps you awake many hours into the comedown and even stronly sedative benzos didn't help much. I will never take this stuff again without being off it a for a couple days completely. I'll do more research when I'm positive everything of this is out and I'll be even more careful

Interesting observation, after binges my room would stay foggy for days despite opening windows and airing the place out. I was paranoid as shit thought that the foil was still emitting smoke, realized how paranoid and ridiculous that sounded and figured it was just residual paranoia. Guess i know it wasn't

Good find

I'm unwilling to share this on forums like reddit, but since you found BL and are already touching the surface, I feel obliged to inform you:

I know this sounds crazy and it is but when you really binge on it for a while, and sub room temperatures are not required, on some occasions your body it self vaporizes...![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)


This is a mesmerizing attribute and still a mystery to most. This is a bonus when you would like to be able to walk through walls and other objects that (under normal circumstances) appear as solids unhindered. 


Ofcourse pre-treating target surfaces with exhaled a-php is a good idea, but thread with caution not to give rise to dangerous or unintended situations like permanent states of diffusion. 

Usually as a rule of thump, the mist is an indicator of either dosing to frequenty for too long or poor ventilation.


Remember to take a benzo and get some sleep every other day or so.

Most of the following information is available here and there in various posts on different forums, but I thought I would consolidate the information for the sake of convenience, as well as adding my own experience to the mix.


There is no drug out there that is completely safe. However, there are a lot of things you can do to minimize your risk with drug use. I'm going to share the following experience in the hope that others will use the information for harm reduction. I did a lot of research before doing this, and it wasn't my first time using alpha-PHP, so please keep that in mind.


For a beginner the most important thing is an allergy test. You should also do one for every single batch of anything you receive, because you never know if your vendor/dealer has given you a different product than before. It may be cut with something or be an entirely different substance altogether that was sold to you by accident or intentionally.


To do an allergy test, take a very, very small amount of whatever it is you're using (in the case of a-PHP I would suggest between 1-5mg at most) and either insufflate it or put it on your tongue, though I must warn you it tastes foul. Wait several hours to make sure you don't have a negative reaction.


Once you're certain you're not allergic, the next step is to figure out the ideal dose and route of administration (ROA). I would not under any circumstances recommend IVing this, even if that's your usual gig. There's not enough known yet about the toxicity of this compound and how much damage it could do to your veins. Some people plug it, some people insufflate it (though it's said to be very harsh on the nose and even likely to cause tissue damage with prolonged used).


My personal method is to vaporize it using an oil burner, also called a freebase pipe but most popularly known as a meth pipe. You could use the dull side of tin foil if you're broke or can't get your hands on proper glassware, but again I wouldn't recommend it. It's too easy to burn and trying to vape it off foil would likely be very wasteful unless you're extremely skilled in this method. Another thing to bear in mind, never use the shiny side of foil. EVER.


Now for dosage ... You need to know your body weight and level of experience with stimulant compounds. The easiest way is to convert your body weight to kg and go from there. If you're not a math whiz, just Google "lb to kg" and a handy calculator will pop up. For a beginner with no stim tolerance or no experience I would recommend using no more than 0.1-0.2mg/kg of body weight.


This is where an accurate milligram scale comes in handy. Don't use one that only measures to 0.1g accuracy. You need AT LEAST 0.01 accuracy, but 0.001 is ideal. They're cheap if you look on eBay, so there's no excuse for not having one if you value your safety.


For someone with experience, but not a regular user, I would recommend the 0.3-0.5mg/kg range. This is what I use, and I've never had a problem. For a heavy user (and I don't recommend this for several reasons) you can go up to 0.8mg/kg. I would advise extreme caution though since so little is known about this substance, and if used too much, too quickly, or too often, it could prove to be very cardiotoxic.


You need to remember to eat, even though the idea will be very unappealing, and you must drink lots of water so you don't get dehydrated. This is important. You should also check your pulse regularly. I usually check mine twice an hour to make sure my heart rate hasn't elevated beyond an acceptable range. The average resting heart rate for an adult is between 60 to 100 beats per minute.


This can be figured by taking your pulse for 15 seconds (I use the timer on my cell phone) and then multiplying the number of beats by four. I find that my pulse tends to stay between 96-100 beats per minute on a-PHP, with a maximum reading of 104 in my sessions. You need to know what the healthy heart rate is for your age. You can find calculators for that online. To find your maxium heart rate, subtract your age from 220. I would advise you to never let your heart rate get anywhere near your maximum. If it does, you need to call 911.


Now you know dosage, ROA, heart rate, and a few other safety precautions. One more thing you need to watch out for is vasoconstriction. Most stimulants cause them to some degree, some worse than others. I only get mild vasoconstriction, even though I also smoke and nicotine is a vasoconstrictor, but some people get it bad. This is where a vasodilator comes in handy. There are all kinds of guides around about vasodilators, and you should familiarize yourself with them and keep something handy in case you need it.


My remedy of choice is a very small amount of 80 proof (40 percent) vodka, around 1/2 shotglass. Be careful you do not take alcohol in large amounts when using stimulants. Not only is this very bad for your organs, but it can actually INCREASE vasoconstriction. A lot of people seem to prefer cayenne pepper for their vasodilator.


I cannot stress enough that you need to be careful with how often you take this stuff. I wait two hours between each dose because I know that's what works for me. If you don't have experience with this compound already, wait longer. Safe trumps dead every time. While I don't condone binging, I understand that it's going to happen, so my advice is to give yourself a strict time limit if you're planning on a binge. Please don't binge for longer than 24 hours or you will likely have some very negative consequences.


If you're naturally prone to anxiety or have a history of getting anxious and/or paranoid while using drugs, then you should keep some benzos on hand. If misused, a-PHP will turn you into an anxious mess. Benzos will help with that and also help with the comedown if you're having trouble sleeping.


I'm not going to go into any great depth with ROAs other than vaporizing. To vaporize a-PHP, place the amount you're going to use into a clean, dry, glass pipe (I find using a plastic straw that's been cut at an angle useful). GENTLY heat the ball of the pipe using a lighter until the drug begins to melt into a clear puddle. DO NOT let the flame touch the glass!!!


DO NOT keep a lighter lit for longer than 10 seconds. It's very, very dangerous, not to mention you could burn yourself. I keep a torch lighter and a minimum of 4 regular BIC lighters on hand for this very reason. The fastest, easiest way is to do the initial melting with the torch lighter (AT LEAST one inch below the glass). Then switch to a regular lighter to heat it up further, and as you're doing so, begin to gently tilt the pipe side to side until you see vapor beginning to swirl.


Inhale gently while continuously swirling the pipe. I switch lighters after every inhale to avoid breaking the 10 second rule (and also because I value my fingers). So be smart, okay? A helpful tip is to make sure your ceiling fans are turned off and that you're not sitting under an A/C vent. Ideally the air around you should be still so the flame won't be battered every which way, thus reducing your risk of burning yourself or your drugs.


I hope this has been helpful and that everyone will heed the warnings I have given.

I suspect this whole paragraph is a great oxy moron, simply because after some fairly extensive research of my own, and a few nights of INTENSELY compulsive dosing with this substance, I have repeatedly experienced visual hallucinations. A couple of times I pulled my car over because I was convinced the cabin was filling with smoke or vapor of some sort. (Yes, I realize how irresponsible it is to drive under the influence of any substance. EXCUUUUUSE ME!) Turned out not to be real. The visual hallucinations seem to manifest as an ever present smoke or vapor.


This is stuff sticks around in your system for a long time. My last session compulsively stretched on for hours in the bathroom with the ventilation fan running. I actually have no idea how long I was in there in a continuous vaping session. I hallucinated that my brother and his girlfriend were outside the bathroom door begging me to come out, but it turns out they were gone the whole night. For days after, whenever the air conditioning would turn on, the humming of the fan sound like strange ethereal music.


Two days after this vaping session, I was afflicted with the most terrible panic attacks I've ever experienced. I was out of etizolam at this point, and could barely manage it. This lasted for two whole days and lingered for three after that. I almost checked myself into the ER at one point because I was convinced I was going to die. 


I strongly suspect the smoke you are seeing is actually a lingering hallucination. I don't think smoke would be really lingering a day after vaping, and I've experienced smoke like hallucinations from aphp many times.

I personally don't enjoy stimulants much but i do enjoy trying new things whether or not I expect to enjoy them. I've tried eph, mdpv, various cathinones, and a lot of empathogenic stimulants and I have to say, aPHP is hands down my favorite. Granted I vaporize which provide a HUGS dopamine rush on par with allowing me to nod off almost in pure ecstasy. Not overly stimulating, doesn't last long, perfect for my needs. Tolerance does build and can use more than a day in s row if that befor you lose that initial rushes usually it's that first incredible rush and then maintains an nice pleasant very euphoric stimulation. But that first rush. Just rocks my world. 

Good thing i could never use needles or this may have s been another problem on par with heroin. 2 years clean  opiates no looking back. But much prefer php to mdpv bc mdpv gives me no euphoria, just straight energy, almost usually overwhelmingly so. 

So that's my 2 $.02 ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Got 2 grams, big orange moonrocks of a-PHP. After telling myself how responsible I'd be and that I'd only dose when necessary like for when I'm tired or need to get work done. Needless to say, I ended up awake for one week straight with barely any food, threatened to kill my dad for asking what I was on, then ran miles down the road in my pajamas in 90 degree weather, idk how I didn't die or pass out, my shirt smelt like that nasty typical pyrrolide scent you may recognize from other similar pv compounds. The cops were called by my dad telling them I was smoking bath salts and I waa let go because I seemed fine and they let me leave with friends, I honestly thought this might have been more forgiving than a-PVP but nope. Also the methylenedioxy version of this (MDPHP) has known to destroy muscle tissue and ever since I used a-PHP, which was over a month ago, my body has been sore especially the muscles in my legs, I never have body pain either so just be careful, this shit could be as bad or worse than MDPHP in terms of toxicity. 


Also anyone notice a-PVP, a-PHP etc are getting more popular like in Florida being sold as "Gravel", I told one of my ice dealers I had a-PHP and he was begging me to throw it away saying he's seen someone he knew that started using it and made them a mess and that their flesh was rotting away from using Gravel, I've never heard of a-PVP causing such dangerous effects outside of media bullshit. There must be some extremely impure toxic pyrovalerone chemicals being sold on the street these days. 


Personally after an ER visit from MDPV years ago, family issues from my drug use, irresponsibility, addictive nature and that last a-PHP insane nightmare, I am done fucking with these chemicals. Even when I used them properly at low doses, extreme anxiety, paranoia, and panic attacks would occur after 20 minutes of enjoyable effects. a-PHP would have me unable to catch my breath most of the time while on it. I'd take a hit of it from my meth pipe and have to lay down for 2 minutes to catch my breath. I know my dosing wasn't the issue, I've used MDPV when I was 14 years old, tried replacements over the years, and knew everything about these chemicals and how bad too high of a dose will twack you out. My friend agreed that one hit instantly gave breathing problems.  My advice? Stay away from the pyrrolidemons. Stick to reliable friendly methamphetamine if you're a frequent stim user. I only used these horrible chemicals because of how cheap they are, and I became addicted to how intense the sex drive is, I'd stay up forever just watching porn or fucking my girl all night from how that shit could turn me into a pornstar lol, MOST of you pv users can relate. Stay safe with this kinda shit, it WILL make you it's bitch when you think you're in control.

Can confirm Florida is completely awash with a-pvp and other dangerously impure related compounds. This shit is destroying lives and is cheaper than a pack of cigs on the street.


I now live in Broward, and here we have a BSO task force called the "flakka squad." (flakka/gravel = a pvp here) they are ruthless and will have u pulled out of ur socks in three seconds if you get caught leaving a known area. I'm telling you guys, as surprised as I am to say this...  Most of the side effects of prolonged abuse are not media hype. I was able to shoot some and only did it once. The comedown was atrocious and even after the heroin wore off I still had that unmotivated, suicidal ideation that no other comedown from a drug can induce.

"As is the case with many drugs sold on the street, the people who take flakka often don't know exactly what they're smoking, snorting, or injecting. The labs that create these compounds are often attempting to modify chemicals in order to get around the DEA's list of banned substances said Broward Sheriff's Office spokesperson Gina Carter. "In order to skirt the system, dealers alter the molecular structure by adding other substances to it," Carter said. "It could be anything, which means no one really knows what users are ingesting or how their body will react to it."

Lol. As if dealers are doing home chemistry to alter a-pvp into something legal. At least vice interpreted what she said into a partially comprehensible statement. 


It's interesting to me that a-pvp is being touted as "flakka" rather than just "bath salts."

Yeah i can vouch for this. Just got some a-php and have been using iv ROA from the start, and now im almost at the end of my gram so i did what i normally do for other stims, double the last dose because otherwise i didn't think i would even feel it. But that was a huge mistake! I started to hallucinate almost instantly. and i more than felt it. i've been eyeballing doses all night but i would probably say my last shot was around 100mg or so. Which is way too much at any stage of using this drug. It went away in like 20 minutes, but it was fucking intense  man. I saw moths crawling around on my floor and when i turned on the lights to investigate further, they were just peices of cotten, and than they stopped moving. So i turned off the lights again and went to my cpu to write this lol. This drug is by far not one of my fav's. I got a  g of EPH a few days ago and it was 100x better.

**Reagent testing for a-PHP?**


What would be the proper reagent test for a-PHP?  

Would it be the Marquis reagent turning yellow, as it would for MDPV and other pyrovalerones?    ![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)

So this will be my first post here at bluelight. I've never been one to post on any of the forums but I truly feel that this is needed information regarding Alpha-PHP and the adverse health issues that have arose over my past 3 and a half week vapor binge of 5 grams crystal.


This compound has been the least harsh to handle for me as for re-dosing, I don't feel I absolutely must but just want to. Secondly I've found it to be the least of the other cathinone analogues to produce euphoria in the way such chemicals as MDPV or A-PVP have in my past 3 years of research with this specific group of rc's. I'm confident that this one is the cleanest and easiest to handle when it comes to social anxiety or anxiety in general. However, I do have some issues that I have found nowhere else in any forum, study (Government, Pharm, etc.), or any other source.


I'll explain this with the full story from day 1 to this very moment I am sitting here in my floor typing this taking occasional breaks to vape the substance. This will be my last night of experimentation with this substance and in no way condone nor do I suggest trying it in any form of consumption on humans. This research was gathered for long term binge, at mild doses, via vaporization to see if any adverse problems arose.


BEFORE EXPERIMENT STATISTICS

Info/stats test subject: Myself

Weight: 55.791 kg's

Height: 6 ft 1 inch's

Age: 19

Health issues: None

Smoker/Drinker: Yes


Day 1: Received my first pure batch of A-PHP with 5g's present in the package. ALL CRYSTAL. All I could think was fuck yes. This shits bout to be the cats potatoes son!!!! I had used MDPV before as well as PVP crystal and powder and PVP PHP mixture powder but never straight crystal only PHP. I ate a few things before cause I knew I would be binging, and eating after that was out the door till the next day when I needed a tolerance break for a few hours. I began my first dose without scaling which I have never done with any of cathinone an's when it came down to vaping. Just throw in a crystal and go at it. My vape method was both foil and a glass rose (Meth pipe, chillay, bulb pip, oil burner) but more the pipe then anything. Just a cleaner taste and easier cleanup. Anyways first hit. INSTANT NAUSEA!! The feeling took me back but the taste took my stomach back to the highschool locker-room. Just disgusting but sure enough I was hooked to that taste after the first rip.

(STOPPED FOR VAP HIT)

I had told some friends I was getting it and wanted them to try it so they came over and each took a hit hating it and saying it had a repulsive scent making me and my home smell of bleach filled sweaty socks. They left and I continued to re-dose sitting in my floor in this exact spot I am now listening to music taking the occasional cigarette break or restroom break. So we can go ahead and skip the next 20 days cause that is literally all I did. I managed maybe about 72 hours of sleep in that time and at least one meal or half a meal a day with lots of fluids being consumed. As for the paranoia or hallucinations I am very used to it from the others so I just ignore it and put all my things away in my safe before lying down at night, taking a short break to go somewhere, or whatever I must do.

(VAPED AGAIN)

So the timing was perfect because I had been laid off from my job for almost 3 weeks but had a large investment that I had made so money was no issue and plenty of time to just do research and take notes but then the break was over when they called the night before and told me that I would be back in for a job the very next day..... I was in no condition to make it to work but I just slept for 2 hours the night before and took my pipe to work vaping only when things got to be too much including audio hallucination, strange glimmering in eyes, and paranoia I would go vape in the bathroom for a quick jolt back. It's very stressful as well because it's hundreds of people and 1 bathroom to vape in inside a military plant.... 

(STOPPED TO VAPE)

I got through my 9 hour shift without much of a problem just listening to music through my headphones doing paperwork and occasionally having to talk with the clientele visitors looking to invest in the various products as well as tour the facilities production floor but luckily it was the slowest day I've had since I started last year. Got home and vaped every 10 minutes till work was a mere hour away so I got ready took my vape and headed in.

(STOPPED TO VAPE)


This is when my first real issues began to arise with this compound after a full blown 23 day binge of constant vape re-dosing. I made it to work just fine only 3 minutes past time I needed to be there. No biggie. But then get this shit guys and gals. The only one bathroom is being re-tiled and is blocked off with a sign saying "NO ENTRY". Naturally I thought okie dokie well guess they won't have work since it's down. WRONG!!! A state owned building about 40 yards away from ours that handles multiple things from elective junk, building permits, and something I'm on which is probation offered to let use their restrooms as needed to keep work up and flowing..... Needless to say I made it about an hour before I started getting withdrawal symptoms I've had before with nicotine or alcohol. These include sweating, bi-polar like mood swings, constant bowel movements, dry mouth, headache, and restlessness. I told my boss I wasn't well and would be using PTO time for the rest of the day. Got home and instantly scurried to my room to vape down on the substance in huge amounts until satisfied for the remainder of that day until around 1 in the morning deciding to get at least a few hours of sleep since I was off for the next couple days.


Day 24:

(STOPPED TO VAPE AND SMOKE CIG)

I slept till around 4 the next evening surprised at how long I had actually slept. Made some food and ate a good bit since sobriety was something that I hadn't had in awhile and felt very relieving. After I vaped for the remainder of the day until around 11 that night when literally all of a sudden out of nowhere a very sharp tight pain started in my upper right pectoral through my shoulder into my back that left me very short of breath, coughing, and in rather excruciating pain. The pain was there regardless of my body position or any other factor but would be much more prevalent whilst breathing deeply, coughing, or drinking liquids of any kind. I kept vaping but at a rate of every 45 minutes as oppose to every 5-10 but didn't get neither worse nor any better. I also felt a small bit of bubbling like feeling in the area. Like if you were to see a bunch of air bubble in a bottle of soda. I decided to sleep it off that it was nothing to sweat around 1 this morning. I slept until 7 this evening and felt so awful that I thought I couldn't get out of bed. As I stood up I noticed my condition had gotten almost 10 times as bad with even more symptoms arising. These include with all at the time shortness of breath, heart palpitations, tightness, excruciating pain from upper pec. into shoulder through the upper back and lower neck. Headache, wheezing, bubbling I spoke of more common, mucus buildup being expelled upon cough, tiny black/brown particles in expelled mucus, and difficulty exhaling/inhaling completely. I took some medications for these symptoms but have had no relief or improvement at this time. I am currently sitting in my floor typing this up to warn of this adverse issue that may have developed from the substance. The only relief I have gotten is from vaping more A-PHP that seems to make almost all the issues virtually not there other than slight pain and shortness of breath......


I'm so confused about what could be happening with my right lung or if it's my lung at all but I am considering more than not of going to the ER in the next few hours if it persists to worsen or other problems arise. I couldn't breath for 45 seconds at one point from choking on mucus that would be expelled but get stuck and re-inhaled when I tried to catch a breath kinda making a paradox if you catch my drift......


Any advice or anybody that can relate would be appreciated. I have work again tomorrow and I'm so worried if I'll make it till tomorrow with the breathing problems I'm experiencing.

That sounds absolutely terrifying. I second going to the ER  immediately and definitely stop using these in my opinion nearly instant life-ruining substances.

It's like a crack addiction with no boundaries regarding money and supply.

 I know it is much more easy to say than actually do it but you are still young and have your whole life in front of you.

So if rehab is an option, please consider it.


I wish you all the best.

So..... Day 25 or 26 I'm not 100% now that I look back but either way the symptoms listed in just a moment are the current ongoing that are happening as of this moment.

Sobriety per say I guess. I've built a tolerance even at my light weight that it takes crystals about the size of a pinky nail jammed into an oil burner and vaped over an 1-3 hour period to sustain any kind of stimulation.


Positive symptoms: 

Hmmm good question?? After long term binge consumption almost all positives are virtually gone other than satisfaction of re-dose brought on by the problems it's causing in the first place. Hell of a paradox if one isn't aware of the loop they are in.


Nuetral: 

Mild energy boost for periods of around 10-15 minutes


Negative: 

Difficulty breathing

Difficulty functioning mechanically

Social anxiety/awkwardness

Unwanted or overwhealming self-awareness

Symptoms of mild heart attacks

Numbness in legs, arms, feet, etc.

Sharp/stabbing pain in upper right chest, back, shoulder, neck

Pressure or tightness in all listed above

Clicking of heart against something... Feels like my heart is the spokes of a bike and whatever it's hitting is a card... ??

Sweating and fever

Paranoia if allowed

Dry cough accompanied by sharp pain in upper right side of chest

Burning sensation in legs (Rare)

Mucus buildup in throat (Brown in color)

Loss of breath

Shortness of breath

Forgetting to breath

Pauses due to uncontrollable breathing pattern

THAAA SHIIIIITTTTZZZZZZZZZ or Diarrhea

Gas buildup

Fatigue

Auditory and Visual hallucinations (Not an issue for me to rid myself of)

Heart palpitations

Irregular heartbeat


I feel there is more but you get the idea I'm sure. However, I must say that my Blood pressure was at an outstanding 125/76 and beats per minute at 107 taken about an hour ago. I currently have more than I need left of this I must say almost useless chemical to put myself out forever if I was a complete uncontrolled fiend of a user but it was just an experiment and although I did plan to visit the doctor this evening after work (which went well actually) I decided I'd rather not sit in a room for possibly 4 hours (which is the usual time) and die, I'd rather do it in the comfort of my own home. That was a serious statement but in all reality if it gets to a point of imminent permanent damage or fatal I have some friends over who have now as I am letting them, (since this experiment is over) take them from me and dispose of them properly as well as monitor my health until cleared by a physician tomorrow evening. I have no want or drive to further my use. It is the same result every time regardless. Either death, injury, or insanity for those who forever chase the high.


Soooooooooooo..... I will be going to the doctor tomorrow and will give a full diagnosis with x-rays hopefully and all to show just how damaging and dangerous this RC can truly be on the body when abused long term even if your at the ripe age of 19.


Thank you,

PM me any question or reply here,

JUST DON'T WORRY!!!

Cya on the morrow!

As for how much I can't say honestly. No approximations were made whilst going into the full binge. I was just dropping 2-5 rocks around the size of a bb for awhile then began just cramming it into my oil burner with rocks 3 to 5 times that size. It got out of hand very quickly without a monitor to stop me this time around (as requested by myself). I can tell you though to prevent rubbing my thumb skin off I used a candle and just held the gas of a lighter to the flame but eventually was dropping rocks everywhere and on occasion would mix a small bit of rocks and wax that I had carved out (for whatever reason I'm not sure of) together and ruin a whole bulbs worth. Took me awhile to notice what was happening first time around. Felt my nose getting stiff and then plucked out some hardened waxy booger berries. Rather disgusting and not pleasant. Just figured it started tasting better. MAN WAS I WRONG HA!

(flakka/gravel = a pvp here) they are ruthless and will have u pulled out of ur socks in three seconds if you get caught leaving a known area. I'm telling you guys, as surprised as I am to say this...  Most of the side effects of prolonged abuse are not media hype. I was able to shoot some and only did it once. The comedown was atrocious and even after the heroin wore off I still had that unmotivated, suicidal ideation that no other comedown from a drug can induce.

It was only a matter of time. I seriously hope.... hope to god they can get this stuff under control and it doesn't spread. Meth aint shit compared to a-PVP in my opinion. Even MDPV aint shit compared to a-PVP in terms of self destructiveness. I've used and abused just about every drug and every class of drug out there, both 'legal' and illegal. a-PVP is by far the strongest drug I have ever used. Not only is it the strongest, it is (for lack of a better word) the most dark and evil. After a day or two of meth use, you might start acting a little mean-hearted. After a day or two of a-PVP, I was ready to rob senior citizens for pocket change simply for the fun of it. 


Obviously personal control, and personal variables play a huge role, and I won't lie and try to completely blame the drug for my poor decisions. But shhiiiieeeeet! Honestly, I am still fucking up daily, just luckily no longer with a-PVP/MDPV. Baby steps. I was seriously screwed up in the head for a solid 4 months. At one point there was a few days where I was convinced I had solved the physics problems between Einsteins relativity and Quantum physics. After 4 days no sleep I was hearing the radio come out of my lamp, and an opera coming out of my ceiling fan. :D


a-PHP was underwhelming, and had a ceiling that was super easy to hit. It didn't even hold a candle to MDPV or a-PVP.... but maybe that is a good thing haha. 


Alcohol and weed for me nowadays.

I suspect about 90% of A-PHP user do not vape it properly. I haven't read through much of this thread but if most extreme care and a very intensely specific vaporization method is not cautiously implemented, the A-PHP instantly turns into a different chemical that seems incredibly toxic.


If you get it right and manage to chase it perfectly and burn the whole run clean off the foil, its effects can be very relaxing and euphoric, but i've never had a session with apvp or aphp where i didn't burn a little bit and end up in full blown panic and fear as the effects quickly turned morbidly horrific.


Many batches of the stuff are nearly impossible to vape and a lot of them will burn no matter what you do. The vapor should taste like sweet and bleachy, if it tastes burnt in any way its getting ruined.

its the only way to do it. Snorting it is a waste. You have to keep the heat low. If it taste burn it is not the same it changes and the effect becomes even more moorish. I have learned to just put a small amount (crush crystals to powder) and get a big ass rip and whip it with wet q tip while blowing out the hit. IF its more than two before you blow it out you are burning that shit. You will have a long few days I promise. You don't over heat it and keep it clean you have a calm over you and man if you can ever cum in your girl on that hit wow not that is some god like shit there.

Hi there,


as I have been a regular reader of this forum for more than a year: Time for my first post!![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

OK, just another A-PHP review; I hope you'll enjoy it anyway.


I'm a 23 years old, 168cm tall pre-op tranny girl from Germany weighing 55kg. My only regular medication is HRT (Estrofem Depot and MPA Depot Subcutaneous Implants) for 2 years; more precisely put these are my new meds since my orchiectomy six months ago.


As a relatively new member of the RC-Community -I'm consuming for a little less than a year now- a cannot make comparisms concerning MDPV and A-PVP, as these compounds were already schedule I substances in Germany back then.


Here we go: I did A-PHP orally two months ago, consuming 0,5g in sum. Since then no substances whatsoever => no tolerance.


After the obligatory allergy test I vaped 7mg. OMG - This took me trough the roof!!! I never ever felt this good in all my life: INCREDIBLE EUPHORIA AND HORNINESS! This is why today I had the sex of my life. One huge never ending orgasm. So the answer to the frequently asked question "Does A-PHP improve ones libido?" is a screaming "You bet!". For me it is nearly more pleasure than I can bear...


The not that funny section: Shortly put: Craving. LOTS OF IT. No comparism with oral use - vaping is a totally different story. The urge to redose is that strong, that 30 min after the initial dose I vaped another 10mg while my husband was f...in me!!! The need to redose is THAT strong.

Now it's 7 hours after the first dose and I finally succeeded in stopping after a total consumption of 110mg. All vaped. Without the slightest tolerance.


So - is it fun? Yeah, plenty of it. But BEWARE of the fast administration routes - always use it orally first.


Cheers,


Lena

Do you have any experience with RCs or even stimulants in general from before you went on hormone therapy?


In the past I've noticed terrible side effects--heart pain, edema, and most worryingly fluid buildup in and around the lungs, when I've tried to use a stimulant in the few weeks to months after using an androgenic substance. From what I've read, androgen receptors play a role in regulating alpha adrenergic tone, and therefore a hypersensitivity to cardiovascular side effects (particularly in the kidneys) would make sense after you withdraw an androgen. 


And obviously "natural" women don't have this problem because their androgen receptors are sufficiently sensitive to produce a parallel response using small quantities of endogenous androgen. 

But I've always wondered how male-to-female transgenders fared in this area: after all, the exogenous hormones you take shut down endogenous T production through negative feedback, and you've developed as a male rather than as a female, so it wouldn't be logical to assume that a female-equivalent androgen dose would have the same effect on you.

Stimulants are known to affect the prostate negatively, both short and long term; to varying degrees depending on the individual. From my basic knowledge this is mostly due to the adrenergic activity of the drug(s). Obviously, people with a Y chromosome (men, even transgenders) have a prostate, something double X chromosome peoples do not have. 


More so, cathinone, substituted cathinones and cathinone related drugs (generally ones with the beta-ketone group being present) are known to generally be much more adrenergic in nature than their amphetamine counter parts. Adrenergic activity has linked with prostate behavior, but I don't know much more than that.


From personal experience: I am a male (cis gender) and cathinones and amphetamines increase my urinary frequency considerably. Both families of drugs make it extremely hard for me to pee (think giving birth through a straw). This side effect basically goes away completely once I have not used the drug for 20-24 hours. I have abused BOATLOADS of amphetamines and cathinones over the years (I no longer do, thank god I was able to clean up my act), and so far have not noticed any negative long term or permanent effects on my prostate or my system.


But time will tell.

just for the sake anyone is to discover this chems here are my findings on research: I have experimented with a php for 4 weeks or so now, taking a dose occassionally about 3 to 4 times a week in doses of 10 to 100mg per set. conclusion: less is more! this can be said on a lot substances, but for this in any way. i found myself sometimes redosing, over 50 mg(i am bout 130 kg, 40 yo.) i only recognized misseable effects doing more than 50-60. anything above is an overdose, for me at least, not worse. no paranoia at all yet, but the comedown is not that nice than, the rush is worse not, you wont get more allert, well the skinn sensation overdosing is nice and prickeling, espessially beyound my hair.. it might be safe, but if i hear my heart beating, i tend to stay safe. if not overdosed(>50mg)-- not(no big issue with symptoms) : ) due. the substance itself forces to redos a little. essentially.  vaping and snorting might leed to quick addictive behaviour (dont know if anyone can say by now, if its addictive... i guess.) every high is followed by a comedown. a php seems quite little comedownsymptoms... even in comparation to amphetamines. though, making this experiences, i turned to low doses of 10-20 mg and took them oral. beside some stimulation effects and allertnes, openly spoken, it is nice for a recreational experience, though, it does nt got any positive outcome on studying, it was possible to use, but not worse to, for studying. actually i often found myself lying on the bed and enjoying, or seeking the internet for harvesting new sources...  though i learned a lot on rcs. i used to read all that literature around, but after a decade, i had to refresh some assumptions. anyway. i found myself quite often overdosed just waint or sleeping the effects to last. even triggerd sexual obsessions...well, i can live with that, hahaha, however: ) while conflicts i felt annoying, conflicts happen. i found myself getting of the situation, which is generally not my way to handle that. i felt a little more disconnected from any inner emotions, like on cannabis use, maybe.. so i behaved like a wise coward, sometimes. all in all i d say, if one does use with respect, it treats one good. over all.  i also found myself trying a batch of a pvp kind of.... 4 f(

4 f(wtflour?!) pvp.. which was total shit! that was absolutely addictive. i did next a thousands of hits of drugs (only softdrugs, lsd, meskalin, n2o, weed, mdma,mdmb, phenidate, mdea, psylocibin, mda, 2-cb and the ones, 3-ce, amphetamine, even methamphtabs.., quite few coke), but never found such a harsh comedown, like with that shit! even meth, at least token orally, can be less harsh. immidiate force driving me to redose, though i found myself after  only 50 mg... taken in to 4 lines(alllergy, 10, 20, 20...). into a 2 day bad mood quite depressive phase... i wont complain. but after all i flushed that batch. the first time ever.. hahaha. ever wanted to do that.. such moment questions anything. that fucking devillish mind hacking bastardous poison. shit! i think, its shit.pvp seems not worse. and compared with reports on the net here and so forth... thats totally missleads.. you might find yourself in deep trouble.  if you want to stay safe, weight your day stuff in the morning, and put the rest asside deep back to da fridge.renjoy the narcotic effect on your tounge an spill throug with water. take a mint bubble gum and enjoy your head skin sensation. a php is unique as its own.. it a narcotic drug. thats what narcotic mean, doesnt?? not more not less. if there is a certain use or sense, let me know.  i dont see any. yet. not for party(especially, music doesnt kick in on this stuff well). not for sex. not even chanting arorund. noc power concentration that lasts, no experience to remember really,  ok a short gain on self esteem, maybe. is senseless surfing sense? {good question, thanks, welcome, your talking to yourself, even you..shut up. i will do the rest of the gram in the next month, which is still 0,4 or so, and then im done with it.  my 3 cent. lost a lot ppl in the past 20 years. quitting drugs, or just shooting them out, getting crazy.  essentially, legalize php, and keep pvp out of office. my opinion: dont binge, dont snort, dont iv, dont vape or smoke chems(think bout that methheads and crack szene... ). thats all in the short circle of reinforcement. short kick searching selfish missuse. and think before you take it. no responsible user must touch any ~zioPAN tripstoppers, as he does not overdo. owning some might be an option, but there is a drastical develpment, i find. thats a shity trend. more in the us, eu also in the less developed poor aereas as well, i guess, from my view. i see a lot ppl doing benzo shit, a way down. anyway, a few hits of weed might bei ok. though i didnt combine much yet with my php.  just stay safe and get a life and rave a lot!! and dont mess the scenes call. every victim is a shame and no loss!!   prepare yourself to die or think: Mr.Dosed2Hard darwin matters.

hey guys I recently picked up a gram of supposed a-php I say supposed because god knows what stimulant they actually sell you lol especially when buying form DNM vendors. small amounts vaped provided extreme euphoria very compulsive. Went through the whole gram in about two weeks doing some every day. I noticed that if I heated it a little to much It would numb my mouth tongue and lips for 15 minutes. is this typical of a-pvp/a-php

New Batch, after quite a few (too long!) months with me fallin' in love with the -Brown powderish' stuff- of thee beloved alpha-PHP, beautiful clear to yellow-tinted small Crystals and damn, this stuff is pure as fuck and even somewhat different in effects (being more motivational, really motivational!) and from what i remember and even though most ppl say, the white'ish or the crystalline Batches should be superior, this one is way more potent but strangely not as rushy @ the onset, i.e. no euphoria for me (thnx to ADHD) but strongly stimulating!


With this being said, afaik remember the Brown stuff at least (dunno how and why) provided some feelin' of well-being, nothing really euphoric but not non-euphoric (somewhat in the middle of FX), but this Chemical i just had the Chance to aquire and do some experimentation after the Honeymoon with the one and only other Batch i had, this stuff is -as already mentioned- much more, MUCH MUCH MORE (!) potent -what doesn't changes the fact i have to high-dose it, just as i know it from every other Stimulant, ADHD once again!- and so should last some while longer.


Whatever, on a sidenote, i remember havin' a REALLY (!!!) good crystalline Variant of alpha-PVP (equipotent to this a-PHP i share sum time with atm) being, for me just to a much different, but nevertheless on the euphoria-side providin' some really good vibes - nothing like the hours filled with laughter THC induce i rarely do nowadays, which is sheer impossible to exceed, but yeah, it was something i call euphoria, to a degree...


Damn, how fuck'd up it is, havin' not only big Daddy PV being literally wiped-out from this planet, perhaps in the DN-Universe (i dunno but guess), probably is for Earth's Population no more to be seen again, but also the a-PHP and -PVP being scheduled in it's originating Country, hence the good Batches are gone in a time not too Long in the future (FACT!)!


The other ones, as the ones being synthesized in the EU, are from my experience just as others confirm'd, nothing like the ones being made in China (which is the same for, needless to say, MXE as a very well-known example, but also most other Compounds afaik).


So this is the shitty kinda, as hard as it is, thing we, the "Crazies",  as so much ppl never learned to enjoy, have to deal with and at least for the rest of what's left of the Chinese-Stuff being here and there, but not all too easy to find, Synths being left. Btw, and refer to the pplz never "learned" to love the Pyrovalerone-relatives, well, i with 200% certainty do say, it's just the exact evolutionary process making the brain able to work with, whatever Chemical i know, so i think it's the same for everyone else - so the Compound of choice need to tickle the Receptors 1st for some time, to actually have a good, or in my case, time filled with much more Motivation and the needed Energy to do what has to be done, i.e. from cleaning my Apartment to being able having appointments and be free of anxiety and -a godbless- be with the ppl i meet, in time! And this is, not as usually with me Doofy in 7/10, perhaps even 8 times being way too late - which means, i lost what could have been Bonus-, Karma-Points, like when in search for a new Job, when being too late is not expected and rarely tolerated!


Thnx once again to (?), ADHD, what else?

****

Stay safe ppl!****

I'm jealous. Tempted to pick up some "PV" like compound after reading the last post.


But I won't. MDPV used to be a daily functional stimulants for me. Used it for a long time until something changed in me. Now I have no self control when it comes to stimulants, especially stimulants of the PV variety.


Once I get the tiniest of doses inside of me I am instantly off the races vaping hit after hit until it's all gone (then feverishly ordering more before crashing).


I don't know how I did it for so long... keeping things seemingly under control. I know that is not possible for me anymore. Many many failed attempts at returning to functional use can attest to that.


I tried alpha-php twice since it came out. The first time I am fairly certain what I received was actually aphp. I enjoyed it. A lot. The second batch I am convinced was actually apvp instead... didn't enjoy it as much but ultimately it didn't matter; stim use, regardless of the actual stim used, will always take me to the same place. Not somewhere my sober self wants to be.

All I can say (after extensive drug experience in general) Be damn careful with pyros. I could agree with the claims if a-php is burned it gets broken down into some nasty metabolite, seems to heavily hit the adrenals. really bad gas build up and chronic constipation- this can attribute to some of the higher heart rate and bp possibly? psychosis and paranoia will def be prevalent after two days of use sleep or no sleep

Gas build up I know from MDPV (orally and insufflated). Can some expert chim in and comment ? Are the metabolites predictable ?

im assuming the metabolites or chemical produced is actually a minuscule amount of pyrrolidine which is toxic. but only if the substance is burned (Can't remember the scientific term... pyrolysis?) It seems to nail the kidneys and nail them hard. I recommend massive fluid intake on binges, orange juice calcium and honey to help your kidneys. be very careful when vaporizing if it turns a very dark amber-black stop smoking always clean the pipes after a few doses. If you inhale to much of the burned shit you will notice some very nasty effects on your body later on in the binge. skin discoloration, I've experienced burning tingling itching flashes of extreme heat in areas feelings of bone joint and muscle pain urinary retention bad GI issues, surprisingly not so much with chest discomfort or breathing issues maybe slightly there. so I chalk all that up to large amounts of pyrrolidine causing kidney dysfunction and causing nerve issues because of the toxic build up from poor kidney function. I have yet to notice cola colored or red colored urine, bad smelling urine, or swelling from fluid retention. and to answer immad's question couldn't tell you never got to try mdpv. however I did get to try what I believe was A-pvp (white crystals strong vinegar smell) had a very similar yet distance taste of php but absolutely blew php out of the god damn exosphere in terms of awesome

for everyone that doesn't know for vaporization method. heat very very slowly no longer than 5 seconds do not keep direct flame on it. the color should be completely clear liquid which will eventually fade to a light yellow oil. once this oil becomes a darker amber color do not smoke it. immediately clean it out/change foils/whatever your using. I've successfully dabbed the substance also. key is to not heat it up enough to be super hot like a dab but enough most of the chem will instantly vaporize. some of this will burn as soon as you begin to taste a harsh taste stop inhaling

considering its chemical directly in the IUPAC naming of the drug I'd say the chances are pretty high I have a very good neuroscience/pharmacology back ground and I love chem but I'm still learning though. I'm going to college for pharmacy/neuroscience/organic chem not really sure which one I'll go for in the end but I'm pretty close to being a pharm tech. But I've been studying this stuff for a few years now and from what I've gained I think this class of drugs is pretty awesome but care needs to be taken and people need to know that. I believe one of the pyrrolindinos (MPHP?) exhibited heavy rhabidomylosis which is extremely hard on kidneys I wouldn't put it past A-php to potentially be very degrading of muscle tissue but its all relative to dosage and how long you keep putting it in your body consecutively. I'm on day 7 of a binge and though my cardio feels okay I can't say the same for the rest of the body. hopefully I'll get a break in my heavy schedule to stop soon. I figured I might report my findings on this substance theres barley anything out on compared peeve or alpha-peev

Thanks for the info, man. It seems, street speed is still "healthier", even though the comedown is harsher. Be safe and take a break if possible. Also lots of magnesium is obligatory (you know that). Did you sleep in those 7 days ? Every body is different, but 7 days sounds overkill to me. I personally would not function after day 3. ![:sus:](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/suspicious.gif)

I slept a decent amount and ate I hydrate like crazy and when I do my body instantly feels way better and I can do more. I wanna be done today though. I think my weird hand color change and such may be Raynauds and I also have anxiety so sitting there reading about vascular and heart diseases liver failure and kidney failure will really make ya paranoid I'm also currently dependent on benzos and they help. The thing is I lack every single medical serious symptom for any of those three things that this substance puts at risk. No severe chest discomfort very little shortness of breath no pain radiating into left neck jaw arm no swelling of hands feet ankles or legs. I'm pretty sure all the muscle weakeneess and woozyness is from the benzos anyways. I think if something was seriously wrong I'd get pretty sick very rapidly. I've seen people consume insane amounts of pyros for years without problems and in a week out of my two grams I still have a gram left plus I got stupid on benzos and wasted/burned most of it early in the week

It's time the world starts pushing for drug legalization. No drug is better or worse than the other unless it's directly highly toxic in some way. Alcohol is one of the most toxic drugs and people drink it almost their whole lives and make it through. But the truth is all these new drugs until drug use integrates into Scotty better nobody is ever going to know the truths from myths. It's all speculation

Iv and and inhalation are obviously the most addictive routes for any psychoactive. I hate when people say weed can't be an addiction because it totally can maybe not physically but still. Being a chem nerd I hate when people say all the natural stuff is good and synth is bad thats not all true. nature has created some of the deadliest molecules the world has seen.

Update: This shit will absolutely fucking annihilate your GI system with continued use. (already have GI issues had them since I was young) so far more frequent than normal bowel habits pinching feeling through the intestines, gaseous feeling that seems to be putting some pressure on my chest. very light cramps none of the symptoms are actually very painful but I'm debating going back to the doctor (was in last Friday due to viral infection which is what I received at the end for diagnostics, yes I know its stupid to be smoking this shit with an upper resp infection but all those symptoms cleared up minus residual mucus in the nose and a bit of lung/throat congestion) they did draw blood to try and figure out what I had they said it came back with a viral infection but everything else was normal. Does anybody here know what all they look for with those tests besides illnesses? can they tell if things are off with heart, livers, kidney etc. Cause I thought the acetaminophen might have given me upper GI bleeding but when I brought this up to him he said no your test results showed no signs of blood loss. I also took a whopping hit of the shit before I went in there. Surprisingly or maybe not so much PHP is a great decongestant and pain reliever. sorry for the lengthy posts I'm just trying to give as much info on my experiences as possible.

To me it seems your rollin the dice alot more by getting some powdered shit from china then traditional street drugs. I guess its both a roll of the dice but id rather get a bag of coke heroin meth etc before i get some shit no one has tried or heard of before with some fucked up numbers and ABCs after it. Take a fuckin hair too much and thats it. Ive heard stories of people losin their mind and it not returning. Im good on that

until you get street heroin laced with fentanyl and coke is often poor quality around my parts and heavily cut with some nasty stuff. the only thing around here in quality is meth and I'm thinking php has  a better chance of being less toxic to the body

pretty sure I just need a break off this shit. Can't tell if psychosis or being overly paranoid about hand and foot color and the tingly pin pricking sensations. I think it all starts looking worse and I have an anxiety attack and everything starts looking bad but if I take my mind off it and look back everything looks somewhat normal. stupid vasoconstriction

Well actually I just figured out my symptoms are actually benzo withdrawal instead of effects from the php. all the skin color changes, nerve pain burning stinging itchy ear ringing GI problems all of it. I've been on them daily for 5 months about way longer than I've used pyrovalerones. IMO benzo withdrawal is a lot more psychosis inducing than any stim lol

*It totally sucks because the benzo dosage I need to keep out of WD messes more than I like to be but messes me up more when I don't take it. I'm starting to dislike doctors most of them won't have an intelligible convo with you and believe everything the FDA tells them instead of doing any hardcore research into what their prescribing. I literally got told yesterday that there won't be long term cognitive issues after I get off benzos which I know is BS especially if its not tapered properly. even though the OD risk is high barbs are probably much safer for anxiety in terms of lasting mental issues*

I need a list of DOs and DO NOTs with regard to Jan reduction with this chem. ROA is vaped


Here's what I have so far:


* vape slowly to avoid burning the chem to a dark brown/amber color. The dark stuff is toxic.


* Hydrate, always. It's hard but freaking hydrate.


* Magnesium is a must. So is every other essential vitamin and mineral but Magnesium Taurate (not magnesium oxide) is a mandatory supplement. Take plenty.


* heart rate is through the roof. Blood pressure as well. What to do? Avoid beta blockers (combo may be fatal) benzos are great but I have a very high benzo tolerance to the point where I nerd 12 mg etizolam..


* clonidine seems to help. I take .400 mg when I vape this stuff. Is that ok? 


* alcohol.. I only have a beer or 2 if available but usually none.


* phenibut, gabapentin (neurontin), picamilon... I take these, sometimes combined, while vaping. Is this OK?


* I try to eat but little success here. At the very least I'll have some honey


* are potent vasodilators safe or contradicted? I'm talking about the ones usually sold for impotence like yohimbine.


* the paranoia, delusions, muscle waste, man. I actually had to stop vaping this and switch to speed to calm myself down. The NRI action with these chems is seriously uncomfortable.


That said, I need more advice other than to just stay the F away from this chem, because the above isn't enough. This chem, vaped, only has a (blissful) high that lasts until you put the pipe down.


Also I sometimes vape the freebase (oil), does anyone have any comment on whether this is more caustic and/or info on toxic pyrolysis metabolites.


THANKS.

Is there anybody around with Information/Knowledge about how long alpha-PHPs provability in Human Blood and Urine Levels?


5 - 7 days, like Amphetamine, just guessin' - is that realistic?


I hope someone with Skills @ Chemistry could, perhaps based on the Pharmcology of similar Compounds like Pyrovaleron, it's main Variant, or related Chems, i.e. specifically Methylendioxypyrovalerone or a-PVP shed some light on this? 


As there is a Study of MDPV availble online, were's extensive Information about it's Pharmacology, that might be useful to approximately name some realistic Values/a Timeframe...


Any input is welcome and i thank you in Advance!


Cheers!

All I have to say is be careful with the pyro family of drugs. I can enjoy other stims but its gotten to a point where even the smallest hit causes body aches everywhere extremely rapid irregular heartbeat. I have very worrisome issues with my digestive tract. It so so so important that it doesn't turn an amber color whatever happens there is highly highly toxic. my lung functioning is shit. I've probably vaped a totally of 4.5 grams of this over 4-5 months. tread lightly guys seriously. I'm having a full toxicology done next week so praying for good results.

I'm wondering if it's different from one to another or related to the ROA (especially vaping) because i'm experiencing, besides of a sometimes after dosing heightened HR, dry Mouth and a bit more of sweating here n' there, nothing to seriously worry about!

Yeah fuck, turns out I got sold this as MDMA in the UK , a friend who I recently met told me that they knew it was flakka and that they oorderd it made me feel very anxious and shakey had energy and couldn't move.. Felt like really distanced from everyone couldn't talk to anyone ever one was on a diffrent level, it was just a bad experience I only sniffed about 3 lines ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Can somebody draw a brief comparison to other stimulant classes (amphetamines, x-phenidates) ? I found MDPV in low doses useful. Phenidates are complete shite (as 2-DPMP). I'm talking about functional, oral dosing. Thanks a lot ! ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Not addictive at all. Just pretty strong.


This a-php is similar if you do not get lost into redosing, which should be a tabu after common sense sets in.


15 mg + 20 mg (all insufflated) at t+1h kept me up 9h easily. So it should not be approached with the same levity as typical phenetylamine-based stims under any circumstances.

What do you mean by "effective" ? It delivers the desired effects with those ROAs. Just not the moreish urge to redose like with vaping.


Every drug becomes otherworldly addictive when vaped/IVd, so it is an inherent property of that ROA, not of the drug itself.

Shure ? Nicotin ingested orally has no kick and THC ingested orally has a too long duration, which makes vaping more convenient -> more addictive.

I found out, that this compound can well be used functionally at insufflated doses of 1-3mg (max. 10mg total/day). Anything above 3mg feels like a cross between Mephedrone and MDPV and I mean the worst of both worlds. Weird stuff but low doses work well.


I have to revert my statement, that this is significantly less potent than MDPV. I guess it has roughly the same potency (maybe a tad weaker) but a slightly different pharmacological profile


And I think it it s VERY similar to RTI-111, but with a longer functional onset.

Yep, i think from much experience with them (Peevee/a-PVP/a-PHP) that this one has the strongest impact on SERT, at least that's how it felt to me..., and i could think of how RTI should feel like.

RTI is a potent DRI right? it would make sense for doses to be below 5mg -cause .5mg-5mg is what the dose of Requip is for RLS and Parkonsins, ect. And it is a heavy DRI.

i normal take this via oral and nasal consumption but i was made aware of other ways ie: smoking so....

i made a small water pipe like anyone would if they where going to smoke crack and i also used it like a heroin user would use heroin

both ways are very similar to both original substance that is used that way

i mean smoking pv like crack has the same taste and feeling like crack does but is a little more harsh like using baking soda for rocking the freebase

smoking on tin foil board like heroin is very similar nothing like in taste or smell nothing like the feeling of heroin and not the addiction but simillar feelings

both ways worked for me and it is like it almost copies a different substance depending on how it is taken

you eat it then it is like xtc you snort it then it is like cocaine smoking two different ways is like crack and heroin and not sure how it is when injected as i have never injected pv i am assuming it will be similar to speed when injected

The recommended ROA is elimination via throw into basket.


Honestly I do not particularly like this compound. At sufficiently low insufflated doses (1-4mg, redose not before t+2h) it can be functionally useful, but not necessarily needs to be. Recreationally it has 0 value. Dunno about Meth, but am a fan of phet. MDPV is vastly superior imho.

I'd suggest 10mg orally, that's the most smooth come up and come down experience. Start at 10mg or lower, and don't redose.


Or, if you want to get addicted similar to smoking meth? Smoke 5mg out of a meth pipe. Then it will be all cracked out and uncontrollable fiendish and moreish. Even when you're strung out for a bit, just like with meth, you get that tiny bit more euphoria, though eventually with dysphoria, every time you take another puff.


Be careful, pace yourself, set yourself amounts out to use in a setting and then stop, don't limit your session based on the size of the bag.

Could anyone give me advise to IV dosage? I know it is not safe, responsible or wise, but i use a-pvp iv and about 20-30mg/shot/2 hours.  How could you compare dosage between pvp and php? I have heard php is little bit "weaker" than pvp. Can i use them both at the same time?

Tried 23mg iv and it was very nice and not overwhelming at all. First took 10mg snorting and almost nothing happenend,very mild stimulation. I have little tolerance to pvp, so maybe theres cross tolerance between these two.

Comparing my own experiences with what I've seen here and on other forums, I suspect the two main reasons people have negative experiences with this drug when trying to take it in large recreational doses (bad post-China ban batches aside) are a) poor vape technique (it's really hard to avoid burning it, which ruins the high/is probably more toxic) and b) taking it too often. People keep trying to treat it like coke or something you can do multiple times in a week and still get high. This might be effective for small 'functional' doses but if you want euphoria you have to give it at least a week and a half between trials, avoid redosing more than 2 or 3 times in one night, and keep the overall amount at or under 50-80mg (depending on body weight). Everyone who has a shitty time seems to have broken these 'rules.' Some have speculated that it has a stronger affinity for SERT than other PVs, so maybe that's the reason you need more downtime - might also be the reason the high feels 'chill,' even relaxed, for a stim, vs. the tweaked out mania of i.e. a-pvp.

The batch of A-PHP I got was better than the Alpha PVP I tried.

I am still unsure if the first a-PHP I had even was -PHP, as it was almost completely different to what’s been sold nowadays, i.e. small to large Crystals, mostly transparent with a tad bit of brown discoloration seen in some but not all Batches I tried - some where just plain white/clear crystalline stuff which did look cool and of high potency but not nearly as outstanding as the beige/tan powder I had only on Batch of when trying the alpha-PHP for the first time in my life.


This stuff was, and i very rarely experience something like that, somewhat i‘d say is euphoria beyond anything I ever felt with any other Stimulant, including Meth, MDPV and even the extraordinary good crystalline and best a-PVP I had once, which was really entertaining and fun but not nearly as rushy, euphoric and uplifting with each plugged dose, especially at the onset which was awesome and never got less interesting - it persisted constantly, over and over again until the bag was empty and fun‘s over - after that it was impossible to find that stuff again and it freaked me out that with continuous redosing even the purest, brightest looking Crystals (some did look simply phenomenal) not had the rush missing from first to last dose but also completely stopped working, making consecutive ingestion pointless as it only aggravated negative side effects and worsened mania and bad-psyche-condition symptoms more and more to the point of suffering mental breakdown for nothing but wasted crystalline Stuff I‘d trade 20grams of for only 10gs of the lovely brown/tan powder of high density, good purity and unique, never before and never afterwards again experienced physiological conditions I did appreciate it for and have vivid memories of even at least 4 years later - that stuff was cool!

Maybe a little late, but anyways my opinion on it:


IMHO it is a pure NDRI, just like the other famous pyros (MDPV, A-PVP, ...). I get zero serotonergic effects from it. Also molecular wise it would be very strange for A-PHP to show any serotonergic action, and all the others don't.


IMHO it is about half as potent as A-PVP, which again is IMHO about half as potent as MDPV. But the reachable ceiling of A-PHP is way way lower than on A-PVP (I never dared to find the ceiling on A-PVP...it's so high...).


As with the other pyros, IMHO tolerance builds up quickly (to feel the same euphoric rush you have to wait 2 weeks), and it has long lasting lingering stim effects.


It has IMHO the typical sideeffects (dirty/unpleasant body feeling, scatter brained) like the other pyros (exception being A-PiHP, which strangely doesn't have these sideeffects).


BTW:

All this by the vaped ROA. I vape all these in a TC cup atomizer. Works flawless, no burning/charring, no freebasing needed. Get about 50mg in one toke.

Is it normal for a-php to smell almost exactly the same as gone off cheese?
