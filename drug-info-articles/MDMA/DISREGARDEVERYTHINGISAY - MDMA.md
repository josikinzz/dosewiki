MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine) is an entactogenic drug of the phenethylamine and amphetamine family. It was first synthesized in 1912 by the chemist Anton Köllisch as a potential medicine for the stopping of abnormal bleeding. Over the following 65 years, MDMA was largely forgotten about, with the first reports of it being used recreationally dating back to 1970. It was finally scheduled as a controlled substance in 1985 when its use began to spread out to mainstream society and rave culture.

MDMA acts as a releasing agent of the neurotransmitters known as serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine, the neurotransmitters in charge of pleasure, motivation and focus. It does this by inhibiting the reuptake and reabsorption of the neurotransmitters after they have performed their function of transmitting a neural impulse. Essentially allowing them to accumulate and be reused, causing physically stimulating and euphoric effects.

Many people across online psychedelic communities seem to think that reports of MDMA’s psychedelic effects are an outright myth but these are simply claims from people who have not experienced it for themselves. It does produce extremely powerful psychedelic effects and hallucinations under the right circumstances, particularly at high doses and especially when combined with marijuana. These effects are on par with Mushrooms and LSD and unlike anything found on commonly used psychedelics. Not presenting themselves consistently but just as readily induced within people even if they have no previous experience with tripping on traditional psychedelics. They can happen at any point throughout an MDMA buzz, but seem to be much more common during the comedown.

The MDMA experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical effects:**

The physical effects of MDMA can be broken down into five components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - the body high of MDMA can be described as a moderate to extreme euphoric tingling sensation that encompasses the entire body. It is capable of becoming overwhelmingly pleasurable at higher dosages. This sensation maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **Enhancement of touch**
- **Stimulation** - in terms of its effects on the users physical energy levels, MDMA is commonly considered to be extremely stimulating and energetic. This encourages activities such as running, climbing and dancing in a way that makes MDMA a popular choice for musical events such as festivals and raves. The particular style of stimulation which MDMA presents can be described as forced. This means that at higher dosages it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still, as jaw clenching and involuntarily bodily shakes and vibrations become present, resulting in an extreme unsteadiness of the hands and a general lack of motor control.
- **Vibrating vision** - a person’s eyeballs may even begin to spontaneously wiggle back and forth in a rapid motion, causing vision to become blurry and temporarily out of focus; a condition known as nystagmus.
- **Dehydration** - dry mouth and dehydration are a universal experience with MDMA and a product of increased heart rate and an extreme motivation to engage in strenuous physical activities that it induces. While it is important to avoid becoming dehydrated, especially when out dancing in a hot environment, there have been a number of users suffering from water intoxication through over drinking so it is advised that users simply sip at water and never over drink.
- **Difficulty urinating** - higher doses of MDMA result in an overall difficulty when it comes to urination, an effect that is completely temporary and harmless, due to MDMA’s promotion of the release of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). ADH is responsible for regulating urination. This effect can be lessened by simply relaxing but can be significantly relieved by placing a hot flannel over the genitals to warm them up and encourage blood flow.

**Cognitive effects:**

The cognitive effects of MDMA can be broken down into ten components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The general head space of MDMA is described by many as one of extreme mental stimulation, feelings of love or empathy and powerful euphoria. It contains a large number of typical Psychedelic, Entactogenic and Stimulant cognitive effects.

The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include,

- **Euphoria** - strong emotional euphoria and feelings of happiness are present within MDMA and likely a direct result of serotonin and dopamine release.
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Increased empathy, love and sociability** - this particular effect is the more pronounced, powerful and therapeutic with MDMA than any other known substance. It is the most obvious and noticeable effect within any MDMA experience and dominates the head space. With time and repeated use however, this effect becomes severely diminished as the perspective it instils becomes fully grounded and already in place, making people feel merely stimulated and euphoric with no new found urges to communicate with others. Some users report that MDMA ‘loses its magic’ with as few as 10 experiences, while others have reported hundreds of uses before the empathic qualities disappear. This does not appear to be true for all users, however, with many users reporting that they have not experienced any decrease in quality of the experience despite dozens or even hundreds of uses.
- **Mindfulness**
- **Time distortion** - strong feelings of time compression are common within MDMA and speed up the experience of time quite noticeable.
- **States of unity and interconnectedness** - experiences of unity, oneness and interconnectedness between level 2 - 3 are common within MDMA. This component most consistently manifests itself at high dosages within large crowds at raves and musical events in the form of “becoming one with crowd”.

**Visual effects:**

The visual effects of MDMA have an occurrence rating that is more selective and less consistent than any of the traditional psychedelics. This is to the point where many people disregard psychedelic experiences with MDMA as a “myth” or “rumour” but this is simply because they have not experienced it for themselves. The effects can never be guaranteed to manifest themselves but are more likely to occur with chemically pure high dose MDMA experiences, towards the end of the experience and if the user has been smoking marijuana. They are also more likely to occur if the user has prior experience with psychedelics but remain entirely possible within those who have never tried one for themselves.

*Enhancements*

MDMA presents an array of visual enhancements which are mild in comparison to traditional psychedelics but still distinctively present.

These generally include:

- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

MDMA presents a single visual enhancement:

- **Tracers** - this effect is rarely manifested beyond level 1 - 3.

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of psilocin than LSD. They can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, mostly blue and grey in scheme, glossy in colour, equal in blurred and sharp edges and equal in rounded and angular corners. At higher dosages they are significantly more likely to result in states of Level 7A visual geometry over Level 7B. Many users report an almost menacing feeling, following a sinister and ominous style with a colour scheme that generally consists of greys and blues.

*Hallucinatory states*

MDMA is capable of produces a unique range of low and high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is significantly less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelic.

These effects include:

- **Internal hallucinations** - the internal hallucinations which MDMA induces are only present as spontaneous breakthroughs at extremely high dosages. The most common way in which they manifest themselves are through hypnagogic scenarios which the user may experience as they are drifting off to sleep after a night of use, these can usually be described as memory replay from the previous several hours. These are short and fleeting but frequent and completely believable and convincing as they happen. In terms of the theme they often take the form of conversations with the people who were with you or instead manifest themselves as bizarre and extremely nonsensical plots.
- **External hallucinations** - these are similar to the effects found within Deliriants but usually follow themes of memory replays and semi realistic expected events. For example people could be casually holding objects or performing actions which you would expect them to in real life before disappearing and dissolving under further inspection. Common examples of this include seeing people wearing glasses when they are not and mistaking objects in the peripheral vision as human beings. At higher dosages however they are capable of becoming constant in their presence and almost entirely delirious in their nature.

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of MDMA are common in their occurrence and exhibit a partial range of effects which commonly includes:

- **Enhancements**
- **Hallucinations** - usually occurring at the end of the night, and almost always consisting of memory replays from the previous several hours. They are commonly manifested as spontaneous clips of the music that was played and garbled voices of the people that were spoken too. These can become as loud in volume as the level of noise heard at any rave or house party and can occasionally become complex enough to manifest themselves as intricate, previously unheard and completely coherent songs or symphonies of any style.

**Tips on inducing these effects:**

If you want to help induce these effects, I suggest you take whatever you consider to be a moderate-strong dose for your tolerance. For me this seems to be around 0.6g +. Make sure you have pure MDMA and not miscellaneous pills of an undetermined nature. If this is combined with a bong and a large amount weed psychedelic effects almost always occur. 
 This generally seems to do it for most people but since MDMA seems to be a strange sort of selective psychedelic it may not for others. Other people and I have tripped when we haven’t smoked weed just a few times but have consistently tripped when we have– every damn time.

**Conclusion:**

MDMA is an entactogen first and a psychedelic second. It is best used for resolving interpersonal problems, strengthening bonds and hard core recreational partying. Its psychedelic properties are extremely unique and interesting and something that I take advantage of and deliberately attempt to induce every time I happen to be taking this substance.

It’s important to keep in mind, however, that the over use of this substance can result in severe neurotransmitter depletion and serotonin syndrome. It is because of this that I recommend you do your research before even considering the use of this drug. Coming from personal experience, it should never be used more than once a month or preferably no more than a couple of times a year.
