anyway SSRA's are basically all the same, this will be very similar to MDAI and IAP

Copied a previous experience I had from another forum:

> In short, apparently it felt very much like MDMA with a couch-lock effect. Almost the same empathogenic effects - but not quite there, but closer than, for instance, methylone or 4-FA - but almost no dopamine drive feeling. A bit of a post-e crash feeling the day after. Duration ~5 hours.

This was years before I tried 5- or 6-APB, and even if the experience has faded a bit, I would rate it higher in terms of empathy and openness (but not psychedelia or drive) - could be even more of a winner if wisely combined with a more dopaminergic agent. Definitely not another MDAI (I have never sampled IAP despite years of trying to acquire some)

So this is great for combining with a psychedelic, for therapeutic value and cuddling with your girlfriend? I've been looking out for a serotonin releaser like that, so I'm keeping my eye on this thread at least

i may be getting some of this soon, so appreciate the report! let us know how 75 goes although friday isn't much time to let tolerance subside - although 25mg is obviously a low dose. 


i was thinking of trying 100mg after initial allergy test since that's a pretty standard 5-apb dose.

Just curious, what're your reasons for thinking that? Stimulant tolerance usually takes 2 weeks minimum for tolerance to subside, but preferably a month. You haven't left a week. Is it just because the initial dose was small and not likely to produce much tolerance?


I ask because apparently the dose you took was enough to produce noticeable effects, which makes me think it have produced some tolerance.

Tested at 120mg a few days ago. Likely had some tolerance issues as 3 days before that I took HOT-7 (assuming it didn't degrade to its sched 1 brother 2-c-t-7 , who really knows)


First opinion is I'm not a huge fan. This is my first MDA/MDMA "replacement" type chem that I've tried (unless 4-fa is marketed as such) 


First alerts were about 20-30 minutes , on a full stomach , which in comparison to MDMA is really fast , usually a good hour to hour and a half it takes , but I've never fasted before MDMA use so maybe that's why I have somewhat abnormal come ups (doesn't fully kick in for 2 or more hours).


By the end of the first hour I was "peaking" , and the following hour was the most intense part.


Really clumsy , wobbly when walking , head felt very heavy & felt discordanated.y only comfortable option was to sit/lay. I didn't get much in the way of actually mind euphoria but the body euphoria was present and quite pleasant.


Empathy present , tactile & music enhancement as well. I laid & pet my dog for what must of been an hour & I'm not really the lovey type animal owner.


Peak didn't seem to last long , maybe 2 hours & back to baseline (or close to) by 4-4.5 hours. Gradual come down. No urge to redose like MDMA. Still throughout the whole experience and even after the effects nearly wore off I just couldn't  now bring myself to getting out of bed. Oh should add shivers were present throughout.


At about 4.5 hours in I started what ended up being a 3-fa wank-a-thon binge and over the next 12-4 hours polished off 500mg (god I hate the days orders arrive sometimes) . I initially just wanted to try the 3-fa and give me a picker up because of how lazy the 5-apdb left me but compulsion got the better of me. I stayed up 40 hours. After the first 24 I still felt fairly clear-headed & not all groggy like I usually would during an all nighter and never had the anxiety of not being able to fall asleep as I would on most stims. 3-fa ran out at about 6 a.m. My girlfriend was pretty annoyed I stayed up all night & never came to bed so we had a minor argument around 11 when she woke up. Then at around 1-2 p.m. 24 hours after 5-apdb ingestion and about 7-8 hours after my last bump of 3-fa I decided to dip into my 4-fa and over the next 9-10 hours ingested 350mg , give or take.


Anyways I got a solid 8 hours of sleep after being up 40 hours and feel fine. I never mixed these while the main effects were present of the other so not sure how they'd go together. Giving the insane sedation of 5-apdb I feel like a stim is in need but I have no clue of the dangers. & I'm not the type who prefers meth+MDMA over straight MDMA. MDMA is somewhat sedating to me and I suppose lacks the push of speediness for an all nighter out raving or at a festival , but most of my drug use is with myself or a couple others in a much more laid back atmosphere so straight MDMA is quite good for me on its own without a stim , but wow wow wow this 5-apdb is just wayyyy to sedating.


Any idea what would be the least harmful stim to mix with this. I have 4-fa , 2-fma & pentedrone at my disposal. Never tried my 2-fma , hated the pent and love the 4-fa a little to much for my own good (I liked 3-fa but sadly it's gone).


Since this is a harm reduction site , I don't condone my multi-drug binge , and feel it was hugely irresponsible. That being said I never really used them in combination and each chem was taken after MOST effects of the last worse off. 


I didn't eat for a good 36 hours outside of a banana & a cookie or two so after getting 8 hours of sleep I do feel pretty weak/sore but no depression is present.


Lastly since this turned into a bit of a rant then straight forward facts about my experience with 5-apdb I should add it definitely gave me the shits. Not to the point where I had to rush to the bathroom in fear of an accident but during the come up GI issues arouse twice. Nothing like the automatic laxative 4-mec gives me , and not as annoying as DOC trips where ill end up sitting there an hour , get lost in the swirling , breathing threads on my towel hanging on the shower rack and realize 45 minutes later there's nothing but a teeny weeny rabbit turd there. Maybe TMI , sorry.


Anyways gonna be a while before I try this one again (months) and putting my FA up as well in a safe lace I can't easily access when temptation arises.


Overall was pleasurable but Regret Not going with a .5g purchase instead of the 1g I bought. Seems more potent by weight then MDMA though as I feel like 100mg would of been enough but was worried about tolerance from HOT-7 used 3 days prior. & I know this is a MDA analogue but I've never used it to my knowledge only MDMA which is why I use comparisons a few times. To put doses in perspective 100-125mg of MDMA would just be a tease (I'm a bigger guy) , an initial dose of 125-150 followed by a 50mg top up is usually my sweet spot but its been awhile since I've even did MDMA as I suspect I was sold the bk version last time (methylone) so I haven't pursued obtaining any in a while.


Anyways have 5-apb en route , 5-mapb soon & hopefully 6-apb so hoping these prove to be  more worthwhile chems (not saying 5-apdb was all negative , I just found the sedation unbearable , I honestly could have fell asleep 2 hours in if I wasn't paranoid  that sleeping while on it may pose extra dangers)


Lastly any thoughts or cautions against a 5-apdb & 4-fa combo. Maybe 100mg 4-fa followed by 75mg 5-apdb half hour later? Or would a more traditional straight stim without the euphoria 4-fa gives be a better option? No plans for the near future just brain storming

Nice reports on this novel chem!  For those who have tried 5-Apb or 6-Apb, how does it compare?  Is it more/less potent, or are the effects totally different?

I found the effects to be very different from 5-apb , but I've only used each once.


I think apdb is more potent by weight , but ill repot back when I've used both in the same dose range. I plan to basically flip flop dosages. Tried 9Omg 5-apb my first time , plan to go for 11O-12O next & I think it was 12O-125 with 5-adbp & plan to try 9O-1OO my next try .


Maybe next month ill give 5- adbp a go again and report back.


Out of the two it's the one I see more promise in but hard to tell with such limited experience.

^Thanks!  Besides potency, how would you say they're different?  Is one more psychedelic/speedy/sedating than the other?  I've only tried 6-Apb (once) so I have no frame of reference.

I found 5-apdb to be much more sedating & the peak to be much more intense. If I remember right I had to lay down during the peak as I felt somewhat disoriented.  


The comeup was much faster as well.


5-apb on the other hand was more subtle & came in waves. Never hit a strong/intense peak. This could all be due to dosage i suppose , which is why I can't really say which I find the better of the two . 5-apb though was not sedating for me at all & was actually stimulating & found it hard to sleep 1O hours after ingestion  , whereas 5-adbp I felt if I wanted to I could of slept during the peak.


For me neither were psychedelic .

How would people rate this is social settings? Too sedating? How is the intensity of the chemical compared to MDAI and MDMA?

This chemical is great of a social setting. Not too sedating at all.


I have never tried MDAI but I have done MDMA plenty of times.

Honestly feels like if a beginner's version of MDMA existed. Something very gentle, yet euphoric and amazing.


5-APDB is best combined with dopaminergic stimulant like 2-FMA (that is what I used and the combo was almost better than MDA)

"Best" is subjective. I won't disagree with you because yours is an opinion I'm sure many share. It probably has to depend on what activity you plan on doing.


My social settings tend to be calm and relaxed either that or I like thought and introspection. With that said I have combined this a few times with different tryptamines such as 4-aco-dmt and it certainly added an enjoyable aspect to the experience.

What were the dosage with the 2-fma combo?


Also curious to info on the tryptamine combo. (Dosage ? Other 4 subbed used?)


4-ho-MIPT + MDMA combo was my most euphoric experience to date.


Both 4-aco-dmt & 5-apdb are very sedative in my experiences so not sure if that combo is for me.

Was tripping with my friends last weekend. We were 4 guys, 3 of us did 5-apdb. The last guy did mxe and 5-meo-dmt.


Earlier experience with SRA's: MDMA, 6-apb.

Setting: Living room of my friends house. 

Dose: 145 mg oral, with at least 3 hours fasting before.


Aprrox. 1,5 hour before dosing the 5-apdb, waiting for the last guy who was also gonna do 5-apdb, we insufflated 8 mg's of 5-meo-dmt. A great short trip, lasted ½ an hour. Point of this is, that we dosed the 5-apdb on the (pretty great) afterglow of 5-meo-dmt. 


When we dosed we were pretty excited since my 2 friends had never done a SRA before. Because of my (and the other friend's) experiences with MDMA and 6-apb, we had put their expectations pretty high. Also, we had understood from what we had read, that the 5-apdb comeup was pretty quick. It was not. For the first hour after dosing, nothing really happened. Small alterations, physical and mental, but nothing of note. 


After 80 minutes we felt the warmth of SRA's, our hands were very sweaty, plus the jaw-clenching started. I was still very disappointed so far though, so we deciced to do a 30-40 mg's redose, insufflated. Man, great timing. I came up (for real) right before insufflating, while my friends, felt they came up after - as a result of the redose. 


During the peak, which lasted about an hour (from +1,5h - +2,5h) there was a slightly stimulating feeling to the trip. We danced around for a bit, talked a lot. Listened to trance (darkpsy, goa) and some DnB. I would not call this compound a stimulant though. Though moving around felt nice during the peak, sitting down was preferable. The "couch-lock" feeling was definitely there, at least for two of us. The other friend was actually a bit more stimulated, and for him walking around the living room was the natural thing to do. I guess we just react differently to any compound, but i'm pretty confident none of us felt any "real" stimulation.


When we went out to smoke weed during the peak (+2 h), we talked about going for a walk, but it just seemed somewhat... unnecessary, when we felt so good just sitting around the house. The euphoria and empathy was definitely there, and we felt great. It was definitely milder than MDMA though, both less euphoria and empathy. Seems like we were missing the dopamine part of the euphoric feeling, as in no (real) stimulation and a lot less mental euphoria than MDMA. The bodyhigh was great though. Just sitting down, running our hands through our hair was great, you could definitely feel the serotonin part of the euphoria. Also, the music appreciation was really good. 


After +2,5 hour, the trip got a little less intense, and we started a very very slow and mild comedown. It lasted til around +5 H, and during those 2,5 hours we would sit around, talk, listen to music and just feel happy and connected. At +5 h you could say we had almost come down, but then again there was a great afterglow, which just seemed like a very mild version of the peak actually. Still a good feeling and music appreciation. 


At this point, my friend and I, who had done DMT earlier, decided to do 12 mg's of 5-meo-dmt, insufflated. It started off way too intense - my friend threw up in the garden. I just had to lie down and ride off the most intense part of the 5-meo-dmt. 15 minutes after dosing, the bad feeling was gone, and we were left with a great psychedelic feeling. Nice bodyhigh, and a slight visual enhancement, some visuals. (Like the ceiling waving, intense colours etc.) As we came down from the 5-meo-dmt, we descended into an awesome 5-apdb/5-meo-dmt afterglow, which lasted till we comfortably feel asleep around +6,5 H. Overall a great night.


So in conclusion: 5-apdb has a great bodyhigh, but is less euphoric than MDMA.  It could be great for a social setting where MDMA is too pushy and overwhelming. We were definitely in control of the trip, (as long as we didn't combine with 5-meo-dmt.) And at least for two of us, it was not really stimulating at all. We were totally couch-locked for most of the trip.

I can confirm that my experience with 5-apdb was pretty much in line with this ^report, although my peak seemed a little bit longer

Any opinions on combining this with 6APB/6APDB? I'm wondering about how not only the two 'APDB' compounds will go together, but also how a low 50mg of APDB would act upon 6-APB

I'm very interested as well with this and the 6-APDB, as when together they have the same chemical structure as MDA.  What would the effects when taken together be in this case?  You would think that it would hold around the same?

Anyone have new reports or reports from users who already sampled this chemical? It seems like it's perfect for what I'm looking for. The 2-FMA combo intrigues me. I plan to order a lot as this compound is priced right. Just curious to hear others reports. The couch lock seems very cool to me. Has anyone puffed some AAA quality herb with the trip?

Researched this yesterday. I never tried 5-APB, but I have tried 6-APB and enjoyed it, but not as much as other people do. So I was a little hesitant in ordering it, but the effects people spoke of interested me. It's also pretty damn cheap for what it is. I went with 150mg oral ROA. Effects were felt within about 1hour. It was subtle with a nice peak. If it was stimulating it was sure hard to notice as I laid on the couch watching the new OZ movie from disney and had a rather enjoyable time. Overall I think this is a nice mood enhancer and not much else. I don't see this being something I'd take in a party situation like MDMA. It just provided a great afternoon that gave about 3hours of peakness and didn't leave me hungover or depressed. I woke up today and feel normal. I'm unsure if I will get more once what I have is gone. I'm more interested in the 5-MAPB/6-MAPB to be honest.

Anyone have some more comparisons between 5-apdb and 5-apb (especially this one), 6-apb and 5-mapb? I enjoyed the last three and was wondering how they compare to 5-apdb. Dose, effects, duration, whatever you can think off. Also does it have any similarity to MDAI (liked that one too)? Do any other chems combine nicely with it?

I have gone through 1g of 5-APDB by now, mostly mixed with ethylphenidate.


**Sex:** Male

**Age:** 19

**Weight:** 85kg / 187lbs

**Height:** 178cm 5' 10"


I'll give you one of the trips.


T - Swallowed a bomb of 80-100mg 5-APDB.

T+0:30 - Starting to feel the effects, somewhat more sociable.

T+1:00 - Okay, now I get a little body rush, similiar to that of MDMA. In a positive way of course. But firstly I get that rather initial part.

T+2:00 - Okay, effects are now fully here. Very good feeling, I am so in love... :D If anybody has done aMT, then this is not very much different from the stimulating part of aMT, as it is also rather a stable empathogen, unlike MDMA which has a very intense rush in the beginning. I am quite sleepy though and have no psychedelic effects. But at full effects I cannot really function 100%, meaning I am sleepy and am not thinking as when I am sober, but I do not want to get caught (with people who must not know that secret of mine), so I decide to insufflate about 60mg of ethylphenidate.

T+2:10 - I am very clear headed now. Lost that head load, meaning psychedelic part (though it is very mild with 5-APDB, nowhere near to MDMA or even less to aMT). I am somewhat confused. Feeling is good in many ways, but a bit confusing which I really dislike. Despite this, I can now think way better and am not sleepy anymore. I still have that super body feeling, that I am in love and feeling awesome and so on.

T+4:00 - Trip ended, to another bomb...


In conclusion I would say, that it is a very nice drug, especially when with people who shouldn't notice, as it doesn't mess up your brain as much as, for example, MDMA does. It doesn't have any real psychedelic value though, but it is a very good sedative, especially when combined with something stimulating (because it really lacks energy).

Still need to get a hold of this to see how well it compliments 6-APDB.  Imagine it would go down very well.  I'm hoping there would be some good needed euphoria going on.  Probably be very sedating though.

I just read carefully through both the this (5-APDB) and the [6-APDB thread](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/661435-The-Small-amp-Handy-6-APDB-Thread) and got the impression that the two compounds are almost complemental: while 5-APDB seems to be work (alsmost) exclusively as serotonin releaser, the dopaminergic and psychedelic side of the action seem to be concentrated on the 6-APDB side. does this make any sense? maybe someone with experience with both compounds can share his view on my ideas. has anyone ever tried combining the two? if my idea makes sense, this should be promising.

HEADS up doses 200mg and above will give you a stagger/impaired ability to walk without looking "fucked up". A few hours of sleep corrected this for me.


Otherwise I'd be telling people at work I hurt myself doing yardwork this weekend ;-).


I've planned to finish what I have left today (300mg+) and decide whether this is worth a return to my collection.

Hi, 


I've tried 5-apdb a few times. The best doses were between 150-200mg (for me). It's a little similar to the 5-apb/6-apbs but not exactly the same. It's missing the slight psychedelia but otherwise if felt quite similar. The taste is also similar, maybe not as pronounced. The emotional openness is also there. It feels like you can function quite sober while on it, but that is just my subjective experience. Other than that there are no real bad side effects and I can use it a few days in a row (but I can do the same with the apbs so that may not apply to anyone). Overall it's a good compound, not as good as the apbs, but still quite nice.

Those seem like quite high doses, given the 5/6-APB relationship and the existence of this as the HCl salt I would expect this to be active from 30mg and good around 70mg. Are you tolerant?

112 mg for a lightweight friend:   (oral) very positive reaction; similar to MDMA. Described himself as 'coming down' off it though about ~3 hours in


~152 mg for a close friend and I:  (oral) Kicked in about 2 hours after swallowing. Similar to 5-apb but somehow different. Slightly more mellow and relaxed feeling, although still dancing was very enjoyable. Not very psychedelic but there are undertones of psychedelia. Less talkative feeling than 5-apb, perhaps less MDMA-style euphoria but still euphoria in a different way. No come down the entire night, lasting 5-6 hours until falling asleep. Pretty enjoyable, felt surprisingly fine the next day, methylone or something destroys me the next day.


-115mg for small female: (oral) Stomach probelsm and nausea entire first 2.5 hours. Puked on the bus. Managed to enjoy herself after about 3 hours in but didn't act very like she was 'rolling' like subject 1.


Pretty interesting, so far i've tried 5-apb,5-apdb, 6-abp and 6-apdb. 6-apb seems like the most interesting, but i really liked 5-apb for hanging out with good friends and simply talking for hours.

The out of the estimated 15 times I dosed 6-apb over the past few years I threw up about 14 times. Always during the come up. 

So now I prefer to plug this series of chemicals if possible.  Has anyone used 5-apdb rectally? If so, did it compare positively to oral dosing?  


I`m looking forward to giving this a try. If it does turn out to be sedating,I`ll use a small dose of 2-fma and see if that helps.

^much less euphoria, that lasts **much** longer with no decipherable come-down leading to a generally very pleasant experience.

I had a highly successful first experiment with 5-APDB last night with some close friends who also tried it for the first time. I first took about 75 mg. After about 2 hours it was very subtle, not much effects to speak of, so I redosed with another 50 mg and that took it over the top! It was majorly activated when a friend gave me a back massage and from there it was full-on for many hours. After the massage I learned how to 'press the button'  to activate the serotonin release. It was like the first time I've ever rolled but without the jaw-clentching stim effects of MDMA. One other friend was also clearly full of euphoria for many hours, and he took a similar dose as myself. Subject #3 had very subtle effects. Not full-on euphoria, but she was definitely very happy, cheery, talkative and singing. Got to sleep easily about 6 hours after the second dose. Nice afterglow 16 hours later.

Edit: I should add that I dosed some MXE about 3-4 hours before the first dose of 5-APDB. I am very tolerant of MXE so I wasn't very concerned about any serotonin syndrome effects, but SS was possible I suppose, and for harm reduction purposes I don't think the two should be dosed that close together.

Probably looking in the wrong direction if you're looking for an MDA alternative close to MDA itself in effects. Consider 6-APDB or 6-APB, or even 5-APB, all of which are a lot closer in pharmacological action to MDA itself. 5-APDB is pretty much just an SSRA (selective serotonin releasing agent) like MDAI or IAP. 6-APB and 6-APDB on the other hand are quite strong dopamine and norepinephrine releasers like MDA itself. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Has anyone had any experience with 50mgs oral and 10mgs IN as an introduction dose?

Well I went ahead and tested over 125mgs IN with this one. Your not really missing out if you haven't had this one, A nice body high but that's about it. Made me downright sleepy.

Considering it's pretty selective for serotonin that's not entirely surprising. Expect something like MDAI

Ok,

So I finally got around to revisiting this one the only difference being absolutely clean of other chemicals that could factor(last time I'd had mxe the night before)

I weighed 100mg(my weight 75kg aged over fifty) of the fine light powder and divided it into four piles. I insulfated one of the 25mg piles and instantly regretted it. This is probably the most caustic research chemical I've encounted so far. 

I put the rest in a capsule and took it po this time just after finishing a large salad for lunch(I anticipated vomitting as before and thought it might help). To my suprise I experienced no nausea this time. This was quite different than before. It took about three hours to reach the peak though I started feeling it in less than an hour. I played guitar for a short while yet was no more inspired or sensative to sound than usual. Motor function seemed effected somewhat, but not impaired. Mood was elevated almost to euphoria. I noticed an increased sociability. After about three and half hours I started drinking ethanol while watching TV relaxing with friends. I then experienced significant potentiation of the alcohol which seemed about twice normal potentcy. I went to bed ridiculously drunk for a mere three drinks. I awoke the next morning feeling somewhat trashed from the alcohol, next time I'll probably not drink.

Anyway, this time was much more promising and pleasant. I think I'll up the dose to 150mg maybe next month.

As to alternate methods of ingestion, the caustic nature of this one, at least from my source, certainly precludes plugging, insulfating, and I'M. I have injected IV other caustic shit in my youth but am loath to punish the few remaining injection sites out of idle curiousity. I leave that experiment to younger more heavily veined psychonauts.

Since there is little information on this chemical, I thought I would share a combination that I decided to try out the other day. I find 5-APDB on it's own to be fairly sedating, with some euphoria and not much empathy. The first 2 times that I dosed this chemical I found myself annoyed or bothered by others, which rarely happens to me on any substance besides this one and alcohol. I found Oral dosing to give a peak of 2-3 hours, followed by 6 hours or so of slight physical discomfort, tense muscles, and 'Restless leg syndrome' while trying to get comfortable.


I found the physical discomfort to outweigh the positives when dosed orally, so I decided to try Plugging it this time. To counteract the sedation and boredom that I get with this chem, I decided to insufflate 20mg of 4-FA. Enough for a decent amount of stimulation, and enough to make the experience more euphoric. I kept the 4-FA low enough so I wouldn't elicit much of a serotonergic response from it.


I weighed out 50mgs of 5-APDB, dissolved it in warm water (it took awhile of shaking), and readied my oral syringe. I then weighed my 20mg of 4-FA and lined it up. I then plugged the 5-APDB. 5-APB took about 20 minutes to feel and 60 minutes to peak when I plugged it, and it didnt seem as potent with rectal administration. However, 5-APDB I began to feel in about 10 minutes and I reached my peak in 30. 50mgs plugged seemed to equal about 100mgs oral, as I expected. I believe 5-APDB lends itself more for rectal administration than 5-APB. I snorted the 4-FA about 10 minutes after plugging the 5-APDB.


I began to do chores around the house while listening to music. About 40 minutes after dosing, the 2 chemicals started getting along very nicely. It was pretty euphoric considering the dose, there was good music enhancement, and I was having a wonderful time doing the dishes. I found it to feel somewhat similar to 5-ME (God I miss you) which I wasnt expecting. I had a very enjoyable peak that lasted about an hour.


I cannot give a timeline or anything. I find both 5-APDB and 4-FA to be slightly moreish and plugging to be somewhat moreish in itself, I ended up plugging a few more doses of 5-APDB over the course of 5 hours or so, ranging from 15-40mg. I also snorted a few bumps of 4-FA throughout the night. It remained a pleasant experience throughout.


Plugging 5-APDB did what I was hoping it would, pretty much got rid of any physical discomfort that I associate with 5-APDB. I will probably be plugging it from now on.

I don't recall having any discomfort when I plugged this one. I remember the pain that both insufflated and plugged 4-FA gives. I'm not saying that it's not caustic, I just didnt feel any discomfort myself

5-APDB is normally the HCl salt so it should indeed be more suited to plugging than 5-APB, which was normally the succinate salt.


x-APDB is much more selective for serotonin so the sedating feel and reduced euphoria is not surprising. The combination with 4-FA should give a much better rounded experience as the dopamine release allows a more traditional empathogen experience.

I don't think I'll be dosing 5-APDB again without a dopaminergic stimulant, I just find it too uncomfortable without it. I have done things like MDAI without any added dopamine release and have been able to enjoy it, but 5-APDB not so much

Do we know that this is really that selective? It doesn't touch DAT or NET, but there could be some binding to monoamine receptors, since it bears a little similarity to MDA, which is known to bind to the same.


Also, please titrate your doses. We don't yet know that people will respond reliably to this drug, or any other new drugs for that matter, so going off of posted reports to figure out how much to take is potentially hazardous.

I found 6-apb hcl to be almost uncomfortable without adding 2fma to the mix. and seen some people flat out tell me they like methylone better than mdma because mdma was too sedating and almost uncomfortable.


but I can agree with mr danharper01 above me, i would assume that because 6-apb with 2-fma seriously flipped it around, i didnt like the 6-apb without it, and with it I liked it better than MDMA.


I want to try 5-apdb out but I don't know which F(M)A to pair with it.

And I have access to all of them. Hmm :/

No we don't know it's *that* selective, but subjectively it does seem to be more so than MDA.


I'm surprised anyone felt the need to combine 6-APB with a stimulant, I thought it was fine on its own.

Some people fine 6-apb stimulating, other do not. I find it to be very very trippy and sedating without adding a stimulant

So compared to 6-APB, how are visuals? It doesn't seem like anyone has mentioned visuals specifically.


And has anyone smoked Cannabis with it? As it seems to be more "Sedative" than similar chems, they will probably go well together.

And has anyone tried it with 5-Meo-DALT?


Or UR-144/5F-AKB48?

6 apb and the 5 and 6 apb combo is much more visual


5-apdb is kinda like mdai but less fun

I think dosage is the factor here. From a simple standpoint, 6-APB releases more of the reward and stimulating (dopamine and norepinephrine) chemicals than MDMA does, and less of the lovey serotonin. 5-APB releases notably more serotonin than MDMA, and less dopamine and norepinephrine. Serotonin itself is relaxing, calming, sedating, and can even make you a tad sleepy - while dopamine and norepinephrine in combination make for that intense energetic rush.


So why do so many people get sedated from 6-APB? I didn't understand it for the longest time and thought it was plainly people getting mixed up batches or something but I suspect now that it's all due to dose. A friend of mine who I've rolled with plenty of times now would always take 60-80mg - she loved the stuff better than MDMA and would dance away all night. One day I forgot how low she normally doses and gave her a full 140mg bomb - she spent the entire trip floored, tripping out, zero euphoria, barely enjoyed a moment of it. 


IIRC 6-APB also has a pretty high affinity for 5-HT2B receptors, encouraging the balance to sway in the favour of trippy piperazine like mongy serotonin flooryness to put it in better terms at higher doses. I could be chatting out my arse though, but that's my theory. ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


Try dosing lower and see what happens? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Like 70-80mg or so, you might be surprised too if you think that'd be too low a dose. I was always dosing 150-175mg+ and last time I took 75mg and rolled pretty much just as hard minus the psychedelia and overbearingness of it all.


Anyway sorry for getting off topic forgot this was the 5-APDB thread - just to reiterate what a couple others have said so I can say something slightly on topic yeah I believe 5-APDB is an SSRA (selective serotonin releasing agent), so think MDAI and the like, rather than MDMA, 6-APB, 5-APB etc. Probably good in mixes, but don't expect to "roll" when taking on its own - great for cuddling with loved ones and relaxing though I'm sure. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Has anyone tried this in combination with A-pvp?  I'm wondering if it would be good for the comedown, like after the last dose of apvp. Or maybe It would be nice to just do them simultaneously.  I've yet to try 5-apdb, but should be doing so within a week or two. I've got plenty of experience with a-pvp though. I'm unable to take benzos/opiates so I usually rough the comedown out with simple hot tea, tiny bites of food, etc. I tried ketamine on it once and felt slimy(I think I was noticing all the sweat I'd produced from staying up on a-pvp.)

I'd like to see more info about this chem.


I'm a bit surprised there isn't more posts about it. When combined with a straight dopaminergic stimulant like 2-FMA, it's a fantastic experience. Quite a bit of euphoria and MDMA like feelings. Eye wiggles, sweaty palms etc. Music enhancement is definitely there with the combo and is exactly what I was looking for. It can feel a bit "busy" though. I noticed when i listened to music at fairly loud volumes (through studio monitors paired with a sub) it was almost like there was too much sound, like I couldn't process it all at once. Sort of hard to explain..... I think it had more to do with sheer volume plus actual speakers (my studio setup gets incredibly loud and clear) vs headphones, as the issue doesn't occur with headphones, regardless of volume.


5-APDB by itself, not so much fun, but that should be expected. It is sedating and definitely has a lazy feel to it. You feel good and mood enhancement is there along with some euphoria, but it's sort of an odd euphoria and has a slight mental fog which leaves you feeling a bit "out of it".


I first tried combining it with 4-FA. It wasn't entirely planned, as I didn't dose the 5-APDB until 5-6 hours after my initial dose of 4-FA. I dosed around ~110mgs of 4-FA plugged, followed by a 40mg redose about 2-3 times spread out. By the time I dosed the 5-APDB I was already passed the peak of the 4-FA and more so coming down. I believe I dosed around 50-60mg plugged. There was a noticeable mood lift and I could feel the serotonin push, only slightly, like I was coming up on MDMA or something similar, but it never seemed to "get there" which I attributed to having dosed the 4-FA so much earlier (which already acts on serotonin itself). It mostly made me feel more relaxed and comfortable. 


Tonight however, I plugged 30mg of 2-FMA. I came up pretty fast and more so than usual for some reason. I experienced a tiny tiny amount of nausea which almost never happens to me, regardless of the stimulant. After about an hour, when I started to notice the 2-FMA slightly die down, I plugged 65mg of 5-APDB. This led to a complete rolling feeling and lots of euphoria. I redosed 35mg of 5-APDB and also 20mg more of 2-FMA. Strong bruxism and sweaty hands, but I'm still feeling pretty great. The "in your face" like euphoria died down which is why I redosed, but it didn't come back as strong. I'm still left feeling plenty good though. It's entirely different than if I were to have just dosed the 2-FMA, which by itself has little to no euphoria. I'm not sure if I'll redose again. 


I still haven't figured out what a good initial dose of 5-APDB is. 


I need to dose them both around the same time, hopefully I'll get an even better experience. I was thinking ~30mg of 2-FMA plugged, followed by ~100mg of 5-APDB 5 minutes later or so. Only reason I had an hour go by before I dosed the 5-APDB tonight was because I simply forgot about it.


Anyone who tried this by itself and didn't care for it so much needs to try it with 2-FMA or something similar. I'm almost positive the experience will be highly enjoyable. 


Sorry for the scatterbrained post, still feeling it plenty and it definitely makes you more talkative.

Sounds rough, hope you're ok now. I have no idea why it happened and am not aware of any research about it being a MAOI. I've also taken it alone and with eph and other than it always feeling like a shittier MDAI never had any notable side effects during and/or after.

It must have been because of either rice, chocolate or cheese. Latter two associate with MAOIs = NONO. I've been clean for past (almost) week. Heart rate is 95-100 BPM.

Idk about rice, but I'm sure I've eaten chocolate and cheese around the times of taking 5-apdb and other benzofurans. Now I'm not saying you're wrong just that it's not well enough researched to say for sure it's a MAOI. It does look like that, but maybe something else is going on.


Whatever the cause I wish you a speedy recover!

Well my heart rate is below 100, I am feeling happy, very talkactive. Great. Actually very energetic, compared to what 5-APDB should be. Now I have some serious doubts about the compound itself. 5-APDB should be VERY sedative, have almost no effect on norepinephrine. Unless there was something mystic going on or MAOI (because I didn't eat regular cheese, two types of aged cheese). Because at low dosage (allergy test and 10-20mg after that) I really felt nothing spectacular, so it can't be ultrapotent substitute.

What does safe or scam about your vendor?


Does your country have some sort of harm reduction organization that can test it for you?


Have you had any other of the benzofurans? Was it similar in taste?


And yes, this doesn't sound like 5-apdb to me either.

Very reputable vendor. Not that I'd know of. I've had 5-APDB and 5-MAPB before, but I couldn't taste it really through the capsule. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Right, caps, forget that people use them... each benzofuran has a specific taste and that's enough to tell them apart. I've had all except the eapbs and 6-apdb (plan to) and none did anything close to this to my heart rate. I tried to pm you something about testing it and finding out exactly what you have, but your inbox is full so if you want to talk about it make some space in your inbox and pm me.

OK thanks Blue Bull.


Well If I here find no answer I think nowhere.Because:

1.I studied Pharmazie and I am Phamacist(which can work 10 hours a week) with drugs

2.The  people here have often psychological problems as I have,shrinks only  read books.You never will Understand I you feel not the pain the comes

in endogenes depression without reason from one hour to the next.

3.I found after ten years 3 substances from perhaps 300(all nootropics,vitamins which you can buy on amazon) meds I tried.

That  was first Amisulpride low dose(the dopamine autorezeptor therory,and  5HT7a ) which turned on lights for 3 years for me.Then one moring it was  over.nada

then Bupropion 600 mg for 6 month then it stopped.

And  now for 3 years 3MMC wich is beginning to fade,and dose is  escalating.Sides are not getting more over time.I think the body is  hard,and can adapt to many toxic substances.


Well my conclusion  is I have a special brain areal that does not work normally.This mostly  needs dopamin and very little serotonin.

No Noradrenalin at all(see diasters with strattera,and venlafaxine)


So is it possible to creat a rc combination.Perhaps Phenmetrazine and a little 5 apbd.I am looking for advice;-)

With 5 APDB or 6 and with 3 MMC or Phenmetrazine i have a vendor with 10 on safe or scam.MDPV was like ritalin only no sleep at all.

I get the impression with this one that combining it with a stim is recommended-was thinking 2 FA or 3 FPM.  Is it that sedative or is this just in comparison with other MDA/MDMA derivatives?

IME it's lacking the stimmy sparkle by itself, especially if comparing to MDMA. Combo with 4-FA was  pretty good IME. I'd combo it with 6-APDB (1/1) and an additional 40mg of  4-FA or similar. 3-FPM had some negative body effects for me so personally I  wouldnt combine it with serotonin releasers. 2-FA should be a good  choice IMO.


I'm out of 5-APDB now, only left with 6-APB and 6-APDB, oh well...

When using 4-FA by itself, Id use about 80-100mg of it. 5-APDB by itself - also 80-100mg, combined together I used to go for 80mg of 5-APDB and about 40-60mg of 4-FA. My favorite was 50mg of 6-APDB, 50mg of 5-APDB and 50mg of 4-FA - that was a roll to remember! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Too much 4-FA in combos with APBs and APDBs feels a bit jittery and gives me headaches, which makes me think of potential neurotoxic processes going on when you combine these drugs. I think it has to do with simultaneous dopamine and serotonin release and reuptake inhibition. Feels good though, I liked the combo way more than MDMA by itself...8)
