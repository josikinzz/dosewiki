## Subjective Experience

First synthesised in 1942, TPA didn’t appear on the markets until early in 2016,
shortly after the UK ban on the structurally similar MPA. This came just weeks prior
to the implementation of the Psychoactive Substances Act, which made its sale and
import unlawful (although not its possession).

I only found time to test it after the ban came into force, and wrote the following
report the day after my initial experiment:

\`\`\`
I finally tested this one last night. Despite the mixed and sometimes
ambiguous reports I dosed at 120mg, via lines of 20, 25, 25, 25 and 25, which
were insufflated over several hours.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I started what probably constituted a mini-binge at about 4pm.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The lift on the first 20mg was rapid, and was really quite nice. Nose burn was
evident, but I've certainly felt worse.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
This was quite functional, but with some euphoria and a slight empathogenic
edge, which brought with it a little horn. I must say that, generally, I enjoyed
it.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
It is quite a long time since I sampled MPA, so this probably has to be taken
with a pinch of salt, but it did seem to be a little smoother. A number of
amphetamine-like qualities were present, adding to its recreational value.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I was able to consume a light meal in the middle of the ride, which I can't
normally face on stimulants, and I had some vitamins earlier in the day, which
probably helped what was a reasonably soft comedown.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
By 11pm it was fading, and I'd had enough. As I was going to be busy the
following day (today) I had a little etizolam and slept like a baby.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
On waking this morning I felt pretty good, possibly feeling the tail end of the
experience.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Overall, I had an agreeable evening, and indeed, I now regret not stocking
more than a single 1g baggy prior to the ban. I should also add that this would
have made for a very pleasant sojourn on a much lower dose than I
experimented with.
\`\`\`
On the basis of my tests, this appeared to be more than just a legal replacement for
MPA. It delivered a positive experience in its own right.

Despite arriving on the market late in the fray, I have no idea why it wasn’t more
popular than it was. It has now, of course, largely passed into the annals of history, as
a minor player during the dying embers of the legal high years.

\`\`\`
TPA arrived late on the scene, missing the opportunity to
become a major force in the legal high market

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiopropamine*

Thiopropamine, also known as 1-(2-thienyl)-2-aminopropane, is a stimulant drug of the arylalkylamine family. It is an analogue of amphetamine where the phenyl ring has been replaced by thiophene. It has similar stimulant effects to amphetamine but with around one third the potency. The N-methyl and thiophen-3-yl analogues are also known and are somewhat more potent, though still generally weaker than the corresponding amphetamines.

## Pharmacology

Like amphetamine and most of its analogues, thiopropamine most likely is a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor and/or releasing agent.
Thiopropamine is likely to be metabolized into active 4-hydroxymethiopropamine and thiophene S-oxides. These are further deaminated by CYP2C in liver transforming them into inactive 1-(Thiophen-2-yl)-2-propan-2-one which is a phenylacetone derivative. Propan-2-amines are not metabolized by monoamine oxidases and most actually behave as competitive monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
