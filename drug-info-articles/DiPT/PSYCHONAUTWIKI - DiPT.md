**N,N-Diisopropyltryptamine** (also known as **Diisopropyltryptamine** and **DiPT** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. It is a structural analog of [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) and related to various psychedelic tryptamines such as [4-HO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DiPT) , [5-MeO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DiPT) , and [MiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MiPT) .

The first human trials of DiPT were undertaken in 1975 by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) , who would co-author and publish a paper detailing its synthesis and human psychopharmacology in 1981. A summary of the synthesis and reports of human use is included in Shulgin's 1997 book *[TiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TiHKAL)* ("Tryptamines I Have Known And Loved"). It has been sold online as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) .

While most [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) are known for producing vivid visual distortions, DiPT's effects are reported to be primarily auditory in nature. Anecdotal reports have described it causing a downward shift in perceived pitch and other unusual distortions. It has been suggested that DiPT may have value in neurological research due to its unique effects on auditory perception. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Additional [subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) of DiPT include a [body high](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations) , moderate [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , mild [visuals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting) , [dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness) , and [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) .

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of DiPT, and it has a limited history of human use. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

DiPT, or N,N-diisopropyltryptamine, is a synthetic indole alkaloid molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicylic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain.

DiPT also contains two isopropyl groups bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone. Isopropyl groups are a three carbon (propyl) chain bound at the middle carbon to the chemical structure. DiPT has substituted analogues such [5-MeO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DiPT) .

DiPT is analogous to [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , containing two isopropyl groups bound at R N instead of the two methyl groups found in [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) .

## Pharmacology

The [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects of DiPT are believed to come from its efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptor. DiPT also has notable binding affinities at the dopamine receptors, adrenergic receptors, and the serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine transport sites. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience remains subject to on-going scientific investigation.

## Subjective effects

Although DiPT's effects are primarily auditory, some users have reported [lack of coordination or balance](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) , [stomach bloating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stomach_bloating) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , and visual [distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting) at higher doses. Aside from these, the most prevalent non-auditory effect is inner ear pressure (which has been painful in some instances such as when combined with [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) ). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)** ### Auditory effects
 
- There is much speculation as to the nature of DiPT's aural distortion. At lower dosages, it has been reported to have an effect similar to a flanging, or a phase shift (Defined as an audio effect produced by mixing two identical sounds together, one sound delayed by a small amount with relation to the other). At medium and higher dosages, the effect of DiPT is typically a radical shift downward in perceived pitch. This shift also tends to be nonlinear in that the shift downwards varies in relation to the initial pitch, for example, higher pitches are not lowered as much as already low pitches. This can produce bizarre sounds and render music disharmonious or unrecognizable These auditory effects of DiPT are very apparent in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly includes: 
- **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)**
- **[Tinnitus](/w/index.php?title=Tinnitus&action=edit&redlink=1)** - This is more common in quiet areas or is exaggerated whilst yawning. It does not necessarily hurt in the ears and the pitch and frequency are not as high and constant.
- **[Ear pressure](/w/index.php?title=Ear_pressure&action=edit&redlink=1)** - This effect is generally mild but has been painful in some cases. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of DiPT are reportedly very lucid and clear-headed in comparison to most other [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) . 
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)** - This effect is subjective and depends on the person and the perceived tunes.
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Ego dissolution](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Visual effects
 
- The sensory effects of DiPT are mostly auditory, however it may still produce visual effects, in a similar fashion to other serotonergic psychedelics, especially at higher dosages These effects can include: 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) , [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Morphing) and [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) )*
- **[Color enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Color_enhancement)**
- **[Depth perception distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depth_perception_distortions)**
- **[Geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry)** - The visual geometry produced by this compound can be described as somewhat similar in appearance to that of [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** ### After effects
 
- The auditory effects of DiPT can last many times longer than it's cognitive, physical or visual effects. The auditory effects can also be retained for longer periods of time in a similar fashion to how one can not as easily forget something that has already been seen. Common after effects include: 
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) .

## Research

One experiment involving subjects with perfect pitch indicated that there is no clear relationship between perceived pitch and actual pitch.

Although recent unpublished research has examined the role of DiPT in hearing perception in rodents, it is not clear that the auditory effect is preserved in nonhuman species; this finding indicates that DiPT does not produce effects similar to other tryptamine psychedelics such as DPT and 5-MeO-DMT in acoustic startle reflex paradigms. DiPT still remains widely unexplored.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational DiPT do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because DiPT is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal reports from those who have tried DiPT suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

As with many psychedelics, the use of DiPT has the potential to bring about long-lasting perceptual and psychological alterations. DiPT is known to chronically alter the perception of sound and talking, which may not be suitable for everyone.

### Dependence and abuse potential

DiPT is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of DiPT is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). DiPT presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of DiPT all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

## Legal status

- **Germany** : DiPT is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.
