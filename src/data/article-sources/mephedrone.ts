## Subjective Experience

First synthesised in 1929, mephedrone was rediscovered in 2003 (credited to Dr
Zee). It became extremely popular from 2008, and indeed, at one point surveys
suggested that it ranked alongside MDMA in terms of number of UK users.

This situation was greeted by a lengthy period of media hysteria, inclusive of flagrant
exaggeration and outright propaganda, which even extended to deaths being falsely
attributed to it. Inevitably it was soon classified in the UK (2010) and scheduled in
the United States (2012).

Online, Erowid describes it as “a stimulant with empathogenic qualities”, whilst
TripSit refers to it as “a short lived euphoric stimulant”. Drugs-forum.com offers this
sensible suggestion

\`\`\`
“Insufflating mephedrone can dramatically increase the urge to redose,
therefore it is important users set out a maximum amount for the night and
stick to it”.
\`\`\`
This is advice which I will certainly heed.

I measure approx 150mg (156mg on the scale) and divide this into doses of 75mg,
25mg, 25mg and 25mg. I measure another 100mg for the scenario in which I wish to
explore further. My absolute upper limit is therefore 250mg. I throw the rest away.

Insufflation is the most popular RoA. However, I elect to experiment initially via the
oral route, and then subsequently snort a few lines. This approach does appear to be
fairly common, particularly for lengthy sessions.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I wrap the 75mg in cigarette paper and bomb it with water. [2:50pm]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:15 Other than the occasional shiver there has been no response thus far.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:30 I perceive an increase in body temperature, and perhaps there is a
minor heady feeling. These early signs, which indicate a slow-burning onset,
are enough for me to hold off with the insufflation plan.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:45 I now feel somewhat elevated and relaxed. There is a nice mild buzz to
this: a certain high and uplift of mood. There are no rough edges or body load
apparent so far, and this is certainly manageable. My pupils are half dilated
and I am comfortably warm, apart from my hands, which are cool and
clammy.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
This is a nice level, although a little higher might be even better. I'll see where
this goes during the next 15 minutes and then take a further decision
regarding the redosing.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:55 I check my blood pressure for no reason other than curiosity. It is
175/89 with a BPM of 65. Whilst I brush this aside under the influence, I do
realise that it is of concern.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 An hour into the experience, I believe that the onset is complete. This
is quite a happy level, and it isn't too intense. I am feeling stimulation,
euphoria and some empathogenic edge, which are all very pleasant.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Regarding horn, drive enhancement is certainly available, so I fully
understand those users who articulate this aspect, although stim-dick seems
to be a factor too (but not to the point of total dysfunctionality). The relatively
short duration (compared to amphetamine) and thus the potential need for
top-ups might also be issues to take on board here.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
I am looking forward to the insufflation, as an increase in intensity would
surely be enjoyable, but at the same time, online warnings that the snort is
painful are fresh in my mind.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:10 I bite the bullet and rail 25mg. This takes me to 100mg, 75mg of which
was ingested orally. The snort wasn't at all bad, and certainly nothing like as
painful as some users suggested.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:25 Surprisingly, there was no instant rush. Perhaps there has been a
minor increase in intensity, but this seems to have crept up slowly rather than
appearing suddenly.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I am as high as I have been, probably a little higher, but it has been a gentle
incline throughout.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:50 I am subjectively in a similar place to an hour ago, but with a greater
sense of depth. My blood pressure is now 162/98 and my BPM is 69.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:55 I snort the next 25mg. As this is proving to be extremely smooth and
enjoyable, I also prepare the 100mg which I had put aside for a potential
extension.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:00 I insufflate the final 25mg of the primary batch. My total consumption
is now 75mg oral and 75mg insufflated, which is well into common territory
according to the harm reduction websites.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Within a couple of minutes this latest hit has elevated the high and noticeably
increased its intensity. This is undoubtedly what is referred to as the rush. It
has the same feel as earlier but is significantly headier in nature.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I am now flying high. It would appear that 150mg, at least of this particular
sample, is my take-off threshold. This is consistent with a significant number
of forum reports.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I would suggest that this is closer to MDMA than amphetamine. It is smoother
and less physical than the latter, but not really as empathogenic as the former.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:20 I am still at the new high, very warm (physically), and in a very
contented and comfortable bubble.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
It occurs to me that this would beat alcohol hands down if I was socialising. It
has the feel of a drug to share with friends, although I am quite happy
regardless.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:30 I can understand how the desire to stay at this level leads to
compulsive redosing, particularly as the duration is presented as short.
Coming-down will be a drag. This is a danger of course, but it doesn't feel like
it whilst actually engaging.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
T+2:40 There is some jaw tension now along with the urge to grind (resisted).
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Although I am higher my pupils seem to be less dilated than earlier, which I
find to be curious.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:50 I insufflate the first 25mg of the 100mg reserve.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I feel that I now have a better understanding of this drug. There is indeed a
rush, like an influx of euphoria, which is extremely rewarding. There is real
temptation to chase it, again and again, as per the various reports and
warnings.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
It is very easy to see how users got through multiple grams of this over a
weekend binge session when it was at the height of its popularity.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:10 The second line of the 100mg reserve is fiendishly insufflated. The
grand total has reached 200mg.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I am as high as the proverbial kite.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I check my pupils again: they are now more dilated than at any point
previously.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+4:20 The third line of the 100mg reserve is gleefully snorted, and 15
minutes later the final 25mg is hoovered.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+5:20 I am still rolling, but not as intensely. This is slowly winding down.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+5:40 I am gently returning to base. I feel no hangover or ill effects so far,
and the urge to redose has dissipated. This is certainly one of the shortest
acting chemicals of this class, which of course can be a positive attribute for
some social occasions.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+7:00 The show is almost completely over. There are some residue effects in
play, including a little stimulation, but simultaneously I am becoming weary.
My pupils are back to their normal size.
\`\`\`
Following this adventure, I slept reasonably well, and there was no hangover in the
morning. This was an entirely different aftermath to those I had endured with
amphetamine and MDMA.

This was a very enjoyable experience, and one which confirmed the reputation of
mephedrone for short term effect and the temptation to sustain the euphoric high via
compulsive redosing. I suspect that this would be harder to resist in a more
recreational environment, which in turn may have led to a less gentle landing. I
would therefore re-emphasize the need to set a maximum dose in advance. It is
probably also wise to stress the need for caution in terms of mixing this with other
drugs, and of course, don’t skip the usual safety measures (Section 1.1).

4-Methylmethcathinone (Mephedrone, 4-MMC)
 
Basics
 
by Erowid
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
[4-Methylmethcathinone Images](https://erowid.org/4_methylmethcathinone_images.shtml)
 
4-Methylmethcathinone is a synthetic stimulant with euphoric and empathogenic effects that gained popularity in the U.K., Ireland, Australia, and Europe between 2007 and 2009. The effects of 4-methylmethcathinone are often compared to those of MDMA, MBDB, bk-MDMA (methylone), cocaine, methamphetamine and other euphoric stimulants. Because of its short duration and intense rush, there are numerous reports of compulsive redosing, resulting in the use of more 4-methylmethcathinone than intended. 
 
[ [Main 4-Methylmethcathinone Vault](https://erowid.org/4_methylmethcathinone.shtml) ]
 
[Dose](https://erowid.org/4_methylmethcathinone_dose.shtml) #
 
A standard oral dose of 4-methylmethcathinone is between 75 and 200 mg. It is most frequently found as a powder, though a few tablets have been commercially produced.
 
Price #
 
As of November 2009, 4-methylmethcathinone is primarily sold online and is available for as low as \$20 (USD) for a single gram, with bulk pricing as low as \$15 (USD) per gram.
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/4_methylmethcathinone_law.shtml) #
 
4-Methylmethcathinone is temporarily Schedule I in the United States and it would be considered an illegal analogue of methcathinone if intended for human consumption. 4-methylmethcathinone is controlled in a number of countries, including Australia, Denmark, Germany, New Zealand, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
 
[Chemistry](https://erowid.org/4_methylmethcathinone_chemistry.shtml) #
 
4-Methylmethcathinone is a synthetic chemical similar in structure to methcathinone.

History #
 
Little has been published about the history of 4-methylmethcathinone prior to its introduction into the world online markets in 2007. The first country to ban it by name was Israel in December 2007.
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
The Substance:
 
Mephedrone, 4-MMC, Meow, M-Cat, Bubbles
 
The Experience:
 
unknown
 
[EFFECTS](https://erowid.org/4_methylmethcathinone_effects.shtml) #
 
Onset #
 
Depending on how much and how recently one has eaten food, oral 4-methylmethcathinone generally takes 15-45 minutes to take full effect. On a full stomach, onset can be considerably slower. When insufflated, effects are usually felt within a few minutes and the peak is reached within 30 minutes or less.
 
Duration #
 
The primary effects of 4-methylmethcathinone last approximately 2-3 hours when taken orally. For many people there is an additional period of time (1-4 hrs) where it is difficult to go to sleep but where mood and mind-set are mostly back to baseline. It is quite common for users to report a strong urge to redose as the effects wane, between 45 and 120 minutes after initial ingestion. With lower levels of consumption, the day-after effects are relatively mild, with most users reporting light to no hangover. Heavy users report worrying neurological and vasoconstrictive symptoms that can last days or weeks.
 
Visual Effects #
 
Visuals Summary Needed.
 
PROBLEMS #
 
Nausea, teeth-clenching, compulsive redosing, heart palpitations, racing heart, increased blood pressure, and other effects of high dose stimulants.
 
Contraindications #
 
- Do not take 4-methlmethcathinone if you are currently taking an MAOI. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorex or Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). Stimulants and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination. Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI.
- At strong doses, do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive.
- If you have a seizure or convulsive disorder or heart problems, you may be at higher risk for health problems when taking stimulants.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
4-Methylmethcathinone is not likely to cause much physical dependence or withdrawal symptoms, but many users report difficulty controlling their own use within a short period of time. It is unknown whether use might lead to long-term psychological addiction and related problems, but it is likely that 4-methylmethcathinone could be one of a number of stimulants that are part of a pattern of stimulant overuse.
 
Long-Term Health Problems #
 
There have been reports of vasoconstriction with repeated dosing, including moderate to severe symptoms of tingling and numbness in the extremities, headache, light-headedness and worrisome skin discoloration.
 
Risk of Death #
 
Risks of death associated with stimulants usually involve cardiovascular problems, overheating, and dangerous drug interactions as well as accidents related to intoxication and multi-drug combinations. 4-methylmethcathinone has been associated with several deaths, but details of the circumstances of these incidents are scanty.

DESCRIPTION #
 
General Effects Notes
 The effects of 4-methylmethcathinone are often compared to those of MDMA, MBDB, bk-MDMA (methylone), cocaine, methamphetamine and other euphoric stimulants. 
 
 4-methylmethcathinone does not include substantial psychedelic visual effects and is perhaps best known for its euphoric effects and reports of compulsive redosing. 
 
 
Routes of Administration
 As with other psychoactives, oral 4-methylmethcathinone ingestion takes slightly longer to cause effects and lasts longer. Insufflation (snorting) is more associated with compulsive / addictive use patterns. Smoking 4-methylmethcathinone is not commonly reported. 
 
 
Addiction and Compulsive Use
 Initial reports suggested that 4-methylmethcathinone was a "non-addictive" alternative to methamphetamine, cocaine, and other stimulants, but there is increasing evidence that it causes compulsive use patterns that are similar to or stronger than those of other recreational euphoric stimulants. It is unlikely to be physically addictive, meaning that withdrawal symptoms are minimal and likely not life threatening, but psychological addiction in some users seems likely to be a problem with this substance.
 
EXPERIENCE EXCERPTS #
 
"[...] [W]e simply kept going until there was nothing left. This is, according to me, the biggest danger with this drug; one doesn't seem to realize or even notice when one has crossed the line, until it's too late." -- [Exp 76345](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=76345)
 
"A very nice substance for me overall. My elocution was remarkably enhanced, communicative centers were gaping wide, very comfortable and relaxed stimulation, empathy was significant (even though the 'magic' has long since departed my MDMA experiences). Comedown was not painful, just so swift it left a vacuum in its wake. I overindulged in MDMA when I was first introduced to it, and now I may as well have three caffeine drinks as take a pill. This substance feels (for me) like its effects could be similarly degraded with over-use. I'll be abstaining as much as my will permits. " -- [Exp 78080](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=78080)
 
"Compared to MDMA, similar euphoria (when bombed [swallowed]), far more hornyness, a bit less empathy, no psychadelia (although light tends to prism after several redoses, I think this is just a serotonin effect) - but what was amazing is that the next day, I felt brilliant, like I hadn't done anything the previous night. I would also compare it to speed and coke a little in its stimulating effects, which were far more than MDMA on its own. [...] The euphoria was absolutely crazy. I looked in the mirror, my eyes were saucers. I felt giddy from how amazing I felt. Stroking my arm was like having an orgasm. It was about as mindblowing as my first 'e'." -- [Exp 74276](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=74276)
 
"I feel very similar to my first ever ecstasy pill. Feel a little bit disappointed that I've peaked and am now contemplating trying a little line intranasaly. I say why they say this is like Cocaine. It is VERY moreish. [...] I believe Mephedrone has overtaken MDMA as my favorite drug. This is something that I never thought possible. The only noticable down side for me was the short duration of action and a binge seems VERY likely if I had a large supply so I'll have to keep the amount I have on me pretty low. The euphoria was amazing, the empathy was great ( I had an overwhelming urge to phone ALL of my friends to have a little chat) and the mild stimulation was perfect, not too much, not too little, just right, making me feel just as comfortable having a little dance in my room as I was sat at the computer listening to music." -- [Exp 77208](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=77208)
 
"The first dose was pleasurable, but overall I regret buying such a large quantity. If there was magic here, I certainly lost it over the course of a couple of days. Worryingly, it was much more acutely psychologically addicting than MDMA/MDMA adulterated with methamphetamine, Bk-MBDB and the various piperazine combinations I've had (though I will certainly place my satisfaction with this above that of those nasty pipes or of Bk-MBDB!). Hell, I felt more like doing this the next day than I felt like getting to my cocaine, and that's even after having a bad experience." -- [Exp 78758](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=78758)
 
"[M]ephedrone really disappointed me. The initial come-up rush led me on to thinking I had stumbled upon something very special - then it dropped off. [...] It seems that few reports from Erowid and afar have mentioned a lack of euphoria, so it just goes to show that chemicals affect people uniquely. [...] At no point was I compelled to take more mephedrone, despite its reputation of being moreish." -- [Exp 77309](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=77309)
 
"Mephedrone Is a nice drug, the euphoria I experienced was extremely pleasurable and from what I remember I had a great time. Mixing Mephedrone with alcohol was a very bad idea I experienced a great deal of memory loss and this is not something that usually happens to me and the nausea of today is unbearable." -- [Exp 76757](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=76757)

DOSAGE DESCRIPTION #
 
Caution : Dose information should not be taken as recommendations. [ see below ]
 
**4-Methylmethcathinone Dosages**
**Oral**
- Threshold: 15 - 50 mg
- Light: 50 - 100 mg
- Common: 100 - 200 mg
- Strong: 150 - 300+ mg
 
**4-Methylmethcathinone Dosages**
**Insufflated (Snorted)**
- Threshold: 5 - 15 mg
- Light: 15 - 25 mg
- Common: 20 - 80 mg
- Strong: 75 - 125 mg
 
4-Methylmethcathinone is a stimulant with empathogenic qualities that is a little less potent than MDMA by mass. As of 2009, it is most often found as a powder, though some tablets have been pressed that include 4-methylmethcathinone.
 
NOTES #
 
Many reports of 4-methylmethcathinone use involve redosing ("boosting" / "bumping") multiple times. Users sometimes mix oral and insufflated, taking some 4-methylmethcathinone orally, then insufflating some, then taking more orally. Because of the common desire to recapture the pleasurable initial high, redoses are sometimes higher than the initial dose or are spaced closely together in time. Many users report having difficulty not redosing after using a strong dose if more 4-methylmethcathinone is available when they are starting to come down. Experience reports in which users find themselves unexpectedly consuming a gram or more of 4-methymethcathinone are common.
 
CAUTION & DISCLAIMER #
 
Every individual reacts differently to every chemical. 
 
 Erowid's dosage information is a summary of data gathered from users, research, and other resources. This information is intended to describe the range of dosages people report using. It should not be construed as a recommendation of any sort. Individuals can respond very differently to the same dosage. What is safe for one can be deadly for another.

4-Methylmethcathinone / Mephedrone
 
Health
 
by Erowid
 
DEATHS #
 
Several deaths in the U.K. and Europe have been attributed to the use of mephedrone. These include cases of mephedrone use alone as well as mephedrone combined with other substances.
 
WARNINGS #
 
- Vasoconstriction at High Doses. At least two reports have described what appears to be significant vasoconstriction (narrowing of arteries causing reduced blood flow) after repeated use of mephedrone over a six or more hour period with a cumulative dose of 600 mg in one case and 1.8 g in another. This vasoconstriction resulted in "bluing" of knees, legs, feet, arms, hands, lips, and face, a well as light-headedness. 2 
 
 One case has been reported in the medical literature of 3.8 grams of mephedrone being injected I.M. The individual suffered heart palpitations, "blurred tunnel vision", chest pressure, sweating, and sympathomimetic toxicity (heart rate of 105 bpm, bp of 177/111, dilated pupils of 7 mm). He was treated with 1 mg oral lorazepam and released from the hospital after 6 hours. Toxicology tests confirmed that the material was mephedrone. 3 It is possible that the treatment with lorazepam prevented more significant vasoconstriction in this case.
- Stimulant Combinations. Avoid other strong stimulants in combination with mephedrone, which can increase heart rate and blood pressure risks.
 
CAUTIONS #
 
- Heart/Health Conditions. Individuals with a history of heart ailments, high blood pressure, aneurism or stroke may be at higher risk.
- Frequent use. Many people have reported using more mephedrone than they intended. Often this takes the form of continuing to redose repeatedly after they had planned to stop.
- Hyponatremia. In the case of one death in Sweden, medical reports show that prior to death the woman was suffering from hyponatremia, an electrolyte or salt deficiency in the body which has also been associated with the use of MDMA/ecstasy. While there isn't enough evidence to make a formal tie between mephedrone and hyponatremia, eating a salty snack or sports drink can help reduce this potential risk.

**4-Methylmethcathinone** (also known as **4-MMC** , **M-CAT** , **drone** , **meow meow** , and **mephedrone** ) is a novel [entactogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) - [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cathinone) class. Mephedrone belongs to a group known as the [substituted cathinones](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinones) , which are derivatives of the active ingredient in the khat plant ( *Catha edulluis* ). It is thought to produce its effects by promoting the release of the [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) in the brain. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Mephedrone was first synthesized in 1929, but did not become widely known until it was rediscovered in 2003. In 2007 it was reported to be available for sale on the internet, by 2008 law enforcement agencies had become aware of the compound, and by 2010 it had been reported in most of Europe, becoming particularly prevalent in the United Kingdom. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) , [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [enhanced empathy and sociability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement) , [relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . It is reported to produce a mixture of classic [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) and [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) effects reminiscent of [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) and [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . It comes in the form of tablets or a powder, which users can swallow, snort, inject or insert rectally. It is also sometimes sold as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) ("molly").

Limited data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of mephedrone, and it has little history of human use. Preliminary evidence suggests it may possess neurotoxic and cardiotoxic properties. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

Mephedrone, or 4-methylmethcathinone, is a synthetic molecule of the [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinone) family. Cathinones are structurally similar to [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamines) , they contain a phenethylamine core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH2) group through an ethyl chain with an additional methyl substitution at R α . Amphetamines and cathinones are alpha-methylated phenethylamines, cathinones contain an additional carbonyl group at R 1 . Mephedrone contains an additional methyl substitutions at R N , similarly to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , and R 4 of its phenyl ring.

## Pharmacology

Given its chemical structure, mephedrone is likely to act as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) and a [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) for monoamine [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) such as [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [noradrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) .

Several articles published near the end of 2011 examined the effects of mephedrone in the brains of rats, as well as examining the reinforcing potential of mephedrone. [Dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) were collected using microdialysis, and increases in [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) were measured. Mephedrone administration caused about a 500% increase in [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , and about a 950% increase in [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) . They reached their peak concentrations at 40 minutes and 20 minutes and returned to baseline by 120 minutes after injection.

Analysis of the ratio for dopamine and serotonin indicated mephedrone was preferentially a [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [releaser](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) , with a ratio of 1.22:1 ( [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) vs. [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) ). Additionally, half-lives for the decrease in dopamine and serotonin were calculated and found to have decay rates of 24.5 minutes and 25.5 minutes.

These findings show mephedrone induces a massive increase in both [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , combined with rapid clearance. This increase in neurotransmitters provides an explanation for the euphoric and stimulating subjective effects induced by this experience. The rapid rise and subsequent fall of [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) levels could also explain some of the addictive properties of mephedrone display in some users.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the user's physical energy levels, mephedrone is commonly considered to be extremely stimulating and energetic. This encourages activities such as running, climbing and dancing in a way that makes mephedrone a popular choice for musical events such as festivals and raves. The particular style of stimulation which mephedrone presents can be described as forced. This means that at higher dosages it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still, as jaw clenching, involuntarily bodily shakes and vibrations become present, resulting in an extreme unsteadiness of the hands and a general lack of motor control.
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of mephedrone can be described as a moderate to extremely euphoric tingling sensation that encompasses the entire body. It is capable of becoming overwhelmingly pleasurable at higher dosages. This sensation maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)**
- **[Vibrating vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vibrating_vision)** - A person's eyeballs may begin to spontaneously wiggle back and forth in a rapid motion, causing vision to become blurry and temporarily out of focus-- a condition known as opsoclonus.
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** - Dry mouth and dehydration are a universal experience with mephedrone and are a product of an increased heart rate and extreme motivation to engage in strenuous physical activities. While it is important to avoid becoming dehydrated, especially when out dancing in a hot environment, there is a potential possibility of suffering from water intoxication through over-drinking so it is advised that users simply sip at water and never over drink.
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)** - Higher doses of mephedrone result in an overall difficulty when it comes to urination, an effect that is completely temporary and thought to be harmless.
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** - A survey conducted by the UK's National Addiction Centre reported that 15% of mephedrone users experienced cold or blue fingers and lips indicative of vasoconstriction occurring.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Body odor alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Body_odor_alteration)** - Mephedrone can potentially leave a very distinct and unpleasant odor within one's urine, sweat and general bodily secretions which is often described as smelling similar to cat urine.
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component can be considered to be less intense when compared with that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of mephedrone can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The general head space of mephedrone is described by many as one of extreme mental stimulation and powerful euphoria. It contains a large number of typical [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) cognitive effects. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - Strong emotional euphoria and feelings of happiness are present within mephedrone and are likely a direct result of serotonin and dopamine release.
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Empathy, love, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_love,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This particular effect, although distinct, is far less prominent than the same effect found within traditional [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B)
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - Strong feelings of time compression are common within mephedrone and speed up the experience of time quite noticeably.

- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

Almost nothing is known about the long-term effects of mephedrone due to its short history of its use. Along side of this, the exact toxic dosage is unknown.

In 2010, unconfirmed reports speculated about the role mephedrone has played in the deaths of several young people in the UK. By July 2010, mephedrone had been alleged to be involved in 52 fatalities in the UK, but detected in only 38 of these cases. Of the nine that coroners had finished investigating, two were caused directly by mephedrone. The first death reported to be caused by mephedrone use was that of 46-year-old who had underlying health problems and repeatedly injected the drug. A report in Forensic Science International in stated mephedrone intoxication has been recorded as the cause of death in two cases in Scotland.

Despite similarities to known neurotoxins such as [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) and other [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinone) derivatives, mephedrone does not appear to produce neurotoxic effects in the dopamine system of mice.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , the chronic use of mephedrone can be considered highly addictive with an extreme potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of mephedrone develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Mephedrone presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of mephedrone all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with Mephedrone should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , mephedrone , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Mephedrone may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - The neurotoxic effects of MDMA may be increased when combined with other stimulants.
- **[Cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine)** - This combination may increase strain on the heart.

#### Serotonin syndrome risk

Combinations with the following substances can cause dangerously high [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) levels. [Serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) requires immediate medical attention and can be fatal if left untreated.

- **MAOIs** - Such as [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , phenelzine, selegiline, and moclobemide.
- **Serotonin releasers** - Such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) , [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) and [αMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91MT) .
- **SSRIs** - Such as citalopram and sertraline
- **[SNRIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNRIs)** - Such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) and venlafaxine
- **5-HTP**

## Effects
The effect is similar to that of methcathinone, cocaine and MDMA. Mephedrone causes euphoria and stimulation, increased urge to talk, increased performance and altered sensory perceptions. The need for food and sleep is suppressed.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Various adverse effects may occur when consuming mephedrone: Dry mouth, mydriasis (dilated pupils), jaw grinding, increased heartbeat, increase in body temperature, anxiety or paranoia. There is a risk of dehydration due to decreased thirst and lack of fluid intake. High doses of mephedrone lead to psychotic reactions and can increase schizophrenia. There is a risk of dependence with symptoms such as restlessness, tremors, insomnia and hyperactivity.
Mephedrone is a research chemical. To date, nothing is known about the exact mechanisms of action, toxicity and possible long-term effects. The current state of knowledge is based almost exclusively on reports from users. Due to the strong craving (irresistible and uncontrollable desire to consume), especially when consumed nasally/smoked, there is a danger that one will take more too quickly and the side effects will predominate.

## Safer Use
- There is very little knowledge about legal highs, research chemicals, etc. When you use them, you are exposing yourself to unknown risks. Have the substance analysed in a drug check. If this is not possible and you still want to use the substance, try small amounts to reach the desired dose.
- Do not buy a product with a fancy name without a declaration of the ingredient. Legal does not mean harmless.
- During consumption, inform your friends about what and how much you have consumed.
- Drink enough non-alcoholic beverages and get some fresh air in between.
- Accept it when the effect runs out, don't add to it right away.
- Refrain from mixed consumption, as interactions are dangerous and unexplored.
- Take regular breaks from consumption.
- People with high blood pressure, heart problems, hyperthyroidism, liver and kidney disease or circulatory problems should not take Research Chemicals.

  "thedrugclassroom": `# 4-MMC (Mephedrone)
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/4-mmc-mephedrone/*

4-MMC is a stimulant, euphoriant, and to a lesser extent, an entactogen. While it was synthesized decades ago, the drug only has a short history of use. It’s a substituted amphetamine and it comes from the cathinone family.

The stimulation it provides lends itself to physical activities like dancing. Since it’s usually described as “forced,” the stimulation can be uncomfortable.

Its euphoria and stimulation can surpass what is provided by MDMA, though MDMA has more pronounced entactogenic effects. 4-MMC is often redosed and unless subsequent doses are planned ahead of time, using more is not a good idea. Redosing without carefully considering your dose can result in dangerous levels of 4-MMC being administered and it can also increase the drug’s negative after effects.

Vasoconstriction is an established issue with the substance and it can be dangerous with strong doses, which are sometimes encountered due to redosing. Neurotoxicity also appears to be a concern with higher doses and its neurotoxicity may be additive with MDMA and methamphetamine’s.

**Mephedrone** (4-Methylmethcathinone, 4-MMC, and also known by slang terms such as 'meow' and 'M-CAT') is a synthetic stimulant with empathogenic effects. A research chemical first developed as an analogue of MDMA in 1929, it eventually became popular among recreational drug users between 2007 and 2009 as it became available for purchase online. As a result, it was used increasingly in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, associated with several deaths, and as a result was controlled in some countries.

Because of the similarity in names, it is sometimes confused with [Methedrone](/index.php?title=Methedrone&action=edit&redlink=1) (4-Methoxymethcathinone, βk-PMMC) or [Methylone](/index.php?title=Methylone&action=edit&redlink=1) (βk-MDMA).

## Effects

Generally described as being more intense of a stimulant than MDMA, providing greater euphoria, but with somewhat less of an empathogenic feel and a shorter length to the 'rush.'

It is often reported as very 'fiendish,' with the tendency to cause users to redose repeatedly throughout the experience.

### Postive

- Mental and physical stimulation

- Euphoria, mood lift

- Feelings of empathy, openness

- Increase in sociability, desire to talk with others

- Pleasurable rushing

### Neutral

- General change in consciousness (as with most psychoactives)

- Decreased appetite

- Pupil dilation

- Unusual body sensations (facial flushing, chills, goosebumps, body energy)

- Change in body temperature regulation

- Sweating

- Increase in heart rate and blood pressure

### Negative

Likelihood of negative side effects increases with higher doses

- Strong desire to redose, craving to recapture initial euphoric rush

- Uncomfortable changes in body temperature (sweating/chills)

- Heart palpitations, sense of racing heart

- Impaired short term memory

- Insomnia

- Tightened jaw muscles, grinding teeth (trismus and bruxia)

- Muscle twitching

- Nystagmus

- Dizziness, light headedness, vertigo

- Vasoconstriction

- When insufflated: pain and swelling in nose and throat, sinusitis

## Harm Reduction

- Taking Mephedrone while on SSRIs or MAOIs can cause serotonin syndrome, which can be deadly.

- The drug has not been proven as neurotoxic, however primary indications show that it may well be. As this is the case, care should be taken to space experiences with this drug out - two weeks has been regarded as a good rule of thumb.

- Given the tendency for users to redose, issues such as malnutrition and sleep deprivation may become a problem with extended use. Try to sleep, and see [Quick Guide to Stimulant Comedowns](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Quick_Guide_to_Stimulant_Comedowns) for more information on managing a comedown.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

Mephedrone is a releasing agent and reuptake inhibitor of dopamine, serotonin and  norepinephrine.

  "wikipedia": `# Mephedrone
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mephedrone*

Mephedrone, also known as 4-methylmethcathinone, 4-MMC, or 4-methylephedrone, is a synthetic stimulant drug belonging to the amphetamine and cathinone classes. It is commonly referred to by slang names such as drone, M-CAT, white magic, meow meow, and bubble. Chemically, it is similar to the cathinone compounds found in the khat plant, native to eastern Africa.
Mephedrone is typically found in tablet or crystal form, and users may swallow, snort, or inject it. Its effects are similar to those of MDMA, amphetamines, and cocaine, producing euphoria and increased sociability. Mephedrone is rapidly absorbed, with a half-life of about two hours, and is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 enzymes. Its effects are dose-dependent. Side effects can include cardiovascular changes and anxiety.
Mephedrone was first synthesised in 1929 but remained relatively obscure until it was rediscovered around 1999–2000. At that time, it was legal to produce and possess in many countries. By 2000, mephedrone was available for sale on the Internet. By 2008, law enforcement agencies had become aware of the substance, and by 2010, it had been reported in most European countries, with significant prevalence in the United Kingdom. Mephedrone was first made illegal in Israel in 2008, followed by Sweden later that year. By 2010, many European countries had banned the substance, and in December of that year, the European Union ruled it illegal. In Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, it is considered an analog of other illegal drugs and can be controlled under laws similar to the US Federal Analog Act. In September 2011, the US temporarily classified mephedrone as a Schedule I drug, with the classification taking effect in October 2011. This was made permanent in July 2012 with the passage of the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act (SDAPA).

## Uses

### Recreational

Users have reported that mephedrone causes euphoria, stimulation, an enhanced appreciation for music, an elevated mood, decreased hostility, improved mental function and mild sexual stimulation; these effects are similar to the effects of cocaine, amphetamines and MDMA, and last different lengths of time depending on the way the drug is taken. Of 70 Dutch users of mephedrone, 58 described it as an overall pleasant experience and 12 described it as an unpleasant experience. In a survey of UK users who had previously taken cocaine, most users found it produced a better-quality and longer-lasting high and was less addictive. The users were also asked to compare the "risk", and they answered that it was equal. A study of users in Northern Ireland found they did not equate the fact that mephedrone was legal with it being safe to use. This was contrary to another study in New Zealand, where users of benzylpiperazine thought that because it was legal, it was safe.

### Available forms

Mephedrone can come in the form of capsules, tablets or white powder that users may swallow, insufflate, inject, smoke or use rectally. When taken orally, users reported they could feel the effects within 15–45 minutes; when snorted, the effects were felt within minutes and peaked within half an hour. The effects last for between two and three hours when taken orally or nasally, but only half an hour if taken intravenously. It is sometimes sold mixed with methylone in a product called bubbles in the UK and also mixed with other cathinones, including ethcathinone, butylone, fluoromethcathinone and methedrone.

#### Purity

One published study that analysed samples of mephedrone bought using the internet in the UK in 2010 found it was racemic (a mixture of both stereoisomers) and of high purity. An unpublished study of six samples also ordered off the internet in the UK in 2010 found they contained very few organic impurities. Four products sold in Irish head shops were tested in 2010 and were found to contain between 82% and 14% mephedrone, with some products containing benzocaine and caffeine.

## Adverse effects

### Short-term effects

The EMCDDA reported mephedrone can cause various unintended side effects including dilated pupils, poor concentration, teeth grinding, problems focusing visually, poor short-term memory, hallucinations, delusions, and erratic behaviour. They noted the most severe effects appear anecdotally to be linked with high doses or prolonged use, and the effects may be due to users taking other intoxicants at the same time. Other effects users in internet forums have noted include changes in body temperature, increased heart rate, breathing difficulties, loss of appetite, increased sweating, discolouration of extremities, anxiety, paranoia and depression. When snorted, it can also cause nose bleeds and nose burns. A survey conducted by the UK National Addiction Centre found 67% of mephedrone users experienced sweating, 51% suffered from headaches, 43% from heart palpitations, 27% from nausea and 15% from cold or blue fingers, indicative of vasoconstriction occurring. Doctors at Guy's Hospital in London reported that of 15 patients they treated after taking mephedrone in 2009, 53% were agitated, 40% had increased heart rates, 20% had systolic hypertension and 20% had seizures; three required treatment with benzodiazepines, predominantly to control their agitation. They reported none of their patients suffered from cold or blue peripheries, contrary to other reports. Nine of the 15 of patients had a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 15, indicating they were in a normal mental state, four had a GCS below 8, but these patients all reported using a central nervous system depressant, most commonly GHB, with mephedrone. The patients also reported polydrug use of a variety of compounds.

### Neurotoxicity

Mephedrone has been found to be a monoaminergic neurotoxin in animals and induces serotonergic neurotoxicity. Although some studies in animal models reported no damage to dopamine nerve endings in the striatum and no significant changes in brain monoamine levels, some others suggested a rapid reduction in serotonin transporter (SERT) and dopamine transporter (DAT) function. Persistent serotonergic deficits were observed after binge like treatment in a warm environment and in both serotonergic and dopaminergic nerve endings at high ambient temperature. Oxidative stress cytotoxicity and an increase in frontal cortex lipid peroxidation were also reported. Although mephedrone has been found to be a monoaminergic neurotoxin, in one study, moderate doses of MDMA produced serotonergic neurotoxicity in rodents whereas mephedrone and methylone did not do so, suggesting that cathinones like mephedrone may be less neurotoxic than their corresponding amphetamine counterparts like MDMA.

### Reinforcement disorders

There have been reports of users craving mephedrone, suggesting it may be addictive.

## Overdose

### Toxicity

In 2009, one case of sympathomimetic toxicity was reported in the UK after a person took 0.2 g of mephedrone orally, and after this did not achieve the desired effect, intramuscularly injected 3.8 g mixed with water into his thighs. Shortly afterwards, the user "developed palpitations, blurred tunnel vision, chest pressure and sweating". The patient was treated with 1 mg of lorazepam and the sympathomimetic features decreased and the user was discharged within six hours of arrival. One case of serotonin syndrome has been reported, where the patient was already prescribed fluoxetine and olanzapine, and then took 40 tablets containing mephedrone in one night. He was treated with lorazepam and discharged 15 hours after admission. Both enantiomers of methcathinone, which differs only in the lack of the methyl group on the phenyl ring when compared to mephedrone, have been shown to be toxic to rat dopamine neurons, and the S-enantiomer was also toxic against serotonin neurons. Simon Gibbons and Mire Zloh of the School of Pharmacy, University of London stated, based on the chemical similarities between methcathinone and mephedrone, "it is highly likely that mephedrone will display neurotoxicity". However, Brunt and colleagues stated, "extreme caution" should be used when inferring the toxicity of mephedrone from methcathinone, noting some of the toxicity associated with methcathinone is due to manganese impurities related to its synthesis, rather than the compound itself. They concluded more experimental research is needed to investigate the toxicity of mephedrone.
Doctors who treated a 15-year-old female suffering from mephedrone intoxication suggested in The Lancet that, like MDMA, mephedrone may promote serotonin-mediated release of antidiuretic hormone, resulting in hyponatraemia and an altered mental state. In another case, a 19-year-old male was admitted to hospital suffering from inflammation of the heart, 20 hours after taking one gram of mephedrone. The doctors treating the patient stated it was caused by either a direct toxic effect of mephedrone on the heart muscle, or by an immune response. One case of acquired methaemoglobinaemia, where a patient had "bluish lips and fingers", has also been reported, after the user snorted one gram of mephedrone. The patient started to recover after arriving at the hospital and it was not necessary to administer any medication.

### Deaths

#### Sweden

In 2008, an 18-year-old Swedish woman died in Stockholm after taking mephedrone. The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reported the woman went into convulsions and turned blue in the face. Doctors reported she was comatose and suffering from hyponatremia and severe hypokalemia; the woman died one and a half days after the onset of symptoms. An autopsy showed severe brain swelling. Mephedrone was scheduled to be classified as a "dangerous substance" in Sweden even before the woman's death at Karolinska University Hospital on 14 December, but the death brought more media attention to the drug. The possession of mephedrone became classified as a criminal offence in Sweden on 15 December 2008.

#### United Kingdom

In 2010, unconfirmed reports speculated about the role mephedrone has played in the deaths of several young people in the UK. By July 2010, mephedrone had been alleged to be involved in 52 fatalities in the UK, but detected in only 38 of these cases. Of the nine that coroners had finished investigating, two were caused directly by mephedrone. The first death reported to be caused by mephedrone use was that of 46-year-old John Sterling Smith, who had underlying health problems and repeatedly injected the drug. A report in Forensic Science International in August 2010 stated mephedrone intoxication has been recorded as the cause of death in two cases in Scotland. Post-mortem samples showed the concentration of mephedrone in the blood was 22 mg/L in one case and 3.3 mg/L in the other. The death of a teenager in the UK in November 2009 was widely reported as being caused by mephedrone, but a report by the coroner concluded she had died from natural causes. In March 2010, the deaths of two teenagers in Scunthorpe were widely reported by the media to be caused by mephedrone. Toxicology reports showed the teenagers had not taken any mephedrone and had died as a result of consuming alcohol and methadone, a synthetic opioid. According to Fiona Measham, a criminologist who is a member of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, the reporting of the unconfirmed deaths by newspapers followed "the usual cycle of 'exaggeration, distortion, inaccuracy and sensationalism'" associated with the reporting of recreational drug use.

#### United States

Mephedrone has been implicated in the death of a 22-year-old man, who had also injected black tar heroin. Mephedrone was found in his blood at a concentration of 0.50 mg/L and in his urine at a concentration of 198 mg/L. The blood concentration of morphine, a metabolite of heroin, was 0.06 mg/L. For comparison, the average blood morphine concentration resulting from deadly overdoses involving only heroin is around 0.34 mg/L.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Mephedrone acts as a potent substrate for monoamine transporters, including the dopamine transporter (DAT), serotonin transporter (SERT), and norepinephrine transporter (NET). It inhibits the reuptake of these neurotransmitters and promotes their release. The drug induces a rapid and significant increase in extracellular levels of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. This effect is more pronounced for serotonin compared to dopamine, which distinguishes mephedrone from much of the other psychostimulants. The pharmacodynamic profile of mephedrone is often compared to MDMA and methamphetamine. Like MDMA, it has a greater effect on serotonin than dopamine release. Similar to methamphetamine, it causes rapid dopamine release. Mephedrone has been found to be a full releaser of serotonin but a partial releaser of dopamine.
In addition to induction of monoamine release via the monoamine transporters, mephedrone shows significant affinity for various receptors, including the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, and α2-adrenergic receptors, as well as the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1). Mephedrone is a potent and near-full agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, whereas it was inactive as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor. Mephedrone binds to and activates the rat and mouse TAAR1 with micromolar potencies, but is not an agonist of the human TAAR1 (EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration > 30 μM).
Mephedrone administration leads to increased extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, elevated serotonin levels in the frontal cortex, and alterations in brain temperature. These pharmacodynamic actions translate into various behavioral effects, including increased locomotor activity, rewarding effects (as measured by conditioned place preference), and potential for drug discrimination (similar to cocaine and MDMA).

### Pharmacokinetics

Mephedrone is rapidly absorbed and eliminated in humans. After oral or intranasal administration, peak plasma concentrations are typically reached within 0.5 to 1 hour. The drug crosses the blood-brain barrier easily, with a brain-to-plasma ratio of approximately 1.85 in rats. It has a relatively short half-life of approximately 2 hours in plasma and whole blood. The drug and its metabolites can be detected in whole blood and plasma for up to 6 hours post-administration, with some metabolites persisting longer.
Mephedrone exhibits enantioselective pharmacokinetics. The R-(+) enantiomer shows higher peak concentrations and a longer half-life compared to the S-(-) enantiomer. The absolute bioavailability of mephedrone is relatively low, at about 10% in rats, suggesting a significant first-pass effect. The percentage of mephedrone bound to plasma proteins is approximately 22%.
These pharmacokinetic properties contribute to mephedrone's rapid onset of action, short duration of effects, and the tendency for users to engage in repeated dosing to maintain the desired effects.

#### Metabolism

Mephedrone undergoes extensive metabolism, primarily through the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme.
The main phase I metabolic pathways include N-demethylation, reduction of the ketone moiety, and oxidation of the tolyl group. Key metabolites identified in human plasma and urine include nor-mephedrone, dihydro-mephedrone, hydroxytolyl-mephedrone, and 4-carboxy-mephedrone, with 4-carboxy-mephedrone being the most abundant.
Based on the analysis of rat and human urine by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, mephedrone is thought to be metabolised by three phase 1 pathways. It can be demethylated to the primary amine (producing compounds 2, 3 and 5), the ketone group can be reduced (producing 3), or the tolyl group can be oxidised (producing 6). Both 5 and 6 are thought to be further metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide and sulfate derivatives. Knowledge of the primary routes of metabolism should allow the intake of mephedrone to be confirmed by drug tests, as well as more accurate determination of the causes of side effects and potential for toxicity.

## Chemistry

### Appearance and odour

Mephedrone is a white substance. It is sold most commonly as crystals or a powder, but also in the form of capsules or pills. It can have a distinctive odour, reported to range the smell of vanilla and bleach, stale urine, or electric circuit boards. Synthesis byproducts or other contaminants are likely responsible for this, as the molecule itself is not an odorant.

### Synthesis

Mephedrone can be synthesised in several ways. The simplest method, due to the availability of the compounds, is to add 4-methylpropiophenone dissolved in glacial acetic acid to bromine, creating an oil fraction of 4'-methyl-2-bromopropiophenone. The oil fraction can then be dissolved in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and drops of the solution added to another solution of CH2Cl2-containing methylamine hydrochloride and triethylamine. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is then added and the aqueous layer is removed and turned alkaline using sodium hydroxide before the amine is extracted using CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 is then evaporated using a vacuum, creating an oil which is then dissolved in a nonaqueous ether. Finally, HCl gas is bubbled through the mixture to produce 4-methylmethcathinone hydrochloride. This method produces a mixture of both enantiomers and requires similar knowledge to that required to synthesise amphetamines and MDMA.

It can also be produced by oxidising the ephedrine analogue 4-methylephedrine using potassium permanganate dissolved in sulfuric acid. Because 4-methylephedrine can be obtained in a specific enantiomeric form, mephedrone consisting of only one enantiomer can be produced. The danger associated with this method is it may cause manganese poisoning if the product is not correctly purified.

### Analysis

Mephedrone does not react with most reagent testing kits. The exception is the Liebermann reagent, which gives a bright yellow reaction.

### Detection in body fluids

Mephedrone may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalised patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma mephedrone concentrations are expected to be in a range of 50–100 μg/L in persons using the drug recreationally, >100 μg/L in intoxicated patients and >500 μg/L in victims of acute overdosage.

## History

Mephedrone is one of hundreds of designer drugs or legal highs that have been reported in recent years, including artificial chemicals such as synthetic cannabis and semisynthetic substances such as methylhexanamine. These drugs are primarily developed to avoid being controlled by laws against illegal drugs, thus giving them the label of designer drugs. According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, the synthesis of mephedrone was first reported in 1929 by Saem de Burnaga Sanchez in the Bulletin de la Société Chimique de France, under the name "toluyl-alpha-monomethylaminoethylcetone", but the compound remained an obscure product of academia until 2003, when it was "re-discovered" and publicised by an underground chemist on The Hive website, registered to a Portuguese IP working under the pseudonym "Kinetic". Kinetic posted on the site, "I've been bored over the last couple of days and had a few fun reagents lying around, so I thought I'd try and make some 1-(4-methylphenyl)-2-methylaminopropanone hydrochloride, or 4-methylmethcathinone." before going on to describe that after consuming it, the user had a "fantastic sense of well-being that I haven't got from any drug before except my beloved Ecstasy." After the initial description of mephedrone's qualitative effects by Kinetic, the drug was commercially introduced in Israel by a mathematician named Ezekiel Golan or "Dr. Z".
A drug similar to mephedrone, containing cathinone, was sold legally in Israel from around 2004, under the name hagigat. When this was made illegal, the cathinone was modified and the new products were sold by the Israeli company, Neorganics. The products had names such as Neodoves pills, but the range was discontinued in January 2008 after the Israeli government made mephedrone illegal. The Psychonaut Research Project, an EU organisation that searches the internet for information regarding new drugs, first identified mephedrone in 2008. Their research suggested the drug first became available to purchase on the internet in 2007, made available through British contacts, contact unknown, when it was also discussed on internet forums. Mephedrone was first seized in France in May 2007, after police sent a tablet they assumed to be ecstasy to be analysed, with the discovery published in a paper titled "Is 4-methylephedrone, an "Ecstasy" of the twenty-first century?" Mephedrone was reported as having been sold as ecstasy in the Australian city of Cairns, along with ethylcathinone, in 2008. An annual survey of regular ecstasy users in Australia in 2010 found 21% of those surveyed had used mephedrone, with 17% having done so in the previous six months. The price they paid per gram varied from A\$16 to \$320.
Europol noted they became aware of it in 2008, after it was found in Denmark, Finland and the UK. The Drug Enforcement Administration noted it was present in the United States in July 2009. By May 2010, mephedrone had been detected in all 22 EU member states that reported to Europol, as well as in Croatia and Norway. The Daily Telegraph reported in April 2009 that it was manufactured in China, but it has since been made illegal there. In March 2009, Druglink magazine reported it only cost a "couple of hundred pounds" to synthesise a kilogram of mephedrone, the same month, The Daily Telegraph reported manufacturers were making "huge amounts of money" from selling it. In January 2010, Druglink magazine reported dealers in Britain spent £2,500 to ship one kilogram from China, but could sell it for £10 a gram, making a profit of £7,500. A later report, in March 2010, stated the wholesale price of mephedrone was £4000 per kilogram.
In March 2011, the International Narcotics Control Board published a report about designer drugs, noting mephedrone was by then being used recreationally in Europe, North America, Southeast Asia, New Zealand and Australia.

### United Kingdom

Between the summer of 2009 and March 2010, the use of mephedrone grew rapidly in the UK, with it becoming readily available at music festivals, head shops and on the internet. A survey of Mixmag readers in 2009, found it was the fourth most popular street drug in the United Kingdom, behind cannabis, cocaine, and ecstasy. The drug was used by a diverse range of social groups. Whilst the evidence was anecdotal, researchers, charity workers, teachers and users reported widespread and increasing use of the drug in 2009. The drug's rapid growth in popularity was believed to be related to both its availability and legality.
In a book about drugs David Nutt reports the re-popularization story of mephedrone in a way that can be cross referenced with a report by Chemistry World in an article.
Fiona Measham, a criminologist at the University of Lancaster, thought the emergence of mephedrone was also related to the decreasing purity of ecstasy and cocaine on sale in the UK, a view reinforced in a report by the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse. The average cocaine purity fell from 60% in 1999 to 22% in 2009 and about half of ecstasy pills seized in 2009 contained no MDMA, and by June 2010 almost all ecstasy pills seized in the UK contained no MDMA. A similar pattern was observed in the Netherlands, with the number of ecstasy tablets containing no MDMA rising from 10% in mid-2008 to 60% by mid-2009, with mephedrone being detected in 20% of ecstasy tablets by mid-2009. The decrease of MDMA was thought to be partly due to the seizure of 33 tonnes of sassafras oil, the precursor to MDMA, in Cambodia in June 2008, which could have been used to make 245 million doses of MDMA. According to John Ramsey, a toxicologist at St George's, University of London, the emergence of mephedrone was also related to the UK government banning the benzylpiperazine class of drugs in December 2009. gamma-Butyrolactone (GBL), another previously "legal high", was also banned in August 2009 despite concerns it would be replaced by other drugs.
By December 2009 mephedrone was available on at least 31 websites based in the UK and by March 2010 there were at least 78 online shops, half of which sold amounts of less than 200 grams and half that also sold bulk quantities. The price per gram varied from £9.50 to £14. Between July 2009 and February 2010, UK health professionals accessed the National Poisons Information Service's (NPIS) entry on mephedrone 1664 times and made 157 telephone inquiries; the requests increased month on month over this period. In comparison, over a similar time period, the entries for cocaine and MDMA were accessed approximately 2400 times. After mephedrone was made illegal the number of inquiries to the NPIS fell substantially, to only 19 in June 2010.
Media organisations including the BBC and The Guardian incorrectly reported mephedrone was commonly used as a plant fertiliser. In fact sellers of the drug described it as "plant food" because it was illegal to sell the compound for human consumption. In late 2009 UK newspapers began referring to the drug as meow or miaow (sometimes doubled as meow meow or miaow miaow), a name that was almost unknown on the street at the time. In November 2009, the tabloid newspaper, The Sun published a story stating that a man had ripped off his own scrotum whilst using mephedrone. The story was later shown to be an online joke posted on mephedrone.com, later included in a police report with the caveat that it could be unreliable. The police report was used as a source for the story in The Sun. Other myths the media often repeated during 2010 were that mephedrone had led to the deaths of over 20 people, teachers were unable to confiscate the drug from pupils and the government was too slow to ban the drug. Parallels were drawn between the media coverage of mephedrone and a piece of satire by Chris Morris in 1997 on Brass Eye when he tricked public figures into talking of the dangers of taking the fictional legal drug "cake". The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) have suggested that the media coverage of the drug led to its increased usage. Jon Silverman, a former BBC Home Affairs Correspondent, has written two articles discussing how the media had a strong influence over the UK government's drugs policy, particularly in that the government wished to demonstrate they were being "tough" on drugs.
A survey of 1000 secondary school pupils and university students in Tayside conducted in February 2010 found 20% of them had previously taken mephedrone. Although at the time it was available legally over the internet, only 10% of users reported purchasing it online, with most purchasing it from street dealers. Of those who had used mephedrone, 97% said it was easy or very easy to obtain. Around 50% of users reported at least one negative effect associated with the use of mephedrone, of which teeth grinding is the most common. Detailed interviews with users in Northern Ireland similarly found that few purchased mephedrone online, with most interviewees citing concerns that their address would be traced or that family members could intercept the package.
On 30 March 2010, Alan Johnson, the then Home Secretary, announced mephedrone would be made illegal "within weeks" after the ACMD sent him a report on the use of cathinones. The legislation would make all cathinones illegal, which Johnson said would "stop unscrupulous manufacturers and others peddling different but similarly harmful drugs". The ACMD had run into problems with the UK Government in 2009 regarding drugs policy, after the government did not follow the advice of the ACMD to reclassify ecstasy and cannabis, culminating in the dismissal of the ACMD chairman, David Nutt, after he reiterated the ACMD's findings in an academic lecture. Several members resigned after he was sacked, and prior to the announcement that mephedrone was to be banned, the trend continued when Dr Polly Taylor resigned, saying she "did not have trust" in the way the government would use the advice given by the ACMD. Eric Carlin, a member of the ACMD and former chairman of the English Drug Education Forum, also resigned after the announcement. He said the decision by the Home Secretary was "unduly based on media and political pressure" and there was "little or no discussion about how our recommendation to classify this drug would be likely to impact on young people's behaviour." Some former members of the ACMD and various charity groups expressed concern over the banning of the drug, arguing it would inevitably criminalise users, particularly young people. Others expressed concern that the drug would be left in the hands of black market dealers, who will only compound the problem. Carlin's resignation was specifically linked to the criminalisation of mephedrone; he stated: "We need to review our entire approach to drugs, dumping the idea that legally-sanctioned punishments for drug users should constitute a main part of the armoury in helping to solve our country's drug problems. We need to stop harming people who need help and support".
The parliamentary debate was held on 8 April, one day after the 2010 general election had been announced, meaning it was during the so-called "wash-up period" when legislation is passed with little scrutiny. Only one hour was spent debating the ban and all three parties agreed, meaning no vote was required. In an interview conducted in July 2010, when he was no longer a minister, Johnson admitted the decision to ban mephedrone was sped up after widespread reporting of deaths caused by the drug, and because the government wished to pass the law before parliament was dissolved prior to the upcoming general election. In January 2011, however, Johnson told the Scunthorpe Telegraph that the decision was based only on information from the ACMD. An editorial in the April 2010 edition of The Lancet questioned the decision to ban mephedrone, saying the ACMD did not have enough evidence to judge the potential harms caused by mephedrone and arguing that policy makers should have sought to understand why young people took it and how they could be influenced to not take it. Evan Harris, then the Liberal Democrat science spokesman, stated the ACMD "was not 'legally constituted'" as required by the Misuse of Drugs Act, when the report on cathinones was published, since after Taylor resigned, it lacked a veterinary surgeon. In the rush to make mephedrone illegal, the act that was passed specified the inactive enantiomer of mephedrone, leaving the active form legal until the loophole was closed in February 2011 by another act of parliament. In Chemistry World, John Mann, professor of chemistry at Queen's University Belfast, suggested the UK create a law similar to the Federal Analog Act of the United States, which would have made mephedrone illegal as an analog of cathinone. In August 2010, James Brokenshire, the Home Office drugs minister, announced plans to create a new category in the Misuse of Drugs Act, through the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill, that would allow new legal highs to be made temporarily illegal, without the need for a vote in parliament or advice from the ACMD, as was required to categorise mephedrone.
According to the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs, after mephedrone was made illegal, a street trade in the drug emerged, with prices around double those prior to the ban, at £20–£25 per gram. In September 2010, Druglink reported the ban had a mixed effect on mephedrone use, with it decreasing in some areas, remaining similar in others and becoming more prevalent in some areas. In an online survey of 150 users after the ban, 63% said they were continuing to use mephedrone; of those, half claimed unchanged usage amounts (as to dosage and frequency) and half claimed decreased usage. Compared to previous surveys, more users purchased it from dealers, rather than the internet. The average price per gram was £16, compared to around £10 before the ban. The 2010 Mixmag survey of 2,500 nightclubbers found one quarter had used mephedrone in the previous month, the price had roughly doubled since it was made illegal, and it was more likely to be cut with other substances. Of those who had already used mephedrone prior to the ban, 75% had continued to use it after the ban. Of the various drugs used by the survey participants, users were more likely to have concerns about it. Interviews with users in Northern Ireland also found the price had roughly doubled since it was made illegal, to around £30 a gram. Rather than the price rising due to increased scarcity of the drug, it is thought to have risen for two other reasons. Firstly, dealers knew there was still demand for mephedrone, but were aware the supplies may be exhausted in the future. Secondly, the dealers perceived customers were likely to be willing to pay more for an illegal substance.
Professor Shiela Bird, a statistician at the Medical Research Council, suggested the ban of mephedrone may lead to more cocaine-related deaths. In the first six months of 2009, the number of cocaine-related deaths fell for the first time in four years, and fewer soldiers tested positive for cocaine in 2009 than in 2008. She suggested this may have been due to users switching to mephedrone from cocaine, but cautioned that before full figures are available for 2009 and 2010, it will be difficult to determine whether mephedrone saved lives, rather than cost them. Other supposedly legal drugs have filled the gap in the market since mephedrone was made illegal, including naphyrone (NRG-1) (since made illegal) and Ivory Wave, which has been found to contain MDPV, a compound made illegal at the same time as mephedrone. However, some products branded as Ivory Wave possibly do not contain MDPV. When tested, some products sold six weeks after mephedrone was banned, advertised as NRG-1, NRG-2 and MDAI, were found to be mephedrone. A Drugscope survey of drugs workers at the end of 2012 reported that mephedrone use was still widespread in the UK and that there increasing reports of problematic users. It was being taken as not only a "poor man's cocaine" but also amongst users of heroin and crack cocaine. Cases of intravenous use were also reported to be on the increase.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

When mephedrone was rediscovered in 2003, it was not specifically illegal to possess in any country. As its use has increased, many countries have passed legislation making its possession, sale and manufacture illegal. It was first made illegal in Israel, where it had been found in products such as Neodoves pills, in January 2008. After the death of a young woman in Sweden in December 2008 was linked to the use of mephedrone, it was classified as a hazardous substance a few days later, making it illegal to sell in Sweden. In June 2009, it was classified as a narcotic with the possession of 15 grams or more resulting in a minimum of two years in prison—a longer sentence, gram for gram than given for the possession of cocaine or heroin. In December 2008, Denmark also made it illegal and through the Medicines Act of Finland, it was made illegal to possess without a prescription. In November 2009, it was classified as a "narcotic or psychotropic" substance and added to the list of controlled substances in Estonia and made illegal to import into Guernsey along with other legal highs, before being classified as a Class B drug in April 2010. It was classified as a Class C drug in Jersey in December 2009.
In 2010, as its use became more prevalent, many countries passed legislation prohibiting mephedrone. It became illegal in Croatia and Germany in January, followed by Romania and the Isle of Man in February. In March 2010, it was classified as an unregulated medicine in the Netherlands, making the sale and distribution of it illegal. The importation of mephedrone into the UK was banned on 29 March 2010. The next day, the ACMD in the UK published a report on the cathinones, including mephedrone, and recommended they be classified as Class B drugs. On 7 April 2010, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) Order 2010 was passed by parliament, making mephedrone and other substituted cathinones, Class B drugs from 16 April 2010. Prior to the ban taking effect, mephedrone was not covered by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. It was, though, an offence under the Medicines Act to sell it for human consumption, so it was often sold as "plant food" or "bath salts", although it has no use as these products; this, too, was possibly illegal under the Trade Descriptions Act 1968. In the US, similar descriptions have been used to describe mephedrone, as well as methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV). In May 2010, the Republic of Ireland made mephedrone illegal, followed by Belgium, Italy, Lithuania, France and Norway in June and Russia in July. In August 2010, Austria and Poland made it illegal and China announced it would be illegal as of 1 September 2010. Mephedrone had been reported to be used in Singapore in February 2010, but it was made illegal in November 2010. In December 2010, following the advice of the EMCDDA, mephedrone was made illegal throughout the EU, a move Switzerland also made shortly afterwards. Countries which have not already banned it, such as the Netherlands, Greece and Portugal, will need to change legislation to comply with the EU ruling. In Hungary, a government advisory body recommended mephedrone should be made illegal in August 2010, which was followed, making it illegal in January 2011; Spain followed in February 2011. Mexico, by decree, outlawed mephedrone as a substance "with low or no therapeutical use which pose[s] a serious threat to public health" in 2014.
In some countries, mephedrone is not specifically listed as illegal, but is controlled under legislation that makes compounds illegal if they are analogs of drugs already listed. In Australia during 2010, it was not specifically listed as prohibited, but the Australian Federal Police stated it is an analogue to methcathinone and therefore illegal. It is now listed as a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities. In February 2010, 22 men were arrested in connection with importing mephedrone. By January 2011, every state in Australia, other than Victoria, had listed it as a controlled drug.

In New Zealand, it is not included in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975, but is illegal, as it is similar to controlled substances.
In Canada, mephedrone is not explicitly listed in any schedule of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, but "amphetamines, their salts, derivatives, isomers and analogues and salts of derivatives, isomers and analogues" are included in Section 19 of Schedule I of the act. Cathinone and methcathinone are listed in separate sections of Schedule III, while diethylpropion and pyrovalerone (also cathinones), are listed in separate sections of Schedule IV, each without language to capture analogues, isomers, etc. Mephedrone is considered a controlled substance by Health Canada. In a report by the Canadian Medical Association in 2010, one lawyer was quoted as suggesting that mephedrone was less popular in Canada than in the U.K. because "there's a provision in the substance act that says analogues of certain drugs and other similar drugs may be illegal too,"; on the other hand, the assistant director of the Centre for Addictions Research of British Columbia suggested there was a lack of "clear illegality". There have been several media reports of the Canadian police seizing mephedrone, but no reports of any successful prosecution of a Controlled Drugs and Substances Act offence implicating mephedrone.
Mephedrone is also currently scheduled in the United States as of 2011. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) states, as an analogue of methcathinone, possession of mephedrone can be controlled by the Federal Analog Act, but according to the Los Angeles Times, this only applies if it is sold for human consumption. Several cities and states, such as New York state, have passed legislation to specifically list mephedrone as illegal, but in most areas it remained legal, so long as it is not sold for human consumption, so retailers described it as 'bath salts'. In September 2011, The DEA began using its emergency scheduling authority to temporarily control mephedrone. Except as authorised by law, this action made possessing and selling mephedrone or the products that contain it illegal in the US for at least one year while the DEA and the United States Department of Health and Human Services conduct further study. Control of these compounds became permanent on 9 July 2012, via passage of the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012.

### Usage

A survey conducted in late 2009 by the National Addiction Centre (UK) found 41.3% of readers of Mixmag had used mephedrone in the last month, making it the fourth-most popular drug amongst clubbers. Of those, two-thirds snorted the drug and the average dosage per session was 0.9 g; the length of sessions increased as the dosage increased. Users who snorted the drug reported using more per session than those who took it orally (0.97 g compared to 0.74 g) and also reported using it more often (five days per month compared to three days per month). An Irish study of people on a methadone treatment program for heroin addicts found 29 of 209 patients tested positive for mephedrone usage.

### Harm assessment

Professor David Nutt, former chair of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) in the UK has said in 2009, "people are better off taking ecstasy or amphetamines than those [drugs] we know nothing about" and "Who knows what's in [mephedrone] when you buy it? We don't have a testing system. It could be very dangerous[;] we just don't know. These chemicals have never been put into animals, let alone humans." Les King, a former member of the ACMD, has stated mephedrone appears to be less potent than amphetamine and ecstasy, but that any benefit associated with this could be negated by users taking larger amounts. He also told the BBC, "all we can say is [mephedrone] is probably as harmful as ecstasy and amphetamines and wait until we have some better scientific evidence to support that."
