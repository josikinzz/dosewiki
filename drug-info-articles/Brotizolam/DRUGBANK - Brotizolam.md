## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as thienodiazepines. These are heteropolycyclic containing a thiophene ring fused to a diazepine ring. Thiophene is 5-membered ring consisting of four carbon and one sulfur atoms. Diazepine is a 7-membered ring consisting of five carbon and two nitrogen atoms.

### Background

Brotizolam is a sedative-hypnotic thienodiazepine drug which is a benzodiazepine analog. It demonstrates anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant effects. Brotizolam has similar effects to short-acting benzodiazepines such as triazolam. Brotizolam is indicated for 2-4 weeks of treatment for severe or debilitating insomnia. Brotizolam is an extremely potent drug and it is rapidly eliminated with an average half-life of 4.4 hours (range 3.6 - 7.9 hours).
Brotizolam is not approved for sale in the UK, United States or Canada but is sold in the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Austria, Portugal, Israel, Italy and Japan.

### Indication

Brotizolam is indicated for 2-4 weeks in the treatment of severe or debilitating insomnia.

### Mechanism of Action

GABA(A) Receptor
Positive allosteric modulator
GABA(A) Receptor Benzodiazepine Binding Site
Ligand

### Absorption

The plasma concentration profile of brotizolam can be described as a one compartmental open model with first-order absorption.

### Metabolism

There are two primary metabolites: 1-methyl-hydroxy- and the 4-hydroxy-derivatives (Eberts et al., 1981; Boehringer Ingelheim, product information). The 4-hydroxymetabolites have a pharmacological activity which is far less than that of the parent drugs, but the 1-methyl-hydroxymetabolites probably have comparable activity (Gall et al., 1978; Jochemsen et al., 1982; Sethy & Harris, 1982; Jochemsen et al., unpublished results). These active compounds are, however, not present in plasma in measurable amounts following a single dose of brotizolam to young healthy subjects (Jochemsen et al., 1982; Jochemsen et al., unpublished results).

### Half-life

4.4 hours.

### Curator comments

Benzodiazepines modulate GABA(A) function by binding at the interface between alpha (α) and gamma (γ) subunits. Of the 6 α-subunits, only 4 (α-1, -2, -3, and -5) participate in the formation of this binding site. The above target is a collection of all α- and γ-subunits that are known to participate in the formation of the benzodiazepine binding site.

### General Function

A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of sterols, steroid hormones, retinoids and fatty acids (PubMed:10681376, PubMed:11093772, PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317, PubMed:14559847, PubMed:15373842, PubMed:15764715, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20702771, PubMed:21490593, PubMed:21576599). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds (PubMed:12865317, PubMed:14559847, PubMed:15373842, PubMed:15764715, PubMed:21490593, PubMed:21576599, PubMed:2732228). Exhibits high catalytic activity for the formation of hydroxyestrogens from estrone (E1) and 17beta-estradiol (E2), namely 2-hydroxy E1 and E2, as well as D-ring hydroxylated E1 and E2 at the C-16 position (PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317, PubMed:14559847). Plays a role in the metabolism of androgens, particularly in oxidative deactivation of testosterone (PubMed:15373842, PubMed:15764715, PubMed:22773874, PubMed:2732228). Metabolizes testosterone to less biologically active 2beta- and 6beta-hydroxytestosterones (PubMed:15373842, PubMed:15764715, PubMed:2732228). Contributes to the formation of hydroxycholesterols (oxysterols), particularly A-ring hydroxylated cholesterol at the C-4beta position, and side chain hydroxylated cholesterol at the C-25 position, likely contributing to cholesterol degradation and bile acid biosynthesis (PubMed:21576599). Catalyzes bisallylic hydroxylation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (PubMed:9435160). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of PUFA with a preference for the last double bond (PubMed:19965576). Metabolizes endocannabinoid arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide) to 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid ethanolamides (EpETrE-EAs), potentially modulating endocannabinoid system signaling (PubMed:20702771). Plays a role in the metabolism of retinoids. Displays high catalytic activity for oxidation of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinal, a rate-limiting step for the biosynthesis of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) (PubMed:10681376). Further metabolizes atRA toward 4-hydroxyretinoate and may play a role in hepatic atRA clearance (PubMed:11093772). Responsible for oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics. Acts as a 2-exo-monooxygenase for plant lipid 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol) (PubMed:11159812). Metabolizes the majority of the administered drugs. Catalyzes sulfoxidation of the anthelmintics albendazole and fenbendazole (PubMed:10759686). Hydroxylates antimalarial drug quinine (PubMed:8968357). Acts as a 1,4-cineole 2-exo-monooxygenase (PubMed:11695850). Also involved in vitamin D catabolism and calcium homeostasis. Catalyzes the inactivation of the active hormone calcitriol (1-alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3)) (PubMed:29461981)
