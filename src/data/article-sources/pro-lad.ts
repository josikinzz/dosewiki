## SYNTHESIS

## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 135 μg, orally) âA strange development into a sort of paranoia place, without any reasonable dialog with my partner. A light-headed experience of a different kind, but we did not find common space. Not too comfortableâemotions are dull. At about mid-experience, considerable visuals came into play, with easy fantasy interlocking with music. BrÃ¼chnerâs âViola quintette in Aâ viola quintette in A produced extraordinary castle frames within castle walls. Emotions were reknit, food was good, and sleep fine at the 8th or 9th hour. It is not up to LSD (if that is your standard) because it is basically not like LSD.â

(with 175 μg, orally) âThis is an intellectually clear material, but it is a funny material. I am certainly at a +++ or at least I was a couple of hours ago. How does one describe PRO-LAD? Itâs not-quite-this and not-quite-that sort of stuff. Or, to borrow from Winnie-the-Pooh, âItâs not at the bottom, and itâs not at the top (but this is the stair where I always stop)ââoh, never mind. I mean, Iâm not sure how to categorize this material. Itâs pleasant, itâs fine for fooling around, itâs good for humor, even excellent. Itâs very good for clear thinking, although not cosmic-type particularly. Itâs a sort of nice, comfortable, middle-American, July-Fourth-Picnic, apple-pie with ice cream sort of psychedelic, the kind that you can wrap up in gold and white striped paper for your youngest aunt, the one who likes to think sheâs really a bit wild, you knowâthe kind of psychedelic thatâs a bit much for your Dad or Mom, but itâs just jazzy enough to keep some younger relatives happy with you for a few months. However, I must tell you, kid, if you try to bring this to the Big Town, wellâ¦ It is pretty much dropped off, now. Ah'm gonna lie mahself on down.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
N-Propynyl-nor-LSD (PARGY-LAD). Some activity at 160 μg. Active at 500 μg.

N-Butyl-nor-LSD (BU-LAD). Something at 500 μg.

N-Phenethyl-nor-LSD (PHENETH-LAD). Nothing at 500 μg.

As these substituents get heavier and heavier, the potency of the products drop by an order of magnitude or so, or even more. But here, in this N-substituted nor-LSD family, there is a fantastic research opportunity just waiting to be exploited, an exact parallel to the radio-iodine labeling of DOI as was described in PiHKAL. It is a good guess that this position is one of good metabolic stability. So what about putting on a small group that can be labeled with a reasonably long-lived positron isotope? A specific proposal: N-(2-fluoroethyl)-nor-LSD with an 18F radio-label. The compound should be makable rather quickly (nor-LSD and 18FCH2CH2I in DMF with potassium carbonate) and cleanly purified by centrifugal chromatography, all well within the almost two hour half-life considerations of radio-fluorine. Here is a group that would be (in theory) intrinsic to the central activity of the end product, N-(2-(18F)fluoroethyl)-nor-LSD. The end compound could be synthesized, purified, characterized and sterilized quickly, allowing its brain localization and central dynamics to be determined by PET scanning, with virtually no risk to the subject. Letâs call it FLUORETH-LAD.

**N-Propyl *nor* lysergic acid N,N-diethylamide** (also known as **6-Propyl-6- *nor* -lysergic acid diethylamide** , **N-Propyl *nor* LSD** or simply **PRO-LAD** ) is a novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) class. It is a structural analog of LSD and is part of a series of LSD analogs which includes [AL-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/AL-LAD) and [ETH-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/ETH-LAD) .

PRO-LAD was first investigated by Andrew J. Hoffman and David E. Nichols in 1984 as part of a series of LSD analogs. It was later described as an analog of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) in the book [TiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TiHKAL) ("Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved"), in which one report remarks that it is "good for humor, even excellent... very good for clear thinking, although not cosmic-type particularly." It has been sold on the online research chemical market alongside [lysergamides](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamides) like [1P-LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1P-LSD) and [AL-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/AL-LAD) as a legal, grey-market alternative to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) .

Subjective effects are similar to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and include [open and closed-eye visuals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) , [time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion) , [enhanced introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) , [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . It has been reported to be around as potent as LSD itself with an active dose reported at between 100 and 200 micrograms.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of PRO-LAD, and it has little history of human usage. It is highly advised use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

PRO-LAD, or 6-propyl-6-nor-lysergic acid diethylamide, is a semisynthetic alkaloid of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) family. PRO-LAD is a chiral compound with two stereocenters at R 5 and R 8 . PRO-LAD, also called (+)-D-PRO-LAD, has an absolute configuration of (5R, 8R). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] It is a structural analog of lysergic acid, with an N,N-diethylamide functional group bound to R N of the chemical structure. This core polycyclic structure is an ergoline derivative, and has overlapping [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) and [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) groups embedded within it (although it is principally classed as a tryptamine). It differs from [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) by the addition of two carbons to the methyl group at R 6 of the structure to form a propyl chain. PRO-LAD is also homologous to [ETH-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/ETH-LAD) , which contains an ethyl substitution at R 6 instead of a propyl chain.

PRO-LAD's structure contains a bicyclic hexahydroindole fused to a bicyclic quinoline group (nor-lysergic acid). Unlike LSD, PRO-LAD does not contain a methyl group substituted at R 6 of its nor-lysergic acid skeleton, this is represented by the *nor* - prefix. Instead, PRO-LAD is substituted at R 6 with a propyl group. At carbon 8 of the quinoline a N,N-diethyl carboxamide is bound. At carbon 8 of the quinoline a N,N-diethyl carboxamide is bound. PRO-LAD is a derivative of LSD, differing by the addition of two carbons to the methyl group at R6 of the structure to form a propyl chain.

PRO-LAD is also homologous to ETH-LAD, which contains an ethyl substitution at R6 instead of a propyl chain. PRO-LAD is a chiral compound with two stereocenters at R5 and R8. It is also sometimes called (+)-D-PRO-LAD, as an absolute configuration of (5R, 8R).

## Pharmacology

PRO-LAD likely acts as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . The [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from PRO-LAD's efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptors. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain an object of scientific elucidation.

As a derivative of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of PRO-LAD are similar to those of LSD. However, they are not exactly the same. The addition of two carbons to the methyl group at R6, and the resulting propyl chain may lead to PRO-LAD being absorbed at a slower rate and therefore a differing initial onset and a peak effect. This could be the reason for the higher threshold and common dosages.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of PRO-LAD can be characterized as prominent in comparison to its accompanying visual and cognitive effects. Like LSD, it can behave as a fast-moving, sharp and location specific or generalized tingling sensation, although this feeling is not necessarily pleasant and often manifests in a neutral way. For some, it is manifested spontaneously at different, unpredictable points throughout the trip, but for most, it maintains a steady presence that rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached, which many users have reported as feeling "artificial" or "mechanical." 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - This component can occur with the development of spontaneous bodily sensations, but is not as consistent as it is with [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) .
- **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)**
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)** - This is generally mild in comparison to traditional [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) .
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)** or **[Frequent urination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frequent_urination)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** 
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Muscle cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_cramps)**
- **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)**
- **[Olfactory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Olfactory_hallucination)**
- **[Mouth numbing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mouth_numbing)**
- **[Excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning)**
- **[Watery eyes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Watery_eyes)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component is considerably less intense when compared with that of substances like [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and happens more readily than with related substances like [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) .
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - This is a **very** rare effect but can likely happen in those predisposed to them, especially while in physically taxing conditions such as being dehydrated, fatigued or undernourished. However, it should be noted that there are no documented cases of seizures occurring with this compound to date.

#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry that is commonly present throughout this trip can be generally described as more similar in appearance to that of [MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MET) or [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) than [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as primarily intricate in complexity, algorithmic in form, structured in organization, brightly lit, colourful in scheme, synthetic in feel, multicoloured in scheme, flat in shading, sharp in edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, angular in its corners, immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity. At higher dosages, it may almost consistently result in states of [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) or [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) visual geometry.

- The cognitive effects of PRO-LAD can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. In comparison to other psychedelics such as [ETH-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/ETH-LAD) and [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , PRO-LAD is often described as significantly more slow-paced and LSD-like in terms of the specific style of thought stream(s) produced and contains a large number of potential effects, which, it should be noted seems to lead to cognitive and general sensory processing overload at moderate to high doses for reasons that are not currently understood. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** & **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**

- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- It should be noted that these effects are the rarest and least reproducible those that can occur during a [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience. They are considered unique in that that simply taking more of the substance does not necessarily increase the chance they will occur, and are said to rely more on contextual factors such as the user's [set and setting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) rather than the substance or dose itself. Their fullest manifestations are sometimes called "peak", "transcendent" or "transformative" experiences; however, they can still occur on a conceptual or cognitive level that can leave a lasting positive impact on the user.

- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
### Combination effects

- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - When used in conjunction with cannabis, both the visual and cognitive effects of PRO-LAD can be intensified and extended with extreme efficiency. This should be used with caution if one is not experienced with psychedelics. Many users sometimes report a dramatically more intense visual trip when combining it with [THC](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/THC) concentrates such as hashish as opposed to cannabis flower. However, this can also amplify the [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) producing aspects of both substances significantly, so extreme caution with this combination is advised.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - When used in combination with dissociatives, the geometry, euphoria, dissociation and hallucinatory effects are often greatly enhanced. Dissociative-induced [holes, spaces, and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids) while under the influence of PRO-LAD have significantly more vivid visuals than dissociatives alone present, and more intense [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) and [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) .
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - When used in conjunction with MDMA, the physical and cognitive effects of MDMA are amplified. The visual, physical and cognitive effects of PRO-LAD are also intensified with an overwhelming euphoric pleasure manifested through uniquely pleasurable body highs and headspaces, and uniquely colorful and awe-inspiring visuals. It is often recommended to wait at least three to four hours after ingesting PRO-LAD to take MDMA so as to avoid coming down from the latter while peaking on the former, but positive experiences have been reported with all possible timings. The synergy between these substances is unpredictable (and likely neurotoxic) [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] , and it is best to start with lower dosages than one would take for both substances individually.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - This interaction is not typically recommended due to alcohol’s ability to cause [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) , [depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression) and thought disorganization which can negatively affect a trip if taken in high dosages. This combination is however reasonably safe in low doses and when used responsibly, this can often take the edge off a trip as well as dull its psychedelic effects in a fashion somewhat similar to benzodiazepines, albeit more stressful on the body.
- **[Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines)** - When used in combination with benzodiazepines, benzodiazepines can, depending on the dosage, slightly to completely reduce the intensity of the cognitive, physical and visual effects of a PRO-LAD trip. They are very efficient at stopping [bad trips](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trip) at the cost of amnesia and reduced trip intensity. Caution is advised when acquiring them for this purpose due to the very high addiction potential that benzodiazepines possess.
- **[Psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics)** - When used in combination with other psychedelics, each drug's physical, cognitive and visual effects intensify and synergize strongly. The synergy between those substances is unpredictable, and for this reason generally not advised. If choosing to combine psychedelics, it is recommended to start with lower dosages than one would take for either substance individually.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational PRO-LAD do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because PRO-LAD is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people within the psychonaut community who have tried PRO-LAD suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

While no formal studies have been conducted, PRO-LAD is likely not habit-forming and it is reasonable to speculate that the desire to use it can actually decrease with repeated administratino. As with most psychedelics, it likely possesses what is considered an intrinsic, self-regulating aspect to it.

Tolerance to the effects of PRO-LAD is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 5-7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 14 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). PRO-LAD presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of PRO-LAD all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of PRO-LAD. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Legal status

- **Austria** : PRO-LAD is technically not illegal but it may fall in the NPSG (Neue-Psychoaktive-Substanzen-Gesetz Österreich) as an analogue of LSD. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Germany** : PRO-LAD is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.
- **Latvia** : PRO-LAD is illegal in Latvia. Although it isn't officially scheduled, it is controlled as an LSD structural analog due to an amendment made on June 1, 2015.
- **Switzerland** : On December 1, 2015, Switzerland added PRO-LAD to the list of controlled substances. It is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis E.
- **United Kingdom** : As of January 7, 2015, PRO-LAD is specifically named in the U.K. Misuse of Drugs Act as a Class A drug.

PRO-LAD, or PROLAD, also known as 6-propyl-6-nor-LSD, is a psychedelic drug of the lysergamide family related to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). It is taken orally.

## Use and effects

According to Alexander Shulgin in his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved) and other publications, PRO-LAD has a dose range of 100 to 200 μg or 80 to 175 μg orally and a duration of 6 to 8 hours. The onset is within 15 minutes. It has around the same potency as LSD, which has a listed dose range of 50 to 200 μg. On the other hand, PRO-LAD has a shorter duration than LSD, which has a listed duration of 8 to 12 hours.
The effects of PRO-LAD have been reported to include a lack of visuals and other psychedelic effects at lower doses, considerable visuals at higher doses, fantasy, synesthesia, clear thinking, lack of "cosmic-type" thinking, humor, pleasantness, dulled emotions, uncomfortableness, paranoia, and lightheadedness. It has been described as having relatively light or moderate effects. In addition, it is said to "not have any of the flavor of LSD", to be less visual than LSD, and to be "not up to LSD", if that is one's standard, as it is "basically not like LSD".

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

PRO-LAD shows affinity for serotonin receptors, including for the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C receptors. It acts as a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor similarly to LSD.
The drug fully substitutes for LSD in rodent drug discrimination tests and with about the same or slightly greater potency than LSD itself. On the other hand, it was about 2- to 3-fold less potent than ETH-LAD or AL-LAD.

## Chemistry

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of PRO-LAD has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of PRO-LAD include LSD, ETH-LAD, IP-LAD, AL-LAD, BU-LAD, MAL-LAD, PARGY-LAD, CYP-LAD, FLUORETH-LAD, and FP-LAD, among others.

## History

PRO-LAD was first described in the scientific literature by Tetsukichi Niwaguchi and colleagues in 1976. Subsequently, it was studied and described by Andrew J. Hoffman and David E. Nichols in 1985. The hallucinogenic effects of PRO-LAD in humans were first described by Nichols in a literature review via personal communication with Alexander Shulgin in 1986. The drug was later described in greater detail by Shulgin in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved). PRO-LAD is said to have been encountered as a novel designer drug by 2015.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Switzerland

PRO-LAD is illegal in Switzerland as of December 2015.

#### United Kingdom

On June 10, 2014, the United Kingdom Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) recommended that PRO-LAD be specifically named in the UK Misuse of Drugs Act as a class A drug despite not identifying it as ever having been sold or any harm associated with its use. The UK Home office accepted this advice and announced a ban of the substance to be enacted on 6 January 2015 as part of The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2014.
