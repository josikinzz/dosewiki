**This thread is for pure 4-HO-DMT (psilocin), NOT mushrooms.  For mushrooms, go to [The Big and Dandy Psilocybin Mushrooms Thread](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/showthread.php?s=&threadid=58587).

**


I know this stuff is on the market now.  Has anyone started experimenting with it?  When I obtain a sample soon, I'll post some trials.


If anyone has tried it yet, please post up something, no matter how little you have to say.

**Coming soon . . .**


A good friend of mine has experimented with it over the weekend. He got hold of it himself and eyeballed it. (He couldn't wait to borrow my scales). He  explained that he had judged the quantity by comparrison to a weighed quantity of 4AcO-DMT which I had previously weighed out for him. Only he wanted to go deeper so he put a 'little' more of the 4HO in his cuppa. His dose must have been at least 20+mg. Needless to say he was blown away and his experience has left him somewhat shaken. He had what he said was a wonderfull experience to start with, and then at the 5 hour mark he started getting jittery, with an uncomfortably high heart rate and the sensations of explosive rushes hitting him in his head and neck. After 6 hours he was back together again. He was so shaken that he has sworn off RCs for a good while.

The only upside to this is that I have now inherited his stash (I am swapping it for some greenery. This consists of just under a gram of Psilocin and a gram of AET. I have used neither of these before, so I am looking forward to giving them a go. I just feel sorry for my pal, but as I told him, discretion is the better part of valour, so I will be approaching both with caution. I will write a report once I have given it a go. My friend would only say that it was very 'different' to 4AcO, which may be partly on account of the unknowable dose he gave himself. . .

the stuff that is available is the fumarate, so it will probably have a higher dosage than historically listed doses of psilocin (which probably weren't the fumarate?).


Leary, (and et. al, whoever that guy is, he's everywhere helping people) administered 60mg of psilocin to people for peak experiences.


edit - lest I be mistaken for endorsing 60mg doses, let me be clear, that this would probably be a HUGE psychological overdose for most people...I believe the best dosage to start with will be 8-12mg, perhaps higher if you are very comfortable with fourth position T's. I'll be careful with this one it probably definitely has the ability to ASS KICK.

Oh...now I'm on a mission to find out what form the sandoz psilocin was in the 60s...bc possibly we could find the shelf life of it with that info...


The fumarate available will probably have a longer shelf life but how long is the question? One does not want this precious substance to degrade before being able to wrap a human brain around it.

I'm hoping that a glass vial in the deep freeze will help it keep for a little while, at least until I get a day off work when I've got a decent quantity of weed (My comfort blanket when going loco).

Should be fine.  I have other 4-hydroxylated tryptamines that I've had stored in glass vials in the freezer for years now.  Never any degrading...slight color change in some but no potency loss.

at [http://www.maps.org](http://www.maps.org)  (was on the TV news, newspapers etc) the FDA approved study with psilocybin i think they used 30mg which gave 80% of the participants mystical experiences.


The one time (.. in this thread somewhere) I took 250mg 4-aco-dmt, "I" think "I" ceased to exist before any fear could come over me - just shut the lights off got in bed and ... never noticed a transition it came so fast. 


I know with 4-AcO-DMT fumarate it was perfectly stable dissolved in a plastic water bottle w/water for days.  Wierd that for example a little 4-AcO-MiPT HCl starts to turn brown in just a couple hours in a small amount of water, when I added more than enough NaOH (xxmg's dont remember, purposely like 4x more than enough to get rid of the acetoxy and the 2xfumarate's) to dh20 then mixed in maybe 30mg's 4-AcO-DMT it started turning blue slowly then more like a darkish blue/green.  I let it get to that point then dumped it into some juice (acetic, stop the decomposition) drank it down (psilocin degration products outta that produced a wierd trip)


It would be interesting to take ... 20mg or so of this psilocin fumarate add it to a vial with distilled water and see what happens.  Maybe the fumarate (i dont know how you'd say it, 1:1 , technically you'd only need one fumarate per 2 psilocin molecules, ..i think thats right) is .... just more stable but i dont know why?  


Well anyway a test like that could sorta show whether its the fumarate salt thats making it so stable (my guess, 4-AcO-otherthings turn color in water fast) or the acetoxy really makes that much difference.

**4-ho-NMT and 4-ho-DMT**


T+0: drink 10mg 4-ho-NMT in lemon juice

T+20min: Feel “off”

T+1hr: insufflate 5mg more of 4-ho-NMT

T+1:08: Definitely feel something, but only a generic tryptamine head buzz and nothing more.

T+1:30-1:45: insufflate 8mgs of pure white 4-ho-DMT over 15 minutes.

T+1:50: This is a hard-edged onset.

T+2hrs:  A lot of manic energy.  I get little bursts of goofy laughter and feel compulsions to move my arms and legs in strange jerky movements and roll my head (like the way one might feel compelled to yawn).  Sparks could shoot out of me at any second. Slight tearing.  This is a lot of fun. 


I stopped keeping time at this point and watched a Twin Peaks episode.  The material is powerfully empathetic.  The terrifying parts of the episode are damn nearly traumatic; the sincere, spiritual stuff makes me tear up. I feel so touched at times my chest aches. It’s impossible to know how much influence the 4-ho-NMT (a possible metabolite of baeocystin) had on the 4-ho-DMT at this point, but the experince was wild. 


The combination of the two together is similar in its effects to 4-AcO-DMT but significantly quicker, more wandering, and chaotic.  If 4-AcO-DMT is like a whirlpool, fully capable of spinning me into the depths, but possessing a constant form and predictable flow that makes it navigable, then 4-ho-NMT/4-ho-DMT is like bounding between neighborhood pools--naked and screaming--making exhuberant swan dives, backflips, and canonballs into each one. 


I was mostly down 2.5-3hrs after insufflation, but I was so charged with vital energy I couldn’t get to sleep for about 2hrs after I normally could have, even with the aid of sleeping pills.  This is a wild one.  Take it slow.

^^^ whoa i was waiting for a report with 4-ho-NMT...


was your balance off at all?  well anyway i had hoped *-nmt in the very rare WILD (in a good way but deeper) mushrooms i've had a couple times was the reason (well partly).  only 8mg 4-ho-DMT, hmm.. i'll shut up & wait for more info, maybe a little/big n dandy 4-ho-nmt thread will show up soon.

I wonder if 4-Ho-NMT is really active at all...I'd have thought that dose would do more (since baeocystin is active at 10mg).

perhaps the 4-ho-NMT will be tested somehow (other than bioassay of course). It is a tannish brown right now...I wonder if it has already degraded?

Well all we have to go on is "10mg is active" (or did he say fully active etc), doesn't really leave much to go on, dose probably too low (assuming the freebase) and "similar to psilocybin" (i forget how it was said just no real details), 


If baeocystin is active on its own (4-phosphoryloxy-*) differently than the hydroxy, well i kinda guess that just like the acetoxy versions, the phosphoryloxy's are like different drugs too - i'm not sure i buy into the idea that 4-PO has to get changed into a 4-HO before its active.. whether scientific guesses this or that no way to know unless its tried.  The 4-PO-N,N,N-TMT trimethyl ammonium salt supposedly impossible to be active / get into the brain, although Dr. Gartz (from experience) thinks otherwise - the mushrooms most different and unique, "special" happen to have more of the N,N,N-TMT compound in them (starts with an a.. cant think of it)


Could easily be tested using a little 4-AcO-DMT and simple chemistry/few hours (like 95% yield).

At 10mg oral + 5mg insufflated I felt a "generic tryptamine head buzz" from the 4-ho-NMT.  There's really not much to say.  I also noticed some distortions in the periphery of my vision, but none of this was like mushrooms at all.  I do think there would be visuals for me at around 20mgs, but please start lower than that.  Also, any links to  baeocystin info would be appreciated.  I only know of a vague blurb that suggests it's "entheogenic" at 10mg.  Do you have information that suggests it's a fully fleshed out psychedelic alone?


Also, "only 8mg of 4-ho-DMT"?  I was going off of Shulgin's dose in Tihkal where he describes 10mg orally as "a little frightening, almost too exciting, after the gentleness of other substances".  I am guessing that 8mg insufflated is approximately equal in intensity to about 12mg oral (+50 percent), and that's on top of 15mg of 4-ho-NMT (btw mine is a light greyish tan).  If my scale was off enough to so seriously over register the 4-ho-NMT I shouldn't have felt as much as I did when it came to the 4-ho-DMT, so I don't think that's the case.

Can I ask why you insufflated them when, at least for psilocin, they're plenty active orally?


Either way, I want to see more reports on psilocin... Mushrooms quite frankly scare the crap out of me and every time I eat them, I feel like I'm poisoned for hours after the trip subsides... it would be interesting to take the pure substance and see how differently it agrees with me.

**Marquis Reactions**


The 4-HO-DMT reacted with marquis reagent with a deep olive green/brown, which developed over 10 minutes into a forest green.


The 4-HO-NMT reacted with marquis reagent with a rusty (almost reddish) brown, which developed over 10 minutes toward a dark olive green/dark brown.


Stimulation results from 2mg oral ingestion of the 4-HO-DMT; a state that is not unlike low dose amphetamine.

My guess is because less of the substance is needed.


Also i found insufflation of tryptamines to not be as painful as with PEA's.

I understand that part Delsyd... but it just seems like its not really needed. And it modifies the experience, making comparisons to oral administration moot in most cases.

It was getting late and I worked pretty early the next morning so I wanted to both shorten it and be able to blow my nose if it accelerated too quickly.  My original timing involved only using the 4-ho-NMT, but when that resulted in a lackluster--though still pleasant--experience, I went for the 4-ho-DMT.  Also, because the onset time is significantly quicker, and the onset of each additional dose is more palpable, I was able to titrate this first time dose to what I was sensationally extrapolating would be a decent level with greater precision.  You may be right about insufflation modifying the experience, but I ended up enjoying it immensely in any case, as I figured I would.  Even if I had used it orally, I had still combined it with 4-ho-NMT, and there is no telling how that affected it at this point either.  Insufflated 4-AcO-DMT doses are about 50 percent stronger than oral proportional to weight and about 1/3 shorter (for me) if you're looking for a--likely pretty translatable--conversion constant for oral 4-ho-DMT.  Qualitatively it's a rougher onset with a more stimulating plateau, with the AcO.  


It's true; it does not burn at all.

I guess I was just under the impression that psilocin hits within 15 minutes through the oral route anyway.


Even when I eat mushrooms, as long as I chew them up immensely (yuck), they hit within 15 minutes.


But either way, thanks for the report. Definitely looking forward to hearing about a full oral dose! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have some of this on the way and allready have some 4-aco-dmt and amt and look foward to trying these in different combo's.  Any suggestions??? has anyone tryed smoking 4-ho-dmt before, when I was a kid I smoked some shrooms and actually tripped mildly, though they tasted like burnt frenchfries. I think the pure chemical might work.

Has anyone else tried this one?


I'm interested if anyone thinks that the qualitative effects of 4-ho-dmt could be distinguished from 4-ho-met or 4-ho-mipt.  I'm quite certain that the 4-acos could be distinguished from the 4-ho's by a trained mind, but I have my doubts as to if someone could tell the difference between 4-ho-dmt, 4-ho-met, and 4-ho-mipt.  They all seem to have the manic energy that the 4-hos seem to impart ... that's just what I gather from reading reports.  4-ho-dipt seems to be noticably different from the rest.  Any thoughts?

I found 4-HO-MET to share some similarities to other 4-HOs, but it, particularly, was unique for sure, most especially in its extremely clear headspace and bright, sharp, rainbow-colored visuals.


4-HO-DiPT is also much different from the others.  And likewise, 4-AcO-DMT is very much different from the other 4-AcOs I've tried (-MiPT, DiPT).


I suppose it could be power of suggestion...

Which other 4-ho's have you tried? ... not including 4-ho-dipt, because I think we can all agree that it's quite a bit different.  4-ho-det did seem qualitatively different ... more of a clear headspace.  According to reports, 4-ho-mipt has a distinct body buzz (I haven't tried this one).  If there are differences here, they are extremely subtle.

^^ I can guarantee if I was given 4-ho-mipt or 4-ho-dipt (blind test style) I would be able to tell them apart. They are totally different on many levels, particularly in the visual department.

**Slowed Dancin' with DMT**


We decided to trip yesterday afternoon as we were hiking around and the weather was clearing.


T+0:00: My friend and I both ate 10mg 4-ho-NMT in a gel cap. I told him not to expect anything as it most likely is not very active.


T+2:00: Nothing. We both have tolerances as we are tripping once or more a week, but I expected *something* at least.


T+2:30(0:00): We both take 10mg of 4-HO-DMT, sublingually. Bitter!


T+0:15: As we walk down to the creek to play in the sunshine with the river rocks we both begin to come up...typical tryptamine floaty feeling...detached, yet grounded (hard for me to explain). I'm sitting on a rock staring at the water, and as the wind plays wth the water I notice intricate patterns in the water.  I have a realization that I am becoming more and more aware in the psychedelic state and finding more and more intricacies to it. There is so much there to discover! We start walking upstream.


T+0:30: WHOA! Coming up FAST now! I get a little nauseas and *almost* throw up but keep it in with some deep breathing and closed eyes. Deep patterns are forming on the back of my eyelids...this is slowed down DMT...I am slow dancing with the DMT visuals that usually are so frenetic (on DMT)...


T+1:00: Defintely peaking, we are talking to each other and sharing things about our life...there are long pauses where we sit and think and look at the world around us. He stands up to make a point and while he's talking he waves his arms in the air. Thousands of his arms freeze around him in still motion and he strikes me as looking like Shiva, as he is literally glowing with energy. In fact, everything is glowing with energy.


T+2:00: Definite drop-off in activity. CEVs just DISAPPEAR all of a sudden. Such a clean drop-off it amazes me. Cognition is rapidly returning to baseline.


T+3:00: Still tripping, yet its very smooth. This feeling lingers for 3 or 4 more hours, gradually fading away.

I agree.  Between 4-ho-mipt, 4-ho-met, 4-ho-dmt though, I'm not so sure I could.  


THANKS for the report samadhi!!!!  Sounds great!  Would you say 10 mg yielded a +++?

Definitely a +3 - but I wonder if the 10mg of 4-ho-NMT potentiated it any (taken 2-2.5 hours before). This was way stronger than 14mg of 4-aco-DMT (WAY stronger!). And I've been tripping way more than I was when I took the aco-DMT last and it still felt more powerful.


Ideally my friend and I could take 10mg of psilocin again without the NMT next time...but I think I will just jump into a very high dose to try to get a long extended DMT trip.

How would you initially say that it compares to mushrooms, out of curiosity?  Subjective, I realize, but I'm interested.

This was different from mushrooms. MUCH less chaotic and more centering, almost sedating. Much cleaner on the body too. Whereas with mushrooms I'm running around a little mad through the woods usually, and my body is doing weird things with its muscles and GI tract, this chemical I was content to sit by the river in the sun and talk with my friend about our lives...something I am usually not capable of doing on mushrooms. I understand now the TIHKAL entry that compared it to MDMA. The CE visuals were very similar to about 15mg of DMT.

^^ Unfortunately there's no way to really answer that because of the large variation in mushroom potency and the presence of 4-HO-NMT, 4-PhO-DMT, and even traces of DMT.

A lot different...much more intense psychedelic, more visual, maybe a little rougher come-up and a little harder on the stomach (like I said I got a little nausea).


The more I think of psilocin the more excited I get! It really was a beautiful experience and has a lot of promise!! I can't wait to take a very large dose and just zone out with eyes closed the entire trip!! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) 


Anyways I'll stop rambling about my experience.....I am looking forward to hearing about others' trips with this one! %)

Any advice on the (pure) 4-Ho-DMT/MDMA mix?  I love the LSD/MDMA combo (in fact, that is really the only way I care to do LSD anymore) but have never tried the psilocin/MDMA combo.  I've read about 'hippyflipping' but I'd imagine the pure compound peaks a bit faster than mushrooms.  I want both to peak at the same time.


Would one be best to take them together (similar timeframe.....both 6 hr) or would one want to wait 1/2 hr before taking the MDMA?

The pure compound will probable kick in quicker than the already fast mushroom counterparts.  IME MDMA takes significantly longer to fully peak compared to mushrooms, even when in pure form.  


I'd take the MDMA a half hour before the 4-ho-dmt.

Not for me.  It takes me a good 1 1/2 hr to 2 hr to peak on mushrooms.  The MDMA peak for me occurs around 1 to 1 1/2 hours.


Dondante...awesome.  Can't wait to see for myself.  Was 14mg enough for a +3?

Yeah, seriously. I remember how I felt on my last M1 experience, it was about like that at times. Also, I was doing that tripping empathy weirdness thing with your friend that sometimes a person does. I was listening to him while he was talking and like scooting up to him with my head tilted so engrossed in what he was saying with a big smile on my face. I must have looked a bit odd to him! He looked lovely to me! Everything looked very very lovely!


I say skip the MDMA!

14 mg was borderline ++/+++.  I supplemented with 30 mg IM MET and 10 mg ketamine.  The other two had taken 10 mg and 14 mg and both were at a similar level ... not quite engrossing.  They supplemented with 7 mg at just over 2 hrs in.  That provided a strong +++.  I would start no higher than 18 mg.

^^Gel caps for first dose.  Dissolved in juice for 2nd.  


How fast did it hit? I can't imagine that psilocin gets absorbed sublingually.  It might be fundal absorption if onset is less than 20 min.

Definitely, 15-20 mins I was getting color saturation and depth changes and light patterns (I can't explain these, they are like crystal clear patterns covering everything) and generally got very quiet staring at the river thinking nothing. By 25-30 mins I was having full blown open eye visuals (patterns, geometric figures, trails, etc). Curiously, by the time I started getting full blown patterns I then almost threw up. It was such a fast ride up....way way faster than mushrooms, even when I've chewed them up very finely.


Why would you doubt psilocin can be absorbed sublingually?

I suppose it could be, but 10-20 mg is a lot to absorb under your tongue.  I'd guess that you'd end up swallowing a good bit regardless.  Now that I think about it though, I don't see why it wouldn't work to some degree.  There's not as much surface area as with rectal, but it's still a mucous membrane.  Also, the rectum may have more active absorption.

It was such a fast ride up....way way faster than mushrooms, even when I've chewed them up very finely.

This is almost the exact same onset profile for me orally, though for me it was a little quicker (dissolved in juice).  No opinion about sublingual absorbtion, just stating it for the record.  Also, even orally psilocin doesn't last much longer than 3 hours for me at a ++ dose, even though mushrooms often do.  For me the insufflated route is about 50% more potent and  has about a 25% faster onset compared to oral.  IM is nearly 100% more potent but is only a little faster than the insufflated route in onset time.  Both of these latter routes are more stimulating and shorter acting.  I think most people will prefer oral, but I enjoyed the more stimulating nature of IM in conjunction with ketamine.  It made it really exhilarating.

^^Dondante and psoodonym, Did you guys notice many headspace differences between the 4-ho-dmt and regular shrooms, like clarity or thought trains? Also have you guys tried 4-aco-dmt and if you have what kind of differences did you notice between 4-aco and 4-ho?

It's difficult to say.  I tried 4-AcO-DMT over 6 months ago, and mushrooms almost 2 years ago.  Also, I did not smoke pot this time.  For me, THC has a profound effect on a trip.  


Taking that into account, I'd generalize by saying that 4-ho-dmt is more manic, particularly the onset.  It was extremely pleasurable.  Oddly enough, neither reminded me too much of mushrooms.  This could be due to faded memories, set and setting, or amount of THC among other things.  


Also, my one 4-aco-dmt experience was with a fairly high dose, 34 mg ... so there's another factor.  Overall, 4-ho-dmt and 4-aco-dmt weren't radically different.  I'd be suspicious of anyone that claimed that they were.

**Comparison: Psilocin, Mushrooms, and 4-AcO-DMT**


I’ve had mushrooms more recently and have used 4-AcO-DMT many times; I think I can make a fair personal comparison.  All of the following distinctions are subtle and confounded by different sets, settings, etc.  


Psilocin is more stimulating and feels “cleaner” than the mushrooms I’ve had. Its onset has a harder edge that I believe is due primarily to the lack of psilocybin and secondarily to the absence of the encasing mushroom flesh (see samadhi smiles' comment about ground up mushrooms above).  This can probably be remedied by simply drinking it dissolved in juice in regular portions and intervals over a half hour, though others and myself have noted a general diminishing affect on the depth of resulting experiences when powerful tryptamine doses are staggered.  All other negative symptoms associated with mushrooms are lessened.  Isolated 4-ho-DMT has the added assurance of having been tested as safe. Not that I seriously doubt the safety of the chemical cocktail that is mushrooms.


The body high is less pronounced than with mushrooms unless I use it in conjunction with 4-ho-NMT.  When I do this it gives me giddy, almost tickling, compulsions to tense up the muscles in my neck, roll my shoulders, and shake my arms and legs, though all of this is controllable and is only significantly expressed when I walk. Everybody else I know who’s used 4-ho-NMT says it’s completely inactive. I still get the symptoms when it’s combined with psilocin and still like it, placebo or not.  


While 4-ho-DMT seems more manic than mushrooms--just as chaotic but less cloudy or confusing--or 4-AcO-DMT, I find 4-AcO-DMT to be slightly smoother, significantly more euphoric, and longer lasting.  In my fairly limited experience, 4-ho-DMT has been more empathic than 4-AcO-DMT, but I find that the 4-AcO-DMT is just as, if not more, introspectively and spiritually powerful, and is, not coincidentally, easier to direct; that makes it a superior tool for me.  I think I’ll be in the minority in gauging 4-AcO-DMT higher than 4-ho-DMT, but not in gauging 4-ho-DMT higher than mushrooms.  Still, I love them all.

psoodonym, have you tried a higher dose of 4-HO-NMT or with alternate methods? I was going to try a 20mg dose, orally and then perhaps a 35-50mg dose. And then try some IM or insufflated doses.


I won't bother with MAOIs since I dislike what the ones I've tried do to my body.

I'd try insufflation.  That way you can have immediate results ... saves playing the waiting game of oral admin.  Maybe try rapidly escalating doses of 20 mg, 40 mg, etc. about 30 min apart if you really want to test its activity.  Obviously, slow down if you get something at 20 mg.  Then have 4-ho-dmt on hand in case you're disappointed.  


BTW, the ID of 4-ho-nmt has been confirmed by NMR.

the rapidly escalating doses (you were talking about oral right). Is this to keep MAO 'occupied' competetively - sorry my q mark key is broken ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

I've used 10mg orally and felt nothing.  I followed that by 5mg insufflated and thought I felt a "generic tryptamine buzz".  In any case, at these levels and alone, I did not find the chem substantial, but did feel something.  Another time I IM'd 5mg after consuming 4-ho-DMT and experienced a resurgence of the idiomotor movements I experienced in my first combination trip, which were not present beforehand with 4-ho-DMT alone.  Though he reported no activity during his 10 mg IM dose, during Dondante's 4mg IV dose he experienced a "wave of muscle tightness", which, if not due to simple anxiety, lends some credence to the idea that the muscular effects I experienced on it in conjunction with 4-ho-DMT were not purely placebo effects.  In any case I don't think 4-ho-NMT on its own will amount to anything worthwhile at any level, but here's to you proving me wrong with rapidly escalating doses!  Meanwhile I'll keep my doses of it low so I can conserve my limited quantity for its fun and fascinating (placebo?) effects on my 4-ho-DMT trips.   


Also, I'm pretty sure Dondante was talking about insufflated doses, which should factor out most MAO issues that might be involved in the compound's activity level/inactivity.

O.K I have this stuff, and I would like to say that snorting it is very nice!   Very little burn and you feel it in 10 min.  You start with a nice body almost x type high then about 20 min into it the visuals start. I use a bullet like people use for coke and get close to equal doses each time.  I would also like to state that it goes very well with AMT also.  I have mixed it with 4-aco-dmt which added a whole new visual aspect to the trip.  We have even mixed it with 4-aco-dmt, AMT, and morphine, and weed and still had great experiences.  What I really want to know is if anyone has tried to smoke 4-ho-dmt yet?  I know you can smoke shrooms but they taste like burnt french fries.  How would you go about smoking pure psilocin, how much would you need, and do you need to prepare it in any certain way?  Thanks....  -Peace

^^ You would need a digital vaporizer probably, set to the vaporization point of 4-HO-DMT (whatever that is).  Psilocin is known to degrade very easily from heat, so using a flame would destroy it (as is the case with mushrooms).  Or at least the majority of it.  Using a meth-like pipe (a freebasing pipe) might also work, but it might also be too hot.

probably converted to the freebase would work much better. This can be done with NaOH or it could be done with baking soda a la crack cocaine. This is on my radar of 'to-do's' as I suspect it will be very DMT like (more so even than oral).


Please report back if you try it.

Just droped 60mg into ammonia, then filtered and dried.  Split this in half with a friend and smoked through a glass chillum with screens and a thin layer of dank on top.  Tapped surface with a butane torch from a distance to cause it to melt.  Smoked in one hit.  Mostly a sedative effect with slight perception changes.  This could be do to the method of smoking or the fact that I've been snorting it the last couple days, but I still tripped with out much drop in effect when snorted. But smoking the freebase did have a definent effect, worth further experimentation....

I have still yet to try this but have some ready for research.  I want a lifetime collection of rcs (1g of each will be enough), but do you think these kinds of tryptamines will last 60+ years in vials and a freezer?  I need to invest in some vials.


A few friends of mine did bumps of 4-ho-dmt and they liked it.  They said it felt a lot like 4-aco-dmt....figures.


I'll have to give this a whirl soon enough myself.  Im surprised it ever made it to the market ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

a guy tried this last night, couldnt tell the difference from mushrooms. 

that guy was thinking of dissolving in water and soaking/drying a mushroom to make a super mushroom.

GREAT stuff!!

this guy looks foward to exploring quite high doses as 10g mushrooms is usually the minimum and it takes a while to get em all down.with this stuff it hits all at once which makes flight/travel possible.

i'll never try this but mr. guy sees this quickly becoming his favorite.

some one who isnt mithra.


anyone have any idea as to equivilency in g's of mushrooms?

what would someone who is into taking 5-7g's take to try and match the effects? 


also, with mushrooms 'a guy' noticed physical changes at high doses- very thin weird feeling hair and changes in skin-primarily hands and feet. ive found psilocin to do this too. anyone know why/how this occurs? anyone else have this happen? he's thinking of taking before/after pictures, its not simply altered perception.

As DivineMomenT said, i never thought id see the day that this beauty would show up.  Im not even that big of a fan of mushrooms but to try pure psilocin is not the type of thing i would let pass by.


Dont know when i will be experimenting with this one but when i do i willl report back.


20mg of psilacetin is my ideal dose. what would the equivalent of that be in psilocin.

wow you are a light weight.. 20mg of psilacetin, I'm guessing that is a new term for 4-AcO-DMT?  (sorry, this is my first post).


I'll assume you have the fumarate salt, rather than the freebase.  That's equivalent to about 11.0mg psilocin, 15mg psilocybin, or a little over 1 gram of dried P. cubensis, assuming the figures of 0.60% psilocin and 0.63% psilocybin by weight on erowid are correct.


I have all of this laid out on an excel spreadsheet, p.cubensis is to psilocin is to 4-ho-dmt is to 4-aco-dmt fumarate,  if anyone wants it.. and I know it's all correct cause I'm a chemist and I'm never wrong.


I made the chart because I was jealous of those in the recent study who had mystical experiences with 30mg psilocybin, and the chart informed me that equals roughly 37.5mg 4-AcO-DMT fumarate and I must say the experience confirmed that in spades.  This is a great dose..


Equivalent to just over 2 grams of P. cubensis according to the chart but I'm starting to think that number is low and the researchers that erowid pulled those numbers from had better quality mushrooms than what is normally pulled off cow shit and found in the streets these days.  An ounce of mushrooms would be 65.4mg going by these numbers!

15mg of 4-ho-dmt is about the same as 20mg 4-aco-dmt, and does anyone have personal experience with any of the cheap milligram scales, are there any that work well for the money?  And by the way pure psilocin is much more mellow of a head trip than shrooms, this has got to be due to the other chemicals in shrooms.  Remember psilocin is what Leary and friends were using before they got there hands on lsd....    Peace

Yes, IM.  For me it's about twice as potent as oral and plateaus in half the time.  It has a harder-edged onset and, for me, remains more stimulating and chaotic than oral throughout its duration.  When I've used psilocin this way I've always insufflated more later or IM'd after oral ingestion, so I can't comment on total length, but it's probably no more than 2-2.5hrs for 6-10mgs IM.  IM is my preferred method for mixing with ketamine (see my recent post in the b&d ketamine thread); the extra stimulation and shorter duration is a virtue in that case.  


Regarding the intensity ratio of 4-AcO-DMT to 4-ho-DMT: for me it's about 3:5 (12-13:20).  I'm interested in mixing them too (~6mg ho ~10mg AcO) but haven't yet.  Also, unlike willkell420 I don't find it more mellow than mushrooms; for me the average 4-ho-DMT trip is more stimulating than mushrooms, but smoother.

For me it is hard to stay awake sometimes after taking too much psilocin, almost like taking a Benzo with shrooms.  But everyones reaction is different...

I had some 4-AcO-DMT stored in tap water (I'm aware distilled is much better) for about 2 months and suddenly I looked at it one day and it was blue. Silly me I threw it out before I clued in that it might have degraded into psilocin.


I didn't expect to keep it that long and it was exposed to some heat, but I'm really regretting throwing it out now... ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

xorkoth, if I remember right you said you really liked the amt 4-aco-dmt combo.  Just for reference 4-ho-dmt with amt is about as good as you can get.  My friend mixed all 3 on the 4th of July.   Peace

**just thought I'd mention**


I started a journal, based on emails I sent to my pal a few days ago. Theycontain a bit of a trip report with 4HO-DMT, vapourised DMT and 5MeO-DMT. I had two days off work to have a good old trip. On the second day I had AET. I couldnt't be arsed to edit for trip reports yet, but if you want a read do check it -

15mg made me have a sort of panic reaction. I think this is more due to mushroom abuse in the past, and a negative association there. I feel the fear so strong as it comes on that it intereferes with the experience. The trip itself, fear and anxiety aside, as interesting and not quite like eating mushrooms (which I am VERY experienced with). The complete lack of nausea being a great difference that I enjoyed.


I think I will try again later on, after taking some MDMA. While it might be more intense, MDMA has very reliably eliminated The Fear for me on every other drug I've tried.


(and thanks to the psilocin guy - this stuff made MANY people's day, quite a treat for them)

Don't be surprised if you get nausea with this chemical. So far 2 out of 6 people I have taken it with have vomited shortly after coming up.


Not trying to mind trick you into nausea....hopefully this won't color anyone's psychosomatic mindscape...


The possibilities are infinite...as I give psychedelics to more people I recognize the power of suggestion present in the felt subjective experience of psychedelic environment.

Yeah, sometimes i hesitate to tell people they might vomit or something like that, out of fear of planting the idea in their mind. Like my GF will probably puke if i tell her people do sometimes on substance ABC. But then i feel bad if i dont and they yack and get uncomfortable (especially newbies).


I got to the point where mushrooms, even the smell, make my stomach churn. By comparison I noticed nothing.

I would guess that the dosages / experiences for this freshly emerged compound are given for its fumarate salt? Or freebase?


(Would there be any difference in the trip's "quality" depending on whether a substance is a salt, or a freebase? Subjective opinions seem to indicate there would indeed be.)


For the record, I had a beautiful trip off 15mg intranasally. Girlfriend was sent into a 2-hour hell off 10mg intranasally. Those were our first times.

If I am doing my math correctly, psilocybin is about 1.4X less potent than psilocin.  And psilacetin is about 1.21X less potent.  Thus 10mg of psilocin = 14mg of psilocybin and 12mg of psilacetin.


30mg of psilocybin equals about 22mg of psilocin.

^^Follow up reports of the Good Friday experiment, conducted by Rick Doblin, actually detailed the fact that, whist most claimed to have a true mystical religious experience, good old Leary forgot to mention the fact that one member (who refused to be interviewd regarding this) had to be tranquilised with Thorazine, and that several other intense panic, borderline psychotic crisies were observed. 


Its a bit amusing that Learys first psychedelic experience was with actual mushrooms, and that he didn't recognise or even really acknowledge any subjective difference between psilocybn pills from sandoz and actualy fungus from Mexico.

Neither did Maria Sabina when Albert Hoffman gave them to her.  Of course, psilocybin is not psilocin, just as psilacetin is not psilocybin.  But most who have had psilocin and psilocybin report no subjective difference.

My cat took 22mg of psilocin one time. He dumped the powder down his throat, chased it with a drink. Come up was sudden, and terrifying. The cat tripped out about many things, leading to him feeling like he was genuinely dying. After a rough 1.5h he pulled through, thanks to some great people. I'd say, "ego transcendence" or at least becoming to where it's pliable. Neat OEVs and CEVs, very natural and organic and mushroomy.


Organic-visual-like, similar to 4-ho-det. More potent by weight than 4-ho-nmt (aka 4-ho-met). Much more paranoia than other RCs. Post-rough-times, very euphoric and chill.


The only time kitty took psilacetin at 25mg, the experience was light but seemed more regular/repeating, less spontaneous visual.

nevermind my confusion, I was referring to "metocin" with one ethyl and one methyl. (I just looked again) - I did not know there was 4-ho-nmt going around but I've seen mentions made of it.

Can you give a little more details on the difference you felt with 4-ho-det and 4-ho-met compared to 4-ho-dmt. Would you be able to tell them apart in a blind test?

It's likely my cat would be able to tell them apart. 4-ho-met, at 36mg had him having minor visual alterations of swishyness accompanied by flickering he does not get on shrooms. At this dose 4-ho-dmt would kick his ass, hell at 22mg he had a difficult time, so, 4-ho-met seems less potent.


4-ho-det has a very recognizable body load, somewhat euphoric with definite horizontal leg tremors towards the end of the trip. Visually, much more is required of ethocin to acieve the same kind of OEVs from psilocin - my cat usually samples 50mg+ of ethocin at a time.


Again, my cat has not experienced 4-ho-met in a strong enough dose to notice definite qualities unique to this compound.

Oh my... this one is awfully special.  Trip report coming soon.  Suffice to say I've never understood so clear, nor accepted death so readily.  This was like mushrooms with tremendous clarity and less physical.  This had the property of every thought leading to every other thought all at once outside the constraints of time, a cascade of logic that inevitably ended up contradicting everything.  Complete inability to remove myself from the immedicacy of the experience.


In fact this trip was very much like my +4 on 2C-E, except I understood what was happening this time.


I am thinking out loud, and will now stop doing so here.

I have a feeling that mixing this with 4-HO-MET would be spectacular.  Equal doses of both, or perhaps a higher dose of this (potency-wise, not mass-wise).  For me, 4-HO-MET left me quite in my own ego, while allowing beautiful access to the tryptamine mindspace, while 4-HO-DMT is a true ego-smasher.

^ So, when can we read the trip report? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I would love to get my hands on 4-HO-MET as well. I bet it's great. I had very nice experiences with MET also.


I can't wait to try 4-HO-DMT either. Mushrooms have always held a very special place in my heart, and I absolutely loved 4-AcO-DMT as well. 4-HO-DMT sounds like a nice cross between the two.

And yeah, I did find 4-HO-DMT to be a great substance, perhaps the deepest synthesized chemical I've encountered.  Mentally it was a lot like mushrooms except (for me in this trip anyway) more mentally focused.  But it was also quite different, particularly in feel.  Like 4-AcO-DMT, it **felt** closer to DMT than to mushrooms.  But much less so than 4-AcO-DMT.  And also deeper and much clearer, and more ego-shattering by far.

Here's the report.  it's not really finished, but is in a finished form.  I will surely be editing it as I remember more and integrate the experience

4-HO-DMT was definitely terrifying.  But at the same time it allowed acceptance much easier than mushrooms do.  And I agree with your assessment of 4-AcO-DMT.  I had a +4 on it (with AMT and 2C-B), also in the Trip Reports forum and linked to in my report posted above.  But that +4 involved staying totally in my ego while accessing the universal mind at the same time.  Once with it I entered the void, but it was very brief and vague and didn't leave much impression on me.

This was already answered with ebay. True enough.


I shall also mention that I found a local headshop more to my choice of a merchant.

Additionally, my experience to note is very novice when it comes to scales and heavy use of them; however, I believe it's a wise choice to buy a higher quality one. Grab a 50g or weight accordingly to the scale to keep an accurate measure through check and calibration.


This is even more cogent in my opinion, if you plan on using the scale more than 1-2 times.

This is a screenshot from the upcoming film [American Drug War: The Last White Hope](http://www.americandrugwar.com/). I'm not sure which study its from, but in the video I can make out that its 250mg total, the capsules contain psilocybin/niacin and the expiry date is 3/10/05. The 11.5mg might be the psilocybin dose or the niacin dose, I can't see for sure because the whole label isn't shown. It also says "Caution New Drug Limited by Federal Law..." Does anyone know what role the  niacin plays? It it being administered with the psilocybin or more likely as an active placebo?

thats 4-PO-DMT - you're offtopic again E1 8) 


well, 11,5mg of the phosphor is equal to about what, 8 or 9mg of the hydroxy -


that would definitely be noticeable!


Have you tried subpsychedelic dose of psilocin yet E1 - its quite nice, has a very clean amphetamine feel to it-

Close enough.


11.5mg sounds a bit more like a psychotherapeutic dose to me rather than an entheogenic one in my opinion, so this was likely an anxiety study. The Hopkins study was a single dose, much higher. 


Unfortunately, I haven't had the opportunity to try pure psilocin yet. I'm still waiting for the guy that stands at my street corner to get some, he assures me it will be soon. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) When I think of the last year and how I've completed neglected plant sources for synthetic, it makes me sad. Its been almost a year exactly since my last mushroom trip.


I really enjoy low doses of 4-AcO-DMT (3-5mg) though. It brightens things up, makes me happy, and puts some sparkle in the world (or more likely, allows me to better perceive it). It reminds of of the afterglow from smoked DMT.

If the desired use was to alleviate stress in terminally ill patients, the Niacin might be to help reduce the hallucinatory effects, which could be considered undesirable and secondary to the emotionally opening effects of psilocybin. The low, multiple doses could allow a person to work through their emotions and accept their fate, although I think some "transcendent high doses" could also be very beneficial in this regard.

^ Psilocybin has been used to treat cluster headaches. I had great sucess with it stopping an acid trip when I was in high school, they was also another time it didn't work very well for that purpose. I take it off and on as I sort of like the flushing sensation and  it feels healthy. If you are having a hellish trip though, taking something that makes you feel like you are burning might not be the best idea. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif) 


For some reason I think the dose in this case (assuming it is actually being mixed with the 4-PO-DMT) is much closer to the RDA and a sub-flush dose. I still think it could have been an active placebo as was used in the "Good Friday Experiment". The Hopkin's study used Ritalin as the active placebo, so it wasn't this study.


> The Good Friday Experiment, a group of **20 seminary students were given either psilocybin or nicotinic acid (also known as niacin)** during a church service. The 10 students who received psilocybin reportedly experienced intensely spiritual feelings. There appeared to be a lasting positive benefit, as a study 25 years later seemed to suggest the effects had continued.
> 
> 
> 
> **The subjects in the recent John Hopkins study received either methylphenidate (Ritalin) or psilocybin**. Of the patients receiving psilocybin, one third reported it as the most spiritually meaningful experience of their lives, citing feelings of intense joy, a distance from ordinary reality and feelings of peace and harmony after taking the compound. Two thirds of the group rated their experience with psilocybin as one of the top five experiences in their life, and compared it to such life-altering moments as the birth of their first child or a parent's death.

**4-HO-DMT (psilosin) dosage**


Well I've recently come across some synthetic 4-HO-DMT however I'm finding Shulgin's dosing misleading. He says a solid dose is 10-20mg, and his trip reports make 15mg seem very intense. However me and a couple of friends dosed 15mg and barely felt anything, mainly just pupil dilation. Can anyone shed some light on a good dosage?

I tried it once, tripped pretty damn hard off only 10mg, though one of my trip buddies who also took 10mg said he barely felt anything.


Proceed with caution.. maybe your product is cut with something, or maybe it isn't what you think it is. You could up the dosage, but I'd make sure you know what you have before you do that.

I have taken 2, 4, 6, 10mg, 14mg, 18mg, 22mg, and 25mg orally. The last two trips were the most powerful (strangely enough the 22mg was the most intense but that was because I was combining it with other drugs) they were literally mindblowing, having to remain laying down blasted away with intense tryptamine visuals (interlocking geometric patterns forming what looks like entity like structures and beings).


The 25mg dose was with ketamine so that must have affected the experience, but it was STRONG.


I would say a good starting dose is 10mg to get a feel for it, don't be surprised if you are tripping hard.


That is if your material is good (and it should be unless this has been through some dirty hands or if it was stored somewhere in less than ideal conditions).


peace,

samadhi

Is it dark grey?  If you have the same stuff that most people who have it have, it starts white and turns grey to dark grey as it degrades (I came across a small amount left out for weeks in a piece of foil.)  Otherwise, unless all three of you have a high tolerance or are using a scale that's way off, you most likely don't have 4-ho-DMT because 15mgs should put you plenty beyond the threshold/placebo effects you describe. 


Whatever happened to the Big and Dandy 4-ho-DMT thread anyways?

The material is white. It comes from a trusted source who imports his goods from Asia. I'm confident he gave me the right substance and the right dose... I talked to him about it later and he said others said they all tripped off it ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

Well sir, if you're confidences toward your dealer are indeed justified and all auxilary assumptions hold e.g. you and your friends aren't anti-psychotic abusing 800 pound gorillas, then I suppose the unlikely event that three people with unusually high innate tolerances to psilocin all just happened to try and trip together has occurred.  Go back, buy 25mg this time, and try again.

Tonight I found myself with all my housemates gone home for the weekend and a snowstorm outside. Perfect setting for another shot. I had 2 capsules with what I was told was 15mg 4-HO-DMT; I opened them up and split one in half. Put them together and bombed down what I believe to be 22-23mg. Long story short enlightenment was achieved this time. When I have some more time I might get started on a report if anyone is interested.

awesome!!! I love to hear about people's experiences with this stuff as every trip report I read makes me more excited about it!


It ranks up there for me in the top three psychedelics

1. DMT

2. LSD

3. 4-HO-DMT

^Glad to hear it hey_papi.  It's really weird you didn't feel anything at 15mg but all's well that ends well I guess. 


In addition to the stuff I brought up before that was left out in foil that turned a definite grey color, even the stuff that was stored in an amber bottle in a freezer has a slight grey tint now that it didn't have fresh.  No loss in potency observed, but I transferred it to the smallest container I could and threw one of those oxygen-absorbing packets you might find in some herbal bottles in the bag alongside the vial.  I'd really like this stuff to last!

the vialed psilocin has remained very pure white for a few months now (its in a freezer in a safe location).

I have a newly found supplier of this, as well as many other tryptamines, and I must say I love this compound greatly. It is essentially a really amazing mushroom trip (as any), but with no nausea or any uneasy, weird feelings. For this reason I believe that the other alkaloids present in them (baeocystin and norbaeocystin) cause such feelings.

Effects for me set in at around the hour point, starting with light waves of euphoria. Visual morphing shortly follows, and both greatly increase throughout the experience. Total duration is roughly 6 hours, no afterglow, great sleep. 

One of my current favourites, the euphoria of mushrooms blows my mind. Honestly it is a million times better than pure MDMA for me, however very similar in the sense that my eyes get the rolls and the euphoria has many shared traits.

Hey dondante, can you expound on this statement? I am under the impression that psilocin is VERY potent IV. I was actually planning on exploring this route sometime, since it supposedly produces a trip close to the 'DMT flash.'


Can you list your dosage and your findings?


(sorry if I missed it)


peace,

Xorkoth, I've noticed your descriptions of alot of substances are quite like the effects I experience.  That being said 4-ho-dmt is my favorite, but my only vendor that once had it no longer carrys it. I really like the euphoric, mdma type state you get from snorting small amounts.  I've been looking for a substitute, I have 4-aco-dmt and it doesn't have the good energy that I get from 4-ho-dmt. 4-ho-mipt makes my thinking feel cloudy. I'm thinking of trying 4-ho-met and 4-ho-det as substitutes.  Can Xorkoth or anyone else suggest another trypt. that is closest in its feel to 4-ho-dmt?

I find oral 4-ho-DMT trips to be like a faster and more manic 4-AcO-DMT trip.  If you're accustom to the onset of snorting 4-ho, you might try IMing the 4-AcO to see if you can recapture some of what you're looking for through a speedier ROA of a "slower" version of 4-ho. Might as well try it before buying something else, since finding something closer to the 4-ho than 4-AcO seems unlikely. Personally, I find 4-AcO significantly more euphoric and MDMA-like, but less manic, than the 4-ho. Even though we differ in that respect, I do find that taking 4-AcO IM definitely sharpens it's teeth and gives it more of 4-ho's character.

No I haven't.  I suspect it would be something like smoked DMT from the IV 4-AcO-DMT reports.  I don't get that much out of smoked DMT beyond a rocket ride, so I haven't really felt the desire.  The 4-AcO-DMT IV reports had me interested for awhile though because as I recall they involved narrative visions. I'm sure I will try it at some point, though, simply because there's not much on it. But I'm just as sure you'll beat me to it. 


Yeah, the trip report ain't short. But as with most trips I'll bother with writing a full TR about, a lot of new and unusual things happened that I felt were all worth mentioning.

4-AcO-DMT is going to be the closest.  4-HO-MiPT can be like psilocin also, for some people.  I haven't explored that one much though.

Thanks for the feedback.  I've just found that the energy/body-buzz and over all good mood that 5-8mg insufflated gives is better than anything else I've tried.  It almost works as an antidepressant/empathogen  on me in low doses much like mdma. I get a very nice energetic tingling in my body that seems like it starts from my heart chakra.  In high doses orally it is on par with even the best cid. Everyone who who has had the opportunity to taste this classic should be grateful to their supplier.   The only supplier that I know of that has ever had 4-ho-dmt quit carrying it last summer.  I'm not asking for vendor info, I just want to know if it is still available?  If it is, I will just look for another vendor rather than a replacement for my favorite entheogen.   Thanks....

I almost said the same thing.  But willkell420 is looking for small dose 4-ho euphoria.  If you're looking for a mild energetic euphoria and 4-AcO-DMT doesn't work for you, willkell420, I'd say low dose aMT is an economically viable substitute--even if it really isn't much like 4-ho. You might also try 4-AcO-DMT with an MAOI, just to tweak the qualitative effects slightly to see if by chance they're more in line with what you're looking for.

Thanks again everyone, but I think I've found my answer!!!  I don't know if anyone else will agree, but 4-aco-det is almost identical in its effects to 4-ho-dmt.  My girlfriend and I both tried it out last night at 20mg each.  She swallowed hers, I insufflated mine.  It didn't burn and I felt it in 5 minutes.  Body buzz felt Identical to insufflated 4-ho-dmt in my opinion.  And besides slightly less visuals my girlfriend couldn't tell the two apart.  I also like the fact that Hoffman made it as the next step in 4-ho-dmt experimentation.  Anyone else's opinions would be welcomed.  I will post a better report under the appropriate thread later, after some well needed rest.  Peace.....

i'm planning on trying this compound but i am slightly hesitant bc i did not like my one and only experience with psilocybe mushrooms (i attribute my bad experience to set and setting but still, i cannot overcome my anxiety regarding the body load and muscle tension).  i've read the entire thread along with some trip reports and it seems the results are mixed, some report terrifying ego-shattering experiences (i'll be in a public place with close friends however it is not an ideal place to have a bad trip by any means) and some report pleasant experiences.  my main concern is severe body load, going into a bad trip and nausea/vomiting.  i will have cannabis on-hand to combat any nausea but i would really like to try the compound on its own first.  


the single dose i have is 15mg, it was given to me about 2 years ago but has been stored properly.  i haven't taken it out of my fun box for the last year or so (i've exposed it to regular 60W light while taking out other things but it has been for no more than 1 min, max.  it hasn't ever been exposed to heat or moisture) so i'm guessing the potency has degraded very little, if at all.  


brothers and sisters, i need any experiences or info you have with a 15mg dose compared with LSD, 2c-b, ketamine and MDMA (i am most experienced with these substances).  thank youuu ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

some guy I know says he has acquired some psilocin that is being used in a study out at Uni of AZ... from all of my research though, it seems they are actually using psilocybin. He says a dose range should be 10-12mg... and that he took it up to 20 and it was almost TOO intense... and this is a guy who usually eats 7g of shrooms. I'm assuming whatever it is the HCl salt... thus making it more potent by mass. I can't rightly figure out which one it is... Is there any real way to tell past GC/MS or NMR? Anyone have any more info on this or the studies being done or done recently out in AZ?


EDIT: I'd also like to mention that he said he comes up in about 20 minutes... making me think it is more likely psilocin... I just don't know of any studies using it. Then again, his source may be bullshitting and ordered it back before this last summer from a common chinese supplier...

^As you seem to suspect, the story is very unlikely.  


A schedule I controlled substance would never make it out of a legitimate research lab in sufficient quantities to be sold on the street...diverting a single dose of psilocybin would be near impossible, not to mention risky, for the select few with access.  The DEA requires reporting of every milligram used.  If a few grams went missing, you likely would have read about it in the newspaper.  Maybe he was just making a general statement about psilocybin being used in legitimate research, but in that case, the John's Hopkins study is far more interesting than clinical trials for obsessive-compulsive disorder IMHO.  


Also, the dose range and description does sound like psilocin.

That was what I was thinking... but supposedly the study is for PTSD treatment... and after taking way too much he sold him his supply of ~500mg. Interesting story, but I assumed fictitious.


Thanks for the help.


I look forward to sampling this 4-ho-dmt. I asked about a few custom synths for it from some popular chinese vendors a couple of years back... they said they would consider supplying it bulk in the future... then when they do supply it, I'm broke as hell and unemployed for several months. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

I'll definitely be starting low at around 10-12mg... but I've never experienced ego death from any tryptamine (I suppose with the exception of LSD... but generally it's more egomania)... My one experience with DMT was sub-breakthrough... so I definitely look forward to a tryptamine ego death in the future when it comes time to be necessary.


Sometimes I truly need something to shatter my ego to remind me to quit getting caught up in the game and focus on the truth.

DPT is quite effective at shattering egos

(and i hear it goes great with k, which is what im saving the rest of mine for, or maybe an aMT combo, but id also like to get smacked around by a tryptamine sometime)

Yeah... I've heard this as well and hope to get some DPT on the way... I also am interested in aMT... I've gone through a lot of the phenethylamines and am just now starting to branch out to the other side of the coin.

Just thought I'd mention that I posted a trip report with 4HO-DMT yesterday:

Reminded me why this is one of my favorite materials.

I got some psilocin freebase, but unfortunately I did not have access to cold storage and now it is degraded. At this point, I have some powder that has turned to a brownish sticky resin and some psilocin that I've dissolved into vodka with an equimolar amount of ascorbic acid. It doesn't seem to have done much good. I took some of the vodka solution about a week after making it and about 1.5 times the previous dose (that I took right before making the solution) had the same effect (about 25mg for a +2 experience).


Do you think the sticky resin might have retained more potency than the solution? It was kept at room temperature for about two months now, and part of it was made into the vodka solution about ten days ago.

I'm also curious about the stability of freebase psilocin, since I recently acquired a half gram. I'm planning to store it in an amber glass vial with some desiccant in a piece of paper towel, inside a mason jar filled with more desiccant, in the freezer. Do you think it would still degrade? Might I be better off trying to convert it to the fumarate salt as described for DMT in [this tek](https://mycotopia.net/forums/botanicals/44153-new-dmt-extraction-techniques-fasa-method-dmt-fumarate.html)?


If it doesn't degrade, I'm going to try to write up a comparative 4-HO-DMT/MET/DET/MiPT/DiPT trip report this winter ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Had luck in dreams with simple extraction of 4-aco to hydrolyzed 4-ho-xxx, thread here in advanced discussion under thread "4-aco-dmt-hydrosysis into psilocin" hypothetically took less than 10 minutes.

Amazing material, enjoy it much more than 4-aco-dmt in dreams.

Important update: the dilute acid catalyzed hydrolysis of 4-aco-dmt to 4-ho-dmt (psilocin) works much better than naoh catalyzed hydrolysis as none of the psilocin is oxidized or destroyed, as psilocin is unstable in alkaline or basic conditions:

I just tried 12mg of synthetic 4-HO-DMT freebase. This compound is amazing. I was gone for a solid six hours, had a really revelatory trip, some personal insights, and a great bonding experience with my girlfriend. I also had some interesting, but benign, delusions. I'm glad I didn't start with a higher dose. Took it concurrently with anenolol, a beta blocker.


I'm not entirely sure that I could tell the difference between this stuff and 4-AcO-DMT in a blind taste test, but I don't really have a lot of experience with either.

Totally agree, have tried 10mg of 4-ho-dmt twice allready, it is my favorite psychedelic right along with mescaline, mescaline for a long trip, and 4-ho-dmt for a shorter trip.


...the effects are incredible, psilocin is so different from 4-aco-dmt it's not even funny, it's not sedating, no nausea, no loss of muscular control, but up-lifting, and the most visual psychedelic i've ever tried, it has a very strong comeup just like mushrooms and the very subtle mushroom carrier wave is present the whole time. 4-ho-dmt descriptions by Shulgin are very accurate and right on the money, amazing stuff. CEV's are ever-changing other-worldly scenes and patterns, i found it more visual than ayahuasca, i was able to move around freely and even go outside and admire nature, some of what i saw outside looked nearly like extraterrestial shrines, nature and psilocybin go together so well. Everything was much brigther and colorful than normal, so very colorful. The walls inside changed to every hue of color, greens, reds, pinks, purples and blues, over and over, beautiful. I had tried a 2nd dosage of the stuff (again 10mg) from the freezer and it again had the same effects, and comes on quickly on an empty stomach (about 25 to 30 minutes), especially if you swish some of it around in the mouth, it lasts a good 4 hours.

You thought so? I wasn't totally sure.


I had a different experience on psilocin than I did on psilacetin, but I took them in different contexts, and at different times in my life. They're certainly more similar than, for instance, 2C-B and psilocin. I think I'd have to have a lot more experience than just a handful of trips to be able to say with any degree of certainty that I could tell them apart, though.

I find the difference reflects the usual pattern with 4-sub tryptamine AcO and ho versions: qualitatively the ho is a bit more serious and white knuckle; the AcO is smoother and more euphoric. When injected intramuscularly the duration difference is pretty radical. For me, at around 8 mg the ho lasts barely over 90 minutes whereas the AcO is still going at 4 1/2 with 12 mg (with those doses broadly comparable in terms of general intensity). IM AcO gets qualitatively pretty close to oral ho IMO.

How is this as a rave drug? Any social anxiety or things like that? (in other words how social is this?)

Really? You're not talking about shrooms right? Sure it's not 4-aco-dmt and they are calling it 4-ho-dmt?

Phens are more suitable for a rave. This is more of a spiritual kind of drug like mushrooms - not very social.

Considering psilocin (4-HO-DMT, the title compound) is illegal in most places I really doubt that the availability is as big as you say. Granted I have not updated my chem sources for like years, but online sources that sell illegal compounds are pretty dubious.


I was lucky enough to be gifted some of this compound (synthetic psilocin) and after storing it properly in a freezer it still appears fine but I hope it has not degraded despite the appearance. I have every intention of taking it very soon. But I am not sure how much and if I can handle the commitment of a full trip on this stuff.


Also I am not sure about the ROA, maybe I want to IM it to make it more economical but then again that probably makes it an entirely different animal with even much more intensity to commit to.

I've been vaporizing 4-HO-DMT and I've found it a worthwhile ROA. I'm surprised this route is so unexplored for 4-X-tryptamines. It offers a shorter (about half) trip with enhanced visuals and muted emotional and psychological effects. A party version of an oral trip. Psilocin is a pretty transparent material even orally, compared to others in its class, but vaporized it is almost like DMT in that I feel more sober than intoxicated. All in all I would say it is much like a low dose smoked DMT + moclobemide trip but with a touch of deeper psychedelia in the introspective and spiritual sense and without the enhanced reality feeling I find unique to DMT.


I think it would be interesting to explore this ROA with other 4-X-tryptamines, if I manage to convert them to freebase. It is very understandable that they are sold as salts, since the freebase degrades very quickly (in 2-3 weeks at RT).

LOL, only now I realize that this was the 4-HO-DMT thread instead of the 4-HO-MET thread, which was the one I was looking for. Maybe I need a little break from psychs.. (at the very least some reading glasses)


And maybe your text doesn't really do the vaped experience justice, but I guess there's a certain expectation some people have with vaping psychedelics so it's not that strange people would rather try oral with such a rare chemical (Synthetic/pure, that is. I'm sure there are tons of alkaloid extracts out there)

I just have to chime in here that I too LOVE psilocin, far more than mushrooms or 4-AcO-DMT.  Dare I say I enjoy it as much as DMT...either orally @ 7-15mg or IMed @ 10mg.  Psilocin has to be the cleanest clearest psychedelic there is.  God's own psychedelic.

Right?!? I tried synthetic 4-HO-DMT and loved it while I never really liked mushrooms or 4-AcO-DMT, could never find a proper level but 10mgs of synth 4-HO-DMT was a superbly grand time. To bad I don't have more currently!

Update summer 2014:


Success converting 4-aco-dmt fumarate to 4-ho-dmt freebase in dreams, please see the thread in the archives entitled "4-aco-dmt hydroxysis into psilocin?" started by yoyoman:


4-ho-dmt is a far better psychedelic than 4-aco-dmt imho, it is the "perfect key" that fits the receptor, unlike the un-natural 4-aco-dmt pale imitation of it.

Yeah 4-HO-DMT is light years ahead of 4-AcO-DMT... it's a much more direct and serious psychedelic though.  The effects are very, very different for me.  The one time I had pure 4-HO-DMT it sent me straight into an ego death loop, it was a challenging but revealing trip.

Thanks Xorkoth, I've read and re-read all your posts about the comparisons of 4-aco-dmt to 4-ho-dmt and I completely agree. The 4-aco-dmt knocks me out (makes me pass out at high doses) and makes me drowsy at low doses as well, I even find my breathing shallow at time on the compound, it's not very visual to me, and is dark and sedating compared to the stimulating, enchanting, and very visual nature of 4-ho-dmt, I find it very similar to pan cyan mushrooms which are about 60% psilocin, 20% psilocybin, and 0.002% of the funky and bad feeling/paranoid thought confusion causing baeocystin and norbaeocystin. On my last trip of converted to 4-ho-dmt I had a 3 hour trip with 2 hours of CEV's brightly colored that revealed religious temples and I was taken on a tour of old civilizations (mayan and aztec), inside the Mayan architecture I viewed artifacts that were brightly lit up, it was like walking thru an art exhibit or museum, it was brethtaking, my ego is always challenged a bit for the 1st 15 minutes or so of the trip, but then it mellows out to a highly visual journey, sounds are quite hallucinatory as well.

I find it fascinating how different pure 4-HO-DMT is than your average mushrooms.  To me it kills the theory that psilocybin is simply a prodrug of psilocin without any unique effects, or that in general the other alkaloids in mushrooms do not provide much to the experience.  I am 100% confident I could tell 4-HO-DMT, 4-AcO-DMT (especially those 2) and mushrooms apart is a double-blind study.


4-AcO-DMT does make me drowsy but its biggest identifying quality is that it feels just like an oral version of smoked DMT to me, same buzzing frequency, same type of visuals (but much less intense) and same scattered/cloudy thought process.  And it lasts at least an hour less time than 4-HO-DMT for me, and a couple of hours less than mushrooms (which themselves seem to last more time than 4-HO-DMT).

To me, 4-ho-dmt feels the most like Pan Cyan mushrooms which are supposed to be around 60% psilocin, 20% psilocybin and only 0.002% baeocystin/norbaeo, such a smooth crystal clear ride and very visual, with none of the anxiety, confusion or paranoid though loops of cubensis which I don't like. 


I was amazed of the "refreshed feeling" that psilocin leaves for several days after that trip day I had, it was a 100% complete relief from depression, the best I had ever felt in years, I had never felt so "together and re-vived w/lots of energy" as I had two days after I had the amazing psilocin trip.


For the first time in years, I said "good morning" to co-workers at work and generally had no problem talking to people I normally could not stand, it was so unlike myself. Very bizarre.

How does one find pure 4-HO-DMT? Extractions don't sound viable

Had to grab it years ago when it was available as an RC I reckon (I also missed that boat)

I got it as a thank you from someone I did some kind of favor regarding some psychedelic he was looking for. Also got synthetic mesc and DOM from him i believe! That was years ago, he was already sort of retiring as a tripper back then iirc.


There was an underground japanese or chinese RC vendor years ago who offered all these kinds of rare ones, but he's been gone for a long time, I just missed my chance to order, and anyway I usually don't have the money to place interesting orders. Considering how poor I have been for many years (i get support though and am also pretty frugal so I can't complain about the luxury in general) it's probably ridiculous what I invested in my psychedelic collection over the years. One special opportunity at a time.


Sourcy stuff is not proper discussion material, but I figure there is a statute of limitations on shit that went on a decade ago.


Anyway, maybe they should start selling 1P-4-HO-DMT.

I think the psilocin came from a different chap than gave us the mescaline and dom goodie bags.

Would that work?  Does it even make sense chemically?

Going only on self-taught chemistry knowing, I'd guess it would work at least as well as 4-AcO-DMT.

I was lucky to be able to sample pure synthetic psilocin.  It differs from mushrooms substantially.  Very quick, very to the point.  I had a pretty messy yet glorious ego death from plugging ~20mg.
