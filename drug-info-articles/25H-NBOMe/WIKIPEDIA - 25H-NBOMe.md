# 25H-NBOMe
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25H-NBOMe*

25H-NBOMe, also known as NBOMe-2C-H, is a derivative of the phenethylamine hallucinogen 2C-H, which acts as a highly potent full agonist for the human 5-HT2A receptor.

## Use and effects

The active dose range of 25H-NBOMe in humans has not been reported and hence is unknown. This is in notable contrast to many other NBOMe drugs.

## Toxicity and harm potential

### Emergency treatment

### Pharmacodynamics

25H-NBOMe acts as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors.
Its affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (Ki = 2.83 nM) was 133-fold higher than that of 2C-H and 24-fold higher than that of 25H-NB (N-benzyl-2C-H), whereas it was 4-fold lower than that of 2C-I and 64-fold lower than that of 25I-NBOMe. In terms of activational potency at the receptor, the drug's potency (EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration = 15.3 nM) was 67-fold higher than that of 2C-H, whereas it was 6-fold lower than that of 2C-I and 35-fold lower than that of 25I-NBOMe. Hence, unlike other NBOMe drugs, 25H-NBOMe appears to have affinity and activational potency at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor more in line with the 2C psychedelics like 2C-I and much lower than NBOMe drugs like 25I-NBOMe.
25H-NBOMe produces hyperlocomotion, a stimulant-like effect, and the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents. Its potency in inducing the head-twitch response was variably lower than that of other NBOMe drugs like 25I-NBOMe and 25B-NBOMe. Conversely, its potency in inducing hyperlocomotion was about the same as that of 25I-NBOMe and 25C-NBOMe. The drug has also been found to produce antidepressant-like effects in rodents. 25H-NBOMe has shown reinforcing effects in rodents. This included conditioned place preference (CPP) and self-administration.

## History

25H-NBOMe was first described in the scientific literature by Ralf Heim at the Free University of Berlin by 2003.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Sweden

The Riksdag added 25H-NBOMe to Narcotic Drugs Punishments Act under swedish schedule I ("substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use") as of August 1, 2013, published by Medical Products Agency (MPA) in regulation LVFS 2013:15 listed as 25H-NBOMe, and 2-(2,5-dimetoxifenyl)-N-(2-metoxibensyl)etanamin.

#### United Kingdom

This substance is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom as a result of the N-benzylphenethylamine catch-all clause in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.
