## Subjective Experience

Although it isn’t saying a lot, this experiment entailed one of the most convoluted
preparations I have ever performed. It was a glorious failure.

I had created the decoction by mixing the material with water in a jar, placing it in
the sun, maintaining it at the appropriate temperature, and tending it regularly and
carefully.

The next day, when I eventually drank it: absolutely nothing.

To be fair, I knew the risks. Field reports of success are very few and far between, and
its psychoactivity is disputed. However, the temptation of a unique form of
psychedelic experience, including auditory hallucinations, proved too much for me,
and I went for it.

Notwithstanding this, sinicuichi is documented in Plants of the Gods, including
reference to its indigenous use, so I may well have missed a trick.
