## GUIDE            

                    How to test for Fentanyl?

**How to test for Fentanyl (fent):** if you intend to use a psychoactive substance first you need a test kit to check purity. Fentanyl can be deadly in doses invisible to human eye and can’t be identified by appearance. Check your sample with [fentanyl test strip (fentanyl test kit)](/how-to-test-fentanyl/).

### Fentanyl tester

### Recommended fentanyl testing kit

Fentanyl assay test kit consists of test strips for fentanyl. Fentanyl test kit is best for detecting fentanyl and derrivatives in any sample.

### What is fentanyl?

Fentanyl is an extremely potent synthetic opioid with derivatives often from 50 to 100 times stronger than heroin. It is mainly responsible for the opioid epidemic overdoses. Fentanyl can be lethal even in doses invisible to a bare eye. It is often found in counterfeit medicine, opioid and non-opioid research chemicals or even common street drugs like cocaine. When fentanyl is mixed with heroin, cocaine or other substances, it is **never** evenly mixed. Powder on one side of a baggy can contain no fentanyl, while powder from the other side might contain a lethal dose. It is extremely important to always test each and every dose intended for consumption.

### HOW TO TEST A PILL FOR FENTANYL

If testing a benzo/opioid pill, crush one in a plastic baggie and dump out the powder.  Then add 10 drops of water into the baggie and mix well. Dip the test strip no higher than the thick line. Wait 15 seconds. Put the strip away and check in 5 minutes.

### HOW TO TEST POWDER FOR FENTANYL

Mix 100 mg of sample in 200 ml of water. Dip the test strip no higher than the thick line. Wait 15 seconds. Put the strip away and check in 5 minutes.

**COMPARE RESULTS**

1 line = fentanyl, 2 lines = no fentanyl. Faint lines also count. Ignore fentanyl tester results after 5 minutes.

To detect all ingredients and estimate their amount pair reagents with a TLC purity test kit.

### Questions?

- What is a Fentanyl Test Strip? 
 .accordion-title 

Fentanyl Test Strip is an immunoassay testing tool with antibodies sensitive enough to detect fentanyl and many derrivatives at concentrations over 10 ng/ml, sufficient to rule out dangerous amounts. Pairing fent strips with reagent testing is required to detect adulterants and increase analysis precision.
Reagent tests and test strips can indicate PRESENCE, but not QUANTITY. Mixtures can be detected with reagents only in case of fentanyl test strips or if adulterant causes a darker reagent test color change than the expected substance. To detect all ingredients and estimate their amount pair reagents with a TLC purity test kit.

- How sensitive are Fentanyl Test Strips? 
 .accordion-title 

Fentanyl Test Strips that we offer have been independently verified to be the best in detecting trace amounts of fentanyl:

10 ng/ml – Fentanyl
100 ng/ml – 3-Fluorofentanyl, 4-Fluorofentanyl, 4-Fluorobutyrfentanyl, 4-Fluorocyclopropylbenzylfentanyl, 4-Fluoroisobutyrfentanyl, Acetylfentanyl, Acrylfentanyl, Butyrfentanyl, Crotonylfentanyl, Cyclopropylfentanyl, Furanylbenzylfentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, Methoxyacetylfentanyl, Tetrahydrofuranylfentanyl
250 ng/ml – Carfentanil (verified by Energy Control)
1000 ng/ml – 3-Methylcrotonylfentanyl, 4-Chloroisobutyrfentanyl, cis-3-Methylfentanyl
Not measured – Benzoylfentanyl, Thiophenefentanyl (verified by PRO Test)

- Are there any possible false positives? 
 .accordion-title 

Yes, in two cases:

You need to follow recommended sample dilution (100 mg / 200 ml) to avoid false positives with most stimulant drugs. Fentanyl test strips are extremely sensitive.
Vitamine C causes false positives – so you can not test cooker residue. The tradeoff here is that our brand of fentanyl testers has been independently proven do detect the biggest number of fentanyl analogs.

- What is included with Fentanyl Test Strip? 
 .accordion-title 

The Fentanyl Test Strip comes in a hermetically sealed disposable pouch with silica gel packet inside. Instructions included.

- What is each kind of test for? 
 .accordion-title 

Cannabis (4-AP) – main test for THC / CBD, helps rule out synthetic cannabinoids
Ehrlich – main test for all indoles, e.g. lysergamides and tryptamines but also 5-HTP and more, secondary test for cocaine
Hofmann – main test for lysergamides and tryptamines, more precise but slower than Ehrlich
Froehde – main test for most powders, secondary test for ketamine and amphetamines, long shelf life
Liebermann – main test for most powders, secondary test for cocaine (detects levamisole)
Marquis – main test for most powders, secondary test for ketamine, mephedrone and psychedelics
Mecke – main test for most powders, secondary test for cocaine, ketamine and mephedrone
Morris – main test for cathinones, cocaine and ketamine, can tell apart some novel dissociatives
Robadope – main test for primary amines, e.g. MDA, amphetamine or PMA
Simon – main test for secondary amines, e.g. MDMA, meth, mephedrone, methylone or PMMA
Zimmermann / Beam – main test for cathinones and benzodiazepines in geneal, detects also CBD

Fentanyl Test Strip to detect fentanyl, even if it is mixed in another substance.
Reagents can indicate PRESENCE, but not QUANTITY. Adulterants can be detected with reagents only if they cause a darker color change than the expected substance. To detect all ingredients and estimate their amount pair reagents with a TLC purity test kit.

METHOD 1   
If testing a benzo/opioid pill, crush one in a plastic baggie and dump out the powder.  Then add 10 drops of water into the baggie and mix well. Dip the test strip no higher than the thick line. Wait 15 seconds. Put the strip away and check in 5 minutes.
METHOD 2
Mix 100 mg of sample in 200 ml of water. Dip the test strip no higher than the thick line. Wait 15 seconds. Put the strip away and check in 5 minutes.
To test weed for fentanyl (or any other herbal sample) proceed the same.
COMPARE RESULTS
1 line = fentanyl, 2 lines = no fentanyl. Faint lines also count. Ignore fentanyl tester results after 5 minutes.

Pair reagents with a TLC purity test kit and fent strips. TLC allows you to discover full number of ingredients and estimate their amount, however still requires reagent tests to identify detected compounds. To detect even trace amounts of fentanyl use fent strips.
Primary TLC Testing Liquid – alkaloids, caffeine, phenetylamines (amphetamine, MDMA, 2C-B, etc.), indolamines (LSD, DMT, etc.), ketamine, tryptamines, opiates and more. Included in TLC kits for amphetamine, methamphetamine, ketamine, MDMA and Full.

To test amphetamine purity use TLC Amphetamine Purity Test Kit (% ruler not included)
To test methamphetamine purity use TLC Methamphetamine Purity Test Kit (% ruler not included)
To test ketamine purity use TLC Ketamine Purity Test Kit (% ruler not included)
To test MDMA purity use TLC MDMA Purity Test Kit (MDMA % ruler  included).

**TLC Testing Liquid for Cocaine **– cocaine, caffeine, ketamine, levamisole, lidocaine, procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, acetaminophen and more. Included in the TLC kit for cocaine.

To test cocaine purity use TLC Cocaine Purity Test Kit (cocaine % ruler included). 

**TLC Testing Liquid for Cannabinoids  **– for testing all natural cannabinoids and cannabis products. Included in TLC kit for cannabinoids.

To test complete cannabinoids spectrum use TLC Cannabinoids Test Kit (THC and CBD % rulers included).

**A positive or negative test result does not indicate if a substance is safe. No substance is 100% safe.**

** sample that tested negative might still contain a lethal dose of fentanyl or other synthetic opioids.**
