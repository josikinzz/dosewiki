**Welcome to the Big & Dandy 3C-P Thread**


![200px-3C-P_2d-skeletal.svg.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2Fb%2Fb6%2F3C-P_2d-skeletal.svg%2F200px-3C-P_2d-skeletal.svg.png&hash=fc84bc44d99da1e2063dbd5808314148)


*1-(3,5-dimethoxy-4-propoxyphenyl)propan-2-amine*


**Note:** 3C-P is **not** the 3C (amphetamine) analogue of 2C-P. Instead it is the amphetamine analogue of proscaline which is coded by "P".

Proscaline is the 4-propyl (4-propoxy actually) homologue of mescaline, compare below:

Original post:


Has anyone tried 3C-P (3,5-dimethoxy-4-(n)-propoxy-Amphetamine)?


Shulgin claims ([in PIHKAL #140 P](http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal140.shtml)) it is probably a psychadelic and active in the 20-40mg range.


I'm interested in the effects of it.

there is precious little known about this chem 


i  heard rumor of some intrepid psychonaut having tested the material several times and found a threshold dose to be ~8mg and i have read other reports of people taking 50mg and tripping for 12 hours.  pihkal sets a range of 30-60mg for proscalin but other then that almost no information exist about this one.

yes, that 30-60mg is for proscalin, 3c-p was untasted, not even synthesized in pihkal.

The eagle has landed![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png). I usually don't write reports, cause I'm not good at it, but since so little is known about this compound I'll write one within a week or so. Keep an eye out in TR.

By the way, what's eveyones thoughts on Shulgins speculated dose range for this one? 20-40mg? IDK about that. I'm a little nervous about this obscure substance, and I think starting at 5mg and working ones way up would be a good idea. Comments? Suggestions?

presonally, I think 5mg is spot on for a first dose. You can always take more next time.

LOL, I'm not dead. I tried 5mg one night and got no effects, maybe some slight stimulation. I haven't tried a higher dose yet, because I temporarily lost access to my scale. It's still next on my to-do list, and don't worry, I will post a trip report as soon as I get around to it. Sorry for keeping you guys in the dark for so long,  I've been busy. I just got back from a trip to upstate NY.

again, sorry to be vague, but i've heard that 20mg is pretty mild. i have no first hand knowledge, but a third person who has experience with this material said they would go higher then 20mg also. please note; this is far from absolute science here, its just a second hand rumor, take it for what its worth.

Well, I've been getting mixed up with MDxx substances  alot lately (along with (meth)amphetamines), and my body has taken a real beating and I've  been sick. I'm taking a break from phenethylamines, especially amphetamine based ones. So this experiment is on hold until my health improves.

update: i have just heard about a 40mg trial.  the subject lived to tell about it, described it as mostly a physical high, and said they would do it again, possibly even at a higher dose.  warning: this is all second hand rumor and should be taken at face value with several grains of salt.  %)

I really want to start experimenting with this,  but I've been having some problems with my blood pressure and amphetamines (of any kind) are on my not-to-do list. My expectations  for this substance are not too high though.

fine.... here's some info + negatives. the experience seems to last around 16+hrs. the high only lasts say 4, but there is a slight glow that extends for 12+ which makes sleep wholly impossible. Nothing will get you to sleep either, possibly benzos (which i lack) but everything else under the sun failed. this substance leaves you  quite drained. its effects are very speedy without any perceptual distortions at all, basically body + mind stimulation. didn't find it all that profound. one feels totally wiped for hours and hours. dosage looks to vary wildly person to person. 30mg is +3 for some 40mg for others, perhaps 25 for others?


Another note. the dangers on this substance seem apparent, others have reported crazy intensification of other substances for days afterwards, negative physiological reactions, fatigue, insomnia, etc. Since the potential for harm (without apparent benefits) is so high, this one should probably be left alone.


The mental stimulation is discombobulating in the way some psychedelics are, but lacking in the world-expanding quality of thought. Music was augmented, and it wasn't like meth or anything, but had more of a neutral feel to it. People who like this would prolly not seek it out for its mental qualities, though i couldn't forsee any great usage of this with its long and unpleasant "hangover"

philosophicus, could you elaborate on the "long and unpleasant hangover". I'm still holding off on this substance. I actually haven't done any "research" at all in  nearly 4  months. 


This stuff  has been available for a pretty long time now and still I've only seen/heard a handfull of vague  reports. The only thing that's really  holding me back is the  lack of info  on dosage.

On dosage I only have three things to offer. For me 30mg orally produced a solid +3 euphoric period for 3hours-ish, and then a +2 psychedelic amphetamine feeling for another 12+ hours.  Hangover is a bad term, I guess I meant that being only just above baseline but unable to sleep (and kind of tired) is pretty annoying. 


Another person I know took 45mg, he thought the initial period was more like a phenethylamine experience but was substantially more ehausted than i was for 12hours, and basically lay in bed all day. He has substantially more of a tolerance than I do in general. 


I tried experimenting with it by smoking it in its HCL form (or i assume thats what it comes in).  At 20mg a mild +2 was had with similar duration, perhaps 2 hours shorter. There wasn't the rushing of oral ingestion for whatever reason. Either way duration wasn't decreased which was the goal.


As for dose I think somewhere in the 20-30mg range would be a safe bet. I think someday when I have lots of time on my hands I will take a higher dose to see if it manifests psychedelic effects and the long period becomes more interesting. I kind of doubt it... which is why I am in no rush to do so.

Out of curiosity are there any other 3C-x chemicals that are known/suspected to be active?

3C-P isn't in PIHKAL, although the phenethylamine homologue of it is, P. About 3C-P Shulgin only says 


> The amphetamine homologue of proscaline, 3,5-dimethoxy-4-(n)-propoxy-amphetamine is an unexplored compound. Its synthesis could not be achieved in parallel to the description given for P. Rather, the propylation of syringaldehyde to give 3,5-dimethoxy-4-(n)-propoxybenzaldehyde, followed by coupling with nitroethane and the reduction of the formed nitrostyrene with lithium aluminum hydride would be the logical process. Following the reasoning given under E, the initials for this base would be 3C-P, and I would guess it would be active, and a psychedelic, in the 20 to 40 milligram range.

Off the top of my head I think there is 3C-E (ethoxy) and 3C-BZ (benzyloxy) in PIHKAL however.

Yeah, all the "3C"s are amphetamines, or **a**lpha-**m**ethyl**ph**en**et**hyl**amines**.  Amphetamines are alpha-methylated phenethylamines.  There are many fantastic "3C" psychedelics.


DOB, DOC, DOET, DOI, DOM, DON, DOPR (DOP), DOT, DOT-2, DOT-7, FLEA, the FLY series, Ganesha, G-3, MDA, MDMA, MMDA, MMDA-2, some of the TOMs and TOETs sound ok.  And I am sure I am missing a few.  All are 3Cs.


Basically Shulgin started his psychedelic research by trying to make mescaline more powerful.  He invented TMA.  TMA and mescaline are the same except TMA has a methyl group (which has three carbons) at its alpha position, while mescaline has two.  One could call TMA, "3C-mescaline."  Or one could call TMA, "2C-TMA."  Get it?  The 2C, 3C refers to how many carbons are at the alpha position.  The "2C" means two carbons at the alpha position, the "3C" means it has three carbons at the alpha.


Now as I was saying, Shulgin started his research with amphetamines (three carbons and the amine group) and made a bunch such as DOB, DOC, DOI, DOT, etc.  Then later he decided to work on the phenethylamine "versions" of these materials.  Amphetamines are phenethylamines with an extra carbon at the alpha...phenethylamines have a total of two carbons and then the amine.


So the "two carbon" version of DOB is 2C-B.  The "two carbon" version of DOC is 2C-C.  The "two carbon" version of DOI is 2C-I.  The "three carbon" version of proscaline is 3C-P.  The "three carbon" version of escaline is 3C-E.  Etc, etc, etc.

As for the 2C-TMA thing.  Yes, it would be "bad english" because the A in TMA is for amphetamine.  Regardless, "2C" is what Shulgin came up with as a naming system for distinguishing phenethylamine "versions" of his DO*x* series from that series.  2C-TMA doesn't make any sense.  But neither does 2C unless you know what it is refering to.  2C could mean anything.  There is no scientific rules that demands they be called 2Cs.  Shulgin made it up for his own convienence.


As for the rest, you sure solved a big issue for me.  Thank you.  So the 2C, 3C does not refer to how many carbons are at the alpha position, but rather how many carbons are on the amine chain (side chain), correct?  Because I was looking at erowid's chem compare after I made the post and noticed that mescaline had only one carbon at the alpha, while TMA had two.  Which really got me confused.


One should never assume anything, but you can see why I would.  All the attention about the extra carbon at the alpha. One could think that 2C, 3C could refer to the carbons at the alpha, not the whole chain.  But like I said, later I was looking at the 3D versions and suddenly what I thought didn't make much sense because I was seeing amphetamines with only 2 carbons at the alpha.  Thank you for clearing up my misconception.


Before I said I was 99,9% right of the time as far as basic psychedelic questions.  Now I will be 100% right all the time!  ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

> The 2C naming system isn't something kids learn along with nomenclature in their organic classes, but that doesn't mean it's open to interpretation.  "2C" could mean "anything" in the same way that the term "psychedelic" could mean "anything" to a four-year-old.   There are specific criteria for which the term was derived-- once you step outside the bounds of those criteria, the term is no longer applicable... unless you'd call cocaine a "non-mind-manifesting psychedelic."  Shulgin specifically defines the 2C series by stating, "If a drug has been initially developed (and initially named) as an amphetamine derivative (three carbon chain) then the two-carbon chain analogue will use the original name (or a symbolic part of it) with the term 2C ahead of it."  That passage is from the entry for PIHKAL #72, escaline, in case you want confirmation on it.

I am aware the amphetamines are phenethylamines.  Hence why they are called alpha-methylphenethylamines.  And I am aware of the rest.  It was the fact that 2C, 3C refered to the amount of carbons on the whole amine chain, not just the alpha position that I was confused over.

In the interest of caution and warnings:


2 people took 40mg of 3c-p orally. It took a little bit to come on, perhaps an hour. Without a clock timing is only a guess. For perhaps 1-2hr a mild MDA-ish experience was had. At this time the feeling was neutral, no mental alterations of any significant intensity were had, though one had mild intestinal pains. After this period the GI disturbances got much worse for one, and the other developed a strange breath and throat constriction. This person described it as a tightness, barrier to deep breaths, an induced strange cough (not too often but unpleasant nonetheless), and general constriction of the breathing apparatus. That being said breathing and pulse were normal, but there was an experienced sense of contraction. Needless to say this was significantly worrying and the evening was spent taking it easy and monitoring the bodily state. The other person experienced no such effects but had quite unpleasant GI problems similar though less intense than 5-meo-dipt or 5-meo-amt. The worry and setting led to a feeling of uncomfortableness in this person, though it may have been the drug as well.


Phenomenological effects: At this dose, the whole character changed. THe empathic rushiness was absent (perhaps this was due to the setting distracting the bodies), but mild visuals were had. It felt like a speedy or twacky mild psychedelic feeling. No interesting emotive or cognitive enhancement was had. There is a slight analogy to AMT or DOB though it is a quite tenuous analogy. The speediness led to the desire to do something but not being content to do anything in particular, this was not pleasant.


The conclusions drawn are that in order to reach the proper intensity for a full psychedelic dose significant health risks would have to be endured. Repeating these experiments in my mind would be far to risky given the reactions of what few experiences we have, and without any cognitive or other benefits. Perhaps the only use for it would be in low doses as an enhancer for some other compound. In low doses it could add alertness, slight euphoria and empathy, but cross the threshold and you may find trouble. But again mixing compounds with this could prove dangerous if not lethal. This has demonstrated a danger about trail blazing in these regions. Comfort has been lost by the participants in pursuing such a path again, at least with psychedelic amphetamines. One thing I just remembered like DOB, 3c-p depleted blood sugar and energy to where one participant required food nearly every half hour. It seemed a fast metabolism was made startling fast, which led that participant to begin to wonder about his ability to use such compounds in the future.


In conclusion what little experience has been witnessed has led these folk to look with fear and caution upon this compound. What you do is your business but proceed with caution if at all.

One thing you guys forgot to include in your otherwise correct consensus definition are the nitpicky caveats that the carbon chain must be linear (otherwise things like beta-methyl whatever could also be considered 3C-class compounds), and that the amine must always be two carbons away from the aromatic ring (otherwise things like (substituted-phenyl)-3-propanamine could also be considered 3C-class compounds).  Not that these two little things really matter, as molecules with these alternative arrangements must certainly be inactive.

Yeah you are.  2C-P is a homologue of 2C-E....2C-P has a three-carbon chain at the 4, 2C-E has a two-carbon chain at the 4.  2C-P is 4-propyl-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine and 2C-E is 4-ethyl-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine.


3C-P is an homologue of mescaline and proscaline...it is 4-propoxy-3,5-dimethoxy-alpha-methylphenethylamine.

I know how you feel.  I love collecting reference compounds with alleged psychedelic properties.


I think my collection is the most precious thing I own as far as material possessions go.  The other day I thought I lost a vial of 5-MeO-DPT.  Here is a compound I have little desire to ever try, and it ruined my entire day when it went missing.   THankfully it turned up.

I registered just so I could post on this topic.  I did 3cp in 2002 or maybe 2003.  I was provided with 50 mg and told that it was an active dose. I asked the person what other people had said about it and he said that no one that he knew had tried it yet.  There was no more info forthcoming.  It was measured accurately.  I stashed it away.


I was a bit apprehensive so eyeballed it into two 25 mg piles and capped it. I was going hiking in the hills with girlfriend and dogs and had water also.  I dosed at the start. Now my memory is not as sharp as when I did it, bit was like lunch time when I did it.   I felt it, but it wasn't that great, kind of like 2ct2 at 10-15 mg for me.   I was having a good time but only remembered I did something when girlfriend asked how it was.  Got home about 5:00 and it was wearing off so I did the other cap and got 2 or 3 more hours out of it.  Didn't get any higher, just prolonged it.  If I had some again I would just do 50 mg.  I should say that I am typically a low doser, so take that as you will.  I experienced no body upset, no bowel stuff, heartbeat normal, everything was ok. I do remember it had a bit of an edge, but not bad. 


I think it comes down to set and setting with an unknown.  I was excited to try it and had a great day outdoors.  But with any rc that is unknown there is the potential expectation of a possibly bad trip that could easily be magnified.


However, as not many have done this, I could be totally wrong too. But I wanted to include my experience for what it is worth.


Peace and out

Thank you for adding that!  Well, outdoors in nature with the girlfriend is truely the best possible setting (take out the dog and its perfect for me).  I'd have thought 25mg would do more, but that's why life is a mystery.  It is good to hear it was mostly side-effect free.  You compared it with T2 which causes me significant bodyload and nausea.  Thanks again for posting!


Now why did he make 3C-P of all things!  Not Escaline, or Allylscaline!

No, 3C-P is 3,5-dimethoxy-4-propyloxy**amphetamine** and Proscaline is 3,5-Dimethoxy-4-(n)-Propoxy**phenethylamine. **


So similar, but 3C-P being an amphetamine with a **propyl**oxy group and Proscaline being a phenethylamine with a **prop**oxy group

propyloxy and propoxy is the same thing. look at the structures and the formulae.

Split up the "3c-p and 3c-e" thread that popped up, making a new B&D for 3C-E, and moving the 3C-P posts here. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


In other news, might try 40mg of this tonight ^^


Edit: 40mg down the hatch, let's see what this has to offer. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Just a note, I snorted a couple of mg left on the wrap, and am already experiencing mild visuals and altered headspace from that - also the burn was nowhere near that of 2Cs (though the amount I snorted was tiny). If this is the same (and same quality) 3C-P that others have reported having, with only minor visuals at 40mg, then maybe insufflation is a better route with this chemical considering how I got effects from so little.


Unfortunately I have none left to test that out, but we'll see how this trip goes.

Come up was rather rough and dirty, reminiscent of how the 2C-P come up was for me but more physically constrained (not even a tinge of nausea, though there was slight GI discomfort) and just more mentally unpleasant, with a lot of anhedonia in particular.


Peaked into a wonderful soft and smooth experience reminiscent of 2C-B but with a unique character of its own. It was driven by a strong amphetamine like stimulation, and there was a definite empathy and openness present much akin to that of 2C-B, but with a bigger stimulating drive behind it which led to a lot of talking and a lot of writing. (As you'll see by my 2.7k+ word trip report.. it was meant to be "a few little notes" 8() - very pleasurable, dancing was wonderful, music sounded great.


Later the rushier euphoria subsided into a more gentle high, somewhat like if amphetamine were wrapped in soft pillows, that's pretty much the body high I've been getting since the peak wore off. It's still present now, and helping drive my fingers to type out these words. There's somewhat of an analytical headspace, but it doesn't get quite so caught up in diverse thought loops as some drugs, and rather simply allows me to think in a clear and balanced manner.


I think this has a lot of therapeutic potential, as I was able to face inner demons without feeling sad or angry or depressed, just calm, in control, and understanding. 


Aside from the anhedonia on the come up the trip has been entirely pleasurable. At T+15:18 since I dosed I'm still not anywhere near tired yet, but I feel another 30-60 minutes and I might be able to sleep, maybe.. or maybe a couple of hours, we'll see.


There were a lot of visuals but at the same time they were rather subtle and not so distracting like those present on 2C-E, more like pleasant background noise.


I'll keep writing my trip report (which is already at a rather long 2.7k+ words as I mentioned ![o_O](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f635.png) - but I'll write a short summary version alongside it) until it ends, and I'll post it up later/tomorrow! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Hope this is enough info to keep you guys going until then ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Edit: Oh and some notes regarding duration:

T+0:00: Dosed

T+1:30: First alert

T+2:00: Definitely tripping now.

T+2:20: Pleasantness kicks in.

T+2:50: Suddenly reminds me of 2C-B and feels wonderfully euphoric, empathic, social etc.

T+5:30: Euphoria dies down into a softer version of an amphetamine type high, with psychedelic layers on top.

--- up and down waves of the effects over the next several hours ---

T+15:30: Still going, expect another hour or two until I'm down.

Thank you for your post. This is the most useful comment about this substance, I've read, so far (though I haven't read your tr, yet).


What I mostly was wondering, and kinda missing in this thread, how does this compound compare to TMA (or the TMA's)? Structurally it is most similar to TMA, although your description sounds pretty similar to an experience I had on ~30 mg TMA-2, minus the long duration.


Can you, or anyone else, comment on this?

Well yes it's a cross between TMA and proscaline, I suggest you read up on proscaline because that sounds like it brings out the MDMA-like qualities of mescaline but not so much the psychedelia (although a part may be retained). It explains nothing but it makes SAR analogies more consistent and it could help us to forget about the similarly named 2C-P which is very psychedelic. Not even the propyl is the same because with 3C-P and proscaline it is a propoxy group. Both propyl and propoxy apparently increase potency though.


If proscaline is already pretty euphoric, although maybe physically languid, probably empathogenic, with some MDMA-ish component ... alpha-methylating it into 3C-P should be more nicely energetic and quite literally more into an MDMA-like direction. I guess I shouldn't overfocus on the description of it being in between MDMA and mescaline because that doesn't necessarily mean there is MDMA-like action going on on. But if it has, maybe this is an exception to the rule for psychedelic that N-methylation abolishes effect rather than sprucing it up.

I understand that proscaline is the closest analogue of 3C-P, chemically speaking and I must admit I don't have experience with proscaline, but what I've read about it, is that it's nothing like the description of Jesusgreen of 3C-P. Moreover, in my experience, non of the PEA analogues correspond to their amphetamine counterpart in effect, duration and dose. Therefore I think reading up on proscaline, to get more insight into this compound, is futile. 

Hence my comparison with the TMA's, since they are better known and possible produce a better insight. Aside from my comparison to TMA-2, a comparison to TMA-6 was made in the TR of Jesusgreen.

How would you compare it to 2C-E? For me there was a rougher come up but later in the trip it got more enjoyable.

No anhedonia though just nervousnes

Do you mean the come up or the overall experience? With the overall experience there is very little that can be compared, other than them both producing some degree of stimulation and being wonderful aids for writing and speaking - though 2C-E sways to the side of poetry for me while 3C-P would favour a debate or a story.


I personally find the 2C-E come up rather easy to handle usually but sometimes at higher doses it can feel a bit sickly and I'm usually greeted by the sensation of not knowing whether I want to stand up, sit down, walk around etc.. With 3C-P the come up was also easy to handle but it really gave me a sense that I'd underdosed and wasn't going to feel anything pleasant, along with a lack of desire to really do anything.


I've read some reports on Proscaline and I'd agree with Solipsis that my experience seems similar to some of those reports, which of course makes sense given the structure. I can't say if it induces more or less empathy and euphoria than Proscaline itself having not tried it but it certainly was a fantastic substance to try and the only other person I know personally irl who's tried it gave it similarly high praise.

IMO Proscaline is much weaker than 3C-P. I tried proscaline 50-60 mg and she didnt impress me , but 3C-P definitely yes . I wrote in other thread that this compound is very safe , my friend accidentally took 350 mg of intranasal . My other friends take often more than 60 mg without any negative side-effects

2C-E is quite other than 3C-P , better is quite other than 2C-P , two different compounds. 3C-P is much closer to Mescaline but more with emphatogen effects.

3C-P as for me is much better than whole TMA group ( I tried TMA-1 , TMA-2 , TMA-6)

Bumping in case anybody has tried plugging this. I'm assuming roughly double potency as is the case with most 2C-Xs but would love some empirical data.


Thanks for the report JG. The 2C-B comparison piqued my interest. I've been hoping for a vague substitute for it since it's really hard to get hold of and if it's more MDMA like all the better.

I tried plugging this during a day off recently.  I can't offer much in the way of solid profile information because of complications that occurred --plus I split up the dose and used 2-FMA, MXE, and kratom with it -- but I will say that it seemed to take at least an hour before first alerts were registered, the total experience lasted no less than 12 hours, and I didn't experience much in the way of visual effects. Though I can attribute little definitively to the contribution of the 3C-P alone, Jesusgreen's comparisons to 2C-B and his description of 3C-P as "amphetamine wrapped in soft pillows" nevertheless strikes me as apt. All in all it seems to be a very pleasant substance. Next time I intend to plan things better and take a single 50 mg dose plugged as early in the day as I can.

When/if I get it, I will post my trip report. I am going to try 50-60mg at first, because usually with substances; 1. I have a weird tolerance, and 2. I can never seem to work my way up with great results. 

I came up with a list of experiments a few years back that I run on any RC/Psychedelic.

First I draw a picture of an eye. This lets me understand my understanding/thinking.

Second, I play a driving game (Test Drive Unlimited 2). About 5 minutes of obeying traffic laws to test my focus, and 5 minutes of full speed car dodging to test my reaction time.

Third, listen to a set playlist, and write down what I notice in the music to see whether it sounds different than on other chemicals (feel of the bass, new instruments heard).

Fourth, attempt to stretch. This is because on a few chems like DOC and 25i, I get a weir muscle tension that makes them sore for the whole night. It might be vasoconstriction because using muscles increases blood flow, and that is what is causing the ache/soreness.

Fifth, I talk to trusted friends on Facebook/Twitter/Xbox Live to test my sociability and anxiety. Sometimes chems can make me shy, and unable to formulate sentences, others make words flow out of my mouth without me having to think twice.

Lastly, the whole report will be written with a pen to test my ability to write, and think clearly. 


I know this isn't a perfect way to test something so untested, but I usually do it just for myself. I am interested in how these chemicals will enhance my life. I will definitely post results as soon as I finish up with my experiments/trip.

I hope you don't have any obligations tomorrow. You'll be up until sunrise at least (enjoying yourself I imagine). I'm budgeting 12 hours minimum for my next sojourn in 3C-P land. I'm surprised we haven't had more questions about 3C-P lately. My one experience with it was muddled by the influence of other drugs but it still struck me as very pleasant, somewhat unique, and potentially a great combo psychedelic like aMT, it just takes ages to get going in earnest. And of course there's the exotic factor with not even Shulgin having taken it and all. I really enjoyed my one outing with 4-ho-DPT and 2C-B together and I'm hoping 3C-P's 2C-B-like qualities are enough to get me back to that head space at some point.

I don't like to trip around people who "can't know." It just causes too much stress. I would rather just be alone than try to hide it. Sounds like a good time though. Thanks for sharing.

Yeah. It did let me test the boundaries of comfort on this chem, which was kind of nice, but last night, I could connect to myself and the earth so much more, and there was just a deep flow of energy that I didn't have to hide. It really is like a subtle 2Cx. Last night I also tried blind folding myself with ear plugs in, and that was beautiful. I saw some amazing, liquid visuals that were what I believe to be visual forms of everything I was hearing, so that was an experience.


And thank you very much! :D 


I will attempt to write up a trip report tonight, but I am testing 25i with C and T, so I'm not sure if I will remember. If there is anything in particular anyone wants to know, just ask, and I will try to answer based on my experience. When I wrote my report I left a few extra things out that would have dragged it on, and quite honestly, I couldn't remember each one of them after the whole night was over.

Wait, you're considering taking 25I this evening? Don't you think that's a bit soon? What's the rush?


I too dislike having to conceal the fact that I am tripping. I would rather not trip, to me it's indicative of a poorly chosen setting.

I am. I just love trips on the weekend. It's a tendency I get a lot with psychedelics, like last semester I went on a week long binge of DOC where I re dosed 2 times a day, and I tried not to sleep or eat. It was not much of a trip by the end of the week, but rather a temporary psychosis. That was all because of the horrible anxiety I got living in dorms with people that were complete dicks. But I did wait a week between my last 25i trip.


The experience wasn't a complete loss. I did feel great, and the trip itself was awesome, I just was around new people. I honestly wanted to stay in my room and play video games and draw, and listen to music, and that's why I decided to do it again last night. And that was a WAY better experience. But I do have a LOT of experience with concealing trips like when I was going through my gram of 2C-I, I used to take 50mg and then spend the night with my parents, and I got comfortable with masking my emotions, but mentally it was still an awesome experience.

50mg 2c-i!?!? ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) Holy crap! I lost my shit once on 25mg. Well, not entirely. Watch the dosing too often. No point in losing the magic.

Heh, sounds like me at (what I presume is) your age. There's a thrill in being on the edge of disaster while feeling like you're teaching yourself a potentially powerful sort of deception and growing more confident by the minute. Just make sure you choose the context for learning wisely. 


I can't disagree with the others who've replied that being around people who don't approve of altered states makes for a bad situation, but having gotten a taste of 3C-P -- though mixed with other flavors -- I think it's perhaps one of the best psychedelics one could find themselves on in a disquieting environment. 


I like your art, too. Like RedBong "Caught in the Spiral" appeals to me, but I also enjoy "Bailey," and, if you care to consider it, in my (purely intuitive) opinion the sort of aesthetic tenancies you're pursuing in that piece are far more likely to be fruitful for you than the former.

GingerTripper, can you decide on a creative title for your trip report? It belongs in the Trip Reports forum, so once you give me a title I can move it over there so it's easier for everyone to find.


Since you obviously wanted to share it here I can also leave a link in this thread to it once it's been moved so it can be found in both places ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**3C-P -- 55mg RA -- mini report**


T+0: solution of 55mg 3C-P administered (RA).


T+25: definite first alerts while running errands.


T+35: interoceptive wavering sensations and a sense that my equilibrium is riding slow rolling waves.


T+40: slight impairment of cognition noted. I’ve returned to the house.


T+60: feels like 2C-B, with maybe more of a stimulant push. If not for the difference in its rate of onset and extreme length I doubt I could tell them apart, however, this is exactly what I was hoping for so my ability to discern other qualitative differences is almost certainly biased toward the interpretation. 


T+70: Plateau? If this experience is like my last one with 3C-P I expect qualitative shifts in the trip are forthcoming but the sense of accelerating intensity I associate with the onset of all drugs has leveled out. Mild-to-moderate CEVs and OEVs are also noted. 

I expect to be tripping for about 11 hours, with residual effects for hours after that. I’ve only ever tried 3C-P RA but given the descriptions of oral dosages and my lack of 5-HT psychedelic tolerance I’m guessing the potency increase over oral is not as dramatic as with 2C-Xs. The biggest advantage I see is probably just that the route speeds the onset and so shortens the overall time between starting the trip and when sleep is possible. 


Compared to the only other psychedelic amphetamine I’ve tried, DOM, the vasoconstrictive side-effects are mild. There is comparatively little anxiolytic edge to the trip as well. This is about as mild and non-committally euphoric (without stepping into empathogen territory proper like aMT can) as I can imagine a psychedelic being so I'm calling it a good addition to the trippy tool kit for those who want that option. Formerly, TMA-6 held that designation for me. I think it's about perfect for day long light recreation -- beach and summer picnic stuff. I'm guessing I could trip on this in front of co-workers without worrying I'd raise suspicions as well, I'd just come off as being in a talkative good mood. I can see why Jesus Green mentioned it as supplying motivation to write.  If it weren't so long lasting it would make a great psychedelic for those just looking for an introductory taste of what they're all about. 


I think it may combine well with gabapentin … yeah I’m gonna go do that.


EDIT: Though I still feel 3C-P is a largely recreational psychedelic, I see now that it can be much more if you work with it. I was petting my girlfriend’s cat just now and reveling in her innocence as she hugged and rubbed her face against my thigh. I projected myself into her empathically during this and the level of recursion doing so incurred caused a sort of fractalization of my consciousness, snowballing into what felt like the beginnings of a partial seizure. I see better now the relationship between empathy and selflessness. The experience was like a pang of ego death. It's helping me get better at actively feeling better.

I'm hesitant to add this, because I've only used it twice (and once muddled in polydrug use), but I did get the sense that my 3C-P thoughts were like psychedelic thoughts on Adderall, that is, like focused explosions, or "free-associational funneling". Obviously I was impressed with 3C-P or I wouldn't be bothered to post. It will take a few more trips to determine if it's just a fluke, not, or some other thing.

25i NBOMe and 3C-P go very well together. I was a little scared about vasoconstriction, but over all physically I feel fine. It has a nice introspective, empathetic head space. When I did 3C-P alone it felt like I couldn't quite go any further, but together with 25i there is a link. Visuals are very apparent, but not overwhelming. The anti-anxiety aspect of 3C-P is also helping with the anxiety I usually get with 25i. This is a great combo.

At +0:00 I had 3x 950ug blotters in my mouth, and then +0:45 I drank 50mg of 3C-P. I dosed high with 25i because I had taken it just on Sunday, and I was making up for the tolerance. The trip was beautiful.

I received some 3c-p recently and decided to give it a try today after snorting a few 20mg doses a few weeks ago with no real effects. So today i took 50mg orally, at around the 1.5 hour mark i started to notice walls shimmering and so on & a subtle psychedelic feeling followed with some nausea and the general shitty come up feelings & now im at the 4 hour mark and those feelings have not really subsided. No euphoria or stimulation at all.... at around the 5 hour mark the sickness and so on had subsided, my pupils were dilated but still nothing much going on. 


I was starting to wonder what was going on then i remembered back to the times ive tried other chems in the 2c family only for nothing much to happen compared to other people even at doses 3 times as large as my friends. I guess its my natural tolerance thats causing the lack of effects at 50mg. Guess i have to cut my losses with this one, its a shame i was hoping to have some good input on this relatively unknown chemical.

Tested this at around 32-35mg via gel cap orally.


First alerts felt around 1 hour mark.


I didn't have any GI/Nausea issues , but i rarely do anyway.


Come up for me was pretty smooth compared to my limited PEA experience. I found 25i & 25c nbome come ups rather alarming. MDMA , Methylone , 5-apdb come ups for me are rather fast & intense , but not at all worrying like I've found the nbomes to be & I've found DOC/HOT-7 to have pretty smooth gradual come ups , but with both once i do reach the peak I'm in for a pretty intense ride. This couldn't really compare directly to any of these , as it was long & gradual as I'd describe HOT-7 for instance but at no point was it intense and it basically just felt like one very long plateau of effects when i reached the top.


Took it early in the day so i could sleep at a decent time. Effects lasted a good 14 hours until i fell asleep.


IME there was no real "peak" so to say as most of the experience was pretty much consistent intensity wise. Visually there wasn't a whole lot. Brighter color/hue's added to objects. Most of the trip was outside during a sunny day which usually isn't very great for noticing visual change. About 10 hours in though while at my GF house , i found myself getting lost in her wall paper as the flowers were breathing/changing hue's so under the right circumstance I imagine this can be pretty visual. 


Mentally i was just really relax & at ease the entire day. Sociable , a bit of MDxx type openness was present as well.


At around 2hr-4hr after ingestion i was at a water park/wave pool and just lounging on a tube in the water with my eyes closed was very peaceful. No anxiety about being in a public setting was present.


My GF isn't a huge fan of my recreational psychedelic use , well really my recreational drug use as the only time it seems to upset her is if I'm on stimulants or a benzo , as with the former I'm usually talking her ear off about who knows what &  awake for the whole night while she'd like me in bed cuddling , and the later i suppose for the opposite reasons as I'd be unable to socialize in a normal manner and be asleep snoring like a lion. The two for me go hand in hand , i only use benzo's after stim's but sometimes I'll overshoot what is needed to put me down so to say. Either way she tends to lump all my drug use together while in reality whenever I'm on (or were both on) psychedelics we have a great time. 


Said that to say this , 99% of the time she can tell if I'm on something. While I usually don't tell her up front , I never deny it when confronted , and yesterday she never said a thing & neither did I. & it wasn't as if i was trying to hide it , as I never really do , as i find trying to appear sober when in a altered state usually dulls the experience or makes things awkward. 


Sex was amazing & no problems achieving , maintaining , performing or finishing the act.


Overall Euphoria was present , both in terms of mental & body.


I had no problem's falling asleep at my normal time , but had i taken this after noon I could see sleep being a issue. Nothing was used to help aid sleep , but i tend to avoid taking a benzo at all costs while on psychedelics , as even if I'm fairly stimulated and would like to be asleep it's unbearable and doesn't come with the anxiety feeling I tend to get if I use a stim and want to get some sleep. I'll only keep them on hand while tripping in case of emergency situations to abort a trip (which I've only done during a rough 4-aco-dmt experience where I wasn't mentally fit for dosing that day/time).


Worth noting i fell asleep before i was back to baseline. The entire experience was very consistent , no intense peak and no sudden drop off just a very long drawn out enjoyable plateau.


As of writing this it's been about 28 hours since ingestion and have been in a good mood sense waking up , about 6.5-7 hours or decent sleep , no negative day after type feelings & if anything a bit of lingering psychedelia seemed present , up to a few hours after being awake. 


I guess i can see where some may find the stimulation a bit much or "dirty" as I've seen it described but at no time did it bother me at all. Just be prepared for the long duration and plan accordingly if you want to sleep. Comparing it to the long duration PEA I have the most experience with , DOC , it's quite tame. But hard to give great comparison , as this is my first 3cp experience and on the rather low end dosage wise , where with DOC I've tested from 1mg-5mg (no tolerance , up to 8mg with tolerance and redosing). So far this seems much more manageable in the sense of going about day to day activities , appearing sober , and not as much residual stimulation. DOC can keep me up 24 hours easy , and 10-14 of those are after being nearly back to baseline , and while not nearly as annoying of a stimulated but wanting to sleep feeling as you'd have off a proper stim it does tend to get a little annoying and the last 4 hours following a DOC trip before i sleep I'm just feeling like I'm so over this , I just want to get rest. At the same time the trip from 3c-p is not nearly as intense or euphoric as my DOC trips have been , but i suppose this could get more intense as the dosage gets higher. Seems more fit for a subtle trip , something you can take and appear sober while going about your day , IMO better for enhancing normal daily activities , or daytime outdoor activities , whereas DOC i tend to want to stay in and am not nearly as comfortable in a social setting , and something like MDMA would be more fit for a party type scene. Not sure 3c-p would provide intense of an experience I'd like if my setting was more party oriented , aka a festival/show , but maybe mixed along side something in combination it would.


That last part being said I'm interested in any combinations that have paired well with 3c-p. Id be hesitant to combine with anything stimulating , but maybe some of the 4-sub tryptamines , simple tryptamines would go nicely with it. Perhaps 5-apdb or LSD. Have only a few combo's under my belt and has been PEA's combined with Tryptamines & MDMA+stimulant so no rush to test the waters as I'd prefer to become more familiar with 3c-p alone before trying to combine it & not to mention there's so little information out about 3c-p to begin with.


All in all very enjoyable. I find it strange it's not more widely available & there's so little information on it given i thought the experience was very nice. My prior PEA experience is DOC , HOT-7 , MDMA , 5-apdb , 5-apb , 25i&c (& i'd rank it in that order) and so far I'd place it above 5-apdb.


Out of the PEA I've experienced with I'd say it was most similar to HOT-7 , but I've only had 1 HOT-7 experience , on a rather small dose , and even so it was more intense then 3c-p and I imagine 3c-p overall is far less intense & more subtle then HOT-7 will be at higher doses. From my HOT-7 experience I could just tell that once i push this a little further I'm in for quite a intense trip , while with this I'm having doubts that a small jump in dosage will provide that much more of an intense experience. Only assumptions here though.


I also find it weird that erowid lists it just as a "stimulant" . I think Psychedelic or Euphoric Empathogen is more fitting. At the very least it's a Euphoric Stimulant , but even that would be misleading IMO.


Anywho , I've managed to get to rambling here so I'll be on my way now & will likely report back after my next experience , hopefully with as much or more positive things to say about 3c-p as I already have.

& correct me if I'm wrong , but this is a mescaline analog , correct? 


I've never had the pleasure to test mescaline & wouldn't even know where to begin looking to find it , but I'm sure one day I'll have the chance and I'd be interested to see how this compares.


I do however have samples of AL , Escaline , 3c-e & soon Proscaline that I'm yet to test. I'm fairly certain those are all analogs of mescaline as well so pretty excited to see how these compare with my 3c-p experience. If this trip is any indication of how I'll react with any of these I'm pretty geeked to work with mescaline analogs in the future.

Almost, yes it's quite similar to mescaline but technically it's an analogue of a trimethoxy Amphetamine (TMA) not mescaline which is a trimethoxy Phenethylamine.

Do you guys trip at day or night with that? My friend who's more experienced with mescaline analogs/homologs says it's only a good trip at day, and that contact with nature is most recommended to simulate mescaline ceremony conditions. Going to try it sometime soon, will be 1st time with mescaline similar substance.

A good setting is a good setting. Doesn't matter if you're on ISS or in a natural oasis in the atacama desert, so long as you feel comfortable, safe and happy there is no reason you can't have the trip of a lifetime. Chemicals neither know or care what time of day it is.

It might be true that chemicals don't know whether it is night or day, but your body does. And it is your body/mind that creates the experience, the chemicals are mere catalysts in this process, so I argue it does indeed make a difference if it is night or day!!


But this is getting offtopic.

OK I'll give you that, but your mind isn't bothered about the exact nature of the setting, so long as you're happy it's a good one ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yeah I get what ur getting at, thing is, my friend said 3C-P, escaline, etc. wouldn't display full spectrum of effects in a night setting, so he advised me to take them during day instead.

Do people think this would be good to take at an event? Im worried about it too mellow and not interesting enough. Thinking of maybe bringing some 2cc or 4homet to add to it. Any thoughts from people who have tried this one?

anyone else got quite annoying GI discomfort on the tail end/comedown phase?


had my first trial with 3cp at 40mg oral... all fine and dandy, bumpy comeup but overall quite managable, a lowish dose for me... but after th 6h mark it drops off slowly and sleep was impossible for at least 10h more. 

but the GI discomfort (gasses, constant feel of impending wc use...) were bad like few others

Did you fast before taking it perhaps? When I first discovered psychedelics I used to fast before taking them but quickly discovered if I did so I'd get stomach discomfort during the trip as my hunger would be amplified - only often the trip would make eating unpleasant and take forever. After that I always ate before tripping and on longer trips like 3C-P and the like I made sure to at least eat some light meal/s during the trip too. Really makes a world of difference.

i didnt fast, it isnt my first trip so i generally know how to prepare for an experience. i did eat a light meal a few hours prior to dosing, and had a great satisfyong meal during the trip. maybe i phrased things  wrong. it wasnt so much the stomach that bothered me, but the gasses and diarrhea... the only other chem to mess with those symptoms as much was 6apb for me, and amt, but those usually manifested after the trip, not during the come down phase.

This compound sounds really interesting... I'd be more interested in trying it than the bk-2C-B I already have, actually... I'm surprised there aren't more recent posts in this thread?

*Yesterday there was a nice warm dry day and I decided to go on a bike ride and take 43mg of 3C-P. A day before that I've sampled it at 0.5-3mg to do an allergy test. 


The 3C-P powder that was obtained from a trusted and tested source appeared very similar looking to 3-FPM (3-FluoroPhenMetrazine - an entactogenic stimulant) - same white scaly crystally looking powder, but 3C-P is a bit whiter, so I naturally was suspicious and decided to carefully sample it by taste (about 1mg or less) - 3-FPM is a bit salty, caustic and not very bitter, whereas 3C-P powder has characteristic phenethylamine bitterness to it that persists. 


Plan to purchase new reagents for testing in the near future so I can avoid guessing.*


**Subject:** 170Lbs male with extensive psychoactives research, phenethylamines, tryptamines and beyond. Previous psychoactive substance taken was 30mg 4-FA with 60mg 5-APDB at the concert more than a week ago. Decided to follow an advice and eat something light before taking 3C-P, in retrospect - great idea with this one!


**Set & setting:** Biking alone on deserted trails in the wilderness, partly in public, middle of day, feeling comfortable, curious about experience.


**Dose:** 43mg (measured on a decent milligram scales with +/- 1mg) of 3C-P (3,5-dimethoxy-4-(n)-propoxy-Amphetamine) in a gel cap.


**Experience:

**

*T=00:00 - *Loaded 43mg of 3C-P in a capsule, took some cannabis and my trusty pipe with me, took my mountain bike, loaded some Wooden Shjips and Moon Duo playlists on the phone to listen while riding and decided to start going for as long as I would want. Also, after reading that by itself 3C-P may be lacking psychedelia, decided to take with me a blotter of 1P-LSD as well - never used it :D

*

T+00:30 - *Perhaps light alerts, some nausea, but since I'm biking, not really feeling it that much. It's a great feel to be on the bike and with psychedelics it always brings out childishness amazements, sense of novelty and discovery %)


*T+01:00 - *Definitely alerts, come up is somewhat simialr to MDMA, 6-APD and 5-APDB with light persistent nausea and a light feeling of disorientation, also a familiar feeling of mescaline's warm energy started to emerge. 


*T+02:00 - *Still climbing, slowly reaching ++ by Shulgin's scale. At this point external stimulis becoming a bit annoying. Killing the music and just enjoying the sounds of nature. Birds chirping and river flows - beautiful!.. Definitely feeling energy building up in me, also still a little dizziing feeling of being slightly drunk.


*T+03:00 - *Finally! Im peaking and very nicely - it comes in waves of mental and bodily euphoria and all I need to do is to relax my thought process! Lights becoming sparklier, my body feels very light, tingly and becoming tired actually feels quite pleasurable. If I were a woman I'd probably have couple orgasms at this point as the sense of touch became ultimately nice and throbbing...8) 

I dont even notice that I've gone through about 25 miles of trails and still kept going.


*T+03:30 - *Stopped next by the river, layed down on the rock and smoked some cannabis... At this point I'm tripping and I'm tripping quite hard. I feel that I can't keep myself "sober" and started to overanalyze myself as being quite inadequate to talk to people - strange desire to do something weird and shocking in public was ovepowering me so I started concentrating on breathing which evntually calmed me down. The trippyness was somewhat similar to Mescaline, MAL (Methallylescaline) and 2C-P. 

After a little break decided to bike a little more as I still was not feeling tired at all. 


*T+04:00 - *Damn, I'm too high to continue going, I just realized that I biked out for about 30 miles out, perhaps even more and its starting to get dark and cold and I need to bike back down. Didn't even feel like I need that 1P-LSD as I was thinking about to go to the natural spa nearby and soak there after the bike ride and I was feeling strongly high already. 

Feeling huge increase in energy and some alarming heart rate so I slowed down and put on "Beach House" and "Washed Out" playlist - perfect for amphetamine euphoric psychedelic, and slowly started rolling back to where I started.


*T+04:30 - *Going donwhill was so euphoric!.. The images around me were getting smoothed with visual trails which was pretty to observe and I felt very empowered, I felt great! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


*T+05:00 - *I have noticed that with this chemical at this dosage it's starting to become hard to deal with any external stimuli, even thinking started to kinda "hurt" me. And out of the sudden, a huge and smelly Jimmy Jones club tuna sub sandwich appears in my mind's eye so powerful, bright and real that I start salivating profusely - the hunger becomes all-encompassing feeling and the only desire to reach. So I start pedaling harder...


*T+6:00 -* Stimulation, along with tiredness, muscle soreness, hunger and still going psychedelic effects made me reach my base a lot sooner - I load my bike in my truck and sit inside to catch some breath. Some chest pressure is observed. My pupils are plate-sized, wide opened eyes, looks like I just took 150mg of MDMA, I'm also twitchy, paranoid and slightly delusional, looking quite insane compared to the standard of "normal looking person".


*T+06:30 - *I feel that the speediness is still increasing, besides I started to feel cold in my extremities so I rushed into the spa. 


Im quite used to be really high on different forms of amphetamines, LSD and both in public but this compound rendered me completely out of it - it took an enormouos effort to look "normal", take out the wallet and simply pay the fee for the entrance and get a towel. I felt that evryone and everything was talking about me, thinking about me and looking at me - your typical amphetamine paranoia with psychosis emerging ![:sus:](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/suspicious.gif)


*T+07:00 - *Trying to be calm and just lay there at the spa - dark stone walls, water dripping everywhere, hard to notice details around as everything seems to be swirling together, in and out. Time is warped too, hard to say how long I was inside for. People near me make me a bit stressed but I'm starting not to care - catching another wave of euphoria and... catching my heart rate going up through the roof again so I get out of the steam room and trying to chill on the recliner in the dry sun room. Hard to stay still at this point, plus the tuna sandwich came back to my mind again and have been drilling holes in my sanity...8(


*T+08:00 - *Very, very stimulated. Body tremors and shaky hands, one more set at the steam room, taking shower and getting out of there. 


*T+08:30 - *Calling my girlfriend as I am not able to drive at this condition at all. Hands shaking, can't hold still, twitchy, the tuna sandwich stuck in my mind.... I wished for benzos, Validol, anything just to calm me down but nothing was handy and I had to wait. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


*T+09:00 - *My girlfriend finally arrives and we take off and immediately stop by the sub shop and get a sandwich and a sprite. My senses are overloading with smells and anticipation of food, it's almost impossible! I feel like a dorky dog who got his favorite food but cant eat it because of overexcitation :D 

I try eating and it takes lots of effort to just bite it, but oh God, it was delicious! With all the hot peppers goodness... After about 15 minutes of nibbling on the sub I feel significantly better. 


*T+09:30 - .*..And then, Snap! All of the sudden I understand how things work around me, how people think most of the times, how automatic and autonomuos our society is. I feel super empathetic and I say to my GF how much I love her and how much she means to me and it makes me feel so free... Im happy again ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


*T+10:00 - *Finally home, taking 500mg of Validol, Scullcap and Valerian extracts. Getting a six pack of Czech beer and full collection of Invaders (60s show about aliens) ready!..


Smoking weed and drinking cold ones feel awesome! I'm so grateful for little things that life grants us!

Visual activity subsided, along with psychedelic mind set, stimulation had let go a bit but was still noticeable for the next 6 hours.


*T+17:00 -* Took 150mg of 5-HTP and 100mg of L-Theanine along with hot shower and was finally able to start falling asleep.


6 hours later I was up already and in good moods. Some remaining residual stimulation and anti-depressant effect is observed throughout the following day.


**Conclusion and thoughts:**

Very interesting compound! I think I want to take it in a lot less hectic setting, and definitely lesser dosage as I think 3C-P's beauty is in it's entactogenic and stimulating properties. So, thinking of 25mg for my next time and not so much of a physical strain.


Also noticed quite interesting staged pattern of trip development (could be affected by intense biking in my case):


* First three hours - setting in, a little nauseous and drunk.


* Three to Seven hours in - the actual trip, it's pretty heavy on sensory overload so better be prepared! Very sensual too!.. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


* Seven to Nine hours - intense coming down from the trip and setting in entactogenic amphetamine mode - better be prepared and be with loved ones, preferably in the safe place.


* Nine to Seventeen hours - entactogenic amphetamine mode. This is the perfect time for chilling in a company of friends, having jokes, beers, watching movies, playing games - all this activities feel greatly enhanced!


Im thinking about combination of 3C-P and perhaps ETH-LAD, or some "slower" tryptamines. Also will take it in combination with Proscaline and write up about it!


Thank you for reading friends and be safe!

Wow, this is great timing as I have some 3C-P coming shortly.  Same place I got my 3C-E from.  I actually tried 3C-P once years back, I was addicted to opiates at the time and I tended to not react too well to psychedelics then, and I remember I took 40mg (I think) and didn't trip too hard, but it lasted forever and gave me an absolutely crushing headache, it was so bad.  I've been wanting to try it again, because I have really enjoyed my 3C-E.  I like it in lower dosages because the stimulation becomes quite intense (as you describe here with 3C-P) when you dose higher.  My impression is that 3C-P is maybe more psychedelic than 3C-E.  Have you tried 3C-E to compare?


Thanks for the detailed report. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yeah I'm certainly going to try mine now when I get it. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Actually I found my 3C-P I got years ago too.  I may try 20mg to start.  I dunno, I really like 3C-E at around 10mg, it's not psychedelic except for that undefinable sparkle, but it makes a great, warm, well-balanced and good-humored stimulant at that dose.  PIHKAL I believe lists the dosage range from 20-50mg.  I took 50mg in a night of it, 20mg, then 30mg more later, and I found it a bit more psychedelic but nothing to write home about, it basically just made the stimulation a lot stronger.  I enjoy it more at low dosages.  3C-P, according to the few good reports that exist of it (and I agree with MGS that this is the best one I've read), seems a little bit stronger on the psychedelic/maybe empathogenic side.  I'll probably still maybe try only 20mg though.

I'm glad you liked reading it as sure I was reliving the experience as I was writing it, so it was fun! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Since the chemical is relatively rare I should post it on Erowid nad TRs, thank you for the advice.


I have not tried 3C-E but after this experience I'm going to add it to the collection for sure! 

I speculate it will be somewhat less confusing, less psychedelic and perhaps even more euphoric, not sure about the body load though. 


Also I should mention that I take a good stack of nootropics daily and usually stop a day or two before the trip, in that particular case with 3C-P, I have taken my stack (CDP-Choline, Aniracetam, Piracetam, Noopept, Agmatine, Phehylalanine, and various herbs extracts) a day before, but not on the day of the trip.


I'd suggest to start with 25mg of 3C-P, to get the feel for it's psychedelia and not get too stimulated. It was rather a surprise for me that I got such a strong nice effects at 43mg as all the info I was reading about it pointed me to even higher dosage. Keep in mind 3hr come up time!


It'll be nice to read about your experiences with this one, guys! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have had a marvelous experience mixing 20mg of 3C-P and 15mg of 4-AcO-MET recently. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Took it all at once, in one capsule - it started developing in 40 minutes and by 2 hours I started peaking. There was absolutely no uncomfortable body feelings, none of that annoying overstimulation of a high dose of psychedelic amphetamine - it was very peaceful and balanced experience that made me relaxed, euphoric and provided soft glowing long lasting psychedelia.8)


So far it was my best experience with this material (and some of the most pleasurable trips ever) and it rivaled my DOC experiences being a lot easier on the body but giving similar pleasant high. 4-AcO-MET blended in so perfectly - it felt like I took only one substance and the resulting high was surprisingly balanced. I had a wonderful feel of being in a fairy tale, strong immersion effects, mild OEVs and CEVs, and a strong empathetic psychedelic glow, akin DOC or LSD. 


There were some interesting visual effects such as complete color replacement of surfaces - I would look at my couch and it will start changing color from brown to green, to red and so on, large areas textures of the same color would have that effect if I would stare at them - it was fun! :D


The trip had it's characteristic plateaus, like all my 3C-P trips: 


***1)*** Peaking for three hours at 2 hr point - airy psychedelic state with interesting and transcendent thought patterning and feelings of excitement. Visuals are there but sense of immersion and magic is what felt the most wonderful at that time.![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

***2)*** Transition phase where you feel mostly strong body high, feeling stoned and somewhat drunk, at the 5-6th hour, lasting about an hour or two. This phase is usually uncomfortable for me but with the dosages chosen and in the combo with 4-AcO-MET it was actually pleasurable and quite hedonistic.%)

***3)*** Setting into a stimulating entactogenic mode at the 7th hour with a similar feel to Mescaline - strong self-affirming body buzz with warm and fuzzy glowing, very fuzzy actually - I would just burst into a deep laughing and feel like the laughing is coming out of my body and my skin, and it made me tingly and euphoric. I became very chatty, open and overall a good fella ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


At about 9hr mark I also ingested 1,5mg of 5-MeO-MiPT which made me even happier and sparklier.


Throughout the trip I was able to fully enjoy introspection laying in the dark bath, to listen to music and observe the CEVs, to play videogames (immersion made it sooo good) for a quite a long time. Then I went up to the mountains to meet sunrise and check out fall leaves (it was crispy freezing good) with my girl, where we took 5-MeO-MiPT and smoked a bunch of cannabis, then came back home and watched Charlie and the chocolate factory and surprisingly I was still getting some movement and texture coloring effects, as well as a great psychedelic glow going on...![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Come down was easy and at the 16hr mark I went to bed and fell asleep without a problem.

Balanced and bright dreams and feeling of a pleasant afterglow upon awakening.


It was one of those cases where "less is more" - this trip was  infinitely better than all my previous experimentations where I was  taking 25-45mg of 3C-P. Addition of 4-AcO-MET was the best combo to go with it (and may be one of the best psychedelic combos I've tried ever), I cannot recommend it enough! Definitely repeating it (with perhaps 20mg of 4-AcO-MET this time) as soon as the time allows to. I'm in love with this one now! :D

Had a great trip with 45 mg of this a couple of weeks ago. I found some aspects of the experience quite enjoyable but the come-up was too rough, and the cardiovascular effects didn't felt dangerous but made me nervous at times. 


I'm interested in trying a lower dose in the future. I had taken 10 mg before but didn't really feel anything defined. I might try 25 mg with some weed, or maybe some 3-MeO-PCP sometime in the future. 


It lasts a long ass time, but I would take it again for it's musical enhancement alone. Next level shit.

IMO 45mg is a bit too much for 3C-P and I found the most comfortable dose for it to be about 20-25mg mixed with 15-30mg of 4-AcO-MET, taken about 2 hours after the 3C-P. 

It will most likely go good with other tryptamines, such as 4-HO-MET, 4-AcO-DMT, Mushrooms as well as dissos if you are into it. 5-MeO-MiPT combined nicely but I wouldnt dare taking more than 2.5mg of it on top of 3C-P. Same goes for 4-HO-MiPT and 4-HO-MPT - I think they will be too speedy for this particular combo.


Strangely 4-HO-EPT did not combine well with 3C-P for me, but it (4-HO-EPT) was like bread and butter both with Mescaline and Escaline (which I found to be an amazing material).:D


I also found that psychedelic amphetamines require me to eat prior to taking them - it eases the come up and the body load IME. Magnesium Citrate is very useful to preload with stuff like 3C-P or DOC. 

To counteract vasoconstriction, I recommend Arginine, garlic and cayenne pepper, cannabis and black chocolate are also good.


Besides evident music enhancements, 3C-P also makes quite unique color replacement visuals for me, especially pronounced if taken in combinations.8)

Great report, Volsam! I bet combining it with 4-HO-MiPT could be delightful. I have a buddy that loves combining it with mescaline, and this seems similar, but a lot less demanding

I personally find 4-HO-MiPT too stimulating to be comfortable combining it with 3C-P

Had my second trial with this one, at a low dose in a combo. Took 10 mg with 1.2 grams of Phenibut and 5 mg of 3-MeO-PCP taken in two doses at t+2 and t+3.5h. Pretty awesome party combo I would say. Felt first hints of the 3C-P at maybe 20 minutes in, but it developed reaaaalllyy sloooowly and gradually to a more defined something at t+3. At that point it was pretty much a rush of euphoria and excitement, music appreciation and color enhancement. Really subtle "empathogenic-like" qualities too. Lots of analytical extrospection and talkativeness. There were none of the uncomfortable side effects that I felt at 45 mg at all. 


I went to a metal show and had a blast. Smoked some weed there, psychedelic effects ramped up quite a bit, but headspace was coherent and semi-lucid throughout. Music enhancement was awesome, and background sensation was a controlled euphoria. Felt pretty energetic the whole experience. After the show went with the ladyfriend to a rave and danced that energy-superavit off. Started getting tired at 4 am, that was t+10h. Slept immediately with the help of 5 mg clotiazepam at t+11. I guess it wouldn't have been impossible to sleep without the benzo, but harder for sure. 


Got three hours of sleep and now feeling nothing close to a hangover. If anything, a mild afterglow, probably the PCP though. 


I'm finding this one a real winner, only kinda hard to get a grasp of. I think 20/25 mg would be my sweetspot for a hedonistic trippy stimulating high. Probably would pair it with Phenibut again, it nicely took the edge off. Felt way less hectic than my 45 mg trial on its own.

Phenibut is so great to combine with psychedelics, in fact with certain ones (DOC, AMT, etc, basically the long-acting stimulating ones) I rarely ever don't combine with phenibut.  Sounds like a nice experience. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I just ate 16mg of 3C-P, I'll report back. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Been meaning to try this for a long time, I did take 40mg one time like 5 years ago, but I was withdrawing from opiates and in a way different place, and all it did was make me feel anxious and give me a *raging* headache.  However I know the set and setting were very not ideal then, and I'm looking forward to seeing what the effects are of what I've surmised to be a solid low or medium-low dose.

I''d definitely be inclined to attribute much of your previous bad experience due to the psychedelic amplifying your withdrawal symptoms, which I'm sure were bad enough already. 


I think that should be right above microdose level and would love to hear more about how that went. Your reports are so wonderful and I recently got since of this stuff for myself, only had one trip at about 35mg insufflated that was good but felt a bit too strong to be able to go about my ordinary day as I'd prefer. I'm very interested in using lower doses (prob 20mg or below) as more of a general life enhancing stimulant with a little psychedelia, similar to microdosing acid or its analogs.

Almost forgot about this... the 16mg of 3C-P was nice, quite mild, it never became psychedelic, felt similar to a very low dose of LSD but slightly more stimulating.  It was nice, but next time I'll probably go for 25-30mg.  I took some notes for a report.  Nothing exciting but I might as well post it.


***15mg of 3C-P - First trial***


8:00am - Ingested 200mg of caffeine orally.


9:00am - Smoked a single hit of cannabis.


11:30pm - Ate a breakfast of 3 slices of polenta, a chicken sausage and 2 eggs.  Lightly full.


12:15pm (T+0:00) - Weighed out and ingested 16mg of shimmering white 3C-P crystals, by putting it on my tongue and letting the flavor develop.  Like its sibling 3C-E, 3C-P appears as shimmering, sparkly white flakes of crystal; I am unable to tell them apart in any way by sight.  Also like 3C-E, there is a sweetness to the taste, except that 3C-P is more bitter than sweet, somehow it is both at once, whereas 3C-E is almost entirely sweet, like an artificial sweetener.  The bitterness was pronounced enough to make me make a bit of a face, but much better than other phenethylamines I've tried.  I drank a few sips of water and swished it around, which left a bit of residual taste, but nothing to bother me and it faded in an additional minute or so.  I am at work (in other words, at home but with responsibilities), and I also need to do some minor home repairs.  It's a very light day at work with a creative side project to work on with no particular deadline.  I hope to get a lot done and explore 3C-P at a lower level.  I find 3C-E exceedingly good at this sort of task, basically functioning as a smooth, less dopaminergic version of amphetamine.  My expectation is for this to be trippier and perhaps less functional, but we'll see. 


1:15pm (T+1:00) - Faint alerts, I think I've been feeling them for a little bit.  Body warmth, hints of euphoria.  A few stomach butterflies, in a pleasant way.  I can't believe an hour has passed.  I feel slightly hungry again already after breakfast.  So far no anorexic effects at all.


1:30pm (T+1:15) - Smoked a cigarette, normally I wouldn't while home working but I felt like it.  I was about to go out and do some repairs including tightening up some steps and tightening some deck railings, but a summer storm hit.  Damn, hope it doesn't last too long.  I guess I'll start on that work project.  


2:15pm (T+2:00) - I am reminded of a half a tab of ALD-52 (~65ug), but there is a bit more tension and body energy.  Nothing negative about it, though.  I definitely feel like I'm on a low dose of a psychedelic.  There is a pleasant body high and a touch of light euphoria, and some energy.  I'm about to go do some of those repairs now.  Work tasks have not been impeded at all.  I just confirmed that I'll be getting together with my guitar player after work to do some recording for our 3 studio tracks we're working on.  He'll be recording guitar and I'll be playing the role of producer and manning the control room for him.  I may drink a few ciders, we'll see how I feel.  I've been trying to cut back on the number of nights I drink but I didn't yesterday.  Band nights are always a strong possibility that I might.


5:15pm (T+5:00) - I am still quite aware of the drug, but it has faded into a background buzz.  There was a period of time where I was at a strong +1, but it's now a standard +1, easily ignored but definitely present.  I am almost done with work, I found focusing a bit harder, because I would get bored and start browsing Bluelight.  I weighed out 12mg of 2C-C because I think I may want to boost this once I get to the studio.  So far this has been light and pleasant.  Next time I'll probably go for 25mg though and in a different setting.  This was really only intended to be a testing of the waters anyway.


The glow stayed with me all day, but never developed more so I didn't take any more notes and actually totally forgot about this until the thread got bumped.  I also never boosted with 2C-C.

So I was surprised to see this one reappear in the world again, at least according to some other forums. Funny, because I had planned to try it for the first time a week ago, but ended up throwing my back out instead. I had wanted to compare it with proscaline in back to back trials now that I'm ready to revisit proscaline. 


The place I was reading about it recommended it as a nasal spray as a substitute for stimulants in festival settings, perhaps in combination with LSD. I'm intrigued.

I can verify that it's out there again. Was kind of surprised to see it pop up.


That recommendation kind of sounds like it's referencing the sort of use in [the only trip report that existed on Erowid for a long time](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=50706). Unfortunately there's not a lot to get out of it.


I've taken 3C-P once at 25 mg and enjoyed it, though mostly because it had this deeply pleasurable sense of peace that I didn't find common to other phenethylamines (though it's notably the only 3,4,5-patterned one I've used so far). The body load was really heavy and nasty, though, I've gotten better at not getting body loads since then, so maybe it'd be nicer now. It felt a lot like other psychedelic amphetamines though unique in some ways, the visuals had a different color scheme and were more detailed in some ways, it actually reminded me of the 5-methoxytryptamines at some points in its subtle complexity. The headspace was also deeper and more contemplative like other psychedelic amphetamines as compared to the simpler psychedelic phenethylamines.


I'd also be curious how it compares to proscaline as I also have a little of that to work with.

I’ve only tried it once at 36mg but had some tolerance issues from 6 days prior. I was at threshold for the whole time, but I can say that that threshold felt *really good*. I’ll revisit it in the future when I can really get a feel for it


Add: The lab is clearly working with some 3,4,5 precursors and I really wish they’d explore some other ones besides this ![😕](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f615.png)

Starts from the same material as allylescaline, and I placed an inquiry about this and others with a source I’ve been working with. I’d certainly try some. That duration though, that’d make it holiday weekend-only kind of stuff for me, lol.

1.5g Phenibut + 10-20mg 3C-P a good idea for going out? I haven’t tried 3C-P on its own yet but judging from the reports it seems to be an interesting combination. Anyone experienced with low doses (+ Phenibut or Alcohol) for socializing, dancing, etc.?

3C-P is pretty chill, especially at that dosage.  I'd say it's a good candidate for psychedelic to use to go out.  And of course adding phenibut is going to make it even that much more easygoing and sociable.

Nice, how’s the bodyload at that dose? Do you think 15mg would be a satisfying dose in combination with Phenibut for a first timer?

I’m also contemplating on doing Phenibut + 4-FA, Phenibut + DOM (low-dose), or Phenibut + Etilamphetamine or Methamphetamine (oral), but I’m most intrigued by the Phenibut/3C-P combination.

Bodyload is light at that dose.  It does have a pretty strong body presence but I find it pleasant especially when you're physically active.  I think 15mg is a good starting dose.  It's going to give a sparkle and somewhat euphoric stimulation without being very intoxicating or strong.  probably no visuals at that dose but we all react differently.

It's going to give a sparkle and somewhat euphoric stimulation without being very intoxicating or strong.  probably no visuals at that dose but we all react differently.

Thank you very much! Sounds exactly like I was looking for. Think I’ll go for 15mg then.

lol quite okay! Was actually pretty mild at 40 mg, contrary to reports I read the peak didn't come on until about 5-6 hours in! Bodyload took about that long to set in too, it was most pleasant by about the 8 hour mark, wonderful sociable headspace, just a weird timeline overall and a quick descent to baseline by about 12 hours. Was much kinder to my body than expected (Mescaline analogues and substituted amphetamines never vibed well with my body, fully expected this to be an ordeal but it was fine, didn't even throw up or anything). Probably wouldn't try again at a higher dose though I think I got what I wanted. Warm psychedelic stimulation and headspace, little in the way of visuals or sensory effects. Very nice for chatting and joking, reminiscent of BOD, bk2c-B and ofc 3C-E but was unexpectedly gentler on my body than any of them.

*I found a report on another website, and wanted to repost it here for posterity.*


Not to be confused with 2C-P which apparently is nuclear and the way I dosed it (eyeballed it with a little scoop) would have landed me in la-la land in a jiffy.


Preface: I am horrified of psychedelics. I had a bad shroom trip many years ago and had panic attacks since which got me down a path of benzos and alcohol. Recently it turns out I actually have ADHD so I was kind of treating the wrong thing there, but point still stands that I can deal with visual distortions but when I start feeling like I'm losing my mind I go ahead and do.


3C-P is 80% stimulant (very similar to 3-MeO-TMP and 4F-MPH, closer to the former as it has more euphoria) and 20% psychedelic. It takes a LONG time to come on and when it does it feels not dissimilar to MDMA - eye twitching, serotonergic kind of kind happy feeling and mild visual distortions (breathing patterns on the floor, tracers, things like that) minus the 6 hour long full body orgasm thing.

I am not entirely sure how much I dosed myself - perhaps too little and it was a breakthrough dose but it felt very very kind and mild and mostly like a light amphetamine (think ritalin)


What's most interesting about it is that it allowed me to take some chaos in my life that's been happening and kind of... best way I can describe it instead of having folder 1,2,3 in sequence that I have to deal with - which is scary and overwhelming sometimes - it let me set up those ikea shelves that stick out the wall and give distance to problems so I was able to more clearly identify how to approach them. That particular day I had some commitments and while normally knowing I'd have to cancel would give me anxiety it was nothing: I just canceled them, rescheduled what I could and that was that. Because that problem was far away from others, on its own "shelf."


You will want to take a nap as it's a hazy, lazy amp high but you won't be able to. It's not a bad thing but just a heads up. Also, I started early in the morning around 8am and it maybe "let me go" around 9pm so be prepared for that. You won't be totally out of commission (I was able to have normal phone conversations) but as I said I may have under-dosed myself.


In any event, it's not a daily thing but it really helped me out - someone who is terrified of psychs - to sort somethings about positively and think about myself and others more patiently and kindly. Which is a last thing I expected from a stimulant.


Anyway I hope this helps someone. Look up dosages and weigh em out - don't do what I did and add 1-10mg over the course of a few hours. (it also has a particular texture that you want to powderize first - it's like little flakes that are hard to snatch. I found simply massaging the substance was enough)


Stay safe.

I have a 2mg doc blotter and want to mix it with 3c-p. The 3c-p first and then after around 10min the doc blotter. Does anybody can give an educated guess about the 3c-p dose to take with 2mg doc?

It's hard to say, I have never combined them.  I would keep the 3C-P pretty low, I'd be worried about overstimulation.  To me, DOC is more well-rounded and full in effects in every way, so the 3C-P seems kind of redundant, but maybe it will be a good combo.

I was looking up 3C-P reports recently on another forum and someone claimed that their friend passed away due to a heart complication after combining 3C-P and DXM. Sad as it is, I figured people over here should at least be aware of that. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Thanks [@ecstacylover](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/344631/). I don't know anything about the heart risk of DXM on its own, and its hard to say what the implications of this are without more incidents like it to draw a pattern from, but good to have the data so we can spot patterns if there is one. Hopefully sharing this tragedy can at least prevent another one down the road, if there is a risk there.


Having this thread pop back up on the forum was a good refresher on that corner of the phenethylamine world.

-3C-P is the amphetamine analog of Proscaline. Structurally, 3C-P is to Proscaline as DOC is to 2C-C

-The amphetamine analog of Mescaline is nicknamed [TMA](http://isomerdesign.com/PiHKAL/read.php?id=158&domain=pk). [TMA-2](http://isomerdesign.com/PiHKAL/read.php?id=158&domain=pk) was apparently the standout of that TMA series

-The TMA series is all of the different possible arrangements of 3 methoxy groups around the benzene ring on amphetamine.


I'm super curious to try TMA-2

DXM can cause serotonin syndrome with anything that releases serotonin... not saying that means 3C-P does, I mean it could be the case of a very unhealthy individual. 


Yeah, TMA-2 could also be called DOMeO.  It's a DOX in all but name, in fact it is the reason Shulgin started exploring the 2,4,5 substitution pattern.  2,4,5-dimethoxyamphetamine.  All the other TMAs have a different substitution pattern... the 2,4,5 is the jackpot (every 2C-X, every DOX, basically all of the best phenethylamines except mescaline).  Can't wait to try it, I have some but just haven't done it yet.

Another good reason to try this one - to trace Shulgin's path of discovery.

Interesting, so Shulgin explored TMA-2 prior to any of the 2C-X compounds?


Also, if you follow Shulgin's nomenclature for the 2C-T-X series, you would use 2C-O-X as a shorthand label for the 4-Alkoxy-2,5-DMPEA series. The 4-Alkoxy-2,5-DMA's can then be labeled as 3C-O-X compounds, which is a little strange (since Shulgin reserved the 3C-X convention for 3,5-DMA's), but this is the convention used in the recent literature.


The reason I mention the 2C-O-X compounds is that Shulgin mostly didn't explore them whatsoever. He tested 2C-O-4 and said


> with the probable low eventual potency of 2C-O-4, I feel that the 2C-O series will not be an exciting one.
> 		
> Click to expand...
The thing is, 2C-O-4 probably would've have been his last choice among the 2C-O-X compounds had he had access to data from recent binding assays, which show that its amphetamine homologue is among the least potent 5-HT2A agonists in the entire 3C-O-X series.


As far as I'm aware, the only other 2C-O-X that Shulgin tested is TMPEA, and although there were no adverse results reported, the commentary reveals another possible reason he didn't further pursue the 2C-O-X series.


> the simple compound that results from the stripping of all three of the O-methyl groups from TMPEA is the extremely potent neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine. When it is administered to an otherwise intact experimental animal, it produces sympathectomy, effectively destroying the sympathetic nervous system. And some of the methyl groups of TMPEA are known to be stripped off through the normal metabolic processes that occur in the liver. There are many fascinating psychedelics that have a signature of methoxyl groups para to one-another. It is known that they, too, can lose a methyl group or two. It would be intriguing to see if there was some biochemical overlap between the metabolism of some of these centrally active drugs and the metabolic fate of 6-hydroxydopamine. But in a test animal, of course, rather than in man.

> Click to expand...
Of course he mentions this right below his three TMPEA reports in humans. ![😅](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f605.png)


Among the 3C-O-X compounds, TMA-2, MEM, and MPM are the only ones that he confirms having assayed. Yet, others in this series (MMALM, MALM, and MTFEM) are anywhere from 10-100x more potent than TMA-2 as 5-HT2A agonists. OTOH, among the 2C-O-X compounds, 2C-O-3 and 2C-O-16 appear most promising.

Yes, from what I recall reading, he began his phenethylamine exploration by messing with the mescaline molecule (naturally).  One of those explorations was TMA, the amphetamine analogue of mescaline.  Then he started moving around the positions of the 3 methoxies to try every combination besides the 3,4,5 of mescaline.  He noticed that when he got to the 2,4,5 (TMA-2), the potency increased by a lot, and the activity became more interesting and deep.  From there he tried removing the oxygen, and got DOM.  Not sure whether the 2C-Xs came right after that or if that was a parallel course... I know 2C-D is called that (with a D instead of M) because it stood for "desoxy", so he must have first explored 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methoxyphenethylamine.  I'm not exactly sure of the order but I know he broke into the 2,4,5 substitution pattern (which is the bulk of the best of the phenethylamines) because of TMA-2.

Ahhh okay that makes a lot more sense. I always assumed he went to the 2C-X's after mescaline, 2C-B being his love child and all, but that's really not a natural progression come to think of it.

That's how I remember it too. His self-directed chemical exploration into so much uncharted terrain sure was a story worth telling. I love the image of the mountains on covers of his books, it's really appropriate; each chemical was like a summit that he bagged the first ascent on, and gave him a vista to the next peak to explore.

Hey, got a chance to order some of this. Hearing that it's like mescaline but with more empathogenic activity is really encouraging! A little bit worried it would show in a hair strand test as amphetamine, so I'll probably not be able to try it for 3 months.

Overall, it's worthwhile then???

Heya 

Recently got a small amount of this chem to try it out because it was pretty interesting to read about. 

Only saw a a couple mentions of intranasal use on the thread here and they seem to be a bit conflicting.

The oral dosage is quite long (although I would enjoy that), wondering if there is potential for another ROA.

Anyone have experience of intranasal dosing?

Has anyone tried boofing this or taking it innhalative / intranasally?


The extremely long time it takes to peak kinda discourages me.

Intranasal Phenethylamines in general have very few benefits over oral and overall not many redeeming qualities.


In fact, I've never had a worthwhile experience snorting any psychedelic phenethylamines.


But if you really want to do it, try at a small dose, as there's no known experience I have seen with intranasal. There were significant overdoses and hospitalisations with snorted 2C-T-7.


Take care and stay safe.

If you're looking for a shorter duration, you're far better off looking at something like 2C-B, which is more readily available than 3C-P.

I wanna try specifically 3C-P.

I'm fine with the long duration. It just seems not great that it peaks 3h after ingestion.


Boofing / inhaling could reduce the time it takes to peak.


Plus it'd be great if I needed less substance per trip.

Insufflation (or sublingual administration) are my preferred ROAs for 3C-E among the ones that I've tried (oral/rectal/sublingual/insufflation.) With it, the onset was still 40-60min, making titration a bit of a pain. I've never got around to pyrolization/vaporization, which might be easier to titrate. It's not really appropriate to try to extrapolate much on anything from 3C-E to 3C-P to be fair. Still, if I ever get around to trying 3C-P, I will probably insufflate it just to reduce the come up time. To Leprechaun's point, I'll probably stick to a low dose. Safety concerns aside, 3C-E and 3C-P sound like triphasic drugs. Only a fraction of the experience is actually psychedelic in most people's reports. Trying to maximize their psychedelic qualities seems like it leads to unsatisfactory trips combined with intensely stimulating tails. They might just be better as long-lasting, multiphasic euphoriants.
