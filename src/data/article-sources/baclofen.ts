## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as gamma amino acids and derivatives. These are amino acids having a (-NH2) group attached to the gamma carbon atom.

### Background

Baclofen is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist used as a skeletal muscle relaxant. Although originally designed in 1962 to treat epilepsy, baclofen was not effective in treating this condition but instead was shown to reduce spasticity in selected patients.
8
Baclofen was reintroduced in 1971 as a treatment for spasticity and was later approved by the FDA in 1977.
6
,
8
Baclofen is used to manage severe muscle spasms of cerebral or spinal cord origins, including multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury.
11
Baclofen was investigated for use in alcohol dependence and withdrawal; however, evidence is limited and there is inconsistent evidence to suggest its clinical efficacy in managing alcohol dependence or withdrawal symptoms.

### Indication

Oral baclofen is indicated for the treatment of spasticity resulting from multiple sclerosis and is particularly useful for the relief of flexor spasms and concomitant pain, clonus, and muscular rigidity. It may also be used to treat patients with spinal cord injuries and other spinal cord diseases. Baclofen should not be used to treat skeletal muscle spasms resulting from rheumatic disorders.
12
Intrathecal baclofen is also indicated for the management of severe spasticity of the cerebral or spinal original in patients 4 years of age and older. It is reserved for patients unresponsive to oral baclofen therapy, or those who experience intolerable central nervous system side effects at effective doses. For use in spasticity due to traumatic brain injury, baclofen should be considered after at least one year of injury.
11

### Pharmacodynamics

Baclofen is an antispasmodic agent that induces muscle relaxation. It reduces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters in the pre-synaptic neurons and stimulates inhibitory neuronal signals in the post-synaptic neurons.
6
Oral formulations of baclofen are the most commonly used form of the drug. In one cross-section study, intrathecal baclofen was more effective than oral baclofen in relieving spasticity directly at the level of the spinal cord.
8
Baclofen has CNS depression properties and can cause sedation with tolerance, somnolence, ataxia, and respiratory and cardiovascular depression.
13
Baclofen also mediates some antinociceptive effects and stimulates gastric acid secretion.
15
Baclofen exhibits anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities: it inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from microglia and astrocytes, and decreases oxidative stress in rats.

### Absorption

Baclofen has an oral bioavailability of 70% to 85%. Following oral administration, it is rapidly absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract with peak plasma concentrations being reached two to three hours after ingestion.
6
Peak effect is observed about four hours after intrathecal administration.
8
The absorption is dose-dependent and increases with higher doses.
6
There is intersubject variation in absorption.
13
Administration of oral baclofen suspension with a high-fat meal resulted in 9% decrease in AUC and 33% decrease in C
max
compared to the fasted state.
13

### Metabolism

Approximately 15% of the oral dose is metabolized in the liver, mainly by deamination.
8
Deamination yields the main metabolite, β-(p-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxybutyric acid, which is pharmacologically inactive.

### Half-life

The half-life is 2-6 hours after oral administration and 1-5 hours following intrathecal administration.
8
The apparent elimination half-life of baclofen oral suspension or granules is about 5.6 hours.
13

### Toxicity

The oral LD
50
in rats is 145 mg/kg.
14
Baclofen withdrawal symptoms typically occur within hours to days following interruption of either oral or intrathecal drug formulations.
8
Abrupt discontinuation of baclofen is not advised.
11
Clinical manifestations of baclofen overdose may include altered mental status, somnolence, seizure, hypothermia, respiratory depression, and coma. Overdose from baclofen oral tablets resulted in vomiting, lightheadedness, drowsiness, muscular hypotonia, accommodation disorders, coma, respiratory depression, and seizures.
6
,
13
Most overdose symptoms are neurological but uncommon cardiovascular effects such as hypertension, bradycardia, and tachycardia may be observed.
9
In case of overdose, symptomatic treatment and gastric decontamination should be initiated. When the patient is alert, gastric emptying should be performed by inducing emesis and then performing lavage while maintaining an adequate airway and respiration. Emesis should not be induced in unconscious patients.

### Mechanism of action

The exact mechanism of action of baclofen is unclear. Baclofen is an agonist at the beta subunit of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors expressed on pre- and post-synaptic neurons.
3
Upon binding to GABA
B
receptors, baclofen causes an influx of potassium into the neuron, leading to hyperpolarization of the neuronal membrane and decreased calcium influx at presynaptic nerve terminals. This results in a decreased rate of action potential threshold being reached by presynaptic neurons and reduced action potential of postsynaptic motor neurons that innervate the muscle spindles. Baclofen thereby inhibits the transmission of both mono- and polysynaptic reflexes at the spinal cord, relaxing spasticity.
8
Baclofen may act on some voltage-gated calcium channels; however, the clinical significance of this is unclear.

### Volume of distribution

The volume of distribution of baclofen is 0.7 L/kg.
15
As baclofen is mainly water-soluble, it does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.
7
Drug concentrations of baclofen in the cerebrospinal fluid are approximately 8.5 times lower than in the plasma.
15

### Protein binding

The protein binding is approximately 30%.
15

### Route of elimination

About 70-80% of baclofen is eliminated in an unchanged form by renal excretion
6
,
8
within 72 hours of administration. About 5% of the dose is excreted via the kidneys as metabolites.
15
There is intersubject variation in elimination.
13

### Clearance

The systemic clearance (CL/F) was 180 mL/min and the renal clearance was 103 mL/min following oral administration.

### Pharmacological action

Unknown

### Actions

Allosteric modulator

### General Function

Receptor for the C-X-C chemokine CXCL12/SDF-1 that transduces a signal by increasing intracellular calcium ion levels and enhancing MAPK1/MAPK3 activation (PubMed:10452968, PubMed:18799424, PubMed:24912431, PubMed:28978524). Involved in the AKT signaling cascade (PubMed:24912431). Plays a role in regulation of cell migration, e.g. during wound healing (PubMed:28978524). Acts as a receptor for extracellular ubiquitin; leading to enhanced intracellular calcium ions and reduced cellular cAMP levels (PubMed:20228059). Binds bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) et mediates LPS-induced inflammatory response, including TNF secretion by monocytes (PubMed:11276205). Involved in hematopoiesis and in cardiac ventricular septum formation. Also plays an essential role in vascularization of the gastrointestinal tract, probably by regulating vascular branching and/or remodeling processes in endothelial cells. Involved in cerebellar development. In the CNS, could mediate hippocampal-neuron survival (By similarity)

**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) , [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) or [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Baclofen** (also known as **Lioresal** , **Gablofen** , **Kemstro** , **Liofen** ) is a [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) substance of the [butyric acid](/w/index.php?title=Butyric_acid&action=edit&redlink=1) class. It is a derivative of [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) and is chemically related to [phenibut](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenibut) , [pregabalin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pregabalin) , and [gabapentin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentin) . It primarily acts as a [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) B [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) .

Baclofen was synthesized in 1962 at Ciba-Geigy, a Swiss pharmaceutical company. Today, it is used clinically to treat muscle spasticity, and holds promise as a treatment for [alcoholism](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcoholism) .

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) , [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , and moderate [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . It is usually described as somewhat similar to [phenibut](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenibut) in its effects. It is reported to have lower recreational effects such as euphoria compared to depressants like [alprazolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alprazolam) .

Baclofen has moderate abuse potential and produces physical dependence with chronic use. Once physical dependence to a GABAergic substance occurs, the user cannot stop use abruptly without risking withdrawal symptoms such as [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , muscle tremors, and in severe cases, seizures.

It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## History and culture

Baclofen was synthesized in 1962 by Heinrich Keberle at Ciba (pharmaceutical company) in Basel, Switzerland, based on the idea of enhancing the lipophilicity of GABA in order to achieve penetration of the blood-brain barrier. It was marketed as **Lioresal** in 1972.

In his 2008 book, *Le Dernier Verre* (translated literally as "The Last Glass" and published in English as "The End of my Addiction"), French-American cardiologist Olivier Ameisen described how he treated his alcoholism with baclofen. Inspired by this book, an anonymous donor gave \$750,000 to the University of Amsterdam to initiate a clinical trial of high-dose baclofen, which Ameisen had called for since 2004.

## Chemistry

Baclofen is a derivative of γ-aminobutyric acid ( [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) ), except with a chlorine-substituted phenyl group in the β-position of the molecule.

It has an almost identical chemical structure to [F-phenibut](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/F-phenibut) (only replacing a fluorine with a chlorine atom in the para-position of the phenyl group).

It is a chiral molecule and thus has two potential configurations as (R)- and (S)-enantiomers.

Baclofen is a white (or sometimes off-white) mostly odorless crystalline powder, with a molecular weight of 213.66 g/mol and it is somewhat soluble in water.

## Pharmacology

Baclofen produces its effects by activating the [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) B [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) , similar to the drug [phenibut](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenibut) which also activates this [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) and shares some of its effects. Baclofen is postulated to block mono-and-polysynaptic reflexes by acting as an inhibitory ligand, inhibiting the release of excitatory [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) .

Similarly to [phenibut](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenibut) (β-phenyl-GABA), as well as [pregabalin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pregabalin) (β-isobutyl-GABA), which are close analogues of baclofen, baclofen (β-(4-chlorophenyl)-GABA) has been found to block α2δ subunit-containing voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). However, it is weaker relative to phenibut in this action (Ki = 23 and 39 μM for R- and S-phenibut and 156 μM for baclofen).

Moreover, baclofen is in the range of 100-fold more potent by weight as an agonist of the [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) B receptor in comparison to [phenibut](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenibut) , and in accordance, is used at far lower relative dosages. As such, the actions of baclofen on α2δ subunit-containing VGCCs are likely not clinically-relevant.

The drug is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and is widely distributed throughout the body. Biotransformation is low: the drug is predominantly excreted unchanged by the kidneys.

## Subjective effects

Baclofen is often compared to [phenibut](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenibut) , but more "messy", less [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoric) , [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) , and causing a stronger [dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness) .

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** and **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - Baclofen has different effects on physical energy levels depending on the dosage used.

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: Baclofen](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Pharms_Baclofen.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

Baclofen has a low toxicity relative to dose. However, it is potentially [lethal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) when mixed with [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) like [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) .

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

Baclofen is moderately physically and psychologically addictive. Discontinuation of baclofen can be associated with a withdrawal syndrome which resembles [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) [withdrawal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal) and [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely if baclofen is used for long periods of time (more than a couple of weeks) and can occur from low or high doses.

The severity of baclofen withdrawal depends on the rate at which it is discontinued. Abrupt withdrawal is more likely to result in severe withdrawal symptoms. Acute withdrawal symptoms can be stopped by recommencing baclofen.

Tolerance will develop to the sedative-hypnotic effects within a couple of days of continuous use. After cessation, the tolerance returns to baseline in 7 - 14 days.

Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing usage abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing and may necessitate a [gradual dose reduction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tapering) . Withdrawal symptoms may include [auditory hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations) , [visual hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinations) , [tactile hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_hallucinations) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium) , [disorientation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disorientation) , fluctuation of consciousness, [insomnia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insomnia) , [dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness) , [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , [inattention](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_suppression) , [memory impairments](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression) , perceptual disturbances, [itchiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Itchiness) , [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [depersonalization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depersonalization) , hypertonia, [hyperthermia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hyperthermia) , [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) , mood disturbances, [tachycardia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tachycardia) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , tremors, autonomic dysfunction, hyperpyrexia (fever), extreme muscle rigidity resembling [neuroleptic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) malignant syndrome and rebound spasticity.

Baclofen produces cross-tolerance with all [GABAgenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) depressants, meaning that after its consumption, depressants will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Depressants** ( *[1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) , [2M2B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2M2B) , Alcohol, Benzodiazepines, Barbiturates, GHB/GBL, Methaqualone, Opioids* ) - This combination can result in dangerous or even fatal levels of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . These substances potentiate the [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) and [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) caused by one another and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. There is also an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If this occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - This combination can result in an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and dying from the resulting suffocation. If a sudden loss of consciousness occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - It is dangerous to combine baclofen with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) due to the risk of excessive intoxication. Stimulants mask the [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) effect of baclofen, which is the main factor most people consider when determining their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the effects of baclofen will be significantly increased, leading to intensified [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) as well as [other effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Baclofen#Subjective_effects) . If combined, one should strictly limit themselves to only dosing a certain amount of baclofen per hour. This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if hydration is not monitored.

Baclofen is a GABA-like drug that has been used for decades in the treatment of spasticity. It has muscle relaxant, anxiolytic, and sedative properties.

Outside of its medical use for spasticity, it has been researched as a possible treatment for alcohol dependence.

The drug is sometimes taken in non-medical settings because it can provide anxiety reduction, sedation, and some euphoria. It’s usually described as somewhat similar to phenibut in its effects.

Baclofen, sold under the brand name Lioresal among others, is a medication used to treat muscle spasticity, such as from a spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis. It may also be used for hiccups and muscle spasms near the end of life, and off-label to treat alcohol use disorder or opioid withdrawal symptoms. It is taken orally or by intrathecal pump (delivered into the spinal canal via an implantable pump device). It is sometimes used transdermally (applied topically to the skin) in combination with gabapentin and clonidine prepared at a compounding pharmacy. It is believed to work by decreasing levels of certain neurotransmitters.
Baclofen should be avoided in the setting of chronic kidney disease and end stage renal disease as even small doses can cause excessive toxicity. Common side effects include sleepiness, weakness, and dizziness. Serious side effects, such as seizures and rhabdomyolysis, may occur if use of baclofen is stopped abruptly. Use during pregnancy is of unclear safety, whilst use during breastfeeding is likely safe, and even more so if oral administration is avoided.
The adverse effects and safety profile associated with baclofen when it is combined with sedative drugs (for example alcohol or benzodiazepines) range depending on the dose and the individual. The interaction may increase the sedative effects of all ingested sedatives and as such is not generally recommended. In high doses the interaction can cause de novo seizures.
Baclofen was approved for medical use in the United States in 1977. It is available as a generic medication. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2023, it was the 87th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7 million prescriptions.

## Medical uses

Baclofen is primarily used for the treatment of spastic movement disorders, especially in instances of spinal cord injury, and multiple sclerosis. Use in people with stroke, cerebral palsy, or Parkinson's disease is not recommended. Intrathecal baclofen is used for severe spasticity of spinal cord origin, that is refractive to maximum doses of oral antispasmodic agents, or who experience intolerable side effects.
Baclofen may be used off-label as a treatment for alcohol use disorder to reduce the risk of relapse, and to increase the number of days that a person can go without drinking alcohol (abstinence days).
It is sometimes used for the treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms, and may be superior for this purpose to the more-commonly used clonidine.
Baclofen is also used in the treatment of sleep-related painful erections.

## Adverse effects

Adverse effects include drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, fatigue, headache, trouble sleeping, nausea and vomiting, poor concentration and recall (resembling dementia), urinary retention, or constipation.

### Withdrawal syndrome

Discontinuation of baclofen can be associated with a withdrawal syndrome which resembles benzodiazepine withdrawal and alcohol withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely if baclofen is administered intrathecally or for long periods of time (more than a couple of months) and can occur from low or high doses. The severity of baclofen withdrawal depends on the rate at which it is discontinued. Thus to minimise withdrawal symptoms, the dose should be tapered down slowly when discontinuing baclofen therapy. Abrupt withdrawal is more likely to result in severe withdrawal symptoms. Acute withdrawal symptoms can be eased or completely reversed by re-initiating therapy with baclofen.
Withdrawal symptoms may include auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, tactile hallucinations, delusions, confusion, agitation, delirium, disorientation, fluctuation of consciousness, insomnia, dizziness, nausea, inattention, memory impairments, perceptual disturbances, itching, anxiety, depersonalization, hypertonia, hyperthermia (higher than normal temperature without infection), formal thought disorder, psychosis, mania, mood disturbances, restlessness, and behavioral disturbances, tachycardia, seizures, tremors, autonomic dysfunction, hyperpyrexia (fever), extreme muscle rigidity resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome and rebound spasticity.

### Abuse

Baclofen, at standard dosing, does not appear to possess addictive properties, and has not been associated with any degree of drug craving. Euphoria is however listed as a common to very common side-effect of baclofen in the BNF 75. There are very few cases of abuse of baclofen for reasons other than attempted suicide. In contrast to baclofen, another GABAB receptor agonist, γ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), has been associated with euphoria, abuse, and addiction. These effects are likely mediated not by activation of the GABAB receptor, but rather by activation of the GHB receptor. Baclofen possesses both sedative and anxiolytic properties.

## Overdose

Reports of overdose indicate that baclofen may cause symptoms including vomiting, general weakness, sedation, respiratory insufficiency, seizures, dizziness, headaches, itching, hypothermia, bradycardia, cardiac conduction abnormalities, hypertension, hyporeflexia and coma sometimes mimicking brain death. Overdose may require intubation and length of mechanical ventilation required may correlate with serum baclofen levels shortly after ingestion. Symptoms may persist even after the point at which serum baclofen levels are undetectable.

## Pharmacology

Chemically, baclofen is a derivative of the neurotransmitter γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA). It is believed to work by activating (or agonizing) GABA receptors, specifically the GABAB receptors.

### Pharmacodynamics

Baclofen produces its effects by selectively activating the GABAB receptor. Baclofen is postulated to block mono-and-polysynaptic reflexes by acting as an inhibitory ligand, inhibiting the release of excitatory neurotransmitters. Baclofen does not have significant affinity for the GHB receptor, and has no known abuse potential. Agonism of GABAB receptors is thought to be responsible for baclofen's range of therapeutic properties, as GABAB knockout mice are unresponsive to the neurobiological effects of baclofen.
Similarly to phenibut (β-phenyl-GABA), as well as pregabalin (β-isobutyl-GABA), which are close analogues of baclofen, baclofen (β-(4-chlorophenyl)-GABA) has been found to block α2δ subunit-containing voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). However, it is weaker relative to phenibut in this action (Ki = 23 and 39 μM for R- and S-phenibut and 156 μM for baclofen). Moreover, baclofen is in the range of 100-fold more potent by weight as an agonist of the GABAB receptor in comparison to phenibut, and in accordance, is used at far lower relative dosages. As such, the actions of baclofen on α2δ subunit-containing VGCCs are likely not clinically relevant.
For drug-reward and addiction, baclofen's mechanism of action is thought to be through its effect on the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, specifically leading to a decrease in dopamine release associated with alcohol. GABAB receptor activation (GABAB receptor agonist activity) may decrease or inhibit alcohol's ability to activate or fire dopaminergic neurons following exposure to alcohol. Baclofen's mechanism of action when used to treat alcohol use disorder is not thought to be mediated through its muscle-relaxing or sedative properties, however there is evidence to suggest that the GABAB receptor-activation in the limbus may also reduce feelings of anxiety in people with alcohol use disorder.

### Pharmacokinetics

The drug is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and is widely distributed throughout the body. Biotransformation is low: the drug is predominantly excreted unchanged by the kidneys. The serum half-life of baclofen is roughly 2–4 hours; however, one source gives a half-life of 6.8 hr, using a more complex calculation combining urinary and serum data. It therefore needs to be administered frequently throughout the day to control spasticity appropriately.

## Chemistry

Baclofen is a white (or off-white) mostly odorless crystalline powder, with a molecular weight of 213.66 g/mol. It is slightly soluble in water, very slightly soluble in methanol, and insoluble in chloroform. It is classified as a Gabapentinoid medication.

## History

Historically, baclofen was designed as a drug for treating epilepsy. It was first synthesized at Ciba-Geigy by the Swiss chemist Heinrich Keberle in 1962. Its effect on epilepsy was ineffective, but it was found that in certain people, spasticity decreased. In 1971, it was introduced as a treatment for certain form of spasticity. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1977.
Intrathecal baclofen was first introduced in 1984 to treat severe spinal spasticity. This administration route aimed to avoid supraspinal side effects.

## Society and culture

### Routes of administration

Baclofen can be administered, orally, intrathecally (directly into the cerebral spinal fluid) using a pump implanted under the skin, or transdermally as part of a pain-relieving and muscle-relaxing topical cream mix (also containing gabapentin and clonidine) prepared at a compounding pharmacy.
Intrathecal pumps offer much lower doses of baclofen because they are designed to deliver the medication directly to the spinal fluid rather than going through the digestive and blood system first. A drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid more than 10 times greater than when given orally is achieved with this route. At the same time the blood concentration levels are almost undetectable, thus minimizing side effects.
Besides those with spasticity, intrathecal administration is also used in patients with cerebral palsy or multiple sclerosis who have severe painful spasms which are not controllable by oral baclofen. With pump administration, a test dose is first injected into the spinal fluid to assess the effect, and if successful in relieving spasticity, a chronic intrathecal catheter is inserted from the spine through the abdomen and attached to the pump which is implanted under the abdomen's skin, usually by the ribcage. The pump is computer-controlled for automatic dosage and its reservoir can be replenished by percutaneous injection. The pump also has to be replaced every five to seven years or so.

## Research

Baclofen is being studied for the treatment of alcoholism. Evidence as of 2019 is not conclusive enough to recommend its use for this purpose. In 2014, the French drug agency ANSM issued a three-year temporary recommendation allowing the use of baclofen in alcoholism. In 2018, baclofen received a Marketing Authorization for use in alcoholism treatment from the agency if all other treatments are not effective.
It is being studied along with naltrexone and sorbitol for Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT), a hereditary disease that causes peripheral neuropathy. It is also being studied for cocaine addiction. Baclofen and other muscle relaxants are being studied for potential use for persistent hiccups.
From 2014 to 2017, baclofen misuse, toxicity and use in suicide attempts among adults in the US increased.
In his 2008 book, Le Dernier Verre (translated literally as The Last Glass or The End of My Addiction), French-American cardiologist Olivier Ameisen described how he treated his alcoholism with baclofen. Inspired by this book, an anonymous donor gave \$750,000 to the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands to initiate a clinical trial of high-dose baclofen, which Ameisen had called for since 2004. The researchers concluded, "In summary, the current study did not find evidence of a positive effect of either low or high doses of baclofen in AD patients. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that baclofen is an effective medication for the treatment of severe, heavy drinking AD patients not responding to or not accepting routine psychosocial interventions."
