## Subjective Experience

Ketamine emerged as a recreational drug in the 1990’s, having been first synthesised
in 1962. It was scheduled in the United States in 1999 and classified under the UK’s
Misuse of Drugs Act in 2006. It remains the most famed and popular dissociative.

Its effects are reported to vary according to dose. The most intense state, on a large
dose, is known as a k-hole. This is an extremely subjective state of mental
dissociation from the body, which has been compared to near-death and out-of-body
experiences. The world becomes increasingly distorted and distant, time is
suspended, and hallucination or indescribable perceptions may ensue, along with a
sense of disorientation and derealization.

Every k-hole experience will be individual, with factors such as personal psychology,
brain chemistry, physiology, set and setting, and personality, all being pertinent. It is
not an exploit that should be contemplated lightly, or without significant research
and investigation, and is certainly not one for the inexperienced.

It should be stressed here that the k-hole is not the normal or usual recreational
ketamine pursuit. This is achieved at much lower doses, which invoke a variety of
interesting experiences.

In this respect, it is important to take care not to overdose and enter the k-hole
unintentionally, particularly in a public or insecure location. This can result in
serious consequences.

If you are intent on using ketamine, my advice is to play in the shallow end, dose with
caution, and avoid use with other drugs. Larger doses should only be considered on
the basis of planning and preparation, and with a specific and clear objective.

Regarding my experiment, the dealer described his supply as 83% Pure S-Ketamine,
and was predictably positive regarding its quality, claiming that it was "about twice
as potent as racemic ketamine" (racemic being the other type of ketamine).

With respect to the thresholds suggested across the Internet and given my experience
with other dissociatives, 50mg seemed to be a reasonable first time dose. I measure
this in preparation.

```
T+0:00 I snort the 50mg line. [4:42pm]
```
```
T+0:05 I am starting to sense some minor changes in perception.
```
```
T+0:10 The show is definitely on the road now. I am feeling a rather disjointed
headspace, as visually everything seems to be a little weird and slightly off-
key, but in a comfortable way.
```
```
Any concerns I had about taking ketamine have already dissipated under its
influence.
```
```
T+0:15 I am still entirely functional, even though I am not fully with it. For no
particular reason I check my eyes in the mirror: the pupils are normal.
```
```
My body feels a little numb, perhaps a little detached: it is fully operational
but the numbness is obvious. For example, hitting the keyboard to type these
words seems awkward, with my fingers feeling strange and too large. Walking
around the room produces a smooth floating impression.
```
```
T+0:20 The headspace bears definite resemblance to the other dissociatives I
have sampled. I am inside a zone, but looking through it into the external
world. None of this is disagreeable however. I am generally relaxed.
```
```
T+0:25 This is quite strong now. I can still, functionally, talk and type, using
auto-pilot, but the headspace is intense in a way that is hard to describe. The
thought occurs that I can almost feel my brain as an individual organ, which is
obviously bizarre.
```

```
At the same time, the degree of numbness of the rest of my body has further
increased.
```
```
T+0:30 I sense that I have found a plateau, in that the experience has stopped
intensifying, and I have come to terms with its effects. The physical aspect,
largely the insentience, is similar to other chemicals in this class, but it seems
to be more apparent. Predictably, the experience has also developed much
more quickly than the others, which were all ingested orally.
```
```
T+0:40 I play some music to test audio. Pink Floyd is a standard test, and in a
bizarre manifestation of synchronicity, Comfortably Numb appears on
YouTube as a suggestion. The listening experience is not particularly
enhanced, so I elect to return to silence and self
