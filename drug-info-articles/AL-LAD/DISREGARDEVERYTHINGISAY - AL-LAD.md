**6-allyl-6-nor-lysergic acid diethylamide** (abbreviated **AL-LAD**, also known as **Aladdin**) is a semi-synthetic hallucinogenic psychedelic drug of the lysergamide family, as described by Alexander Shulgin in the book TiHKAL (Tryptamines i Have Known And Loved).

This substance has little to no history of human usage. However, it has recently become commonly marketed along side of LSZ as a legal alternative to LSD through online research chemical vendors.

In terms of its chemistry, the molecule differs in structure to LSD by the simple replacement of the methyl group with an allyl group at the 6th nitrogen. Lysergamides are distinct from both tryptamines and phenethylamines, although the chemical structure is more similar to a tryptamine than a phenethylamine.

In terms of its pharmacology, AL-LAD acts as a 5-HT2A partial agonist. The psychedelic effects are believed to come from AL-LAD’s efficacy at the 5-HT2A receptors. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

AL-LAD shares many common traits with LSD; it appears to be equal in potency as well as similar in mechanism. However, the progression and duration of effects are compressed due to its metabolic differences.

While the subjective effects are almost identical to that of LSD, AL-LAD is significantly shorter in its duration. In comparison to its structural relative LSZ, it is reported to be more introspective and stoning. It therefore comparatively lies on the opposite end of the spectrum of effects which most lysergamides are capable of producing.

The effects listed below are based upon the [subjective effects index](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index) and personal experiences of [PsychonautWiki](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) contributors. The listed effects will rarely if ever occur all at once but heavier dosages will increase the chances and are more likely to induce a full range of effects.

**Physical Effects:**

- **[Spontaneous tactile sensations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Spontaneous_tactile_sensations)** - The “body high” of AL-LAD can be described as proportionally intense in comparison to its accompanying visual and cognitive effects. It behaves as a euphoric, fast moving, sharp and location specific tingling sensation. For some it is manifested spontaneously at different unpredictable points throughout the trip, but for most it maintains a steady presence that rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. At moderate to high doses of AL-LAD, this sensation will usually hit its highest level and become so overwhelming that people find themselves writhing on the floor in complete pleasure.
- [Stimulation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Stimulation) - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, AL-LAD is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating without being forced. For example, when taken in any environment it will usually encourage physical activities such as running, walking, climbing or dancing. In comparison, other more commonly used psychedelics such as psilocin are generally sedating and relaxing.
- **[Nausea](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Nausea)** - Mild nausea is occasionally reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes instantly once the tripper has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Enhancement of touch ](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Enhancement_of_touch)**- Feelings of enhanced tactile sensation are consistently present at moderate levels throughout most AL-LAD trips. Once [level 8A geometry](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_geometry_%28psychedelic%29#7A_-_Exposure_to_entirety_of_neurological_structure) is reached, an intense sensation of suddenly becoming aware of and being able to feel every single nerve ending across a person’s entire body all at once is consistently present.
- **[Increased bodily control](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Increased_bodily_control)**

**Cognitive Effects:**

The cognitive effects of AL-LAD can be broken down into 14 components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. In comparison to other psychedelics such as Psilocin, LSA and Ayahuasca, AL-LAD is significantly more stimulating and fast paced in terms of the specific style of thought stream which it produces and contains a large number of potential effects.

The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include:

- **[Enhancement of current mind state](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Enhancement_of_current_mind_state)**
- [Acceleration of thought](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Acceleration_of_thought)
- [Feelings of fascination, importance and awe](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Feelings_of_fascination,_importance_and_awe)
- [Time distortion](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Time_distortion)
- [Introspection](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Introspection)
- [Deja-Vu](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Deja-Vu)
- [Multiple thought streams](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Multiple_thought_streams)
- [Removal of cultural filter](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Removal_of_cultural_filter)
- [Conceptual thinking](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Conceptual_thinking)
- [Ego suppression, loss and death](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Ego_suppression,_loss_and_death)
- [Thought loops](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Thought_loops)
- [Feelings of interdependent opposites](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Feelings_of_interdependent_opposites)
- [Delusions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Delusions)
- [States of unity and interconnectedness](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_States_of_unity_and_interconnectedness)

**Visual effects:**

*Enhancements*

AL-LAD presents a full and complete array of visual enhancements which generally includes:

- **[Increased visual acuity](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Increased_visual_acuity)**
- **[Enhancement of colour](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Enhancement_of_colour)**
- **[Enhanced pattern recognition](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Enhanced_pattern_recognition)**

*Distortions*

AL-LAD presents a full and complete array of visual distortions which generally include:

- **[Visual drifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting)*****([Melting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting#Melting), [Breathing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting#Breathing), [Morphing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting#Morphing) and [Flowing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting#Flowing))***- In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed yet cartoon-like in appearance. The distortions are slow and smooth in motion and fleeting in their appearance.
- [Tracers](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Tracers)
- [After images](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_After_images)
- [Depth Perception Distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Depth_perception_distortions)
- [Symmetrical texture repetition](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Symmetrical_texture_repetition)
- [Colour shifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Colour_shifting)
- [Scenery slicing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Scenery_slicing)

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of 2C-B or 2C-I than Psilocin, LSA or DMT. It can be comprehensively described through its variations as primarily intricate in complexity, algorithmic in form, unstructured in organization, brightly lit, colourful in scheme, organic in feel, multicoloured in scheme, flat in shading, soft in its edges, large in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, round in its corners, unimmersive in depth and consistent in intensity. At higher dosages, it consistently results in states of Level 8A visual geometry over Level 8B.

*Hallucinatory States*

AL-LAD is capable of producing a full range of low and high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is significantly less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. These effects include:

- **[Transformations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Transformations)**
- [Internal hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations) ([Autonomous entities](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Autonomous_entities), [Settings, sceneries, and landscapes](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes),[Alterations in perspective](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Alterations_in_perspective) and [Scenarios and plots](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Scenarios_and_plots)) - Although AL-LAD is technically capable of producing hallucinatory states in a fashion that is on par with psilocin or DMT in its vividness and intensity, these effects are extremely rare and inconsistent in comparison. Whilst traditional psychedelics such as LSA, Ayahuasca and Mescaline will induce internal hallucinations near consistently at level 5 geometry and above, AL-LAD will for most simply go straight into Level 8A visual geometry. This lack of consistently induced hallucinatory breakthroughs means that for most, AL-LAD is simply not as deep of an experience as certain other psychedelics. On the rare occasion that they are induced however, they can be comprehensively described in terms of their variations as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability and geometry-based in appearance.

**Auditory Effects:**

The auditory effects of AL-LAD are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly includes:

- **[Enhancements](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_effects:_Enhancements)**
- **[Distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_effects:_Distortions)**
- **[Hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_effects:_Hallucinations)**

**Physical Health Effects, Potential Addiction and Tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational AL-LAD use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because AL-LAD is a research chemical with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people within the psychedelic community who have tried AL-LAD suggests that there is no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

AL-LAD is non-habit forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

An almost immediate tolerance is built to AL-LAD after ingestion, preventing one from experiencing its full effects more often than every 4-7 days unless they increase their dose significantly.

**Legal issues:**

AL-LAD is currently a legal research chemical in the UK, however it is illegal in the US under the analogue act when sold for human consumption. It is unclear in many countries whether it is legal or not and one should take precaution and assume it is illegal to avoid legal issues.

On June 10th, 2014 the UK ACMD recommended that AL-LAD be specifically named in the UK Misuse of Drugs Act as a class A drug despite not identifying any harm associated with its use.[2]

**Conclusion:**

AL-LAD induces a worthwhile lysergamide experience which can be described as almost indistinguishable from that of LSD although with a much shorter duration. It is a trip which is equally compatible for both recreational and spiritual settings. I would recommend this substance to anybody who is interested in experiencing a somewhat legal alternative to LSD.
