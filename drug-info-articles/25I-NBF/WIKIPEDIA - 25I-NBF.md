25I-NBF (2C-I-NBF, NBF-2C-I, Cimbi-21) is a derivative of the phenethylamine hallucinogen 2C-I, which acts as a highly potent partial agonist for the human 5-HT2A receptor, with bias towards the β-arrestin 2 coupled signalling pathway. It has been studied in its 11C radiolabelled form as a potential ligand for mapping the distribution of 5-HT2A receptors in the brain, using positron emission tomography (PET).
