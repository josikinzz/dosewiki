## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 12 mg) âComes on smoothly, nicely. In 40 minutes I feel nice euphoria, feel home again. Then I begin to get uncomfortable feelings. Gets more and more uncomfortable, feel I am sitting on a big problem. Blood pressure, pulse, go up considerably. Have hard time communicating, lie down for a while, get insight that most important thing for me to do is learn to listen, pay attention to what is going on. I do this the rest of the day, at first with considerable difficulty, then easier and easier. Discomfort stays with me for several hours, and although I get more comfortable towards the end of the day, I am never animated or euphoric. I feel very humbled, that I have a great deal to work out in my life. The next day I find myself very strong and empowered. I see that all I have to do is let things be as they are! This feels marvelous, and a whole new way to beâmuch more relaxed, accepting, being in the moment. No more axes to grind. I can be free.â

(with 18 mg) âI found myself with complete energy. I was completely centered with an absolute minimum of the dark edges that so often appear as components of these experiences. The ease of talking was remarkable. There was some blood-pressure run-up in the early part of the day, but that quickly returned to normal. I would repeat without hesitation.â

HOT-2 is a psychedelic in the phenethylamine class. It has rarely been used since its synthesis by Alexander Shulgin and little is known about the substance.

It is similar in structure to 2C-T-2 and other drugs in the HOT series.

---

HOT-2 = 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(β-ethylthio)-N-hydroxyphenethylamine; N-[2-(4-Ethylsulfanyl-2,5-dimethoxy-phenyl)-ethyl]-hydroxylamine; 2-[4-(Ethylsulfanyl)-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl]-N-hydroxyethanamine

---

## Dose

#### Oral (tentative)

Light: 10 – 12 mg

Common: 12 – 15 mg

Strong: 15 – 18 mg

PiHKAL Range: 10 – 18 mg

---

## Timeline

#### Oral (tentative)

Total: 6 – 10 hours (stimulation may persist for a few more hours)

Onset: 00:20 – 00:40

---

## Experience Reports

[Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_HOT2.shtml)

---

---

## Effects

#### Positive

- Stimulation
- OEVs and CEVs
- Euphoria
- Mood lift

#### Negative

- Nausea
- Confusion
- Insomnia
- Increased blood pressure
- Increased heart rate

The visual effects may be fairly light and comprised more of basic visual alterations than complex imagery (e.g. geometric patterns). More activity is reported in peripheral compared to central vision.

It has so far been described as a stimulating psychedelic, though not to the point of being uncomfortable.

---

## Pharmacology & Chemistry

It’s a phenethylamine that is very similar to 2C-T-2 in its structure. They differ in that HOT-2 includes a hydroxyl substitution.

---

## History

HOT-2 was first reported by Alexander Shulgin and discussed in PiHKAL (1991).

Since then, barely any reports have appeared and the drug has not been sold on the market.

---

## Legal Status

HOT-2 is not specifically controlled in the United States, but it could be treated as an illegal analog when sold for human consumption.

---

## Safety

Due to a lack of information, it’s not clear how safe the drug is, particularly with repeated use.

It’s best to use common doses, avoid combinations, and minimize your use frequency.

HOT-2, also known as 4-ethylthio-2,5-dimethoxy-N-hydroxyphenethylamine or as N-hydroxy-2C-T-2, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine, 2C, and HOT-x families. It is the N-hydroxy derivative of 2C-T-2. The drug is taken orally.

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists HOT-2's dose range as 10 to 18 mg orally and its duration as 6 to 10 hours. The drug's onset is 30 to 40 minutes and peak effects occur after 2 hours. HOT-2's properties are very similar to those of 2C-T-2, which has a dose of 12 to 25 mg orally, a duration of 6 to 8 hours, and an onset of less than 1 hour with a time to peak of 1 to 2 hours. HOT-2 may act as a prodrug of 2C-T-2.
The effects of HOT-2 have been reported to include some psychedelic visuals like perceptual movement, flowing, and shimmering, increased energy, euphoria, uncomfortableness, easier or more difficult communication, some difficulty concentrating and mental confusion, increased heart rate and blood pressure, and no body load. Shulgin said of HOT-2 that it "seems to be a well tolerated, and generally pleasant material, with a mixture of sensory as well as insightful aspects. Something for everyone."
