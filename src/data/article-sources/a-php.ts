## Subjective Experience

a-PHP was first synthesised in the 1960s, and became popular as a legal high
following the ban on a-PVP early in 2014. It was itself scheduled in the US in 2019.

Wikipedia introduces it as follows: “α-Pyrrolidinohexiophenone is a longer chain
homologue of α-PVP, having an extra carbon on the alkyl side chain. Regarding the
potency of alpha-PHP in the brain, chemist Michael H. Baumann of the Designer
Drug Research Unit (established by Baumann of the National Institute on Drug
Abuse stated: "alpha-PHP might be even more potent than alpha-PVP"; this
statement is based on laboratory tests of chemical reactivity.”

Given the lurid scenes shown of a-PVP (‘flakka’) victims across the news media, I
approach its stronger sister with some hesitation. Internet reports certainly confirm
that extreme care will need to be exercised. NeuePsychoaktiveSubstanzen for
instance offers the following (translated) words of caution, amongst others:

\`\`\`
“Consumers who only know weaker upper like speed will be overwhelmed by
the strong craving and the psychological side effects that a-PHP triggers and
should stay away from this substance!”
“Paranoia, anxiety states & psychotic phases ("drug psychosis") possible ...
the body load of alpha-PHP is perceived by the vast majority of users
(especially in higher doses) as very unpleasant .”
“Once an overdose has been taken, users find it extremely difficult to stop
adding more and more, even if psychotic, schizophrenic symptoms have
already occurred”
\`\`\`
With those words still ringing in my ears I place an absolute limit on my
experimentation by separating 50mg from my supply and placing the rest totally out
of reach.

After careful consideration I elect to initially dose in the middle of the
common/normal range as specified by the harm reduction portals, rather than
targeting the stronger band which I often edge towards. I prepare 20mg in lines of
2mg, 6mg, 6mg and 6mg. The idea here is to use the 2mg initially as a toe in the
water, and then proceed with the larger lines, with the final line being optional. Use
of the remaining 30mg will be dependent upon how the afternoon develops.

I clear my desk, take a deep breath, and prepare to launch.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I hoover the 2mg line with my right nostril. [12:30pm]. I will give it 5
minutes before taking any of the rest.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0.10 I feel warmer, a mild heady stimulation is underway. I snort the first
6mg line.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0.45 A heady glazy feel is now in place, not overly strong, but a bit
whimsical in nature. I was really tired this morning and I can still feel that in
the background, but I am warm and fairly contented. Horn is also in play but
not overwhelming at this point.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1.00 There has been no significant change. I feel I can go heavier without
being pulled out of control, so I snort the second 6mg line, bringing the total
to 14mg.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1.40 I am in a pleasant zone. A weary edge to proceedings remains, but
there is definite horn and the general stim-like headiness. I snort the last 6mg
line with my left nostril.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
T+3:00 I seem to be on a plateau, which is charged and positive, although I
feel I can go higher and of course I have a strong desire for the ride to
continue.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I prepare the last 30mg of my reduced stash and for better or worse over the
next hour I snort my way through it. My higher brain knows I shouldn’t be
doing this, but is aware that I do have a ceiling after this supply has gone.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+4.00 I am very high but this has a slightly different character to
amphetamine and methamphetamine. This is very much in the same ballpark,
but the head space has a more rounded edge to it, in that there is a persistent
dreamy-like background.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The sexual payload is also compelling and constant, and meal time comes and
goes with no appetite or interest in food.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+5.00 I remain highly stimmed and in a place from which I don’t want to
leave in a hurry.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Having sensibly limited my supply I decide to depart my usual single-drug
path and smoke some weed. The idea here is two fold. Firstly, to prolong and
perhaps intensify the ride, and secondly, to hopefully enable a gentler
comedown and a better night’s sleep.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+7.00 The last couple hours have passed in a state of almost zombified bliss,
with the cannabis having rounded the edges of the experience and taken it
into a more internal dimension, less tuned to the physical world. I am tiring at
this point, but now able to eat a healthy meal.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+9:30 Although I feel that I am on the way down I am still extremely high,
with most features still in situ. It is now 10pm, my usual bedtime, so I decide
to retire in the interests of tomorrow.
\`\`\`
I lay in bed for perhaps 30 minutes before taking 0.5mg of etizolam to help me on my
way. This was a success, and I had a passable night’s sleep. I woke at my usual time
in the morning, feeling somewhat dazed, but generally functional.

I take my usual recovery steps (food, fruit juice, walking, a couple of supplements
and vitamins) to hopefully mitigate the anticipated downer of the next few days.

This was, as expected, very moreish, and without the fear factor engendered courtesy
of research, I may well have careered into a more damaging binge. There’s no point
in denying that it was a hugely enjoyable ride, and the temptations which lead some
people into serious trouble were clearly evident. My precautions certainly helped, not
least with respect to the aftermath.

If you intend to use this drug, despite its risks, it is vital that you do not skip any of
the safety measures.

**alpha-Pyrrolidinohexiophenone** (also known as **PV-7** , **alpha-PHP** , **A-PHP** , and **α-PHP** ) is a lesser-known novel [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cathinone) class. It is structurally related to [MDPV](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDPV) and is one of the successors to the [designer drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinone) analog [α-PVP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/A-PVP) .

It is being used and marketed as a replacement for [α-PVP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91-PVP) (known on the street as *flakka* ) a few years following its ban, where it has come to substitute α-PVP in many parts of the world. While initially mass synthesized in Chinese industrial laboratories, a ban on α-PHP within China's borders has forced production to nations worldwide. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) such as [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , [thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration) , [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) and [ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation) . It generally comes in the form of either a fine powder or crystallized shards that can produce powerful but short-lived euphoric stimulant effects comparable to those of vaporized [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) and [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) . Like its cathinone predecessors, it is has gained notoriety for its tendency to induce [compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) and addictive behaviors as well the ability to produce [delusional states](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) when abused. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of α-PHP. It has recently become commonly marketed alongside [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [NEP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/NEP) and [Hexen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hexen) as a legal, grey-market alternative to [a-PVP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/A-PVP) , and commercially distributed through online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) vendors.

It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

α-PHP, or α-Pyrrolidinohexanophenone, is a compound of the [substituted cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinone) and [substituted pyrrolidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_pyrrolidine) chemical classes. Its structure is comprised of hexanal bound to a phenyl ring at the 1 position and the nitrogen of a pyrrolidine ring at the 2 position.

α-PHP is the longer chain homolog of α-PVP, possessing an additional carbon on the alkyl side chain.

## Pharmacology

The mechanism of action of α-PHP is unknown. Aside from a substantially shorter duration, it is believed to act similarly to the [designer drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) [pentedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pentedrone) and [α-PVP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91-PVP) , which both act as a potent [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) - [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [reuptake inhibitors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) (NDRI), although no substantial research on the pharmacology of this compound has yet been conducted.

This means it may effectively boost the levels of the norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitters in the brain by binding to and partially blocking the transporter proteins that normally remove those monoamines from the synaptic cleft. This allows dopamine and norepinephrine to accumulate within the brain, resulting in [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) effects.

## Subjective effects

In comparison to its predecessor [α-PVP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91-PVP) , this compound has been reported as inducing slightly less anxiety, uncomfortable side effects, euphoria, and an easier comedown.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - α-PHP can be considered to be extremely stimulating and energetic, although less so than [α-PVP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91-PVP) . This encourages activities such as running, climbing and dancing, although it can also encourage sitting immobile and engaging in repetitive tasks. The particular style of stimulation which α-PHP presents can be described as forced. This means that at higher dosages it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still as jaw clenching, involuntarily bodily shakes and vibrations become present, resulting in an extreme unsteadiness of the hands and a general lack of motor control.
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of α-PHP can be described as a moderate to extreme euphoric tingling sensation that encompasses the entire body. It is capable of becoming overwhelming at higher dosages. This sensation maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - α-PHP can enhance one's sense of touch to extreme degrees, often leading to states of sexual arousal.
- **[Vibrating vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vibrating_vision)** - A person's eyeballs may begin to spontaneously wiggle back and forth in a rapid motion, causing vision to become blurry and temporarily out of focus (a condition known as nystagmus).
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - α-PHP has been noted as enhancing focus, but in a way that leaves the user totally fixated on whatever task at hand, however trivial.
- **[Mouth numbing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mouth_numbing)** - In a similar fashion to that of [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) this compound numbs the areas of the body which it touches, these areas can include the nostrils, gums, mouth and throat of the user.
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)** - Due to the potency of its rush, α-PHP can cause various uncomfortable or painful sensations in the heart, especially when abused or used for extended periods. Those with familial or personal heart issues are discouraged from using this drug in its most potent [routes of administration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) .
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** - α-PHP, especially when it is vaporized or injected, can lead to sudden spikes of blood pressure that may manifest in an extremely uncomfortable "exploding heart" sensation.
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** - Dry mouth and dehydration are a universal experience with α-PHP and are a product of an increased heart rate, adrenergic activity and the motivation to engage in strenuous physical activities. While it is important to avoid becoming dehydrated, especially when out dancing in a hot environment, there is a potential possibility of suffering from water intoxication through over-drinking. Therefore it is advised that users simply sip at water and be mindful of their water in-take.
- **[Dry mouth](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dry_mouth)**
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)** - Higher doses of α-PHP result in an overall difficulty when it comes to urination, an effect that is temporary and typically harmless.
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)** - This typically can occur towards the end of the experience, but can sometimes happen during one as well.
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)**
- **[Restless leg syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Restless_leg_syndrome)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** - α-PHP can be considered very vasoconstricting at higher doses, and is on par with that of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) .
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component can be considered to be less intense when compared with that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , though becomes more present at high doses.
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - α-PHP may lower the seizure threshold in some individuals, especially when it is misused. ### Visual effects
 
- - **[Brightness alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brightness_alteration)** - α-PHP can make spaces seem brighter due to its ability to dilate the pupils.
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** - This effect is usually very mild and increases with sleep deprivation.
- **[Visual acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)** - α-PHP can have visual and vision-impairing effects that can lend readily to peripheral hallucinations.
 
### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[Peripheral information misinterpretation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peripheral_information_misinterpretation)**
- **[Scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of α-PHP can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The ample head space of α-PHP is described by many as one of extreme mental stimulation and powerful euphoria. It contains a large number of typical [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) cognitive effects, particularly those of the [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinone) or [pyrrolidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_pyrrolidine) classes of drugs. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - A euphoria very similar to [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) is present as well as feelings of well-being and contentedness which are likely a direct result of serotonin and dopamine accumulation in the brain's reward pathways.
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - Users report that this effect typically only occurs at low doses, and becomes increasingly more impairing as one increases their intake.
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** & **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - α-PHP can lead to states of extreme anxiety and paranoia when dosed too highly or frequently, which is why eyeballing this substance is strongly discouraged. The anxiety and paranoia this compound produces shares many features of the paranoia that can be induced by [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) or [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) , and typically happens during the come down phase of the experience. 
- **[Feelings of impending doom](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Feelings_of_impending_doom)** - This typically is experienced when the substance is abused, but can happen at higher than needed doses, or the comedowns of binges. It can also happen spontaneously, although this tends to be rare.
- **[Information processing suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Information_processing_suppression)**
- **[Ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation)** - Similar to the ego inflation of [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , α-PHP can temporarily induce states of egomania at its peak.
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)** - While a high tendency to compulsive redose is a hallmark of this class of drug, α-PHP has been reported as being slightly less compulsive than its predecessor α-PVP. Nevertheless, users are advised to use extreme caution in not losing control when on this drug.
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)** - This effect provides short-lived states of extreme motivation, but due to the cognitively narrowing aspects of its action, rarely ever translates into productive action.
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** - α-PHP, like its predecessor α-PVP can induce states of extreme sexual arousal due to its powerful disinhibiting effects
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - Strong feelings of time compression are common within α-PHP and increase in the perception of perceived experience is greatly increased
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis)** - This compound may induce psychosis if it is compulsively binged upon for prolonged periods of time. However, the likelihood of psychosis on this compound has been reported to be noticeably less than that of [A-PVP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/A-PVP) . ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. It has been reported that this crash is usually not considered as severe as it is on [A-PVP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/A-PVP) at equivalent dosages. The effects commonly include, but are not limited to: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational α-PHP use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because α-PHP has very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried α-PHP within the community suggests that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

α-PHP has been reported to be the cause, or a significant contributory cause, of death in suicides and overdoses caused by combinations of drugs.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other short-lived highly dopaminergic [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , the chronic use of α-PHP can be considered highly addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of α-PHP develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). α-PHP presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of α-PHP all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) will have a reduced effect.

### Psychosis

α-PHP, like other strongly dopaminergic stimulants, can result in a stimulant psychosis that may present with a variety of symptoms (e.g., [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , or [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) ). A review on treatment for amphetamine, [dextroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) abuse-induced psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. The same review asserts that, based upon at least one trial, [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with A-PHP should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - A-PHP may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.

#### Serotonin syndrome risk

Combinations with the following substances can cause dangerously high [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) levels. [Serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) requires immediate medical attention and can be fatal if left untreated.

- **MAOIs** - Such as [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , phenelzine, selegiline, and moclobemide.
- **Serotonin releasers** - Such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) , [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) and [αMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91MT) .
- **SSRIs** - Such as citalopram and sertraline
- **[SNRIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNRIs)** - Such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) and venlafaxine
- **5-HTP**

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%91-Pyrrolidinohexiophenone*

α-Pyrrolidinohexiophenone (α-PHP, A-PHP, Aphp, alpha-PHP, α-Pyrrolidinohexanophenone, PV-7) is a synthetic stimulant drug of the cathinone class developed in the 1960s which has been reported as a novel designer drug.

## Similar chemical compounds

α-Pyrrolidinohexiophenone is a longer chain homologue of α-PVP, having an extra carbon on the alkyl side chain. Regarding the potency of alpha-PHP in the brain, chemist Michael H. Baumann of the Designer Drug Research Unit (established by Baumann) of the National Institute on Drug Abuse stated: "alpha-PHP might be even more potent than alpha-PVP"; this statement is based on laboratory tests of chemical reactivity.
Pyrovalerone is a structural isomer of alpha-PHP.

## Legality

The President of the Republic of Italy classified cathinone and all structurally derived analogues (including pyrovalerone analogues) as narcotics in January 2012.
Sweden's public health agency suggested to classify α-PHP as narcotic on June 1, 2015.
As of October 2015, α-PHP is a controlled substance in China.
In December 2019, the UNODC announced scheduling recommendations placing Alpha-PHP into Schedule II.
As of 29 October 2021, α-PHP has been banned in the Netherlands under the 1971 Vienna Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
In the US, a-PHP is a Schedule I controlled substance as of 2022.
