4-Acetoxy-DMT
 
Basics
 
by Erowid
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
4-Acetoxy-DMT is a synthetic psychedelic drug with a limited history of use. It is likely that, similar to psilocybin, it is rapidly converted by first-pass metabolism into psilocin. It is reportedly very similar to psilocybin/psilocin in effects, although it is sometimes described as "warmer" or "more euphoric" than psilocybin-containing mushrooms. Data regarding its use and effects is limited. 
 
[ [Main 4-Acetoxy-DMT Vault](https://erowid.org/4_acetoxy_dmt.shtml) ]
 
[Dose](https://erowid.org/4_acetoxy_dmt_dose.shtml) #
 
A common oral dose of 4-Acetoxy-DMT is between 10 and 25 mg. Several reports describe doses of 25-30 mg as very strong. Insufflation appears to produce more potent effects with a more rapid onset. A smoked dose of 40 mg of fumurate was described as extremely weak, comparable to the effects of 5 mg oral.
 
Price #
 
Not commonly available. In September 2010, Internet vendors listed 4-Acetoxy-DMT at $200 to $350 per gram, significantly higher than a few years earlier.
 
Law #
 
4-Acetoxy-DMT is unscheduled and uncontrolled in the United States, making it technically legal to possess. Sales or possession could be prosecuted under the Analog Act, although we are not aware of this having occurred. We are not aware of any other country where it is specifically listed as illegal.
 
Chemistry #
 
4-Acetoxy- *N* , *N* -Dimethyltryptamine (4-AcO-DMT) is a synthetic chemical in the tryptamine class. It is related structurally to DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, bufotenine, psilocybin, psilocin, and the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT).

History #
 
4-Acetoxy-DMT is a novel compound with relatively little availability on the research chemicals market. Since 2007, its use appears to primarily be confined to psychedelic connoisseurs.
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
The Substance:
 
4-Acetoxy-DMT; Psilacetin.
 
The Experience:
 
No common terms known.
 
[EFFECTS](https://erowid.org/4_acetoxy_dmt_effects.shtml) #
 
Psilocybin, present in magic mushrooms, is metabolized into psilocin; a similar situation likely occurs with 4-Acetoxy-DMT being metabolized into psilocin. The effects of 4-Acetoxy-DMT are said to be very similar to the effects of psilocybin/psilocin, although enough users have reported some differences that it is speculated that 4-Acetoxy-DMT may be uniquely active on its own, and not simply active due to (probably) being metabolized into psilocin. Users report dose-dependent colorful visual effects and a sense of physical energy or euphoria, sometimes accompanied by abstract, associative, "trippy" thought patterns, or derealization. 
 
 Several available reports of 4-Acetoxy-DMT compare it favorably to psilocybin, describing it as more euphoric, gentle, warm, and colorful. It has also been described as less jarring, and less likely to produce nausea. However, most of these comparisons are made with mushrooms, not pure psilocybin. In addition, it is unknown to what degree expectancy plays a role in shaping such experiences.
 
Onset #
 
Effects take about 30-40 minutes to begin, with peak effects at around 2 hours. The onset has been characterized as smoother, gentler, and more pleasant than the onset of mushrooms.
 
Duration #
 
The primary effects of 4-Acetoxy-DMT typically last for about 4-6 hours. They have been described as lasting from 3-4 hours (low oral doses) to 8-10 hours (moderate to strong oral doses).
 
Visual Effects #
 
Visuals have been described as being similar to those produced by psilocybin/psilocin, 2C-B, and DMT.
 
PROBLEMS #
 
As with all psychedelics, some people may experience the effects of 4-Acetoxy-DMT as confusing, frightening, or unpleasant. While 4-Acetoxy-DMT is pharmacologically similar to psilocybin and may well be similar in terms of its relative safety, it has not undergone toxicological studies and its possible harms are unknown. Some users may have idiosyncratic responses to dosage and effects. 
 
 A review of available reports suggests that many people have begun with doses that generated stronger effects than expeceted or desired, in the 25-30 mg range. One report describes a person who took "25 mg oral and had a 2 hr blackout, in which he curled up in a bed and mumbled nonsense to himself. He had absolutely no recollection of the 2 hours."
 
Contraindications #
 
- Do not operate heavy machinery. Do not drive. The effects of 4-Acetoxy-DMT may be dramatically increased if used by individuals currently taking MAOIs. MAOI drugs include the prescription antidepressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorex or Manerix (moclobemide), as well as the harmala alkaloids present in *Banisteriopsis caapi* (ayahuasca) and *Peganum harmala* (Syrian rue). Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your medication is an MAOI. Individuals currently in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval in their everyday lives should be careful about choosing to use psychedelics as they can trigger even more difficulty. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because psychedelics have been known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
Owing to its pharmacological similarity to psilocybin, it is very unlikely that 4-Acetoxy-DMT is addictive. Howver, it has not been studied for addiction liability.

DESCRIPTION #

EXPERIENCE EXCERPTS #
 
[16 mg] "Wowww! The colors! I never had visual changes of that kind with my eyes open. The room tends to transform itself. CEVs comparable to DMT, my thinking is out of order, -nothing! The muscles of my face, esp. that of my cheeks contract that way that my face transforms into a smile. Moving my hand in front of my eyes leaves long traces. [...] This stuff makes me active like nothing ever tried before. There are so many crazy things that spring into my mind, which I could do now: Walking out jumping around... I must take me completely together not to do any really stupid thing. I'm tripping too hard for that all." -- [Exp 57030](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=57030)
 
[20 mg] "I began to feel mildly high and clear-headed, my thoughts flowed faster and changed rapidly, and it became a little bit difficult to construct sentences from my thoughts, so I stayed fairly quiet. [...] When I focused on the sky, I saw pleasant visuals forming, but I had to focus for them to appear, and if I looked back at my surroundings they disappeared. T." -- [Exp 65909](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=65909)
 
[32 mg, cumulative] "By T+5 hours, the overwhelming emotions had ceased and I was back in control. I found myself in a stable, pleasurable, somewhat sedated state. The selective visual effect continued. I was a bit sweaty and exhausted, but I felt complete. This comfortable, middle-ground state was mine to enjoy for two to three hours. The hallucinogenic effects were gone by T+8h, and my pupils remained dilated for a couple of hours afterwards." -- [Exp 66763](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=66763)
 
[45 mg] "By this time, I saw no surface that did not bear a host of multi-layered evil faces staring me down in all my littleness, in all my squalor, in all my waste of a life. Eyes, eyes, eyes - all dissolving my very person before their slicing scrutiny. [...] I felt there was an out-of-control engine inside my head, redlining and about to explode. I had no recourse, no sanctuary. Everywhere I went, the eyes followed and the realities dissolved." -- [Exp 84044](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=84044)
 
[125 mg] "...as I reached for a towel the nausea came back in a hefty wave. So did the visuals. I ended up back on my shower floor with a towel wrapped around me, getting soaked by the warm water again. I breathed at a steady pace whilst watching the bathroom walls turn purple and green." -- [Exp 86651](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=86651)
 
[150 mg] "I literally think I almost died. Took it at 5:30pm. Half an hour or more in I was getting some visuals, though really not that intense or even very good. I started to get anxiety and feel nauseous/sick. I was outside walking around. I managed to make it home luckily. [...] Generally weak visuals, really messed with my blood pressure and heart." -- [Exp 86617](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=86617)
