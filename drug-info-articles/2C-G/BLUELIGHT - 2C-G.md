The current discussion follows from Psykaps inquiry about 2C-G - starting from page 2, here is the quote:

Has anybody ever heard of any trials outside of PIHKAL with these compounds? They sound extremely interesting to me. Let's hope someday we get our fingers into this cookie jar. Here's 2CG3 and 2CG5 entries from PIHKAL.

> QUALITATIVE COMMENTS: (with 16 mg) It came on in little leaps and bounds. All settled, and then it would take another little jump upwards. I am totally centered, and writing is easy. My appetite is modest. Would I drive to town to return a book to the library? No ever-loving way! I am very content to be right here where I am safe, and stay with the writing. It does take so much time to say what wants to be said, but there is no quick way. A word at a time.

What if I had met someone who had wanted to talk? Towards evening I got a call from Peg who said her bean soup was bubbling in a scary way and what should she do, and I said maybe better make soap. It was that kind of an experience! **Way up there, lots of LSD-like sparkles, and nothing quite really making sense. Marvelous.**

> QUALITATIVE COMMENTS: (with 14 mg) I was well aware of things at the end of two hours, and I was totally unwilling to drive, or even go out of the house. I was reminded continuously of 2C-B with its erotic push, and the benign interplay of colors and other visual effects. But it is so much longer lived. I am a full +++, very stoned, and there is no believable sign of dropping for another several hours. There is a good appetite (again, 2C-B like), and I managed to sleep for a few hours, and all the next day I was spacey and probably still a plus one. The day yet following, I was finally at a believable baseline. Both of these days were filled with what might be called micro doze-offs, almost like narcolepsy. Maybe I am just sleep deprived.

> (with 16 mg) The first effects were felt within one hour, and full effects between 2 1/2 and 3 hours. **Tremendous clarity of thought, cosmic but grounded**, as it were. This is not at all like LSD, and is a lot mellower than the 2C-T family. **For the next few hours it was delightful and fun and I felt safe and good-humored.** I got to sleep without much difficulty while still at a plus three, and my dreams were positive and balanced, but I awoke irritable and emotionally flattened. I did not want to interact with anyone. The first 16 hours of this stuff were great, and the second 16 hours were a bit of a drag. Just twice as long as it ought to be.

I agree 2CGN doesn't sound that great from his comments. I'd still like to try them eventually.


Well I didn't figure many people would have tried this. Hopefully somebody will have tried it and one day search google and find this thread and share with us ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Can a moderator please edit my thread title to add a parenthesis containing (2CG3 and 2CG5) to aid searching?

The one that's related to these, but not a 2C-G-x as such is the one with only one methoxy group and is effectively the IAP derivative that corresponds to MMDA (5-(2-aminopropyl)-7-methoxyindane aka 3,4-trimethylene-5-methoxyamphetamine) as I'd imagine it'd be somewhat similar to MMDA, but has the advantage of not being illegal under UK law.


Chances of seeing that on the market are probably less than the 2C-G-x's though!

there is a german report that appeared on BL sometime ago, it was generally non descriptive and the user said the duration was too long (no big surprise). MGS has mentioned that he has 2C-G in his collection, but i dont thinks hes tasted it.

It was available at some point, where and when i dont know but i suspect it was one of the early 2000s american suppliers, and thusly 2C-G and its family are now gone.


I would LOVE to work with it.

I managed to get some 2C-G back in the day, but I've never tried it.  If I'm going to take something that lasts that long, its going to be DOM or maybe 2C-P.

DOM doesn't last that long unless you take as dose like those dished out free in the 60's (10mg +). A much more sensible 3-5mg lasts a bit longer than LSD; if you're OK with AMT you'll be OK with DOM in terms of duration.


Worst I've ever had in terms of not knowing when to pack it in & piss off were DOC & DOI. Had 2mg of DOI and at the 24 hour point it stopped being funny even in that 'you've got to laugh or else you'll cry' way. DOC was very similar in outstaying it's welcome

I must be one of the very few that enjoyed DOI's duration.  Although it was a very physically exhausting trip, so I would certainly think long and hard before taking it and plan for the post-trip fatigue.

I love long duration chemicals if they're good.  DOC is perfect for me, and I usually wish AMT would last longer. 


I agree about DOM's duration... it seems the shortest of the DOXs I've tried.  Well, DOT/aleph-1 is actually shorter.


If anyone has any experience with these, please post about it, as I would love to know!  I hope to one day get my hands on some, especially G-3 and G-5.  The descriptions in PIHKAL sound promising indeed!

i love long duration.


though,

i wouldn't mind a bit of non-disabling hppd, either ;P

but that's easy for *me* to say - not having to live with it.

I had a few hits of DOI a couple years ago, was always too leery of the 30+ hour duration to use it. Eventually, I lost them. Probably for the best. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

did he explore any of the amphetamine analogs of the 2cg series?


if they made a psychedelic that lasted days on end do you think the potential of death would be posible out of the lack of sleep and exhaustion? 


there was a chemical that was related to aniracetam that they are still studying (and whos exact chemical formula isnt yet given away) that they claimed to say makes the need to sleep almost vanish, with reports of people only geting one to two hours of sleep and being able to function perfectly for multiple days in a row.  i dont know why i just thought of it...

Agreed. Impressive material.


2c-g seems intriguing. Any particular reason this one is pretty much nonexistent? Difficult synthesis? Id imagine it wouldn't sell well either, considering its duration...

^ There would be a few brave souls willing to try it Im sure. And due to how rare it is Im sure it would sell to us interested in furthering our collection.


Pedal, 2C-P is wonderful IMO, everything a psychedelic should be. Just need to be careful with dose, the difference between 12mg and 14mg is crazy

Oh yea, 12mg of 2c-p was fantastic. 14mg was frightening. I am in no way interested in experiencing a 16mg "overdose".


I wonder how much of a risk of psychosis there is with the 2c-g's considering the length of action.

I think they will become available *eventually* on the market, after all there must have been a time when the now fairly common 2C's were difficult to source as well.

Oh, and by the way - does anyone know why Erowid is so far behind the eight ball with listing compounds?


Surely they could at least create a blank page for them (because they do exist somewhere) and then fill in more details with time.

For example, why does CP55940 *still* not have it's own page on the Chemical list?


Sorry I know this is a bit of-topic, but now is a valid time to ask the question

They both sound interesting, though as peeps have noted 48 hours of tripping sounds rather nasty!

Erowid relies on user submissions for the most part to fill in their information.  I would imagine they have not received any.  Erowid is basically built by the community and for the community, so if you see something missing, you should feel free to contact them and submit something.

**2C-G's**


wonder why not much is known about them out side of sasha's test group. They seem like they would show some promise. 2C-G-5 was described like a 2 day 2c-b trip. reached a +3 the first day and a steady +2 the second day.


and the 3C-G's sound interesting as well, dark red crystals? awesome!


yeah not much else. dont know enough about chemistry to write anything cool.

I'm sorry to say, but there just isn't enough information on this drug. Erowid doesn't even have a vault for it, as if it doesn't exist. That's quite rare, meaning that this drug is really unknown. 


I'm sure you've seen this, but I'll link for those who haven't. The only trip reports about 2c-g that I know of. I don't think there are any more in the literature, so you'll just have to go by these few reports alone:


> DOSAGE: 20 - 35 mg.
> 
> 
> 
> DURATION: 18 - 30 h.
> 
> 
> 
> QUALITATIVE COMMENTS: (with 22 mg) I am completely functional, with writing and answering the telephone, but the coffee really tastes most strange. While the mental effects (to a ++ only) were dispersing, the body still had quite a bit of memory of the day. Sleep was fine, and desirable, in the early evening.
> 
> 
> 
> (with 32 mg) Superb material, to be classified as a 'true psychedelic' unless one is publishing, in which case it could be best described as an 'insight-enhancer' and obviously of potential value in psychotherapy (if one would wish to spend 30 hours in a therapy session!). I suppose it would be best to simply stick with the insight-enhancing and skip the psychotherapy. Just too, too long. There was not any particular visual impact, at least for me. The non-sexual and the anorexic aspects might indeed change, with increasing familiarity. Remains to be seen. The length of the experience is against its frequent use, of course, which is a pity, since this one is well worth investigating as often as possible.
> 
> 
> 
> (with 32 mg) There was, at the very beginning, a certain feeling of non-physical heat in the upper back which reminded me of the onset of various indoles, which this ain't. The energy tremor was quite strong throughout, but somehow the body was generally at ease.
> 
> 
> 
> (with 32 mg) At a plateau at two hours, with just a bit of tummy queasi-ness. And I am still at the plateau several hours later. Sleep finally at the 18th hour, but even after getting up and doing all kinds of things the next day, I was not completely baseline until that evening. And a couple of days more for what is certainly complete repair. That is a lot of mileage for a small amount of material.

Effects are described as **similar to Ganesha, but with a major difference **:


> Dosage and effects
> 
> 
> 
> In Shulgin's book PiHKAL, the dosage range is listed as 20 to 35 mg. Effects are similar to the related Ganesha, and are extremely long lasting; the duration is 18–30 hours. **Visual effects are muted or absent,** and it is described in PiHKAL as an "insight-enhancer" [1]. Unlike other members of the 2C* family, 2C-G is nearly as potent as its amphetamine cousin

> Ganesha is the amphetamine analogue of 2C-G. It is a particularly long lasting drug, with the duration listed in PiHKAL as being 18 – 24 hours, which might make it undesirable to some users. It is named after the Hindu deity, Ganesha. Very little data is known about the dangers or toxicity of Ganesha. Effects of Ganesha include:

2C-G lacks visuals. Perhaps we can think of it as a non-visual Ganesha. But this is not as helpful since there's just not enough information on either. It could be perfectly visual for you, the same way weed is very visual for some people and not visual for others. 


You're going to be one of the few people to have ever tried this compound aside from Shulgin and his friends. So just be careful and expect the unexpected. I tried to help you, but this is uncharted territory. I'm extremely interested in hearing your report. 


Be safe.

just remember to be very precise when you dose. ie. make sure your scale is accurate. though i figure you probably already know that seeing as how you stated you did your research already. as phew said, your gonna be one of the few people to try this, just be relaxed and i guess keep a benzo or two on hand just incase. enjoy man, and write a report when you get a chance!

Yes, please do write a report after you've taken enough titrated doses to build up to something substantive.  The reports of qualitative effects are so limited as to doubt even the predictive reliability of claims of "no visuals," as this could be chalked up entirely to individual subject or individual trial effects.

Well thats certainly interesting. I was interested before when I heard about its mental effects/duration. Care to explain what you enjoyed/felt on 2c-g?(in terms of speak of it being visually muted, although mind wise nice)

Okay I really want this one... Just for collections' sake. I doubt I'd ever take it. That's far too long to be affected by a substance - though I believe it was 2C-G-3 that I was interested in greatly.

I wanted to receive also Genesha but because of the unsuccessful synthesis instead of red cristalls they turned yellow, all what has left is to check the activity of 2c-g , of course I'm going to  short raport with separate doses , Give me just a some  time on research , I hope that I'll respond soon.

Off-topic: I noticed you're from Poland, where abouts if you don't mind me asking? I'd PM you but you can't reply to PMs until you hit 50 posts. I'm in Małopolska myself, about an hour from Krakow. It's good to see some other people from Poland on BL. I'm actually only half Polish myself, but been living here for a few months now.


I'd very much like to hear your report psykap, and the reports of anyone else who's tried this.


Are you 100% sure that what you have is 2C-G? I'd start with a sub-milligram dose to be sure that you won't have an adverse reaction, then work your way up.


Let us know how it goes.

I hope you dont mind me saying, but if your talking about one thing you use much not many, you only use many if youre talking about more than one thing. Good luck with finding out. Otherwise thats a perfect post.

Sorry  but you'll have to wait for my report about 2C-G. I've received an email from my vendor where he wrote to me that he's trying to obtain from ready 2C-G , 25G-NBOMe  . As a consolation I will receive 25C-NBOMe and 25D-NBOMe so I'll devote my time for these research, especially I'm interested in 25D-NBOMe because I haven't found any information about dosage , I'll  revive thread when it will be available.

25G-NBOMe?  wow that's a big unknown.  i hope he assays it thoroughly himself (and perhaps with a few close friends) first if he ever offers it on the open market.

My jaw just dropped. I've been waiting for a trip report on 2c-g for 3 years. 


I've also been ridiculously interested in the nbome series, and wondered very much (for hours on end many days) how the 25g-nbome would be. 


You are about to have the chemical ive been dreaming about for so long. Sir, a report on this would make my year. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

25D-NBOMe sounds interesting to me.  For the 25X-NBOMe series the potency is higher when the more electronegative moieties are in the 4-position, the opposite of what happens in the 2C-X series.

25G-NBOMe? That lab is getting a bit overzealous IMO... This compound could last for days...

I'll be interested to see what effects on duration & dose will occur with that alteration.  Any speculation?  Obviously a lower dose, but single digit mg or µg?  As far as duration is concerned, i've got no idea

2C-G lasts an insanely long time as it is... I believe in PiHKAL there are reports of feeling "off" for a few days after taking it...


I imagine the NBOMe would be shorter duration honestly but nobody knows til its made.

due to the reverse of potency with the halogens, i can safely say that anything goes. i think that all previous compounds should be re-explored with the added group, because now firmiliar things are very new in effect. i think the same is true for the g series of compounds. i mean after 2c-g-3 shouldnt there have been experiments with haloges on the new ring? the flys of that also. i mean there are so many interesting things you could do, and then the nbome just adds a whole new level to exploring the effects of the different substitutions

there is an entire alphabet of these things i just havnt heard of yet....Im sure of it...


I thought 2c-e was long...Ive seen plenty of people lamenting over 2c-p's duration...Now 2c-g....


Im not a fan of the duration, but damn these are novel chems...I wish I had the wherewithal to source such things...its probably for the best (and my mental health) that i don't though ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Nice. Looking forward to your report. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Edit: What is your reasoning for trying the nbome version first? wouldnt it make more sense to try 2C-G first?

You are  right . I wanna try first 25G-NBOMe but dosage is unknown so This may take some time before I reach the active dose , so probably 2C-G will be first ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I wonder if the duration of 2c-g carries over to the nbome version.. It seems like the nbomes generally lasts longer than their 2c counterparts?

Hmm I noticed that NBOMes lasts different.

For example 25D and 25N was shorter than 2Cx counterparts .

25C in last was longer than 2C-C .

It's hard to say  how it will be in this case


In saturday first try , I think about dose. Since 2 months I take psychedelic for every week , so probably I have any tollerance  I think that it will be 25-30mg.

T:0:50 - Short raport from 30 mg 2C-G


DOSE:30 mg

ONSET:0,5-1,5h

PEAK:15h

Normal After Effects : 10h.


This note was written on currently.


TIME : 10:40 /. Saturday

T:00 - I am take 30 mg in water sollution.


T:0:10 - I am feeling something , very strange feeling , but probably its my HPPD.

Without bodyload, the loading is slight , I have light CEVs .


T:0:20 - I am feeling excitement , butterflies in stomach , I dont know is it 2C-G , but I think it is cause this that I have no idea how it will be affect. In Pihkal Shulgin hasnt wrote specific effects


T:0:40 - I am feeling very strange , confusion in my head .My short-term memory muck up.

I forget many things , writing gives me problems . I have trouble with concentration .

No OEV's , CEV's gaining momentum .


T:0:50 - No sense discomfort , normal pressure ,I do not want to vomit .

OEVs gain strength. Music sounds quite good , but still nothing special.

Sasha has wrote that didnt noticed change visual , very strange my OEVs are on ++ level.


T:1:00 - I am feeling that main bodyload just begun , severe anxiety , muscle tension , I am very cold . I got a strong catarrh

. but I think that is it fault Methoxetamina which I took yesterday

Music relaxes me , I forget about bodyload , but 10 minutes later I am vomiting , maybe it was slice of pizza which I have ate few minutes early. Im tried any 30 another phenethylamines and I never vomited. Mental activity becomes more stonger.

Plan for today , me my girl and girlfriend wanna goes on the outside, They took 2C-T-4 but We are waiting when we are feel peak effects. I think that for any 10 h I will take some LSD and 4-HO-DiPT when I will be boring 2C-G.


T:1:20 - Bodyload disappear I have feeling that I am approaching on the peak.

I have very interesting CEVs similar to 2C-E / 2C-P , very strong euphoria and slightly smaller empathy , Probalby I am on the peak . The talking with other people gives me an incredible pleasure . I stop writing ,We decided go somwhere.


T:2:00 - 7:00 Nice , I think that I will got fear of people but none of these things , viusal effects are medium . I dont fell overwhelmed , colours was slightly darker than 2C-P / 2C-B , blue and dark orange was dominating coulours . I do not feel hunger , We decided go on the sea , it was good idea , the walk through the forest and cliff was amazing , views of breathtaking , on the sea was very cold but I dont feel it . The thinking was very clear , lot of time I thought how this compound can be helpful for anorectis and unsexual people , Shulgin has wrote that is good substance on a psychotherapy , but I didnt noticed none of this

It was very cold so decided back to home . We spend any time on watched movies .


T:9:00 Me and my girlfriend decided take small quantity another compound , It was 100 mcg LSD , 15 mg 4-HO-DiPT and 40 mg of Methoxetamine . I feard about interaction esspecialy about my girlfriend because she was on 2c-t-4 and I thought that methoxetamine can be cause serotonine syndrom , I was ready on this , I got ACEI inhibitors , benzodiazepines and beta blockers , Fortunately nothing will happen . I will not describe effects of this combo because its is describe of 2C-G


T:15:00 - I didnt felt nothing only still effects of 2C-G on this same level


T:16:00 - I have of feeling that peak is decreases . We decided that We are watching Avatar and go to sleep , watching a movie give me the pleasure .


T:19:00 - Is 7 am of next day but I am still feeling action of 2C-G .

I wanna sleep , I have to go to job next day , I decided take 1 mg alprazolam and go to sleep . I woke up 8 h later and still I felt light 2C-G , but I was very tired and I asleep on next 18 h . Today I am feeling very good , but I must to take free day in job


SUMMARY : Sorry for little detailed raport but didnt happen nothing special what I can add.

Sorry also for my language mistakes . However I can recommend this compound , It is very interesting substance but duration is too long and after about 10 h it is boring .

I think that although a little I detailed profile of this compound , Its all


Now I can reserach 25G-NBOMe when I know this . I will be have any recognition. I hope that it will be similar and duration will be much shorter.

Nice report psykap! It sounds like you had a great time out there. I do love long-acting psyches. Why not trip for so long? Plus you gotta get your money's worth ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) Thanks for illuminating us.

Not exatcly , J like long-acting psychedelic , but I felt uncomfortable with thinking that in monday I have to go to job . Usually When I take long-acting substances I start in Friday then in sunday I fell very good , but in this case I dont have another possibility.

I remember few thing which I didnt noticed early ,

stimulation of the 2C-G is one of the smaller from 2C-x series similar to 2C-T-21 , 2C-B-FLY  , in night when I went shopping colors became very clear  , headlights and streetlight were so clear that  I had trouble with moving through the city , still blinding me .

I noticed also light depression and apathy caused probably long-action.It is a condition resembling the day after ingestion of large amounts of MDMA . If I remember someting more I will write it.

Do u want comparision  to all of 2C-x which I tried?

As for me  headspace is very similar to 2C-iP , 2C-T-21 , 2C-B-FLY , 2C-C , 2C-N or also to small doses 2C-D ,while after 2C-B , 2C-P , 2C-E , 2C-I  seems 

much stronger.

Thanks people , I hope that my report from 25G-NBOMe will be also helpful like this.

From my reserach I have knowledge that 25G is inactive for me  in dose 300-500 intranasally so I think that strong dose will be up 1 mg.

Good report, psykap.


However we can't really draw any conclusions about the duration of the peak, since LSD, 4-HO-DIPT and methoxetamine were taken at t +9hrs, which would have quite strongly contributed to the effects subsequently!

I will try persuade my friend who's buy it  with me . Maybe He wants write something there.I got last 20 mg and I think what can i do with such quantities . Probably I will take it intranasally . This will be painful but shorter duration and maybe more potent suggests that I should do it.

Maybe there can be more side-effects that way that wouldn't be there taken orally, there is always much discussion about the real value or worth of insufflating 2C-X but personally I am not really an advocate. If you think about insufflation then an improvement on it may be plugging.

What about IM injection? Comes on quick, shorter duration.  I got 35mg so not quite enough for 2 oral doses, might take one oral and IM whats left (in small parts don't want it to be too strong).


Actually maybe IM all the way cause 30 hours is just too long.  But that's what seroquel remeron and trazodone are for ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  and benzo's around.


When i get a chance to take this i'll write a report, i was blown away by 4-ho-met a few days ago.. it retains the DMT effect, but *-DET does not so it only needs one methyl there apparently (little off topic there).

I took 10.5mg total 2C-G today, via IM route cause i did not want a several day trip.  Boy am i glad i did...


Everything is groovy except the horrible body load.  Its not that it feels so bad or anything, even somewhat relaxing, but, it is HEAVY.   I would have been out riding a bike just watching everything because of the pretty color enhancement.  But the body load felt like 50 bricks on your back, so strong just pulling you to where you dont want to even move.   Other than that, the color change/enhancement reminded me a LOT of 2C-P.  Only 2C-P is a much better trip and much less of a body load.


I would have taken it up a notch (got to a ++) if it weren't for this horrible body heavyness feeling.  It ruined it, basically.   if i were to ever take this again, i would preload with a shitload of oxycodone or something strong like that just to numb it, it was so strong almost painful.   I really wanted to up it to a +++ but just the thought of a even stronger body load completely put me off.  I doubt i will be trying this compound again.  I'll post in trip reports probably tomorrow, i feel like i've come down just almost completely, i can tell a TINY bit of something is still going on but i coudl easily sleep.  So it was like an 8-10 hour ride IMed.  I doubt this is why the body load was strong - i'm sensitive to PEA body loads (i dislike 2c-b i think the body load is nowhere near euphoria, it makes you want to lay down and do nothing, give me 2c-d or 2c-c or 25i-nbome anytime over 2c-b, because those don't make my body feel like shit).


The closest it came to was 2C-P and that is because of the way colors were enhanced/altered. but give me 2C-P over this anyday, this is not something worthy of a hard synthesis.... get something worthwhile made like 2C-EF or 2C-TFM...  i've had pure 2C-TFM before and it had no body load, and the colors and everything about it was better than 2C-G.  The potency , the duration, etc. everything.   Why someone would want to pay a lab to synth this is beyond me.   I think it sucks, just because of the body load.  


The only way I would ever take this again is if i had a ton of opiates to numb the borderline painfully strong body load.   I ended up getting sick of it and took some MXE and kratom which made me feel much better, but at this point i was on my way down anyway, and it wasn't that strong or interesting.  Pretty colors though, but i've seen better (like 2c-tfm, much better colors).  


If you want to see what this is like just take some 2C-P and imagine that drug with a bad body load and a duration of 30 hours orally i guess.... and a boring trip.  


I hate to sound so bad, i really tried to like it, i really did, but the body load had pissed me off and I spent my time looking for drugs to kill the body load rather than want to boost the trip more.


Eh, no thanks.  Also it was mostly visual, almost zero mental effects. But like i said, i felt so shitty (in the stomach area, that 'pulll' like you just want to lay there, and in my back, felt like 50 bricks on my back or something).


I'm glad I IMed it, and I don't believe that is the reason the body load sucked.  I am sensitive to PEA body loads, the only one i will tolerate is 2C-T-7 because it is so friggin awesome its actually worth it, and it was not so heavy like this ..crap.  


if you have a lab that will make you this, why not make something good ....if they can handle diffficult synthesis surely they can convert some 2C-I to 2C-TFM?  I'd buy it all up myself just for personal use its so good.   I hear 2C-EF is also good.   


If Ganisha is anything like this, no way in hell i'd take any!


----


But, a few days ago I got to try 4-HO-MET for the first time, and that was the polar opposite of this stuff... wonderful! No body load, has everything the *-DMT's have which blew my mind that it was possible (to have anything but a N,N-DMT up on the molecvule, apparently a methyl, ethyl retains all the DMT goodness).  It was so good i would trade all my 4-aco-dmt for 4-HO-MET.  But that is for another report or post.  I'll post a trip report tomorrow but it ain't too exciting....i'm gonna even call it "body load" cause that is the theme with this chemical.  Never again...  There are worse things like 2c-t-2 though...hate the body load on that probably the worst of them all.   Ibut i love 2c-t-7! weird)

Thanks a whole lot for the elaborate description of your experience, your findings and comparisons! The body load part is quite helpful, it will vary between people as with most things but nevertheless there are trends and tendencies that can be distilled. I'm interested in the compound in general and may have a chance to try it in the future or at least add to the collection and list of things still-to-try but I am a bit put off by your mention of the bodyload. I found 2C-E to be heavy in that section, 2C-P sounds heavier, if this is harder then at the very least I will be more considerate about my physical condition when I start.


With body load sensitive compounds in my experience it matters way way more if you are feeling a bit tired, sickly, worn out or hungover at the moment you dose. Some body loads appear to be develop inherent to the drug's properties but in most cases I think it is an amplification of your bodily sensations so they better damn well be in order in the first place. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Also I agree on the T-7 sentiment: it does have a serious body load but it's well worth the totality of the experience and despite it, I rank it among the highest if not the number one of 2C-X compounds I tried.

I found 2C-E to be heavy in that section, 2C-P sounds heavier, if this is harder then at the very least I will be more considerate about my physical condition when I start.

Some body loads appear to be develop inherent to the drug's properties but in most cases I think it is an amplification of your bodily sensations so they better damn well be in order in the first place. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yeah the body load was worse than 2c-e and 2c-p *definitely*.  No where near as bad as 2c-t-2 though, that is one of the worst i've experienced.  honestly it just felt like 2c-p lite or something. Similar colors, long duration, yet 2c-p has a 4-propyl while this one has a 3,4, dimethyl.  Strange.


Got 25mg left, enough for an oral dose i think probably.  I'll save it for the right friend or trade it for something good or new to me / unique or something.  *TMI*


I am going to test a lowish dose of 2c-i tonight, because i haven't had that one in sooo many years.   I know its got a body load but it wasn't bad enough to make me want to not take it plenty of times.  I forget what its like anyway so what the hell, i got potent bali (plain powder micronized, the only real good & strong kratom out there IMO no wonder people don t like kratom ,cause they're getting all the worse kinds.. Bali is just wonderful, way better than hydro, no as good as oxy sounds about right)  in case i wanna escape the body load. Better dose right now ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  so i can pop a seroquel later to end it and pass the fuck out.  


Now what is a REALLY  special compound, is 4-HO-MET.  Its got the DMT-effect in full, for those that know-whatamine, by-that.  methyl, ethyl sub works, wow.  Need a gram of half a g ASAP!!  that is a gem.  2c-g definitely is not.

Well 4-propyl folded a bit alongside the phenyl ring may be a bit more bulky but still somewhat similar to 3,4-dimethyl. I doubt 2C-P docks into the receptor with it's 4-propyl sticking out like a dick. About electronic configuration, that too may be a bit alike since it's all alkyl substitutions. That makes for different dipoles than something like a halogen.


LOL nice going on that off-topic tangent 8)  It's funny to see a train of thought in live action. Made me smile anyway, especially about the ifyouknowhat-amine...

indeed, if it did than the higher 4-alkyl homologues would be active.


would be wild if 2C-Octyl was active though.

2C-G-N might be interesting as a wakefullness promoting agent. Wikipidia says an average dose lasts 20 to 30 hours. The 2C-x series intrigue me as psychedelics and as nootropics at lower doses. 2C-I seem more interesting to me though, as it's like strong clean stimulation for 4 to 6 hours. 2C-x series are quite rare nowadays though. Stupid governments!

Bump for prune.  I've always wanted to try a few of this series.

Ew, not me. I hate stimulation with my psychedelics. I know that Ann thought they were special, but that's way too long for me. I've never even tried DOM for those reasons

A dutch vendor recently stocked 20mg 2c-g pellets, no clue wether it is legit and i have no way of getting some personally as this vendor ships to nl only, but i would like to try and source a pellet to send it in for testing.

I bought some and had it tested. The testing facility confirmed that it is in fact 2C-G, unfortunately, as always, Checkit doesn't release expected test-results in their data base. 

Unbelievable that all these rare PEA's pop up so close before the NL ban. For anyone buying those 20mg "pellets", they are in fact capsules filled with a bunch of green filler and 2C-G... The capsules were also labeled as 25mg, so no idea about the actual dose as they weren't able to quantify the powder.

It seems like 2C-G-5 has become available now (or something which is sold as is), and it is not affected by the NL ban. Hoping to see some reports of this, but it seems like the 2C-G that was sold not too long ago didn't yield any reports either so far.

In case anyone else was wondering what 2C-G-5 looks like, here's the diagram from wikipedia:


![125px-2C-G-5.svg.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2Fd%2Fd6%2F2C-G-5.svg%2F125px-2C-G-5.svg.png&hash=79d5e29cd4f86232026c75c5a951cf30)


> *Dosage*: 10–16 mg
> 
> *Duration*: 32–48 hours
> 
> *Effects*: Similar to [2C-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2C-B) for some users. General euphoria (sometimes followed by irritability), often leading to tiredness (likely due to duration).

As the type of person who's always been like "Damn, I want to try every Shulgin chemical and every variation that's reasonably safe at some point!" I never once expected to see any of the 2C-G family other than maybe 2C-G-N, 2C-G or their amphetamine homologs on the market. The remainder either have precursors or syntheses that are truly challenging to pull off, and the long durations rarely appeal to people on the common market. 2C-G-5 has perhaps the easiest precursor to access and it skirts around many of the structural bans in places like the Netherlands for now. What I'm really interested in, is if that precursor for 2C-G-5 can be modified in any meaningful way, hanging a halogen off of it for example would be an interesting experiment.

The release of 2C-G-5 is really exciting.

It should be legal in NL & GER, right?


If someone sends those 5mg pellets to a lab to confirm it's identity, please report back!


Also if someone tests them.

I'd think about trying one 5mg pellet if I get my hands on them.

The long duration is a put off though. I propably wouldn't take a full dose.


I wonder whether there'll be new phenethylamines (psychedelics? Uppers? Even empathogens?) which don't fall under the blanket ban.


Exciting indeed!


There's also the new cocaine analog "N-Dipropyl-Dimethocaine / DiCaine" & a new methaqualone analog called MCPPQ in NL now.
