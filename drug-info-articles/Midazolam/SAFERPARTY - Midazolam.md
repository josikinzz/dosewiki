## Effects
Midazolam has a calming, relaxing, antispasmodic, anti-anxiety and sleep-inducing effect.
Taking benzodiazepines increases the effectiveness of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABA-A receptor. This triggers sedative (calming), hypnotic, anxiolytic (anxiety-relieving), anticonvulsant (anticonvulsant) and muscle-relaxing effects in the body. Benzodiazepines have a depressant effect on the central nervous system. The flow of information in the brain between the brain cells (neurons) is thereby reduced / disturbed and feelings and perceptions are dampened.
The breakdown of the individual active ingredients of benzodiazepines in the body is age-dependent and therefore varies from person to person.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
There is little information available on risks, toxicity, side effects and long-term consequences. Therefore, the general information on benzodiazepines applies:
When mixing with other downers (alcohol, GHB/GBL, heroin) there is a risk of respiratory paralysis!
Taking benzodiazepines can cause numerous undesirable side effects. In addition, regular and long-term use carries a very high risk of physical and psychological dependence. Benzodiazepines should only be taken as prescribed by a doctor and only for a short period of time (max. 4-6 weeks). Longer-term use should be discussed with the treating specialist. The dosages and duration of action of the individual benzodiazepines differ considerably.
Side effects of benzodiazepines may be as follows: Prolonged fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, impaired reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, headaches, dizziness, motor difficulties, visual disturbances, slowed breathing, muscle weakness, confusion, sexual dysfunction, aggression, outbursts of anger, restlessness, random movements, allergies, skin problems/rashes and speech and movement disorders. Some benzodiazepines can cause seizures in epileptics.

### Long-term Risks
Regular and long-term use can lead to psychological and physical dependence (very high dependence potential). Immediate discontinuation of the drug after prolonged use can lead to negative withdrawal symptoms (including dizziness, physical weakness, inner restlessness, tremors, sleep disturbances, headaches, sweating, nausea, hallucinations and depression).
In addition, seizures and memory disorders/loss and listlessness (hangover effects) can occur. In case of possible dependence, withdrawal should be discussed with a doctor beforehand and the withdrawal should be medically accompanied. It is extremely important that the dose is reduced gradually.

## Safer Use
- If medicines are obtained on the black market or on the internet and not from a pharmacy/medical facility, the contents are unclear. Have the medicine tested for the exact ingredients in a drug check!
- Do not rely on dosage information from colleagues who regularly use benzodiazepines. Due to habituation or dependence, their doses can be much higher and fatal for new users.
- Blisters of counterfeits may look identical to the original packaging.
- The simultaneous consumption of depressant substances such as alcohol, ketamine, GHB/GBL, nitrous oxide, opioids and/or other benzodiazepines is dangerous as there is an increased risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. The risk of suffocation is high!
