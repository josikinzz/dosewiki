## Subjective Experience

BK-2C-B began to appear on the markets in 2013. Whilst it did not generate any
particular fanfare or excitement, it was consistently available, and over the following
years was sampled by relatively large numbers.

From my own perspective, its long duration provided something of a deterrent:
writing off at least a day to test it wasn’t the easiest commitment to make. However,
in 2014 I gave it a spin.

The results were disappointing. I experienced a mild psychedelic buzz, with minor
body and head stimulation. This was at such a low level that it was difficult to
document in much detail.

Subsequently, I discovered that the likely reason for this was that its effects are
diluted considerably if it is mixed with water upon ingestion. Further research
indicated that the usual modus operandi was to bomb it in a gel cap, or in cigarette
paper, with an acid based drink.

Regarding dose, online trip reports suggested that the effects were extremely
variable. Some people experienced intensity at well under 100mg, whereas others felt
very little, replicating my own story.

For this experiment, and after much deliberation, I decided to dose at 80mg. I based
this upon my new found knowledge regarding acidity, and on the generic
recommendations of the major harm reduction communities.

I had BK-2-CB samples available in both pill and powder form. I chose to proceed
with powder, simply because I could weigh this with greater precision.

I embarked upon the exercise with an empty stomach and low expectations.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I attempt to measure 80mg, but 82mg drops on to the scale. I bomb it
in rizla cigarette paper with a glass of orange juice. [3pm]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:40 Earlier than I anticipated something is emerging: a hazy drifty
headspace. This is minor but clearly present. I also feel slight physical
warmth, and a mild anxiolytic effect is taking hold.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 A heady psychedelic feel is now firmly in place. Visually, a blurry
sheen has developed, which is emphasised when I change my field of focus.
There could be an impression of after-images and diffraction, but there is no
significant distortion, and no movement (morphing, breathing, etc). I feel a
little distant, but quite relaxed.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I am warm with a general overlay of body tingles. With the latter aspect in
play I can understand why some people consider this to be a sex enhancing
drug.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:30 All the previous effects are now well established, and this is quite a
pleasant journey. I do feel some body strain, but nothing excessive. It is
certainly one of the tingliest and most physical psychedelics I have
experienced.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Although it lacks the intellectual depth of the lysergamides, the head buzz is
quite intense, and the hazy visual sheen is stronger than it was earlier.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I am well into ++ territory on the Shulgin scale, but not quite touching +++. I
am functional, but I am at the point at which it is increasingly difficult to hide
my tripping status. I certainly have to avoid anything other than brief episodes
of communication with third parties.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
T+2:00 The onset is definitely complete, and I have stabilised on a plateau. It
remains very physical, with almost constant tingles, and the head haze
continues unabated.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:00 The experience has calmed, and is drifting towards the lower end of
the ++ range. I am comfortable, with the sentient flushes of body awareness
interjecting from time to time. The headspace is now sufficiently mild that I
could happily socialize in the right company.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+4:00 I have now moved into a period of lower level psychedelic glow. The
headspace is gentle and can be pushed into the background at will, and the
physicality is gently tumbling along.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
This has been extremely tactile, with body sensitivity greatly enhanced. This
facet reminds me of Shulgin’s statements with respect to 2C-B and sexuality.
Under the right circumstances this aspect would clearly be supercharged.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
There is a degree of mental fatigue entering the fray, but given its positivity I
seek to make the most of the longevity of the experience.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+5:00 The show is over to the extent that the main act has left the stage. I
am still lapping up the dying embers of what has been an excellent ride.
Although there are no more fireworks to be seen; I continue to bask in a lower
level psychedelic aura.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
It is comfortable and I am relaxed, but all intensity has departed. Even so, I
remain in a place from which I am in no hurry to leave. Indeed, I hope that the
claims that this lasts for many more hours are accurate.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
At this point it seems that Psychonautwiki wasn’t far off the mark with this
comment:
“The effects of this compound are described as considerably more
stimulating and less psychedelic with a longer duration in comparison
to its close structural relative 2C-B”
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Perhaps there is also an empathogenic edge lurking, along with the usual
softening of ego.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Although it is rather late in the game I check my pupils in the mirror. They are
dilated: the left more than the right. I’ve no idea what this means, if anything.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+7:00 The last two hours passed quickly, as I was consumed in a Terence
McKenna lecture, courtesy of YouTube.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+8:00 The headspace still lingers, as does the tranquillity, and I remain quite
happy. I notice belatedly that audio seems to be enhanced. I should have
explored this earlier.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
T+9:00 I take 0.5mg of etizolam as a sleep aid, and retire to bed.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+10:00 Whilst I lie in bed and close my eyes, mild CEVs are present. This is
something else I should have explored earlier!
\`\`\`
The night’s sleep was undisturbed, but was not long enough. In the morning I was
mentally fatigued, and an early nap was already on my mind as I prepared for the
day. Unfortunately, I still felt some psychedelic stimulation and edge, so this was not
going to be possible.

In terms of duration, this was certainly a long one, and it took its toll. Having said
this, my general mood remained elevated and I was relaxed, so the prolonged length
was not all negative.

Regarding dose, it transpired that 80mg was plenty, and the fruit juice trick was
entirely effective.

For years I looked down on this drug with a snobbish too-familiar attitude: it was so
widely available yet there were so few enthusiasts. However, it surprised me. I had an
excellent time. Body load was a little too high, but perhaps this was the cost of the
thrill and exhilaration of the tactility.

I am glad that I procured enough to engage a few more trips before the
counterproductive axe of the Psychoactive Substances Act made it impossible to
source.

\`\`\`
BK-2C-B was commonly available in both pill and powder form.

## Summary
βk-2C-B, bk-2C-B, also known as 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxy-β-ketophenethylamine or as β-keto-2C-B, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine and 2C family. It is the β-keto derivative of 2C-B. The drug is taken orally.
The drug acts as a very-low-potency serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist.
βk-2C-B was first described in the scientific literature by Richard Glennon and colleagues in 2004. It was first encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe in 2013. The drug has since become a controlled substance in Canada, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

## Use and effects
βk-2C-B was not included nor mentioned in Alexander Shulgin's book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved). However, it subsequently emerged as a novel recreational designer drug and its properties and effects were reported. βk-2C-B is usually taken orally, but may also be used by other routes. Insufflation is said to be not well-tolerated. The drug has been said to be used at doses of 150 to 1,000 mg orally. Its onset is said to be 20 to 70 minutes and its duration is said to long at 10 to 40 hours. The effects of βk-2C-B have been said to include euphoria, psychedelic visuals, entactogenic effects, and sensory enhancement, among others.
