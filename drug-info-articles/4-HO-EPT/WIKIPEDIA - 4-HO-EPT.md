## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

4-HO-EPT is a potent full agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. It has one to two orders of magnitude greater potency as a serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptor agonist than as a serotonin 5-HT2C receptor agonist. The drug also shows affinity for other serotonin receptors, such as the serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT6 receptors. 4-HO-EPT produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents.

### Pharmacokinetics

The metabolism of 4-HO-EPT has been studied.

## Chemistry

### Analogues
