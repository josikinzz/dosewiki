2,5-Dimethoxy-4-isopropylamphetamine (also known as DOiP and DOiPr) is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine, amphetamine, and DOx families. It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin, and was described in his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved). He described DOiPR as being at least an order of magnitude weaker than DOPR, with doses of 20 to 30 mg orally required to produce valid changes in mental state. Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of DOiP. DOiP substitutes for DOM in rodent drug discrimination tests, but it is several-fold less potent than other DOx drugs like DOM, DOET, and DOPR, though it is similar in potency to DOBU.
