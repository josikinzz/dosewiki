DESCRIPTION #
 
General Effects Notes
 The effects of 5-MAPB are usually compared to [MDMA](https://erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/) and other euphoric stimulants like 6-APB, MBDB, etc. 
 
 5-MAPB is less physically stimulating than MDMA, methamphetamine, 2-FA, 4-FA, and many other euphoric stimulants at equivalent levels of empathogenesis. Some users combine 5-MAPB with low doses of more epinephrine and dopamine agonist stimulants in order to "fill in" for the lack of wakefulness and stimulation that 5-MAPB provides. When taking 5-MAPB by itself, higher doses are often ingested than when combined with other drugs, in part because of this lack of stimulating effects when taken alone. When taken at oral doses over 150 mg, strong jaw tension and other physical side effects become evident and can become problematic. 
 
 
Routes of Administration
 5-MAPB is most often taken orally, though there are reports of insufllation, rectal administration, and a few reports of IM (intramuscular) and IV (intravenous) use. 
 
 
Addiction and Compulsive Use
 Although 5-MAPB's character as a euphoric, empathogenic stimulant can trigger a desire to redose and/or to take the drug again in the near future, it's less stimulating effect profile seems to be associated with less compulsive redosing than some other related drugs. Because its short history of human use and lack of experimental research, no definitive statements can be made about the risk of addiction and/or compulsive use across a wide cross section of users.
 
EXPERIENCE EXCERPTS #
 
[30 mg oral] "30 mg of 5-MAPB was, to me, definitely comparable to a 'standard pill' of ecstacy (MDMA). I think that 50 mg would be comparable to a strong pill. I might try that, or actually I'm eager to. But ingesting something like 100 mg or more is not something I would try with a new substance like this." -- [101375](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=101375)
 
[50 mg oral] "Very pleasant, lovely tactile sensitivity in body and occasional pleasant waves flowed through me, much empathy felt, strong desire to communicate though I did not find this chemical very stimulating at all. [...] Was far more open than normal..." -- [UK Chem Research](https://www.ukchemicalresearch.org/Thread-5-MAPB-1-benzofuran-5-yl-N-methylpropan-2-amine)
 
[100 mg oral] "totally in a party mood, awake and with positive attitude. No nausea or head spinning like it happened to me sometimes with mdma or 5apb hcl. Cold hands as usual, bit of bruxism and jaw tension, nothing uncontrollable tho." -- [UK Chem Research](https://www.ukchemicalresearch.org/Thread-5-MAPB-1-benzofuran-5-yl-N-methylpropan-2-amine)
 
[125 mg oral] "ife and I use this time to be intimate physically and lots of cuddling. Some talking but nothing deep mostly physical things. My senses of touch, sound, and sight are all heightened and I feel waves of euphoria. Music is enrapturing and colors are slightly brighter or sharper hard to describe. I do not get any kind of visual hallucinations open or closed eye except for color shifts or whatever you want to call the brightening and sharpening of colors." -- [103398](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=103398)
 
[125 mg oral] "Super euphoria. Sweating profusely. Jaw seems to have been swinging for some time now. Big eyes. [...] Look at my watch (glow in the dark) and see moving chinese symbols in bright green. Most unexpected thing i've ever seen (wasnt expecting a trip at all)." -- [Bluelight](http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/657421-The-Main-5-MAPB-Thread?p=11375552&viewfull=1#post11375552)
 
[265 mg oral] "I can't recall much of what happened through the night but my arms and legs were convulsing heavily, I was drenched in sweat, my hands and feet were contorted, could barely move my mouth to talk because of insane bruxism and my neck tremoring. Me thinks the beginning of serotonin syndrome." -- [UK Chem Research](https://www.ukchemicalresearch.org/Thread-5-MAPB-1-benzofuran-5-yl-N-methylpropan-2-amine?page=2)

DOSAGE DESCRIPTION #
 
Caution : Dose information should not be taken as recommendations. [ see below ]
 
**5-MAPB Dosages**
**Oral**
**( tentative )**
- Threshold: 10 - 20 mg
- Light: 20 - 30 mg
- Common: 30 - 70 mg
- Strong: 60 - 120 mg
- Heavy: 120+ mg
 
**5-MAPB Dosages**
**Nasal / Insufflated**
**( tentative )**
- Threshold: 7 - 15 mg
- Light: 15 - 20 mg
- Common: 20 - 50 mg
- Strong: 40 - 80 mg
- Heavy: 80+ mg
 
 
5-MAPB is a synthetic empathogenic stimulant that is most often found in powder form and taken orally, nasally, or rectally. IM and IV use have been reported. Although there's a wide range of reported doses reported, often this is related to differences in expectations for effects. 5-MAPB is considered slightly more potent than MDMA (but less stimulating), on a milligram per milligram basis, with perhaps 50-70mg of 5-MAPB being the equivalent of 100mg of MDMA. Because Erowid has read less than 40 total human reports of 5-MAPB use (as of Oct 2014), dose ranges are tentative. 
 
 Some other information sources suggest that 100 mg is a "normal" dose, but the effects reported at this or higher doses are often very strong and the negative side-effects more prominent. 5-MAPB may not be suited to those seeking strong stimulation, as the doses required to achieve strong stimulation are quite high. 
 
 Several batches of 5-MAPB sold between 2013 and 2015 have included [5- or 6-EAPB](http://www.ecstasydata.org/results.php?start=0&search_field=substance&s=mapb) and doses of the -EAPB versions appear to be lower, making some reported doses of 5-MAPB higher than they would be with pure 5- or 6-MAPB. 
 
 Note that insufflanting 5- or 6-MAPB can be more likely to result in unpleasantly strong effects or over doses.
