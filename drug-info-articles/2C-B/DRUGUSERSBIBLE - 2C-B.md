## Subjective Experience

2C-B was first synthesised by Alexander Shulgin in 1974 and became one of his most
popular creations. It was initially used in psychiatric therapy, before emerging as a
popular recreational drug.

For a period in the late 1980s it was sold as a legal alternative to MDMA, but
generally it is now perceived more accurately; as a chemical which induces its own
unique experience. At the time of writing it is still widely available, and is sometimes
(dubiously) used as a club drug.

It was, in fact, one of Shulgin's personal favourites, particularly in the context of
sexual activity:

```
"If there is anything ever found to be an effective aphrodisiac, it will
probably be patterned after 2C-B in structure." ~ Alexander Shulgin
```
With respect to this, it is interesting to note that it was once sold commercially as an
aphrodisiac, under the names Erox and Nexus.

Research (including with reference to Shulgin’s PiHKAL) also indicates that this
chemical is extremely dose sensitive, with a very steep curve: meaning that only
slight changes in dose can result in significantly different experience outcomes.

After due diligence consideration, and with this in mind, I decide to dose at
15mg, which is pitched well above threshold but is reasonably low on the overall
scale.

As a backdrop, the particular pill I am sampling was recently the subject of a number
of hysterical and misleading UK media reports. It is bright yellow in colour and was
allegedly manufactured in the Netherlands.

```
T+0.00 I crumble the pill (18mg) and put 3mg to one side, swallowing the rest
with fizzy water. Note that I am testing on an empty stomach. [3pm]
```
```
T+0.40 The headspace is starting to develop. A chilly feeling emerges, and I
note that I have cold fingers (indicating vasoconstriction).
```
```
I feel a little shivery, apart from my head, which is strangely warm.
```
```
T+1.00 The ride seems to have settled. The headspace is now stable and the
earlier body sensations linger lightly but gently in the background.
```
```
T+1.15 At this point I am still fully functional and can easily suppress the
experience, which comprises a mild psychedelic ambiance with no obvious
visuals, other than brighter colouration should I focus upon this aspect.
Layered on top of this there is a physical awareness which is slowly levelling.
```
```
T+1:30 There is no significant change. I am in a solid ++ state, but one which
is not unduly exciting.
```
```
T+1:45 As this is clearly not going to escalate much further, if at all, I pop the
remaining 3mg from the original pill. The total dose is now 18mg.
```
```
T+2:00 I test taste, via a bag of plain crisps. There is no particular change or
enhancement, and no noticeable loss or increase in appetite.
```
```
Now, what about sex and horn, as so frequently referred to?
```

```
There is certainly interest, but it is not overwhelming by any means.
```
```
I do feel that sexual human contact would be enhanced as there is a tactile
edge to this, but there is no strong or compulsive drive or urge (as per certain
stimulants). It is quite subtle in nature, and I suspect that suitable
circumstances and intimacy would make all the difference.
```
```
T+2:30 I feel content and happy enough, although I am not tripping high or
particularly intensively. The shivers and chills have largely dissipated and
there is no perceptible discomfort in terms of body load. My skin does feel
relatively sensitised, in a strange entactogenic sort of way.
```
```
My mind tends to wander and drift, again though it is well under normal
functional control if I focus. I feel a little dreamy.
```
```
Despite eating so little today, after the crisps and some yoghurt I don't feel at
all hungry. Note that I have been drinking plenty of fluid, but for safety
reasons rather than thirst.
```
```
Regarding visuals, along with slightly enhanced colouration there is a degree
of morphing in play, albeit light and transient. This isn’t a central feature.
```
```
T+3:10 At this point I believe that I am drifting back down towards baseline,
which defies most of the published material.
```
```
I feel a sense of calmness and serenity: a comfortable and positive mood.
There remains a certain sentience which is not quite tingly, but is perhaps a
prelude status to this condition.
```
```
T+3:30 The effects documented earlier are still present, but are much less
pronounced. I am closing in on normality.
```
```
T+4:00 To all intents and purposes, I am back to base, with only the usual sort
of post-trip afterglow persisting.
```
Following this pleasant but unspectacular experience, I tired a little earlier than
usual and retired to bed early. I slept well and woke up with no hangover at all.

Overall, this was a good ++ experience. I can see how some people confuse it with
MDMA, but I found it to be less empathogenic and I was much more body conscious.
I found it to be similar to, but less intense than, a 10-12mg dose of 2C-B-FLY (noting
that I hadn’t tested any of the other 2C compounds at this point).

Given my size and experience 15mg was probably a good introductory dose, but if
further testing is possible, I will probably increase this to the 20mg range. Generally,
however, as some users do report body load issues, caution is advisable.
