**Propylhexedrine** (also known as **Benzedrex** and **Obesin** ) is a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [cycloalkylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cycloalkylamine) class. It is a structural analog of [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) . Propylhexedrine is widely used medicinally as a nasal decongestant (for relief of congestion due to colds, allergies and allergic rhinitis) and sometimes used recreationally as an over-the-counter "legal high".

Benzedrex was first manufactured by Smith, Kline and French after the Benzedrine inhaler, which contained racemic amphetamine, became unavailable following the placement of [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamines) on the US Schedule II status (i.e. highest abuse potential, yet with accepted medicinal uses). Propylhexedrine has also been used in Europe as an appetite suppressant under the trade name Obesin. In the United States, propylhexedrine is most commonly found in over-the-counter Benzedrex nasal inhalers.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement) , [motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement) , [increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido) , [appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . Anecdotal reports describe propylhexedrine's effects as similar to [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or low-dose [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) . However, it is reported to produce more peripheral effects like [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) as well as less euphoria, overall resulting in a less "clean" high. In the United States, propylhexedrine is sometimes extracted from over-the-counter Benzedrex nasal inhalers using lemon juice. The health risks of this practice have not been studied.

Due to its amphetamine-like euphoric effects, propylhexedrine is considered to have moderate abuse potential. Chronic use may result in tolerance, physical and psychological dependence. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

Propylhexedrine is chemically classified as a [cycloalkylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cycloalkylamine) . It is structurally similar to [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine_(compound)) and [its derivates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) . It is particularly similar in structure to [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , with the only structural difference being the substitution of an cyclohexane ring for methamphetamine's phenyl ring. This makes propylhexedrine a structural analog of methamphetamine.

Moreover, propylhexedrine is a chiral compound (the α-carbon is chiral), and the product contained in pharmaceutical products is racemic (RS)-propylhexedrine free base. (S)-Propylhexedrine, also known as levopropylhexedrine, is believed to be the more biologically active isomer of the two, although [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamines) with a "levo" prefix are less active than their counterparts. (S)-Propylhexedrine can be synthesized from methamphetamine. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

[Freebase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_base) propylhexedrine is nonpolar, volatile, oily liquid at room temperature, but it readily forms a polar salt when protonated with hydrochloric acid, citric acid, and acetic acid to form a crystalline white substance. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] As a volatile liquid, it evaporates over time, losing potency drastically quicker than crystalline substances; However, the salt forms are crystalline, and do not evaporate.

## Pharmacology

Propylhexedrine affects the central nervous system (CNS) by acting as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) for the [monoamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine) [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) , and [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) ( [SNDRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine_releasing_agent) ), binding to and reversing their transporters, pumping these neurotransmitters from the cytosol to the synaptic cleft, where these neurotransmitters can bind to their respective receptors. Additionally, propylhexedrine inhibits [VMAT2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicular_monoamine_transporter_2) , leading to a further increase in the aforementioned monoamines, being that VMAT2 transports all 3 from the synaptic cleft to the cytosol. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Propylhexedrine, like [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) , [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , and [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , agonizes [TAAR1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAAR1) . TAAR1 agonism, through protein kinase A & C (PKA and PKC) signaling, causes dopamine transporter (DAT) phosphorylation. Both PKA and PKC result in non-competitive dopamine reuptake inhibition, although PKC alone results in dopamine release/DAT reversal.

The pharmacological actions of propylhexedrine are similar to those of [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) , such as [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) , albeit in a generally less centrally active and recreationally desirable fashion.

Since propylhexedrine has a cyclohexane ring in the place of methamphetamine's phenyl ring, it lacks the level of Brain-Blood Barrier permeability that the phenyl ring provides amphetamines, and therefore has a greater proportion of effects on the peripheral nervous system relative to the central nervous system.

Propylhexedrine has a half-life of 2.5 - 6.5 hours, which is variable based on urinary pH and the level of activity of certain Cytochrome P450 enzymes. Higher urinary pH elongates duration, while low urinary pH shortens duration. Higher activity of certain Cytochrome P450 enzymes also shortens duration.

Propylhexedrine is metabolized by certain Cytochrome P450 enzymes into norpropylhexedrine, cyclohexylacetoxime, *cis* -4-hydroxypropylhexedrine and *trans* -4-hydroxypropylhexedrine.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, propylhexedrine is usually considered to be extremely energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is extremely similar to that of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , and stronger than that of [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) , [caffeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Caffeine) , and [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) . It is similar to the stimulation experienced on racemic or the levorotorary form of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or the racemic [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , encouraging physical activities such as dancing, socializing, running, or cleaning. The particular style of stimulation which propylhexedrine presents can be described as forced or pressing and is noticeably more [adrenergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Adrenaline) and tense on the body. This means that at higher dosages, it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still as jaw clenching, involuntarily bodily shakes and vibrations become present, resulting in extreme shaking of the entire body, unsteadiness of the hands, and a general lack of motor control.
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - Heart palpitations are commonly reported on common to heavy doses of this substance due to its significant peripheral nervous system activity.
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - Propylhexedrine has been noted by users to raise blood pressure significantly more than other stimulants. It has been speculated that this is due to its higher affinity for [noradrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) relative to stimulants such as [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) .
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - Due to its pronounced peripheral nervous system activity, propylhexedrine tends to increase heart rate much more drastically than comparable dosages of other stimulants.
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Bronchodilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bronchodilation)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Frequent urination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frequent_urination)**
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - This effect is prominent on the onset and come up period when ingested via the cotton found inside Benzedrex inhalers, particularly when it is taken on an empty stomach.
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)**
- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** - Propylhexedrine has been noted by users as being particularly vasoconstrictive in comparison to other stimulants. It has been speculated that this is due to its higher affinity for [noradrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) relative to stimulants such as [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) . ### Visual effects
 
- As with [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , the visual effects of propylhexedrine are usually less consistent and are only mildly noticeable at higher dosages. They are somewhat comparable to the visual effects produced by [deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriants) and are generally more frequent in darker areas. 
#### Suppressions
 
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)** - An uncommon effect that only occurs at very high, potentially dangerous or toxic dosages.
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** - This effect is usually subtle and barely noticeable and only occurs at higher dosages or when combined with [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) . Commonly this consists of level 1-2 drifting.
- **[Brightness alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brightness_alteration)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of propylhexedrine can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The general head space of propylhexedrine is described by many as one of moderate to extreme mental stimulation, increased focus, and powerful euphoria. It contains a large number of typical [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) cognitive effects. Although negative side effects are usually mild at low to moderate dosages, they become increasingly likely to manifest themselves with higher amounts or extended usage. This particularly holds true during the offset of the experience. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria)** - The euphoria capable of being produced by propylhexedrine is reported to be similiar to that of [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) at high doses.
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation)**
- **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This component is most effective at low to moderate dosages as anything higher will usually impair concentration.
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Memory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought organization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_organization)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)** - Due to depletion of the essential neurotransmitters [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , and [norepinephine](/w/index.php?title=Norepinephine&action=edit&redlink=1) , propylhexedrine can cause moderate to strong feelings of depression after large doses.
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** - According to anecdotal reports, residual feelings of wakefulness can persist for up to 12 hours after the initial high wears off.
### Experience reports

Anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) include:

Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: Pharms - Propylhexedrine](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Pharms_Propylhexedrine.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity of recreational propylhexedrine use has not been studied as extensively as that of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) but it is reasonable to assume that most if not all of the same risks apply.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , the chronic use of propylhexedrine can be considered highly addictive, and is capable of causing psychological and physiological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops or drastically decreases their usage.

Tolerance to the effects of this compound likely occurs in the same general fashion as with [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) rapidly develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Propylhexedrine presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of propylhexedrine all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) will have a reduced effect.

Like with [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and methamphetamine the evidence on effective treatments for dependence and abuse is limited. In light of this, [fluoxetine](/w/index.php?title=Fluoxetine&action=edit&redlink=1) and [imipramine](/w/index.php?title=Imipramine&action=edit&redlink=1) appear to have some limited benefits in treating abuse and addiction

In highly dependent [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) abusers, "when chronic heavy users abruptly discontinue methamphetamine use, many report a time-limited withdrawal syndrome that occurs within 24 hours of their last dose". Withdrawal symptoms in chronic, high-dose users are frequent, occurring in up to 87.6% of cases, and persist for three to four weeks with a marked "crash" phase occurring during the first week. Methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, drug craving, dysphoric mood, fatigue, increased appetite, increased movement or decreased movement, lack of motivation, sleeplessness or sleepiness, and vivid or lucid dreams. Withdrawal symptoms are associated with the degree of dependence (i.e., the extent of abuse). The mental depression associated with methamphetamine withdrawal lasts longer and is more severe than that of [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) withdrawal. . It is likely that propylhexedrine abuse is subject to these same outcomes.

### Psychosis

Like with the abuse of methamphetamine, propylhexedrine abuse can result in a stimulant-induced psychotic state that may present with a variety of symptoms (e.g., [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) ), though likely to a lesser degree. A review on treatment for amphetamine, [dextroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) abuse-induced psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. The same review asserts that, based upon at least one trial, [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Tricyclic antidepressants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricyclic_antidepressant)** - Propylhexedrine may increase the effects of tricyclic antidepressants to dangerous levels.
- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with Propylhexedrine should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Propylhexedrine may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.

- **[MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs)** - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , and some [antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressants) .
- **[Cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine)** - This combination may increase strain on the heart to dangerous levels.
