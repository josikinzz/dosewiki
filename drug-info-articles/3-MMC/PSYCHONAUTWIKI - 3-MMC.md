**3-Methylmethcathinone** (also known as **3-MMC** or **metaphedrone** ) is a novel [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) - [entactogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) substance of the [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cathinone) class. It is a structural analog of [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) (4-MMC) and was created as a legal designer drug after the banning of 4-MMC. The mechanism of action is not fully studied, but [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and norepinephrine releasing activity is known to be involved.

3-MMC first appeared on the online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market shortly after the banning of the massively popular mephedrone. Its first emergence was recorded in Europe in 2012 . It is a prominent example of a contemporary [designer drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) specifically chosen to mimic and/or replace the functional and structural features of its recently-controlled predecessors.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) , [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [enhanced empathy and sociability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement) , [relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . The effects are reported to be similar to those of mephedrone, which is sometimes described as a hybrid of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) .

However, it is described as being slightly less entactogenic and more stimulating than mephedrone, and some report more side effects. Like mephedrone and [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) , it is associated with [compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) and abuse due to its powerful, short-lived [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoric) rush. It is typically administered via [insufflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insufflation) , although [oral](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Oral) and [injection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Injection) [routes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes) have been observed.

Limited data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 3-MMC, and it has little history of human use. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Preliminary evidence suggests chronic use (i.e. high dose, repeat administration) may carry neurotoxic and cardiotoxic risks. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] It is reported to produce the symptoms of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) depletion with overuse.

It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

3-MMC, or 3-Methylmethcathinone, belongs to a class of synthetic organic compounds known as cathinones. Cathinones are a sub-category of [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamines) , meaning they share the core amphetamine structure of a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain, and an additional methyl substitution at R α .

Cathinones are differentiated by their ketone substitution on the beta carbon of the amphetamine skeleton, meaning they are β-keto-amphetamines. 3-MMC has two methyl substitutions on its cathinone skeleton, one at R 3 of the phenyl ring, and a second at the nitrogen group R N .

It is a structural analog of [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) (4-methylmethcathinone), meaning it is identical in structure except for the placement of the methyl group at R 4 instead of R 3

It is a chiral compound with a stereocenter at R 2 of the propane side-chain. Two enantiomers exist: R-3-MMC and S-3-MMC. Due to the similarity with cathinone proper, the S form is thought to be more potent than the R form [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] .

The hydrochloride salt of 3-MMC occurs as a white crystalline powder. It has a melting point of 193.2 ± 0.2°C (hydrochloride salt) and a boiling point of 280.5 ± 23.0°C at 760 mm Hg. It is sparingly soluble in PBS; slightly soluble in ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, and dimethyl formamide [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] .

## Pharmacology

Due to the lack of research regarding the substance, all discussion regarding the pharmacology of it is purely speculation based upon its structure and subjective effect similarities to other [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) and [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) such as [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and [2-FMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FMA) .

3-MMC most likely acts as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) . This means that it effectively boosts the levels of the [monoamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine) [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) , and [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) in the brain by binding to and partially blocking the transporter proteins that normally remove them from the synaptic cleft. This allows the neurotransmitters to accumulate in the brain, resulting in [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - 3-MMC is reported to be extremely stimulating and energetic. It can encourage physical activities like running or dancing, which makes it popular for parties and raves. 
The style of stimulation can be described as "forced". This means that at higher doses, it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still as jaw clenching, involuntarily body shakes and vibrations become present.
 
Additionally, persistent or wave-like feelings of deep [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) and [relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) may be paradoxically present, typically at moderate to strong doses.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of 3-MMC can be characterized as a moderate to extreme euphoric tingling sensation that encompasses the entire body. It is capable of becoming overwhelmingly pleasurable at higher doses. This sensation maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - Physical euphoria is very prominent when used responsibly (i.e. reasonable dosing and spacing between experiences) and can lead to profound feelings of social and physical [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) .
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Tactile hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_hallucination)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)**
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Decreased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** ”
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Nausea is most commonly present during the [come up](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Come_up) phase of the experience, and at higher doses, but has been reported to occur spontaneously in those who are thought to be susceptible to it.
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Dry mouth](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dry_mouth)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** - This effect is typically very strong. It is reported that this effect is often more prominent than that experienced from using [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] This effect may contribute to excessive redosing, which is a commonly reported effect for this substance.
- **[Orgasm suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orgasm_suppression)**
- **[Vibrating vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vibrating_vision)** - At high doses, the user's eyeballs may begin to spontaneously wiggle back and forth in a rapid motion, causing the vision to become blurry and temporarily out of focus. This is a condition known as [nystagmus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nystagmus) .
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This effect when experienced alongside [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) can often lead to users mildly or intensely clenching their jaw muscles, sometimes even to the point where the individual’s facial expression begins to change. This is sometimes colloquially called “gurning” and is typically only experienced in common to high dosages.
- **[Shortness of breath](/w/index.php?title=Shortness_of_breath&action=edit&redlink=1)** - Due to the strong vasoconstriction 3-MMC causes, the blood flow to organs can be limited. When this happens in the lungs or in the chest muscles, the vasoconstriction can cause a blood oxygen deficiency and difficulty breathing.
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - This is a rare effect but can likely happen in those predisposed to them, especially when taking heavy doses or redosing while in physically taxing conditions such as being dehydrated, undernourished, overheated or fatigued. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) - The dopaminergic effects of 3-MMC likely contributes to this.**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium)** & **[Confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion)** - This effect typically only occurs with overly high doses, and is associated with temperature dysregulation and overheating, particularly when 3-MMC is taken in crowded, physically strenuous environments that leaves the user unable to cool off, rest, or rehydrate adequately.
- **[Time compression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - Strong feelings of time compression are commonly produced by 3-MMC and speed up the experience of time noticeably.
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
3-MMC presents an array of visual enhancements which are mild in comparison to traditional psychedelics, but still distinctly present. These generally include:
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
 
#### Suppressions
 
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**

## Reagent results

Exposing compounds to the reagents gives a colour change which is indicative of the compound under test.

## Toxicity and harm potential

As with most [research chemicals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemicals) , the long-term effects of 3-MMC have not been researched extensively enough to provide accurate information of its risks and harm.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , the chronic use of 3-MMC can be considered extremely addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage. It is said that this compound is considerably more addictive than that of [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) .

Tolerance to many of the effects of 3-MMC develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 3-MMC presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of 3-MMC all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with 3-MMC should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - 3-MMC may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.

#### Serotonin syndrome risk

Combinations with the following substances can cause dangerously high [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) levels. [Serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) requires immediate medical attention and can be fatal if left untreated.

- **MAOIs** - Such as [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , phenelzine, selegiline, and moclobemide.
- **Serotonin releasers** - Such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) , [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) and [αMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91MT) .
- **SSRIs** - Such as citalopram and sertraline
- **[SNRIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNRIs)** - Such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) and venlafaxine
- **5-HTP**
