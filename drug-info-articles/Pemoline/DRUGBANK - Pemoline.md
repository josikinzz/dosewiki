## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzene and substituted derivatives. These are aromatic compounds containing one monocyclic ring system consisting of benzene.

### Background

In 2005, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) withdrew approval for pemoline. In March 2005, Abbott Laboratories (Cylert marketer) had discontinued the production of Cylert arguing economic reasons.

### Indication

For treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)

### Pharmacodynamics

Pemoline belongs to the group of medicines called central nervous system (CNS) stimulants. It is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Pemoline stimulates the brain, probably by affecting neurotransmitters, the chemicals in the brain that nerves use to communicate with each other.

### Absorption

Pemoline is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract

### Metabolism

Hepatic

### Half-life

The serum half-life of pemoline is approximately 12 hours.

### Toxicity

Side effects include insomnia, anorexia, stomach ache, skin rashes, increased irritability, mild depression, nausea, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, and hallucinations
