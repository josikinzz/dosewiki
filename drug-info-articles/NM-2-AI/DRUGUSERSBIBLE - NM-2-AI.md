## Subjective Experience

I have sampled this as an ingredient of a number of blends, most notably in
combination with MPA. These definitely produced a nice ride, and there is no doubt
that NM2AI brought something to the table. The question, therefore, is whether it
has any value stand-alone.

A couple of years ago I explored a light dose via the oral route, but got little return.
More recently I turned to insufflation. I snorted 40mg, which for this RoA is
probably a reasonable first-time dose. The nose burn wasn’t as bad as had been
suggested online.

There was definite psychoactivity: a slight head buzz, some stimulation, and a minor
mood lift. I drifted gently back to baseline after an hour or so. I experienced a very
modest but not unpleasant sojourn.

On the question of whether there is a sweet spot for a significant take-off, I join the
general consensus in not being sure.
