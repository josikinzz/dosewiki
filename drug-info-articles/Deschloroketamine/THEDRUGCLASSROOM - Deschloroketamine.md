# Deschloroketamine
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/deschloroketamine/*

Deschloroketamine is a dissociative research chemical in the arylcyclohexylamine class. It’s very close to ketamine with its structure and it’s closer to ketamine and MXE than to PCP-like dissociatives with its effects.

It might have some antimicrobial properties, but those have only been minimally investigated. If those properties are real, they may provide another reason to limit your frequency of exposure.

The drug is more potent than ketamine and lasts longer.

## Effects

#### Positive

- Anxiolysis
- Dissociation
- Sedation
- Mood improvement

- CEVs and OEVs
- Physical euphoria
- Music enhancement

#### Negative

- Memory impairment
- Motor control impairment

Compared to other dissociatives, it’s typically placed between ketamine and PCP, but is often said to be closer to ketamine and MXE-like dissociatives. It lasts much longer than ketamine, which some people find is a negative quality.

It appears to typically offer relatively tame mental effects and a lower risk of mania than certain dissociatives.

People tend to either like the effects or find them boring. In the “boring” reports, users say it doesn’t offer much beyond basic dissociation and sedation. It’s pretty uncommon to have severely negative experiences.

#### Visuals

At common doses, blurriness, double vision, and seeing things as closer or farther away is common.

The CEVs at common doses can include colors and basic patterns.

#### Common doses

DCK offers a progressive detachment from your body in a dose-dependent manner. Initially, your limbs will feel different when moving and your ability to engage in fluid, quick movements is impaired. There may be a feeling of floatiness.

A general sedative effect is common, though not to the point of falling asleep at normal doses.

The feelings arising from your body can change. You may notice numbness, especially in your extremities, and tactile perception can be blunted. Another common element is a pleasurable feeling of warmth and fuzziness.

At least to a certain degree the effects are akin to non-drug psychological “dissociation.” This is a state in which the person feels less identified with their body and mental activity. They’re acting more as an “observer” than the subject.

It can be hard to think and maintain a normal thought stream, which can be quite impairing. This can lead to a meditative/calm mindset, with lower distractions both externally and internally. Some people find it’s quite a lucid experience, but there are also reports of confusion and major cognitive impairment that leaves people feeling unintelligent for hours.

DCK sometimes offers a psychedelic-like feeling of profoundness and importance, but this isn’t the most typical response.

Difficulty speaking and otherwise communicating is fairly common.

#### Common+ doses

With a sufficient level of dissociation, a sedated and highly disconnected state can arise, often featuring more notable CEVs and OEVs. The OEVs can include somewhat psychedelic-like visuals, such as morphing and melting.

Internally, people can enter states where they’re mostly or entirely oblivious to the outside world. During this time they may experience dream-like sequences or hallucinatory landscapes/environments. Sometimes people even have dream-like scenarios that play out with eyes open.

While these “hole” experiences have been reported with DCK, they might be harder to reach vs. with ketamine.

There can be significant time distortion, especially during a “hole” experience. The “hole,” when obtained, is sometimes described as MXE-like. It can include colors and various dream-like worlds.

Memory is often impaired, so even remembering the entire experience or the hole is difficult.

Your body can feel like it’s distorting, typically in a pleasurable/interesting way.

#### After effects

Some people report depression or cognitive impairment for up to a day after the experience is over. But, like with other dissociatives, antidepressant effects are sometimes noted for a week or so.

## Chemistry & Pharmacology

#### Chemistry

Deschloroketamine is in the arylcyclohexylamine class. It only differs from ketamine in that a chlorine substitution has been removed.

#### Pharmacology

Though we lack pharmacology studies, it almost certainly operates as an NMDA antagonist. Other potential mechanisms have yet to be elucidated.

**Antimicrobial**

A couple patents from the same group in Germany (Detlef Preiss and Akos Tatar) outlined the alleged antimicrobial properties of DCK. Those patents were published around the year 2000 and nothing else has happened with the info since then. No further research has been conducted to formally test DCK’s antimicrobial properties.

Because the burden of proof for patents is low, properties described within them shouldn’t be taken as fact.

There’s also some evidence that ketamine has antimicrobial properties as well, though it’s not clear if they’re present at concentrations relevant to humans.

## History

#### 1966

A patent from Calvin Stevens at Parke-Davis in Michigan described the preparation of deschloroketamine.

#### 1998 – 2000

A couple patents from a group in Germany were published. They described the alleged antimicrobial properties of the substance.

DCK was allegedly capable of significantly benefiting people suffering from bacterial and other kinds of infections.

#### 2015

The EMCDDA received its first report of DCK’s presence through the EU’s Early Warning System. The report came from the UK in March 2015.

#### 2015 onward

Most experience reports have appeared online post-2015.

#### 2015 – 2016

(Frison, 2016) – Reported on the analysis of seized drugs in Italy. 102 envelopes (31 green, 20 pink, and 51 blue) were said to contain ketamine in powder form. Upon analysis, it was determined all of the green and blue envelopes were deschloroketamine, while the pink envelopes were methoxetamine.

#### 2016

(Hout, 2016) – Showed the presence of DCK on AlphaBay and Valhalla, two dark net markets, during the second quarter of 2016.

#### 2016

(Head, 2017) – Based on data from the DEA’s laboratory system, DCK was seized at least 8 times in the US during 2016.

## Legal Status

#### US (as of July 2017)

Uncontrolled

#### Other (list may not be complete)

Controlled in Canada (general ban), Latvia, and the UK (general ban).

## Safety

The safety of deschloroketamine isn’t known, largely due to it being a research chemical. It’s best to use common doses, infrequently, and without combinations.

**Overdose**

Using too much can result in unconsciousness, which comes with risks like vomit aspiration. The impaired, sedated state it provides can also be dangerous due to the potential for falls and other accidents.

**Urinary tract**

It could come with some of the same chronic use concerns as ketamine, meaning problems along the urinary tract that result in pain, increased urinary frequency, and other issues. Avoiding daily or near daily high-dose use can effectively prevent these potential effects.

**Psychological**

Some people find they’re more depressed and prone to emotional fluctuation after using dissociatives like DCK. If you notice this, it’s best to avoid the drug.

Acutely, it could also raise the chance of mania and hypomania, along with confusion.

**Antimicrobial**

Though these properties could potentially exist, they don’t appear to be a major concern with reasonable levels of low-frequency use. Among the possible chronic use concerns would be a disruption of the gut microbiome, but we don’t even know how real the antimicrobial properties are.

**Risky combinations (list may not be complete)**

- Other depressants, including ethanol, benzodiazepines, and opioids.
- MAOIs
- Tramadol
