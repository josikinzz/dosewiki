**2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine** (also known as **DOM** and **STP** or **"Serenity, Tranquility and Peace"** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) class. DOM is a member of the [DOx](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOx) family of compounds which are known for their high potency, long duration, and mixture of [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) and [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) effects. It produces its effects by acting on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) receptors in the brain.

DOM was first synthesized and tested in 1963 by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) . It attained some popularity during the summer of 1967 under the name "STP" ("Serenity, Tranquility, and Peace"), but its use was short-lived due to its side effects. In 1991, the synthesis and pharmacology of DOM was published in Shulgin's book *[PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL)* ("Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved"). .

Over the years, DOM has gained a reputation for being a highly dose-sensitive psychedelic that is often sold on blotting paper and known for its strong visuals, body load and neutral, analytical headspace. Many reports also indicate that the effects of this chemical may be overly difficult to use for those who are not already experienced with psychedelics.

## History and culture

DOM was first synthesized and tested in 1963 by Alexander Shulgin, who was investigating the effect of 4-position substitutions on psychedelic amphetamines. DOM is part of the so-called "magical half-dozen" which refers to Shulgin's self-rated most important phenethylamine compounds, all of which except [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) he developed and synthesized himself. They are found within the first book of [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) and are as follows: [Mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , DOM, [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , [2C-T-2](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-2) and [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) .

In mid-1967, tablets containing 20 mg (later 10 mg) of DOM were widely distributed in the Haight-Ashbury District of San Francisco under the name of "STP" (short for "Serenity, Tranquility, and Peace"). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] This short-lived appearance of DOM on the black market proved disastrous for several reasons. First, the tablets contained an excessively high dose of the chemical. This, combined with DOM’s slow onset of action (which encouraged some users, familiar with substances that have quicker onsets, such as LSD, to re-dose) and its remarkably long duration, caused many users to panic and sent some to the emergency room. Second, treatment of such overdoses was complicated by the fact that it was unknown at the time that the tablets called "STP" were DOM. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Chemistry

DOM, or 4-methyl-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine, is a molecule of the [substituted amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) class. Amphetamines are substituted phenethylamines containing a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain and a methyl group bound to the alpha carbon R α . DOM contains methoxy functional groups (OCH 3 ) attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 and a methyl group attached to carbon R 4 of the phenyl ring. DOM is the amphetamine analogue of the phenethylamine [2C-D](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-D) .

This is one of the last of the experimental compounds within the phenethylamine family on which any animal toxicity studies were performed prior to human studies. The LD50 of DOM is between 100 - 125 mg/kg for a mouse. An effective dose in a human of 2 mg (for an 80 kg man) is equivalent to 25 μg/kg.

As with DOI, the presence of a heavy atom, the bromine atom, in DOB makes the radioactive isotope labelled material a powerful research tool.

## Pharmacology

DOM is a selective [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) at the [5-HT2 receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_System) family. Its psychedelic effects are mediated by its [agonistic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) properties at the 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2B receptors, but less so on the 5-HT 2C receptor. Due to its selectivity, DOM is often used in scientific research when studying the [5-HT2 receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_System) subfamily. DOM is a [chiral](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Chirality) molecule, and *R* -(-)-DOM is the more active [enantiomer](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Enantiomer) , functioning as a potent agonist of the serotonin family of receptors (mainly of the 5-HT 2 subtype). However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

The 2,6-dimethoxy positional isomer of DOM, known as Ψ-DOM, is also mentioned in *PiHKAL* as being active, as is the alpha-ethyl homologue Ariadne. Analogues where the methoxy groups at the 2,5- positions of the aromatic ring have been altered have also been synthesised and tested as part of an effort to identify the binding mode of DOM at the 5-HT 2A receptor. Both the 2- and 5- O-desmethyl derivatives 2-DM-DOM and 5-DM-DOM, and the 2- and 5- ethyl analogues 2-Et-DOM and 5-Et-DOM have been tested, but in all cases were significantly less potent than the corresponding methoxy compound, showing the importance of the oxygen lone pairs in 5-HT 2A binding.

There is a strong implication that some metabolic conversion occurs in the lung, and it is only after this that the truly active metabolite is available for central action. This is consistent with the relatively slow onset of effect, and the very long duration of action.

## Subjective effects

User reports suggest that DOM is relatively clear-headed and absent of side-effects in comparison to [DOC](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOC) or [DOB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOB) . ***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, DOM is usually considered to be mildly stimulating at levels which do not become overwhelming, encouraging users to move around, run, dance, climb and generally engage in physical activities. In comparison, it is more stimulating than psychedelics like [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , but less stimulating than most compounds of the [DOx](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOx) family.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of DOM is reported to be somewhat intense in comparison to most classical [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . However, in comparison to [DOC](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOC) and the overwhelming forcefulness of [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , it can be considered relatively mild and natural in feel. The sensation itself can be described as a constantly present yet somewhat mild energetic pins and needles sensation that encompasses one's entire body. This is coupled with a euphoric, fast-moving, sharp and location specific tingling sensation. It is usually felt over every square inch of the skin, but occasionally manifests itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - Feelings of enhanced tactile sensation are consistently present at moderate levels throughout most DOM experiences. If [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) visuals are reached, an intense sensation of suddenly becoming aware of and being able to feel every single nerve ending across a person's entire body all at once is consistently present.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Bodily pressures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_pressures)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)**
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)**
- **[Muscle cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_cramps)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Mild to extreme nausea is typically reported at moderate to high dosages and either passes once the user has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** - This effect is usually only present at higher dosages, but can be particularly uncomfortable and persistent.
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Increased salivation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_salivation)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)**
- **[Diarrhea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diarrhea)** ### Visual effects
 
- Reports describe DOM as having less pronounced visuals proportional to it's accompanying physical and mental effects at low to moderate dosages. Higher ones do tend to display a unique set of visual effects which is not found with similar substances. 
#### Enhancements
 
- **[Acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Depth perception distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depth_perception_distortions)**
- **[Perspective distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_distortions)**

- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry of DOM is described as being very unique and may share some similarity with [2C-D](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-D) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Variations) as intricate in style, equally algorithmic and abstract in form, equally synthetic and organic in style, structured in organization, brightly lit in lighting, multicolored in scheme, glossy in shading, sharp in edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, equal in rounded and angular corners, non-immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity. Higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry over [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
DOM produces a full range of high-level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more or less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) . These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - In comparison to other psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , DOM is extremely high in its internal hallucinations when approaching higher dosages. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They can be comprehensively described in terms of their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability and [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in appearance. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of DOM are described by many as a combination of prominent mental stimulation and a powerful enhancement of a person's current mental state. 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Empathy, love, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_love,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , but still prove strong enough to provide long-lasting therapeutic effects.
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)** - While DOM is technically able to produce states of ego dissolution, it tends to more often than not develop only in extremely high doses, with grave physical and mental side effects being apparent and is often of a terrifying nature.
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- Transpersonal states on DOM are reported to occur less reliably and consistently than classical psychedelics. This can perhaps be attributed its the prominent physical and stimulating effects, which tends to interfere with the user's ability to fully immerse themselves in the experience. 
- **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
### Experience reports

Anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) include:

Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: DOM](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_DOM.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational DOM use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

DOM is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of DOM is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). DOM presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of DOM all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Overdose

The risk of a DOx overdose is present starting in or past the heavy dose range with sensitive people, or when a DOx is mixed with other substances, particularly [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) or [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) . Non-oral routes also seem to exhibit a higher chance of overdosing, perhaps owing to differences in bioavailability, potency and unpredictability of dosage and effects. The effects of a DOx overdose typically include bizarre, [delusional](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion) and sometimes violent behavior, [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [numbness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) . The user may not be able to communicate and can be severely agitated. At appropriately high doses, more serious side effects such as [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attack) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) which in turn further affect a dangerously [elevated heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) , [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) and [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) may occur. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Severe vasoconstriction typically develops to its peak several hours into the intoxication and may require medical assistance if blood flow is significantly cut off for extended periods of time.

In the event of an overdose, [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) can be administered to mitigate the hyperagitative effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] A powerful vasodilator may also need to be administered to prevent a hypertensive emergency, or in more serious cases, necrosis, organ failure and death from the resulting hypoxia. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] As a result, emergency medical services should always be sought in the event of a DOx overdose.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Lithium** : Lithium is commonly prescribed in the treatment of bipolar disorder; however, there is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with psychedelics can significantly increase the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination should be **strictly avoided** .
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol lowers the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act as triggers for seizures, particularly in those who are predisposed to them. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants affect many parts of the brain. Combined with psychedelics, stimulation can turn into uncontrollable [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [panic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) and [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) . This interaction may cause elevated risk of psychosis. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
