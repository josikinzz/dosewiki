## SYNTHESIS
To a stirred suspension of 0.50 g LAH in 10 mL anhydrous THF, stirred, under nitrogen and at room temperature, there was added a solution of 0.66 g 4-acetoxyindol-3-yl-N,N-dipropylglyoxylamide in 10 mL anhydrous THF. This was added dropwise at a rate that maintained the reaction at reflux. When the addition was complete, the reflux was maintained for an additional 15 min and then the reaction was cooled to 40 Â°C. The excess hydride and the product complex was destroyed by the addition of 1 mL EtOAc followed by 3 mL H2O. The solids were removed by filtration, the filter cake washed with THF, the filtrate and washings pooled, and the solvents removed under vacuum. The residue was distilled at the KugelRohr and the distillate recrystallized from EtOAc/hexane. Thus there was obtained 0.27 g (51%) of 4-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyltryptamine (4-HO-DPT) with a mp 96â97 Â°C. Anal: C,H,N.
