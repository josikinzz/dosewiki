Based on in-vivo reports? Seems weird that substituting the chlorine with a fluorine should make it that much more powerful... you'd figure people would've been all over Fonazepam if it had been four times as potent as Clonazepam.

Then again, maybe the SAR for Triazolos is slightly different than for regular benzos.

Holy shit.  There's going to be so many benzos at the end of all this. 


To be fair this one seems like it has potential. 


I'm looking forward to reports.

1-methyl benzos seem to be a bit different yeah (like diclazepam -> fludiazepam). I'm pretty sure that will apply hear as well.

Sorry if I sound stupid here....But amazing how those hexagons and letter mean something to people, I would not have a clue what they mean ![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)


Slightly off topic.....How is Clonazepam different to Diazepam, would the hexagones and letters be a lot different?

Okay, let me try to explain benzodiazepines as simple and quickly as possible.


Take a look at the [Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine), especially the structure to the right, that's the benzodiazepine core found in all benzodiazepines. There are multiple positions that can be substituted with different substance groups.


R7 is always a halogen (bromine or chlorine) or a nitro group. Bromine is most potent, but also most hypnotic; nitro is most recreational.


R2' can be nothing or a halogen (chlorine, fluorine). Halogens tend to increase the potency a lot.


R2 is pretty much always a ketone (except for triazolobenzodiazepines, which I'll explain below).


R1 can be nothing or a methyl group (again, exception triazolobenzodiazepines).


In triazolobenzodiazepines (such as [Alprazolam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alprazolam)) R1 and R2 are infused into a 1,2,4-triazole ring. The methyl group on the triazole ring can be removed, this roughly halves the potency, but increases the duration (see Estazolam or Metizolam).


Let's take a look at diazepam:


![SZFPiuv.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FSZFPiuv.png&hash=9eca9057f5a5bf542ad9ede8fa116ddc)


R7 is a chlorine group, R1 methyl.


Compare that to clonazepam:


![XSteL3d.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FXSteL3d.png&hash=8c26afca552447f0c017e1cc463c67f4)


R7 is a nitro group, R2' chlorine. The halogen at R2' gives it a much higher potency compared to diazepam.


Triazolobenzodiazepines with a R7 nitro group tend to be the most euphoric/recreational benzodiazepines.


The name Flu-ni-trazolam tells you all about the structure already. Flu = fluorine at R2', ni = nitro at R7, triazolam = triazolo group. Similar how Clonazepam tells you that there's a chlorine group at R2' and a nitro one at R7.


Flunitrazolam combines the most recreational substitutions (triazolo and R7 nitro) with R2' fluorine, which provides the highest potency.


Of course there're also a few more possible changes, such as 3-methylbenzodiazepines (which are metabolites of other benzodiazepines), for example oxazepam, which is a metabolite of diazepam.


![TIBxbl4.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FTIBxbl4.png&hash=281367c3a05a42f72ecff7b816551f8a)


It is also possible to replace the phenyl ring with a pyridine one, as seen in pyrazolam. This seems to be of similar potency as a 2-chlorophenyl group, but causes the substance to be active at different subreceptors.


![cuW4c4f.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FcuW4c4f.png&hash=7524c883ed69dac4f2adea46932055b7)


Another possibility is going from benzodiazepines to thienodiazepines. Here the upper phenyl ring is replaced by thiophene. This also increases the potency a bit. An example is etizolam.


![A6MsHtB.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FA6MsHtB.png&hash=f145e62f865364ec24b3151615794192)


The most potent possible benzodiazepine derivative would therefore be something like Flubrotizolam (Flu = R2' fluorine, bro = R7 bromine, ti = thiophene, zolam = triazolo).


![HZ9nN88.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FHZ9nN88.png&hash=e74a6d0221d377202cc93f545c1214d9)


Does that make any sense to you? If not, PM me with any questions you have instead of going completely offtopic here ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

MMMMM. Never had Clonazolam, just etizolam...but I"m a sucker for potent benzos. Thinking about getting a mailbox in a different state so I can have stuff shipped to me(the bastards want ship cuz one of their products is illegal in my state, etizolam). And honestly ya etizolam is nice but imo, is not up to par in strength of xanax or anything, don't know why so many people regulated it.

Brotizolam (R7 = Br / R2 = Cl... the *Clo* is silent ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) ) is sold as a prescription drug in Europe and is generally considered about as potent as Triazolam, except a bit longer lasting. Not sure if substituting the chlorine with a fluorine would really make it more potent than F-Lam. Has anybody made Phenazolam ("Clobromazolam") yet? Might be interesting to compare that with Flubromazolam if we're looking for structure-activity-relationships.

No, Phenazolam is not around. Flubromazolam is the worst RC benzo in my opinion, not too thrilled about this one.


Some parts of benzodiazepine SAR are yet to be explored, like Diflutriflumetizolam. Who knows...

Anyway, back to Flunitrazolam? ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Is there any reason to believe that this is water soluble like its “parent-drug“ flunitrazepam?

Flunitrazepam had only a very low degree of water solubility. A Triazolo-version should be even less soluble.

The reason people were able to use it as a date-rape drug was mostly because they added it to highly alcoholic drinks.


Are you sure you're not confusing it with Flurazepam, which had good water solubility, but relatively low potency?

I know of Flurazepam -and its quality to be (more or less) freely soluble in water- , but I'm definately talking flunitrazepam here. No mistake in name in this case. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Well, I wasn't really thinking of the “date rape“ issue. 

(IV-)Drug addicts here were/are shooting flunitrazepam all the time. It works pretty well, even a couple of mgs in ~1ml is absolutely fine. 

It's very popular to make combinations of flunitrazepam with heroin and with heroin and cocaine, which is called a “frankfurter“ here.


This is why I asked. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


But sry, enough off topic. Most of this (my post ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) ) belongs more in 'Drug culture', I guess. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

After some digging around on Google I found an article explaining how the solubility of Flunitrazepam is highly pH-dependent/temperature dependent: At low temperatures and neutral pH, Flunitrazepam is indeed effectively insoluble in water. However, at body temperature and highly acidic pHs, the solubility approaches 1 mg/ml... so I suppose if you heat up your "Frankfurter" mix (which would presumably contain an acid to solubilize the heroin) in a spoon, a decent amount of Flunitrazepam goes into solution.


Of course it's also possible that the actual "bits" of Flunitrazepam in the pill are extremely small (the 1mg of Fluni per pill is only a small fraction of its total mass), so it just looks like a solution when it's more of a suspension of microparticles.

Interesting, thanks!

This makes a lot of sense, actually. I would like to know how much flunitrazepam really gets dissolved in a adequatly acidic solution.

This might contribute to the fact that it seems to work that well.

My guess would be, that it's a combination of both these 'processes'.

I'd like to try one or two doses of both clonazolam and flunitrazolam, always wondered how clonazolam would feel, I bet it would be good and it seems it is, but I quit benzodiazepines for good over 2 years ago and I'm definitely not buying it. Perhaps if they were both available in my country... I considered buying some clonazepam recently when I ran out of bupe 3 days early, but I couldn't find a vendor in my country so I passed.


Anyway, I doubt it's 4x times more potent than clonazolam. It certainly is an ultra-potent benzodiazepine, so start very low if you're going to use it, but I would guess they're more like equipotent rather than differing in potency substantially.

I would also think think 0,25 mg Flunitrazolam equals 0,5 - 0,75 mg Clonazolam.


I will probably be waiting the first reports before I try Flunitrazolam myself. But I am gonna order some in the coming days. I never got to try Clonazolam even though Clonazepam is my favorite pharma benzo, so I am not going to miss Flunitrazolam.

I have read a rather strange trip test of Flunitrazolam from Swedish people. 


One person started with 0,125 mg Flunitrazolam. After this he experienced a decrease in anxiety, muscle relaxation and euphoria.. After this he took 0,25 mg more and this resulted in a state where he couldn't speak coherent. This lasted for 6-8 hours and he concludes his post with "My summer is saved". I can't say anything about the validity of this as I don't know anything about the source I found it in. And I should add that I understand Swedish very badly ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Keep in mind that Swedish benzodiazepines are often dosed extremely high. When Clonazolam and Flubromazolam were legal, 1mg pellets were quite common.


So Flunitrazolam may very well be as potent as I thought.

I don't think that comparison is close to the truth, as that would make flunitrazolam 100x more potent than diclazepam, or 1000x more potent than diazepam. Nah, that's unrealistic.

I wasn't really judging by the strength of pills, but we'll find out soon. Flunitrazolam and clonazolam only differ by the halogen atom at C2', somehow I doubt changing chlorine for fluorine could make such a drastic change in potency here, but who knows.


I'm wondering why all triazolobenzodiazepines sold as RC's are analogues of alprazolam and not a single one estazolam analogue, they might be good and unique too just as estazolam is pretty unique and quite different from alprazolam being strongly hypnotic.

He was only talking as to how high that made him feel compared to diclazepam so for potency it can't be used. But we have to keep in mind as well that I am not exactly talking Swedish fluently :D Flunitrazolam and Diclazepam probably isn't easy to compare anyway. But what I noticed the most was that he said it felt euphoric. I hope we will see more reports soon that are a bit more coherent.

There is one (unless you exclude triazolothienodiazepines), metizolam. Without any tolerance I quite enjoyed it at 4mg.

He didn't write diclazepam, he wrote diazepam. Anyways I'm not sure what he meant as he wrote 6-7 r2or (diazepam). R2or would probably mean Roche 2 mg, which means clonazepam as Roche manufactures clonazepam as 2 mg under brand name Iktorivil here in Sweden (and under the name Rivotril in other countries). 


The poster was talking about an experience his friend had and it all seemed a little incoherent. But to sum it all up - he was probably comparing 0,125 mg Flunitrazolam with around 12-14 mg of clonazepam. That would be the most reasonable interpretation of the post. I too doubt it would be that potent.

Ahh that makes sense. I saw he wrote diazepam, but as I interpreted the 2 as 2 mg I thought he meant Diclazepam as so little Diazepam wouldn't make any sense in comparison. I just didn't make the connection to clonazepam from the "r2or (diazepam). I think you are spot on. He is comparing 0,125 mg Flunitrazolam to 12-14 mg clonazepam. But I agree with you, his post seems very incoherent which is why I called it rather strange. 


I look forward to more and better reports.

Flunitrazolam is starting to show up in liquid solutions as well. 1 mg/ml. Either Flunitrazolam is not as potent as we have been theorizing or they are going insane with the strength of the solutions/pellets.

Hehe that's very understandable. Here in Sweden they are frequently referred to as Roche 2or or "Krysstvåor" which is why I was easily able to connect the dots. You did a fine job translating the post on the whole, how come you know Swedish?


There will be a lot of reports coming in on the same source you got that post from as there are now many people on there that has ordered the Flunitrazolam I bet. So check back there in a few days when they have had time to get them and try them out. I can also be of assistance with translating some reports to be posted on here if anyone is interested.

I am from Denmark. So Swedish is somewhat easy to understand. Today in Denmark the 2 mg Clonazepam's are called "Krydser" (Crosses). In the old days "Krydser" referred to Roche's 2 mg Flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) but after Roche stopped selling Flunitrazepam in the Scandinavian countries 2 mg Clonazepam slowly took over the name due to the cross on the tablets

So about the same here then, "kryss" meaning cross as well. What is Flunitrazepam called in Denmark these days? Here we call them "FM1or", "Flunisar" or sometimes "Roppar" (referring to Rohypnol).

I understand swedish very well, my aunt is swedish and my own language is pretty similar to swedish![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) (..i speak norwegian)

Just got curious to read myself ,even though i bet you did understand the most part.


Its a very heavy stuff, btw, i tried a very, very small dose some days ago(1/4 of my friend's dose), i cant remember shit. Those around me told me i was aggressive and yelled a lot until i suddenly fell asleep. Pretty much same as the other fluni'z![:o](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f631.png)

Are they available in Sweden? Who produces them?


Ah, I can see Mylan are selling them in Sweden. I wonder why they aren't available in Denmark at all?

Ah well that makes sense if they are no longer available there. Maybe they have just been taken off the market and no longer used for medical purposes? If I'm not completely mistaken I seem to recall they are not available in the US either.


Yes Mylan are selling them here. I took some last time just the other week actually. Imo I think they are sort of overrated, didn't even do much for my sleep. Good against anxiety but not really better than other benzos on the whole if you ask me. Lots of fakes floating around here too but mine came straight from the pharmacy.

How large was the dose you tried? Do you have a history of getting aggressive on benzos? Funny how different people can be - they make me the most sweetest cuddliest person ever, perfectly content with everything.

A side effect of benzo's is paradoxical effects, where one becomes stimulated, aggressive, paranoid et cetera. So the exact opposite effect how what benzo's it supposed to do happens sometimes.

If its more potent than clonazolam that is terrifying to me as even as little as .5mg  clonazolam can black out intollerant user. Someone is surely to get hurt on one of these ultra potent RC's and then the rest of us will be forced to get our anxiety meds the old fashion way.

Federal analog act changed the game for all schedule I and II RC's in the US. Im waiting for them to close this loop hole in the benzo department as well. Seems a matter of time especially with popularity gaining. I hope I am wrong roi.

A couple of more reviews now arrived on Swedish boards.


One of the posters (who has a high benzo tolerance judging from his other posts) describes flunitrazolam as d*mn. The best benzo he ever had in a long time. He took 2 of them sublingual (so 0.5 mg since he bought from a place with pellets of 0.25 mg) and claims it is somewhere between meclonazepam and flubromazolam potency wise. He thinks this is a wonderful benzo and strongly recommends it to people.


Another poster simply describes it as the best benzo and being equal to flubromazolam.


Keep in mind these are very preliminar reports though and we are yet to hear more about it's duration etc.

I've been reading this thread and not even roi knows about a report? Well, I do - or someone trustworthy who did it.


Stronger but much more of a "fun" benzo compared to clonazolam -- Not too sure if it's stronger than flub-lam. 


Be careful with this stuff as, 1mg is extremely potent. Oh and it doesn't last as long as clonazolam and flub-lam and it kicks in quicker.

I plan to try it someday... maybe not soon though.


Anyway, the subject had a tolerance to benzos - so flunitrazolam could be much more potent than clonazolam than I'm led to believe.

I have seen several people stating that Flunitrazolam is more potent compared to Clonazolam than we originally theorized, so it should not surprise me to be right.


I don't know whether I will try mine right away when they arrive. I would like to have more knowledge about Flunitrazolam and it's potency before I ingest it. I do now wish to be a guinea pig for something this potent.

Someone with a high tolerance for benzos has apparently consumed 50 pellets (25 mg) flunitrazolam in two days. Other than some memory loss and a strange but good sensation he reported no other negative side effects and seemed normally coherent. His friends did not seem to have noticed he was on it.


So, it might not be as potent as Flubromazolam. Still from other peoples reports it does seem powerful so be careful. People with a high tolerance will obviously get less affected, just sharing this experience on here to let you know it doesn't seem to cause complete knockouts or many days worth of memories just gone.

Vendors who have yet to have opened their new stores who were in the UK, well one anyway, was saying he was going to have it as blotter with 100ug on it. Now I've ordered some from sweden as 0.5mg pills. I guess I'll split them in 2... 0.5 makes me uneasy and I have 3 rx scripts. I guess they learned with the norflunitrazepam tablets which were 2mg, I needed 3 of them and they were double scored as in, watch out this stuff's really strong. A single pill of norflunitrazepam had someone I know with no tolerance only say "I slept a bit deeper than normal".


Although at 6mg the stuff was great. When you consider it's more than 1 (CAD) per pill once transformed into that fancy newfangled electronic currency which has people taking a cut from people when they transform your currencies..this one (flunitrazolam) will be more worth it.

So I received my Flunitrazolam tablets. 500ug pr tablet. White with a cross on making it possible to divide the pill in four pieces of 125ug each. It would be almost impossible to see the difference between these pills and a 2 mg Roche Rivotril (Clonazepam sold under the name Rivotril in Denmark). They look exactly the same.


![flunitrazolam.jpg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fs33.postimg.org%2Fjxjuppskv%2Fflunitrazolam.jpg&hash=56d85acd0a34c8beb3d4030511690cb1)


I am starting with one 500ug and see if I can feel anything. If I don't feel anything from this I will split the tablet in 4 parts and add 125ug after a couple of hours and see if that changes things,.

50ug is 0.05 mg - that is not much. The pellets and solutions I see are dosed with 0,5 mg or 1 mg.

^ If flunitrazolam is indeed more potent than clonazolam, then 0.1mg (100ug) may already be an active dose for intolerant people, so starting with 50ug (0.05mg) seems reasonable. All these benzodiazepines are usually first tried out in a small group of people, so there is some information regarding its potency, but I imagine most of those testers are people already more or less tolerant to benzodiazepines. Also, once you're tolerant to benzodiazepines and take them every day, it's not as easy to compare strength of two benzodiazepines.

I think those I'm waiting for (could be a while, last time I ordered from that place over the atlantic was for norflunitrazepam pills 2mg, they were blue and also split with a double score line). Although for me I needed 3 as I have a tolerance to really feel it, I gave one to a friend with no tolerance (the blue norflunitrazolam pills) and told him to take half and he didn't get sleepy, but he felt a buzz he said, he's a heavy weed smoker and already pretty damn mellow, the kind of person who never started getting paranoid or not like weed, I wish I was like that still, no need for benzos, would sleep heavily with absolutely no dreams when I smoked weed everyday for 9 years, although the last 4 years I smoked everyday but less and less, learning that all this dank canadian weed isn't to smoke joints with, its strong enough that only a bowl does the trick, over that and it becomes mindfucking like when eating edibles, but that's another story.


Can't wait to get that, or the 250mg of clonazolam I got at a firesale price on the 24th, but had sent by regular airmail, not knowing they would send from an undisclosed country EU depot and not from the UK (paranoid much, the ban date wasn't set yet). So I deal with my scripts, and save on them with some Etizolam powder I have dissolved and made blotters with for myself, they are LSD sized blotter squares so I tried to put the max amount of material per blotter (2mg). I felt weird buying all white unperfed blotter paper at some artist supply store, the only place I know where blotter paper is sold, it's to put drawings on after all. I'll do the same with the 250mg clonazolam, I won't be stupid like I was 6 months ago and eyeballed doses of flublam from a 100mg bag.Although, I didn't do anything stupid it shot my tolerance way up and I had one 2 week of hell when eating my valium script in 10 days (60x10mg) for 30 days left me in the shit, with only seroquel to sleep, which gives me heartburn, nightmare and waking up all the time to urinate, the 25mg pink ones for sleep.


Anyway, when I get this in about 20 days, I'll give a report, and I probably won't have anything else in my blood other than my Bromazepam 6mg x2 (12mg) in the morning dose when I receive the package. Unfortunately they don't offer any sort of express shipping, even if buying 500 tablets, so i went with 50 to test first, like I did with the norflunitrazolam (was called Fonazepam, not bad at all, like the norflurazepam...I can't wait till the people selling this open there store in continental europe like they were supposed to.

All these benzodiazepines are usually first tried out in a small group of people, so there is some information regarding its potency, but I imagine most of those testers are people already more or less tolerant to benzodiazepines. Also, once you're tolerant to benzodiazepines and take them every day, it's not as easy to compare strength of two benzodiazepines.

After having tried these for a couple fo days there is no doubt they are potent. Not as potent as I thought they would. For me they are not as euphoric as Etizolam for instance.

Etizolam to me goes like this : in powder or blotter form, you put it under your tongue and suckle on it like you would on a suboxone. You will get a major rush of anxiety relief, then you will have a small diazepam 5mg like anxiolysis and then it will die out. I got a bag of etizolam powder, one of clonazolam powder and one of diclazepam powder. Taking 4-5mg of diclazepam is a lot more evenly euphoric and knocks you down into sleep, especially people who don't take benzos often. Same people who don't take benzos often find the same result from powder etizolam. Clonazolam is in between the 2, it's not something that knocks me out, but it makes being awake a lot less of a drag on certain days where I will go fuck it and take 3-4mg. 


All this to say, etizolam used the way I use it is a major bupe ,other opiates and other benzo booster you're on booster. But, if I had to deal with pills, I'd find it pretty lame. I only find it good sublingually for the major rush it provides, with blotters or powder. I'm not sure it would work with the rx pills like Etizest, Etilaam etc.


Too short acting, like Xanax, which also has a major euphoria to it, and no need to suckle on powder or blotters. Although some people bother making Xanax blotters so I guess the major euphoria from subbing it (I find that with Etizolam, the longer i've had benzos, or the more stressed out I am, the more massive that head rush of euphoria will be. Today was a good day, and I subbed 7mg and I got a tiny hint of rush and it faded away. So I'll be keeping the rest of what I've got for now.

 What do you mean with this?


I do not find diclazepam and diazepam euphoric at all. Actually, I hardly feel effects from it unless I take serious dosages. Etizolam however provides me an effect that is close to euphoria and otherwise well-being. Clonazolam I do not know, but Clonazepam I do know. Clonazepam is much more effective for me than diazepam. I get prescribed 0,5 mg each day for anxiety and epilepsi, and that small dose is enough. Clonazepam is a super benzo for me

Etizolam sublingually after using your bupe pill/strip whatever gives me some insane euphoria that lasts between 30 seconds and 2 minutes and then it's like xanax, nothing much except a feeling of wanting more and 1 hour later it's gone entirely. I only used 99% pure powder and **very** good blotters with 1mg per blotter. My bet is I would find brand names ones sold in Italy, Japan, India (Etizest,Etilaam etc.) a waste of time subbing pills that are pretty big (they're much bigger than say pink 1mg clonazepams) which can't sub adequately would be worthless to me. That's why I exchanged my Xanax 1mg prn (got 30 a month) because I don't have panic attacks anymore, only GAD which diazepam and bromazepam (and other muestas from the internet) control just fine for Restoril 30mg gelcaps, because when it comes to evening time, my since-childhood insomnia is a lot more of an annoyance now. Get 30 of 'em and I wouldn't exchange them for 1000 xanax 2mg or etizolam 1mg tablets.

It sounds like both clonazolam and flunitrazolam are extremely strong hypnotics. The fact that a fairly tolerant person can take a low dose to chill out doesn't mean it's otherwise.

Ok, package of 100 0.5 white double scored pills like the person who posted a picture. I definitely feel it, but it's more like clonazolam and less like flubromazolam's (and f-pam when it finally hits and you had a good dose 2 or 3 green 8mg ones, going to bed and finding yourself more benz'd in the morning, no alcoholic like benders from f-pam though, in contrast to f-lam. Clonazolam always felt clean and like it should be allowed to be sold by a company for Rx. i had 2.5mg (t:00 0.5mg, some arguing with my upstairs neighbour I felt really pissed off and I could only feel it vaguely. So I took a 0.25mg doses at T+1:00 and another 0.25 at T:1:45.


I'm glad to haveit but its not as hypnotic as flunitrazepam most likely and surely not flubromazolam.

I recant my first very positive view of this compound. Fonazepam (norflunitrePAM) was much better than this.


This  stuff should not be had over 1mg at once and at very large increments  of time. I felt a whole week while I almost eatin 50 out of my 100 )  (well 103, they were a tiny bit generous), the strongest effect you ask?  Its amnesic properties are crazy. And it's kind of dysphpric even after  a while. Today I got my Valium 10 renewal and tomorrow (idiots told me,  you still have some? Then we renew you the exact date, granted it  wasn't the cool pharmacists at work at my assigned pharmacy (because of  the Suboxone ORT treatment, which I hope I will be off that crap (the  subs), when I get to 2mg (now at 8, been almost 3 years at 12mg, 4-5  months at 10 and now.


But yeah, the audacity of hype is what this  RC benzo should be nicknamed. It takes me forever to type at times,  other times I open a tab because of wanting to check something I had in  mind...and suddenly I don't remember what I was supposed to look for or  enter an URL. Now that I got my Valiums will be fine.


Anybody  else noticed that icky dysphoric effect of flunitrazolam ? I told the  people who invented Fonazepam tp bring it back...never got an answer,  their email account doesn't work anymore. I can imagine because a lot of  people were not happy flunitrazolam. As for now I will only have 0.5mg  with my rx's at the beginning of the day. just one pill for the other 50  and such. Valium 10mg when  I wake up, bromazepam 6mg at around noon,  another bromaz 6 at about 5-6pm and my valium, hydroxyzine plus that  0.5mg. Some of you probably noticed I tend to make  moderately to very  long posts in general...this took me almost 15 minutes to write, its  purely amnesic and not much else, well stress is reduced a little at  0.25 or 0.5mg, as per the simple pill dosage and the way which like the  norflunitrazepam (Fonazepam) pills were, double scored, as a kind of  warning (they do this with really strong methbombs here too), but this  crap everyone including myself) made me laugh, because giving a  Fonazepam 2mg pill to a guy with no tolerance (but who's done benzos,  just very sparsely) say that one whole 2mg pill made him sleep a bit  deeper. I'd never give flunitrazolam to anybody, it's the only benzo  that has had me feel like if I had a lobotomy..I heard of some people  who had a lot of GHB, it can get like that. 

I guess that's all for now


And unless I move somewhere that has Brotizolam, which is expressly banned in the list of banned drugs and some precursors which is essential for some industries. I don't know why, we never even had Brotizolam in this country, I know of 2 countries with it, it seems that it is the holy grail of benz--strike that, it's a thieno like Etizolam, anyway those I know of who has it is Spain and Portugal, so far anyway.

 I know you usually use things in with safety in mind, but you took way too much.


Dysphoria with benzos is typically found at the stage of a dose so high where you become delusional and become angry or disappointed for no reason.

Half of a 0.5mg does absolutely nothing to me, while my rx bromazepam does the trick with a couple 6mg pills.


Thankfully I can get Fonazepam again asap, which I will do, if Canada mail workers don't go on strike monday. I had to take 2 1/2 2mg pills to feel it but at least I feel it.


I know what you're speaking about, when I was on clonazepam (my first long term benzo script), if I went any higher than 2 2mg pills (went up to 8mg once because I was really mad about a grade I got for a final exam I think) it was totally useless and made me restless instead of relaxed. Granted, clonazepam is even more known to cause paradoxical reactions than other benzos, it really reduces activity in the temporal lobes compared to all other benzos except clobazam and nitrazepam, probably why these 3 are used ny neurologists, some countries, especially in scandinavia and germany, austria etc. only use Rivotril (it's the brand name of clonazepam everywhere in the world except the US..I gotta say your brand name ones with the K shaped hole in the middle looks neat, the brand name Valium even better) for epilepsy.

As do I, as well as a few other BZD's (like overly high of lorazepam or alprazolam); I can find myself unable to stay attentive and get irritated when I'm stuck in a boring situation or sitting still, but the anxiolytic-induced energy can also be productive and pleasant in pressured social/job situations. I'm almost positive c-lam would have less a chance of causing me a paradoxical BZD reaction as opposed to it's relative clonazeapm.

I have had a chance to try this compound over the last week. It's very enjoyable at doses of 0.75-1.25mg taken at once. Any more and i pretty much pass out (I have a high benzo tolerance tho). 


It seems to have a noticeable anti-depressant affect similar to etizolam but stronger, and a very very short half life, I'd say 2-4 hours tops. I'd call it the fentanyl of benzos. I highly doubt it will take off and be as widely available as other RC benzos, due to how insanely potent it is, and the one US vendor that trialed it has already discontinued it after only a few weeks. 


This stuff really doesn't have good muscle relaxant or anxylotic properties compared to other benzos but defiantly causes insane compulsive residing unlile any other benzo I've ever taken. I dosed like 0.3mg every 2 hours today and after not dosing for 4 hours I am 100% sober.  The only good effect is no matter how much you dose there is no benzo "hangover" the next day (no grogginess or slurring words ect) 


I have a small amount of 1mg/ml solution left that I'm gonna put in the stash box for now, but I don't think I'll be buying more even if it does become better availible. 


I plan to stick to diazepam for when my neck bothers me, and etiz/alp for when I just need to unwind and relax.


This is just my opinion tho,

0,5mg give me few sedation but quite anxiolytic effect and very bad coordination: I walked as if completely drunk and drop many things. But I was still conscious, feeling still quite sober. I didn't feel any muscle relaxant effect. Then ended anyway sleeping since staying awake become difficult...

I agree with the anti-depressant effect but I still feel it the day after...

It's a very specific benzo, the only closest benzo I can think of is clonazolam (which is a beast) but with less memory loss this time...

Got a second batch from a Scandinavian vendor. The tablets have changed looks, they used to be like their previous Fonazepam (which I prefer, took 6mg (3 2mg pills to hit, but then it was a medium-long acting one, the real flunitrazepam mod (unlike nifoxipam which is a total dud). Anyway, 2 months ago when I got the first batch of flunitraz I could get, like I said, they were bulky double scored white pills, 0.5mg. I'd usually take half of one with my rx bromazepam and be good for all day). Now they have tiny as 1mg pink clonazepam pills, very difficult to have a half, without chewing it. Anyway, those are seemingly much weaker, they did the job while awaiting for my rx to be filled (today), but there's no way I would have had half what I ordered with the older ones.


But overall, flunitrazolam, while good, is not as strong as say flubromazolam which is the absolute strongest benzo I've had...beats legal rx Triazolam which I only had once, when given a dozen 0.25mg pills, I don't know how it would compare to Brotizolam, in those knock-out very small dose benzos. But I'm having 2mg of fluni-traz to get some anxiolytic effects, and still I'm more excited about the delivery guy bringing me my Bromazepam 6's. Maybe in moderate combos like I did back then with the previous pills it will be feeling more useful. I'll be storing away the 20 or so I have left when my rx arrives. But all the hype about how it would be the triazolo flunitrazepam..I wish flunitrazepam was available in this country, seems more effective.

I have Flunitrazolam pellets from a Scandinavian vendor containing 0,5 mg, the pellet is white and double scored. I have not tried the new pills from the vendor.


Overall, I find them disappointing considering all the hype surrounding them. They are not particularly potent and far from the best RC benzo I have tried. If I didn't know the structure of the chemical I wouldn't be able to guess it was related to Flunitrazepam. The effects of Flunitrazolam can in no way be compared to Flunitrazepam in my opinion.

Couldn't find it on the benzo solubility mega thread, however some posters reported very low water solubility, just like most benzo's, in this thread.. [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/791664-Flunitrazolam](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/791664-Flunitrazolam)

I would imagine it's barely water soluble,  not enough to fit a dose in a rig. It's possible you might fit more in by adding citric/any acid and lowering the pH. However this will sting and be terrible for your veins.


Have a look at the structure and compare it to flunitrazepam (i know people inject them but I'm not sure how) and compare also to the closest "lam" benzo. Midazolam perhaps. Flunitrazolam may be able to be protanated and form a water soluble salt like midazolam at lower ph levels.


Again I don't know. Probably best to wait for sekio or ebola or someone to reply.


And of course please consider other routes aside from IV. Especially with pills.

Nearly all benzodiazepines are weak bases and are therefore not soluble in water. 


The only exception in the prescription benzodiazepines is Chlordiazepoxide, which is a strong base. It's the only prescription benzodiazepine that is used as a salt and therefore also the only benzodiazepine that is soluble in water. 


You could try to dissolve it in some acid, but not sure that's the best thing for your  veins. Taking it orally is probably a lot more simple. ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Thanks, and I abandoned the idea. I used the rest of the Dormonoct (Loprazolam) from my dutch friend, since I was already playing with needles, it just came to my thoughts.


Loprazolam is very highly water soluble, it's an imidizalobenzo or whatever the nomenclature like Midazolam.

Got some of this today. Pretty potent, a bit like doing a whole 2mg Xanax bar with a bit more kind of whoozy dizziness. That was from one 0.5mg blotter. Bear in my I have a pretty high tolerance and have eaten quite a few Xanax 2mg bars. They are

potent for sure, quite short lived, maybe 4-5 hours max. Not particularly euphoric.

I find it more euphoric than Flubromazolam. Flubromazolam remains stronger than this, the pre-appearance speculation around it and vendors speaking of 100mg blotter were pretty damn wrong it turns out. But it is more fun than flub-lam, it's like a long duration triazolam. Mixes extremely well with a small dose of a regular PAM benzo, say 20mg of valium or 30mg temazepam. I've had 1mg pills from the same vendor twice, although they were different in looks, were definitely the same thing, although the first one were larger and had a score line, I prefered taking 0.5mg here and there. Those they came up with afterwards were tiny white things.


Then I got some on blotter, no difference, other than the kinda bad taste, it's not as revolting as chewing xanax or ativan, but being able to have it come up rapidly by subbing it for a while then wash it down with my grenada juice does the trick. I'm glad that that source doesn't take almost a month to get over here so I'll likely keep on buying it in blotter form. Thinking of making one order so I don't have to order any more in over 6 months and be done with the always waiting for the mailman, the LP's and cd's and other stuff I buy online, I can almost have a tracking number for.

I like Flunitrazolam and would equate 150ug to 1mg Flunitrazepam. A dose of 500ug is a bit much for me and my personal sweetspot lies at 150ug.


Edit: It dissolved like a charm in some 50/50 water/ethanol.

I guess everyone reacts differently to drugs and these RC's. Clonazolam doesn't seem to do shit for me. Ordered blotters from two different reputable vendors and thought they might have just sent me paper. Flub-lam on the other hand seems much more potent. Even then it's seems to take several beers and 1mg to induce any sleep. Yes, dangerous and I discourage anyone from my degenerate life style. On a side note diclazepam (sp?) seems great for anxiety but not the most hypnotic.

Some quick background: I have a relatively high benzo tolerance and was using flubromazolam for sleep for a while. Suddenly my favorite vendor stopped stocking it. (As an aside, why the fuck are people dead set on snorting or shooting up benzos? Just shove them under your tongue, that's where they have the fastest onset and bioavailability.)


I picked up of this up from a different vendor along flubromazolam from a different vendor. I flunitrazolam to be relatively shit in my experience. The speculation on potency I believe was definitely way overblown. THOUGH AS ALWAYS TITRATE UP. My experience may be different than yours. I find the effects to be almost like a shitty form of xanax and about as potent. Oddly given its "pam" parent compound, I found that it gives almost no hypnotic effects at 800-900ug. I will have to experiment a bit more given that I have a ton left. I plan to push 1.5mg and see how that goes. My go to vendor is now selling it at super low quantity versus larger amounts of other benzos assuming that the potency deal is for real...


As for my experience with other benzos:

-I agree with the above poster, flubromazolam seems to be MUCH more potent. I used 1 mg as a sleep aid for over 6 months with no issues until my doc prescribed me vilazodone which not only gave me horrible insomnia, it shot my benzo tolerance way up. 


-I disagree about clonazolam though. Its quite possibly my favorite recreational benzo. It gives me a body drunkeness with a relatively clear, more outgoing headspace at 2 mg. 1 mg is great for anxiety though the half-life isn't all that long.


-Diclazepam I find to be not all that effective at much. I remember reading that 1mg = about 10mg of diazepam. Plus it has a number of metabolites which are also active. I find that if I take around 5 mg I need something else to help stay asleep or if I manage to stay asleep I feel like shit the next day. Personally I don't find any recreational value or much therapeutic value either.


-Flubromazepam for me is a pretty interesting one. Luckily I stocked up a bit because the supply seems to have run dry. Unfortunately its lack of potency means my supply will run low if I choose to use it much. I seem to get the same effects with 4mg or 8mg. There is almost no sedation of hypnotic effects but excellent anxiety relief. It almost feels as if someone has applied and ice pack to my brain. 


-Etizolam where have you gone? I never quite understood why vendors feel the need to replace something everyone likes with something that's just new. Did the manufacturers really just stop making it? I still see the Indian pharma brand stuff available but the cost is nuts. Plus I have a gram sitting around. I find the effects similar to xanax to with about 1/2 the potency. Was always a good one.


-3-HO-Phenazepam is an interesting one. If it is in fact similar to phenazepam I don't get what panic was all about. 3mg alleviates some anxiety for me but I don't find the effects long lasting or great for staying asleep. I would be interested in trying phenazepam since this is merely a metabolite. I'm not sure how effective it the metabolite is versus the parent compound. Wikipedia states there's less sedation with this one but whoever wrote the entry my guess is that they're not a pharmacologist and its simply anecdotal. 


-Meclonazepam - haven't tried it yet. Doesn't sound interesting. I've already had scripts for clonazepam in the past and don't really want to bother with a less potent derivative.


-Pyrazolam never made it state-side ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) Though I've heard flubromazepam is similar. If so, what a shame. 


-As for benzos I've been prescribed, therapeutically clonazepam was probably the best for a while before its crapped out on me. Alprozolam/Xanax worked well for panic attacks but I was only ever prescribed small doses. I feel like the XR would have been great for my GAD and insomnia but no one's bothered to ask if I wanted to try it. Ativan I thought was garbage and diazepam just seems to kind of "work" in the background weakly as I still feel anxiety when I take it but it is reduced. This seems to be the case regardless of dosage. I really wish my doc would have allowed me to try something like Librium with a longer half-life or a Z-drug for sleep. Instead he gave up and referred me to a neurologist after trying out Doxepin on me. If you're trying to wean off benzos watch out with Doxepin if you're prescribed it. It is a super strong antihistamine and the dosages for sleep are 3-6mg. Its also an antagonist at a ton of serotonin receptors and was really originally meant as a tricyclic antidepressant. For sleep its apparently still patented and costs much more at lower doses (the American healthcare system at work). Your doctor might try to skirt this by prescribing a higher dose. Let's just say 10mg was 14 hours of terrifying REM sleep and then the rest of the consisted of almost instantly falling asleep every time I close my eyes. Also its almost guaranteed to eventually give you Alzheimer's disease.

You've been using inferior Flunitrazolam likely from US sources, because the previous large 1mg pills made for easily cutting them in half, 100 of them lasted me so goddamn long, then that place changed to 0.5mg pills and now 0.6mg pills, and the 0.5mg ones were very very strong, taking more than 2 was ridiculous and people here know my tolerance, also I tend to mix benzos instead of taking massive doses of a single one. A place that lays it on blotter at 0.5mg is very good (and they taste awful, chewed xanax awful, maybe worse, since they're blotters..I know of a couple other stores that have it who ship to here or the US, haven't tried it from them, but I can think of 7 sources for it, and that's as precise as I will be, which are in Europe and sell either International (5 of them and 2 who only ship in Europe). As for the US, US vendors since they are back only do internal commerce so I wouldn't know. Flubromazolam is a stronger hypnotic, but doesn't have that close to triazolam silly euphoria, or that temazepam (a couple of 30m capsules) overall feeling of well being and complete disappearance of any worries, flubromazolam at 1.5mg has me sleep and have very poor balance, it's a great insomnia medication I'd say, while flunitrazolam is a lot more like a long lasting triazolam...minus the euphoria very peculiar to triazolam itself.


The only one in there that's no longer around I'd like to try is 3-ho-phenazepam, there was 2mg tablets from a place where I was getting the original 1mg pretty large flunitrazolam pills with that strange press that really told you, take half and see. I'm getting Brotizolam soon, I'll tell you how that stuff which is rx'd at 0.25mg like Triazolam is...if it's anything like king Triazol, my god, the half-life is longer, although it is a thieno like Etizolam...but apparently that's where it ends. Even the Brand name, which I'm getting, called Lendormin, is a play on words in french that pretty much says "it'll put him to sleep till tomorrow". :D

Got some newly pressed 0.6mg instead of 0.5mg, very tiny white pills, might as well be acid microdots. They work as well as the flunitraz I can have on blotter, which taste horrible, i guess it's like xanax is disgusting to chew, especially a whole 2mg pill. These pills are so tiny I don't have time to taste them even if I chew it first and then take a drink of something, with blotters I sub it for a long time before I decide to swallow them. But they seem perfect, taking half fonazepam 2.5mg and half 0.6mg flunitraz seem to complete each other and it will make this Suboxone-less day (I'm having problems sticking to 8mg a day, and it's all I'm provided for the week, so when I take little quarter extras a few too many times I end up before refill day with nothing). Also I took half a pill this saturday night, all I had left, I thought I wasn't affected by Triazolam as much as I wanted,but I was, I was sure it was monday the next day hah.


But no horror stories to speak of in 3 years of ordering benzos, rc or otherwise. Worst that can happen is I'll fall off my chair and sleep on the ground, and that's very rare and was unique to flubromazolam.

This thing is retardation (the good kind) in powder/pill/blotter form. Shame it's so rare especially in powder form...... I'd suck some dick for 50 eur/g powder (no homo) from the eu.


Took 2 mg last time and for about 2h I had no idea wtf was happening....

Took 3 IQ tests in my life, 2 with the same college psychologist whom I could see for free, so why the hell not get myself an IQ test when I first got in. Tested 130. Second time, I had been involved with marijuana, dxm powder caps i'd make myself with .4g in them, one was enough with weed for me, a dozen LSD trips, a couple lines of pcp snorted. Scored 129.


The year before I tried to do a Masters Degree, I had been on clonazepam 1.5mg a day everyday (to cure myself from HPPD, worked fine, after 6 months, but then I needed my 3x0.5mg a day). Different university, different psychologist, scored 133.


So I guess drugs haven't ruined anything with me, just have some self-created chemical imbalances, well self-created, only time I had a benzo before that time was a guy selling weed who had a bunch of those fat white 2mg clonazepam pills calling 'em "beer pills", makes it so that you can split a 6 pack with your friend. He was right about that, 3 beers and were so wasted, but that was in a wonderful era before 9/11. That small amount of time after me finishing high schoool and my first year of college. That probably affected me more than all drugs I had combined, I was letting the media win and fuck with my head, i would have benefited from a short term benzo script, but I got a short term trazodone 50mg script which I threw in the garbage, nightmares and night sweats in a pill, yeah you will sleep, wont be pleasant and scare you away from controlling what you put in your body...k, small speech over.

**Thanks for the mini-diazepine class, roi!**


Thanks for all that information roi.  I never had even a remote understanding of what was going on in the chemical structure of a benzo-(or thieno)-diazepine.  This post was most elegant and explanatory, and I for one really appreciate your simplification of the chemical structure and the potentially yielded results of the various changes to the structure.  Tight work my friend.


As for this Flunitrazolam, holy shit, especially after roi's explanation, this thing looks outrageously potent, not to mention MAD FUN.  Thank God I've taken the time to perfect volumetric dosing...  I'm gonna have to (very fucking carefully) check it out.


Thanks again!  %)

Roi posted a pretty good benzo sar 101 on page one although I disagree on a few details.


Let's start with classic 1,4 benzos.


Diazepam is a good example of them:


![SZFPiuv.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FSZFPiuv.png&hash=9eca9057f5a5bf542ad9ede8fa116ddc)


The Cl is at R7, the methyl at R1, the oxygen at R2, R3 is a hydrogen here but can be substituted with other things, the second phenyl ring is at R5 and the second carbon on that ring is R2' (third would be R3' and so on).


The most common and interesting substitutions are at R7, R1, R3 and R2' although some rare ones exist too.


R7 is almost always either a halogen (Br or Cl, Fluorine is probably too small and Iodine is too big and not electronegative enough but that is just a guess) or nitro group although you can use others too (pseudohalogens like trifluoromethyl, ethynyl (makes it much more subtype selective in QH-II-66 and so on)). Imo potency goes like this nitro > Br > Cl (see nitrazepam, nimetazepam vs diazepam) and the fun factor like this nitro > Cl > Br (again nimetazepam, nitrazepam, diazepam). Chlorine is a nice balance between hypnotic and anxiolytic effects, nitro groups are the most hypnotic and Br is more anxiolytic than hypnotic (see bromazepam).


R1 usually has a hydrogen or a methyl group, the methylated ones are usually slightly stronger, funner and more hypnotic (nitrazepam vs nimetazepam, temazepam vs oxazepam, lorazepam vs lormetazepam), larger substitutions aren't as common and usually reduce potency and act as pro drugs for the same thing with a hydrogen there. 


The oxygen at R2 is almost standard although there are some with a sulphur or nothing at all. If R1 is hydrogen and R2 oxygen they are a good starting point for making the triazolo versions.


R3 is often hydrogen but another popular substitution is an -OH group. Those lead to more predictable metabolism, lower half lives and usually a slight reduction in potency (diazepam vs temazepam for example) but there are exceptions, 3-oh-flunitrazepam is supposed to be more potent than flunitrazepam (and has a better safety profile according to the patent for it and nifoxipam (why was nifoxipam the one that got made and not n-methyl nifoxipam is a good question)). Meclonazepam puts a methyl group there which reduces potency but makes it an anti parasitic agent. Other subs do exist but as I said they are rare.


R5 is almost always connected to a phenyl ring with some rare exceptions like bromazepam and tetrazepam. Without the ring the potency is very low. 


Putting a Cl at R2' results in a massive increase in potency and doesn't swing the effect either towards more hypnotic or towards more anxiolytic. Hence the large potency of things like lorazepam, lormetazepam, phenazepam and clonazepam. Florine increases potency too but not as well as Cl, it does however give a large increase in hypnotic effects and enjoyment hence making flunitrazepam one of the most sought after benzos. Substituting the Carbon in the ring with a nitrogen also increases potency while tending towards anxiolytic effects.


You can also put a Cl/F at R2' and R6' if legal issues force you to.


Something shared by most classic 1,4 benzos is  a relatively long half-life. The exception being ones with 3-ho groups which have medium to short hls.


Next are the triazolos, for example alprazolam


![150px-Alprazolam_structure.svg.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2F3%2F31%2FAlprazolam_structure.svg%2F150px-Alprazolam_structure.svg.png&hash=bb8faed109d41835331aa71a21dd9515)


The numbers of some positions change due to the way IUPAC names work, R7 is now R8, the methyl sticking out from the triazolo ring is at R1, the second phenyl ring is attached to R6, the substitutions on the second ring retain their numbers.


The basic rules regarding substitutions at the second ring remain the same - R2' Cl gives the highest potency and most balanced effects, F gives almost as high potency and greatly increases hypnotic effects while  replacing the carbon with a nitrogen increases potency and produces mostly aniolytic effects (see pyrazolam)


The same goes for R8.


Triazolobenzos have shorter half lives in general, but removing the R1 methyl increases hl but decreases potency.


Next up midazolam analogs and thiens...

Well, looks like this one disappeared. No more pacman blotters or pills. Norflurazepam is making a comeback which is cool, I liked it, wasn't too strong but was very utilitarian and had like 15 active metabolites including Quazepam, probably why 10mg a day lasted me all day and I didn't need anything to sleep, it just continued to go.


But all the sources I know of, flunitrazolam is gone, as much as flubromazolam. Thankfully there's rx benzos that can be found..and c-lam is as present as ever and its my favourite social benzo, it brings back the old talkative me, I've grown much quieter, I think it's most likely age, because I used to sing and scream while playing guitar in a hardcore/thrashcore punk band in the early 2000's...now my voice is fucked, smoked cigs for 9 years and now I can't imitate my favourite singers in those kind of bands like I used to. 3 years now I've stopped smoking and vaping works fine but it gives me terrible throat secretions.

Ok I know you can't identify a drug based on appearance, but I got some flunitazolam from a trusted souce it's oderless almost tasteless and it's very, very yellow. If you hold it up to a light you can see that it's almost translucent the color changes to almost brown under a UV light. Is this typical of flunitazolam? Im pretty sure it is based on duration and dose is on point. 

Anyone seen straight up powder? Is it as yellow as the pills? I know this is no way to ID a drug but you really can't do any reagent test on benzos either. I heard that you can use DMSO and NaOH + 1 mg of the chemical, to get color reaction but I know of no proof.

The straight up powder I've seen was white/gray for all benzos and kinda-benzos like etizolam. That would mean clonazolam, alprazolam, flubromazolam, cloniprazepam, norflurazepam,etizolam and flunitrazolam were all straight up white. Some kinda held up together in flakes that could easily be broken, etizolam and alprazolam mostly did that.


I'd take an extremely tiny dose (0.05mg) before trying this if you are going to.

Yeah I did and I can feel a super small dose a few grains is active for sure, almost produces a menthol like numbing tinglinling effect lasts for about 6 hours not very amnesiac. Really like it not as heavy as I thought. If it's real I will probably never know, you never seen a yellow benzo? I don't think color has anything to with wether or not it's legit, mxe was white somtimes and others yellow....

Alright, I got 100mg of this stuff. It's yellow powder. I'm that idiot who eyeballs doses. I have an insane tolerance. Anyway, the first 4 times or so it was awesome. Very potent and a good sleep aid. I'm probably on like 5mg right now, I feel like it doesn't work very well anymore. The vendor said that it loses potency fast (is that true?) This stuff doesn't slur my speech, it actually makes me talk my ass off. I gave prob like 1mg to my friend and he said it felt like a better version of Xanax, he also said when he laid down to sleep very strong muscle relaxant properties "closest benzo to an opiate" that's what he said. But my tolerance is perm-fucked from eyeballing c-lam and f-lam.


Don't do what I do.

Organic compounds with nitro groups are often yellow; it could be the Flunitrazolam itself that‘s yellow, but it also wouldn’t be surprising if something synthed in a shady Chinese lab contains enough intensely colored precursors/synthesis byproducts to give it a yellow appearance.


Then again (as you noted), the yellow colour doesn‘t necessarily suggest that the final product even contains a nitro group either; amines are pretty ubiquitous in organic chemistry, and they‘re often made by reducing a nitro group (ex.: nitropropene impurities resulting in yellow street speed).


And that‘s not even mentioning all the other structures that can act as chromophores...

That minty-numbing taste could be a 'thing' in common with nitrobenzodiazepines, although I've only taken nitrazepam and nifoxipam, and a couple of other, less potent but long forgotten nitro-benzos, but I've a script for moggies that, contrary to their tendency for amnesic effects in USERS, appears to have caused one in my fucking doctor, who was asked for a script with a beginning and definite end date by myself, and who then went on and doubled it then not cancelled it, telling me 'take it twice a day' and just left it, or almost left it. Added it to my repeats so I didn't have to come in and ask the dozy get. 


Not that I'm going to drop him in the scheisse, since no harm came to me, but had I not known not to follow the directions it might well have. And whilst I'm on longterm (strong) opioids (three formulations of two of them, morphine and oxy, not counting OTCs, or anything grown from poppies or other plant life, or that came from something born in a beaker that made anybody's vacuum-line output a stench of vomit for the next several oil changes too, although the doc didn't, in fairness know about any but the oxy and morphine, nor about anything that might have, perhaps come from morphine either.  But he DID know I was on two morphine formulations and dosage units and a fair dose, plus quite a bit of IR oxycodone


 (at least enough to seemingly suddenly become capable of by virtue of my mere presence in a shared room for less than the time it takes to speak the words 'good morning doc' to, of pissing them off like a rotting, louse-riddled syphillitic lesion with a severe case of tellurium breath, in all but the case of the prescribing dr originally and one other) Anyone of the others even within a light-year of cunthood seems automatically to despise me for so much as being a patient on the meds in question.


 Bloody politician-shagging pack of mingemongering twofaced spineless little polyps. Handing out with one palm what they make abundantly clear they'd like to slap me for accepting with the other, were it not for the standing orders of those two doctors and a long history of unquestioned repeats with rare changes over years, such as one trying me on fentanyl and my going back the next day and begging for the oxy I was on at the time to be reinstated instead, since I didn't like the fent one bit.


As a result, someone somewhere either forgot outright, or just thought 'lets reduce the number of appointments for refills in this set time period planned by this patient by putting it on indefinite repeat', so I've had my share of nitrazepam, and damn if it doesn't have exactly that minty-to-slightly-anaesthetizing type sensation on the oral mucosa. No yellow color to the tablets but thats saying nowt at 5mg a pill 6-8x a day as and when, rather than the daily 10mg they tell me I should  (still) be taking, despite the need that instituted the rx no longer being there. Still, not going to throw away a resource which would be difficult to re-acquire when it is not even asked of me. Sooner cache them and use them when I really do need them, like to take the edge off when my pain meds run low, and I need a solid smack round the head with a big, benzo-shaped stick to get any rest for the next two days. Writing off whichever DR's amnesia/dotage got that one written down as 'repeat automatically printed to schedule every week' as an error on their part and in my favour enough for it to be a resource that'd be hard-gotten generally and that I'm sure as shit stinks going to mine out deeper than the shade of an albino's cheeks after cutting cheese in an elevator shared with elderly lady nuns who are busy taking a mutual masturbation break. With the aid of a dog, having just been caught doing so. On camera. ;P


Flunitrazolam sounds bordering on dangerous though just from the name of the stuff.  A fluorinated nitro-triazolobenzodiazepine is a pretty bald-faced and blatant shot on the part of some enterprising chemist with some knowledge of SAR to come up with the results pending a train of thought going something pretty damn close to ''now what factors can be put together to make a 1,4-benzodiazepine with a long action, powerfully hypnotic general flavour and be a real fuckoff wall-banger of a tranq, fit either for drug pigs with bank cards or taking down any stray rhinoceros that might just happen to escape from the local zoo, cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war, straight through the cat-flap in the front door of my lab''


''X=fuckedup/2, solve for X'', 1,4-benzodiazepine' in their lab notebook. Or sideways up the nearest wall in reverse gear when driving on the part of the first test studies in humans. Whilst managing to drive a rabbit.  Or perhaps 'at least TAKING this, as opposed to withdrawing from overuse, won't kill anyone very likely, lets let it loose and have it become the 'fent-a-benzo'. The nitrobenzodiazepines are well known for being quality goods, and popular with benzo fans, whilst the triazolo ring tends to mean potency shoots up quicker than a desperate junkie given his body-weight in skag, a bag of needles and water amps, and fluorination tends to give benzos with a long half life, doubtless the fluorination making them somewhat metabolism-resistant. 1x3=one mean ass cunt of a benzo to flog on the grey market that'll have random tranq-heads fornicating in the church pews in zero to jack shit  time flat. Sounds like a fucker for tolerance too which is pretty shitty.


Although IMO I can discount the theory that, despite your friendly neighborhood nitro group making for a good chromophore, be it Ar-NO2 or aliphatic nitro, P2NP being a candidate for an amphetamine impurity to any significant level. It is indeed yellow, a very pretty yellow, especially when crystallized with an artful hand, but ever got that stuff into a scratch? lets just say, that the first person to try smoking any P2NP-contaminated amphetamine/meth/N-ethylamphetamine would be the last if anyone else got word of it from them. Ever been in a room with the stuff when it gets hot, and inhale any vapor? its pretty passable teargas. We aren't talking 'acrolein' downright toxic or chloroacetone-level of 'arrghhh my eyes, my eyes, who kicked red hot sand in my eyes and nose and throat and stepped on my face! where the FUCK are the fresh canisters for my mask????' but a room full of dispersed P2NP vapors will do one pretty well as a substitute for an improvised lachrymatory agent of respectable  capacity for the task of dispersing a crowd, rather than attracting clientele wishing to snort something that comes from it, or smoke it. I'd shudder to imagine what trying to inhale the smoke of some P2NP on tinfoil would be like. NOT something I'd like to try. It LOOKS pretty, it actually manages to smell quite pleasant in sub-lachrymatory concentrations, and its made from the uber-tasty-smelling benzaldehyde (benzaldehyde has a scent like marzipan, and is actually used in small amounts, diluted in edible oil to make artificial almond essence. And it smells fucking lovely, I can't work with benzaldehyde without clocking off thinking 'fuck me, do I ever want something sweet and pastry-based to EAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTT' and hell take anybody stupid and suicidal enough to get between me and sweet snack type junk food after getting up close and personal with some nice fresh benz![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I feel like this stuff's potency has been overstated. I took 0.53mg about 45 minutes ago, and I feel it, but not as much as I expected to. I dare say it's less potent than clonazolam in my experience.


I suppose it's possible my solution is underdosed, but my source has been around for years and is extremely reliable.


I also find it takes a bit longer to kick in for me.

I had no intention of downplaying clonazolam's potency, but I had read people saying flunitrazolam was supposed to be significantly more potent (I believe the highest estimate I saw was 4x). So I was just saying that I don't find it *that* potent. I also find that it takes about an hour to fully come up for me.

Lol Clonazolam is at 50mcg or so; Remember they make. Clonazepam wafers that are a mere 1/8th of a mg, or 125mcg, and Clonazolam is more potent; 1.5-2x would think


Unless 1mg of it is equivalent to 7-8mg Clonazepam or ~200mg valium, then that was a SSERIOUS overestimatetion, on their part, not yours - and clono is a bit more potent than flu nitrazepam, makes more sense that it's trinitro counterpart, Clonazolam is more potent than flunitrazolam

IIRC threshold is 50-100ug, light dose is 100ug -250ug, COMMON is 250-500ug and strong is 500ug to 1mg. Beyond 1mg you're on your own. Onset around the 45min mark means be patient, these little bastards can bite as you slip into amnesiac land and set off into the night.

^ Yes


Again, they make 1/8th mg, or 125mcg clonazepam wafer, and quarter mg tablets (generic 0.25 at least 


Clonazolam is more potent-so it may not give you a buzz, and you would need to be pretty much benzo naive, however it would in theory be "active" at less than 100 micrograms 


If we assume 1.5-2x potency, which seems reasonable, pure Clonazolam is, or has the potential to be straight up dangerous


And doubt flunitrozolam is active at 25mcgs, so leave it at that?

Clonazolam is definitely active at 50 ug.... At 100 ug I was slurring and stumbly already more than alcohol or any benzo has affected me. Clam is extremely potent. Cpam never affected me like clam even at 6 mg

Just goes to show how much individual biochemistry matters. I can function pretty damn well on clam until i start going over 0.5mg, and I don't have a monstrous benzo tolerance or anything.

I would describe clonazolam as more than twice as potent as clonazepam, but less than 4x (which was the number I saw floated around when I was in my preliminary research phase of reading as much about it as possible). Honestly not that far off either though, IMO. 


Do you have a link to the paper that first described clonazolam? i would love to see some actual data about it, such as bonding affinities and what have you.

Binding affinities weren't listed, though it was the most "potent compound tested"


Clonazepam is like methadone a but, it actually becomes more effective/potent with chronic use or multiple doses-that is why it is sometimes described as being double (or 1.5-2x) the potency of alprazolam, even though a single 2mg dose would be roughly equivalent, and if anything, the fast onset of Xanax may make it "feel more potent 


Xanax hits you hard and fast, and so does Clonazolam; that is likely why it could seem 3-4x as potent; however 0.125 mg clonazepam is like 1.25-2.5mg Valium, so unless this stuff is over 100x as potent, double seems fine, for overall, chronic benzodiazepine effects


(Clono is 30-40x and xanax ~20x(range 15-30) as potent as dzp, basing figures on that-1mg C-LAN could arguably be like 7ng ativan![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Clonazepam has a binding affinity of less than 1nm, higher than alprazolam, if that is of interest... maybe can find it?

Wouldn't mind trying this, just a couple of times, since I love nitrobenzodiazepines out of benzos in general with nitrazepam and loprazolam being favourites so far, and  quite enjoyed nifoxipam.


But wouldn't want weight around, unless it were to be shifted to others in single dose units or a few at a time so no one person ended up taking more than a couple of hits, I really wouldn't want gram weights of this stuff about, even though I'm no benzo baghead, I still enjoy moggies given the local docs surgery graciously granted me for some reason an accidental infinite repeat script automatically printed for 5mg nitrazepam, is this put up in pellets or blotters, PG soln. etc?

Depends on where/who or what you order......


i have no sources. But the last time I purchased this I bought in powder form, just before the vendor packed up shop due to it being a too stressful career. 


I appreciate the shorter halflife on this one. Working nights at a pub, then brewing beer commercially part time makes day naps a very handy thing. 


If if it lasted longer I’d miss my shifts ;-)

I ordered 25 x 0.25 flunitrazolam and it arrived the next day.

Living in Holland may be the reason of this .

25 pinky tiny pallets and upon asking the dosage per pallet is constant.

I have a decent tolerance and am looking for a good moment to experiment.


I'll let you know how the results are ,once i tried them!

Ok,then....

I made 3 testruns by taking 2x0.25 pellets and really wondered if i got screwed, for the heavy knock-out effect i was aiming for didn't happen.

After i consulted my vendor, he suggested to calmly up the dosage, for the expected effect should deffo come, since he already assured me the dosage in each pellet was the same.

But better be carefull and harmfree, than having a garden on my belly, if you get what i mean...


I must add that i had been taking diazepam for the last week in the ammounts of 20 to 50mg a day, to "reset" my mind and "lose some days". I do this from time to time for i have been in a rollercoaster ride since i have been diagnosed with bowelcancer with metastasis to my lymphatic nodes.

This combined with all the chemo- and radiation-therapy and surgery, leaves me with "some stress", from which i find some release by using the occasional benzo.


(For which i have to go any other route to obtain them, for after leading a former life of addiction ,from which i turned away, my doctor will not subsribe any benzos...which is f-ed up, for I'd rather spend my money on my lovely kids, of whom i may take care since their mother decided she didn't want to take care of them anymore,(5 years ago already when they were 6 and 7), and she decided to go and live wih my "best friend"....


So i know my way around the personal med healing path, but my mind needs some relaxation now and then...


 So I lately build up a small tolerance quite quickly, for i hadn't been using diazepam for a? dosage of the flunitrazolam to 1mg.


Oh boy.......when my alarmclock went of this morning my knees hurt like hell for i seem to have passed out in crosslegged position. Ouch!

But i can say the down and out state i was looking for was a definate thing!


A nice thing is that there is no buzzed out state you'd expect after taking a benzo, for like when i use diazepam I'd be buzzing in my head half of the following day,  due to its incredibly long half life.


I feel fresh, and would like to add that during my years of I.M. use of Dormicum/midazolam I used to wake up ,having the idea that i missed a whole night of sleep, and thus feeling crappy all day afterwards. 

In this case no such thing!

My head is clear and i am up to the dayly tasks at hand.


So, overall, a 1mg dose seems to do the trick for me and i intend to do some more business with my vendor.

There are only very little vendors of RCs in the Netherlands,  i can say i am very pleased with the one i found and have good contact with.


So, there is some very decent Flunitrazolam available and ordering them didn't hurt my wallet either!

I'm not gonna dicuss that further, so i dont break the forumrules.

You have to look for yourselves when interrested, so you'll have too find out if export to your country is an option.

For we surely wouldn't want to break any rules, of course.


So, i hope you enjoyed my writing, as much as i did enjoy the testing!


One Love!

Flunitazolam is highly potent, 0.1-0.2 mg doses are roughly equivalent to 10 mg diazepam or 0.5 mg clonazepam.

Yep, if it was an accepted med somewhere, it would follow clonazepam/alprazolam dosages 0,25/0,5/1/2mg. It's not that great though. It worked to ween myself off triazolo RC's when I got a gram for very cheap and I'm glad I got rid of that tolerance and can manage with my bromazepam and diazepam scripts, they're generous already, 6mg x 2 bromaz, 10mg x 3 diaz. I got the official GAD and big I Insomnia diagnosis from my shrink though. I think I read it could CAUSE seizures by taking it, but that never materialized for me and I never read it elsewhere so that might have been just some goof doing the -lam fearporn we had going 2-3 years ago.

Maybe, but I'm speaking from my personal impressions. I have Flunitrazolam here since yesterday and It solved quickly in PG (with a lot of shaking tough - it's a workout ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)) So today it was ready to consume which I just did. I guess most of you know about my high benzo-tolerance, so I started with 2 mg I guess half an hour ago and i just feel mild sedation. I took 3 Fullspectrum-CBD-Drops (14 %) and 6 drops of a THC-Oil (7% )so like I said - mild sedation. The drops are always lasting longer to come but I took everything on an empty stomach, so it should not last too long to also feel the combi of THC/CBD.


The light sedation of the Flunitrazolam does not change at all. I give it another half an hour and will do a bit more then.


**NEVER FORGET: I HAVE AN INCREDIBLY HIGH TOLERANCE TO BENZOS AND RC-BENZOS- SO PLEASE DON'T DO THIS IF  YOU ARE NOT EXPERIENCED AT  ALL!**

Hope this helps a bit with the equivalents of RC-Benzos, their duration and so on. There are both prescription and RC-Benzos on this list.

EDIT: sorry, I just saw on this list that Flunitrazolam has nothing we don't know now as well. But I think it's probably good for other substances to look them up.

It does not give you a seizure (normally) when you are taking it but if you take them so long to have a physical dependence already and you stop the drug immediately there happen a lot of seizures!
