**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Fentanyl**
- REGULATED: Yes

- SCHEDULE: Schedule I (temporary)
- CLASSIFICATION: Opioid
 
As of July 17, 2015, Acetylfentanyl is Schedule I temporarily in the United States. This means it is illegal to sell without a DEA license and illegal to buy or possess without a license. See [https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/07/17/2015-17563/schedules-of-controlled-substances-temporary-placement-of-acetyl-fentanyl-into-schedule-i](https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/07/17/2015-17563/schedules-of-controlled-substances-temporary-placement-of-acetyl-fentanyl-into-schedule-i) . It is extremely likely that acetylfentanyl will be permanently scheduled at the end of the temporary period.
