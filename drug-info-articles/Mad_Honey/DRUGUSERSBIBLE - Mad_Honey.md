## Subjective Experience

Some years ago I watched a YouTube documentary titled “Hallucinogen Honey
Hunters - Hunting Mad Honey”. This presented an adventure in the mountains of
Nepal to retrieve honey produced by giant bees, which contains a substance called
grayanotoxin (from rhododendron flowers). This reputedly carries medicinal,
aphrodisiacal and hallucinogenic properties.

The documentary was compelling, and it was clear that this stuff packed a punch, not
least because the translator (Deepak) ate too much, had convulsions, vomited, and
lost consciousness. He had to be carried back down, and looked in a really bad way.
Fortunately he survived, but the warning this presented was clear enough.

Unfortunately, I was unaware of mad honey when I visited Nepal, where I sampled
only the exquisite hash sold in Kathmandu. I therefore had to track some down and
import to the UK a few years later.

This was quite expensive, and largely a shot in the dark regarding its authenticity, but
certainly, the small 115 gram jar looked promising, referring to both the giant bees
and rhododendron on its label:

Having acquired the honey, the tricky question of dose now arises. The vendor, who
does seem to be genuine, and claims to have collected it himself from the same
region the documentary was filmed in, suggests “one to two spoon”. This probably
means teaspoon, as thedrugclassroom.com states that:

```
“For traditional medical reasons, around 1 teaspoon is a fairly common
dose. More than 1 tablespoon is associated with more overt symptoms,
including recreational ones. Yet even 1 tablespoon has the potential to be
dangerous.”
```
This website also contains a significant number of alarming medical case studies, and
also explains that the recreational effect is generally intoxication rather than
hallucination.

For obvious reasons I elect to tread carefully, going for two teaspoons on my first
experiment (1.20pm). The honey is dark and runny as I stir it, but it tastes rather
nice. Note that I've seen reports citing onset time from half an hour to four hours, so
I will not allow impatience to seduce me into double dosing.

An hour in I feel a little heady; perhaps slightly dazed. This could be a bit of a sugar
rush or simply light headedness due to my empty stomach, or it could be a minor
inebriation. It is impossible to call at this stage, but there has certainly been a change
in my disposition.

After two hours, although I remain more or less in the same place, I am now
convinced that this is psychoactive. I am in half a pint to a pint of beer territory,
which is a fair analogy; given that the intoxication has an alcohol type of feel to it. I
experience a sort of head sedation but without a euphoric warmth, and with a relative
clarity of vision when I choose to focus. Broadly speaking I drift into states of not
being quite with it, accompanied by a faintly strange headspace.

I note that my blood pressure and heart rate are both slightly lower than usual. I also
sense some discomfort and potential for palpitations, which is why I performed the
tests. This thought tempers the entire ride.

Over the next few hours I gradually return to what passes for normal, although there
does remain a sort of background presence. In the evening I experience a mild
headache, which could be unconnected, but may not be, particularly given that the
subsequent night’s sleep was somewhat disturbed and I felt a general malaise and
something of a body ache.

I should stress that all these symptoms were indeed mild, but if linked, do suggest
that higher doses could quickly lead to something more serious. Of concern is also
that the concentration of grayanotoxins is known to vary from batch to batch,
meaning that I could well have a particularly strong sample.

I had planned to repeat the exercise with a higher dose some weeks later, but given
this scenario, and that the intoxication wasn’t particularly wonderful in nature, I
have decided to skip this. The idea that I have essentially poisoned myself has
occurred and it is hard to shake off. I could be misrepresenting it somewhat, but it
did have the feel of a deliriant, the edge of illness and a touch of weirdness about it.

Finally, I will end with another quote from thedrugclassroom.com:

```
"Most of the concerning effects involve the cardiovascular system. It very
often results in significantly low heart rate (bradycardia) and low blood
pressure (hypotension.) With the conduction disorders arising from the
toxins, it can lead to 1st to 3rd-degree heart block, asystole, and myocardial
infarction."
```
On
