4-AcO-MET, also known as 4-acetoxy-N-methyl-N-ethyltryptamine or metacetin, is a psychedelic drug of the tryptamine family. It is the acetate ester of 4-HO-MET, and a homologue of 4-AcO-DMT. It is a novel compound with very little history of human use. It is sometimes sold as a research chemical by online retailers.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Due to its similarity to the psilocin prodrug 4-AcO-DMT, which is deacetylated to form psilocin in vivo, it is expected that 4-AcO-MET is also quickly hydrolyzed into 4-HO-MET by serum esterases, but human studies concerning the metabolic fate of this drug are lacking.
The pharmacology of 4-AcO-MET has been studied.

## Chemistry

### Analogues

Analogues of 4-AcO-MET include methylethyltryptamine (MET), 4-HO-MET (metocin), 5-MeO-MET, 4-AcO-DMT (psilacetin), 4-AcO-DET (ethacetin), and 4-AcO-MPT, among others.
