## Subjective Experience

I approached this chemical with a significant degree of apprehension. This largely
stemmed from the fact that it is an analogue of PCP (phencyclidine) which reportedly
causes much higher rates of mania and psychosis than other dissociatives. Media
reports around this have, over the years, created a substantial amount of infamy, and
have contributed to the wide scale popularity of street names such as angel dust,
rocket fuel and sherm.

At time of testing, 3-HO-PCP is one of its lesser known analogues, even though it was
first synthesised back in 1978. I chose it rather than the more popular 3-MEO-PCP
largely because existing field reports subjectively seemed to be less erratic in content
and nature.

Having stated this, I may be somewhat in the margins with this perspective as in
addition to direct warnings regarding dose and risk, Psychonautwiki, for example,
states that:

\`\`\`
"There are also reports that suggest this compound may produce more
physical side effects such as muscle soreness and flu-like symptoms during or
shortly after administration. This suggests it may be uniquely more
dangerous or toxic than related dissociatives, particularly at higher doses."
\`\`\`
Another safety matter is the problem of bladder damage, as documented for
ketamine and a number of other dissociatives. Does this apply here? I can’t find
anything conclusive but this remains in the back of my mind.

\`\`\`
Published papers didn’t offer much comfort regarding the safety of this drug
\`\`\`
In terms of dose, the consensus on the Reddit post I am currently reading is that well
under 5mg is more than sufficient for a first time user. Given the horror stories
dotted around the Internet I intend to heed this advice. I weigh 20mg, halve it with a
card, halve it again and then halve it a third time; in theory leaving around 2mg or
so. I am aware of the obvious lack of precision with this method, which is a further
extenuation for the cautious approach I am taking.

I also note that the doses specified on the usual harm reduction websites are for oral
consumption. However, a significant number of users do insufflate, which these days
is my preferred method, so I elect to take this route. That generically suggested doses
for insufflation are often lower than for oral is yet another justification for going low.

\`\`\`
T+0.00 I snort the powder using my right nostril [11.50am]. I did read on
several forums that this drug has an opiate-like aspect to it. Perhaps this will
alleviate the slight anxiety I am experiencing in starting this experiment.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0.45 Onset is commonly cited as being the best part of two hours, but I do
detect a slight change of headspace in that I feel a little distant. At the same
time there is something of a tingly numbness about my hands (although these
are arguably contradictory terms).
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1.30 I feel warm and I am a little flushed, with now a hint of dissociation in
play: everything seems slightly different in terms of sensory input. This is not
at all as dramatic as encountered on some of my ephenidine trips (for
example), but a similar edge is present. I remain in full control of my faculties.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
T+3.00 This is already an interesting experience. I sense that I am not far
above threshold (which is undoubtedly true), but the dissociation, whilst not
particularly distinct, is solid. I am warm, with the numbness still apparent,
and with a rounded and contented disposition (recalling those opioid
references). There is also some potential for horn, which I don’t usually find
with this class of drug.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
There is a peculiar heady quality to this; not a headache but a presence which
may develop. The trip itself is a little wearing as I discern an air of fatigue, but
it is pleasant by most metrics.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+4.20 I have the impression that the ride is now a little less intense, and that
I am in afterglow territory. There is still some headiness there, I am a little
chilly with the numb edge about my fingers remaining, but I am most
certainly homeward bound. I also note at this point that the time has passed
extremely quickly, and I recall that this is a common manifestation with this
class of drug.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+5.00 In terms of significant action this is now over. The mild afterglow
continues and I am left feeling generally content, with a slightly dreamy
headspace.
\`\`\`
From this point the effects ebbed away quite quickly, leaving a somewhat balmy feel
and perhaps the hint of a headache, which persisted until the next morning. The
night’s sleep wasn’t the worst and regarding the aftermath I felt a degree of reset, as
per other dissociatives (and of course psychedelics).

This was in fact quite a decent experience, tempting a potential return. Indeed, I did
intend to schedule another ride at a higher dose, but now I am not so sure that,
having documented the basics and with the issues previously discussed in mind, I
will follow through.

NOTE:
The following day the beginnings of a cold seemed to be emerging. This eventually
turned out to be COVID-19. I have no idea how this influenced this experiment, if at
all.

**3-Hydroxyphencyclidine** (commonly known as **3-HO-PCP** ) is a novel [dissociative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) substance of the [arylcyclohexylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Arylcyclohexylamine) class that produces potent [dissociative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) , [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) and [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoric) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . In addition to its primary activity as a [NMDA receptor antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor_antagonist) , it has been found to have appreciable affinity for the [μ-opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) .

3-HO-PCP was first synthesized in 1978 to investigate the structure-activity relationship of [phencyclidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phencyclidine) (PCP) derivatives. It was further explored alongside [PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PCP) in the 1980s, where it was discovered to possess [μ-opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid) [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) activity in animal models.

Like other substances of its class, particularly [methoxetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methoxetamine) (MXE), [phencyclidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phencyclidine) (PCP), and [3-MeO-PCE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-MeO-PCE) , it is known to primarily induce a state referred to as " [dissociative anesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives#Subjective_effects) ", albeit the extent to which this occurs has been reported to be highly dose-dependent and variable in its effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] It is unknown whether the studied opioid properties in animal models applies to humans, with some early reports suggesting that it does not.

There are also reports that suggest this compound may produce more physical side effects such as muscle soreness and flu-like symptoms during or shortly after administration. This suggests it may be uniquely more dangerous or toxic than related dissociatives, particularly at higher doses.

Today, 3-HO-PCP is almost exclusively distributed as a gray area [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) by online vendors. Extremely little is known about its pharmacology, metabolism and toxicity in humans. Due to its sensitive dose-response, potential habit-forming properties, as well as unknown toxicity profile, it is strongly recommended that one use proper [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if choosing to use this substance.

## History and culture

3-HO-PCP was first synthesized in 1978 to investigate the structure-activity relationship of [phencyclidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phencyclidine) (PCP) derivatives. It was further explored alongside [PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PCP) in the 1980s, where it was discovered to possess [μ-opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid) [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) activity in animal models.

Its potential as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) for human use was not suggested until 1999 when a chemist using the pseudonym John Q. Beagle reported on its significantly increased potency relative to PCP as well as its "profoundly enhanced affinity for the opiate receptor" which was estimated to give it analgesic activity one order of magnitude lower than [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) .

On October 18, 2012, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs in the United Kingdom released a report about methoxetamine, saying that the "harms of methoxetamine are commensurate with Class B of the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971)", despite the fact that the act does not classify drugs based on harm. The report suggests that all analogs of MXE should also become class B drugs and suggested a catch-all clause covering both existing and unresearched arylcyclohexamines, including 3-HO-PCP.

## Chemistry

3-HO-PCP, or 3-hydroxyphencyclidine, is a synthetic dissociative of the arylcyclohexylamine class. The structure of 3-HO-PCP is comprised of cyclohexane, a six-member saturated ring, bonded to two additional rings at R 1 . One of these rings is a piperidine ring, a nitrogenous six member ring, bonded at its nitrogen group. The other ring is an aromatic phenyl ring, substituted at R 3 with a hydroxy group.

3-HO-PCP is a structural analog of [PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PCP) and a homolog [3-MeO-PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-MeO-PCP) .

## Pharmacology

Like other [arylcyclohexylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Arylcyclohexylamine) [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives) , 3-HO-PCP acts principally as an [NMDA receptor antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor_antagonist) .

The NMDA (N-Methyl-D-Aspartate) receptor, a specific subtype of the [glutamate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Glutamate) receptor, modulates the transmission of electrical signals between neurons in the brain and spinal cord; for the signals to pass, the receptor must be open. Dissociatives inhibit the normal functioning NMDA receptors by binding to and blocking them. This disruption of neural network activity causes network disintegration, some research suggests, by hyperconnectivity throughout the brain. This causes an increase in noise (random, nonsensical and erraneous data) on the cerebral network and thus produces loss of normal cognitive and affective processing, psychomotor functioning, anesthesia. This is often observed in those showing psychosis or induced with high-dose IV THC or Ketamine in healthy participants, please see references.

Unlike many other dissociatives, 3-HO-PCP has also been found to have appreciable affinity as a [μ-opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) in animal models. However, the extent to which this applies to humans remains unknown.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - This extent to which this effect can be produced is unknown but can likely happen in those predisposed to them, especially while in physically taxing conditions such as being dehydrated, fatigued or undernourished. ### Disconnective effects
 
- The disconnective effects of this compound appear to be less prominent compared to dissociatives like [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) or [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) . They seem to not occur at common doses and may only occur at levels that may be accompanied by potentially dangerous side effects.

### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: 3-HO-PCP](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_3HOPCP.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 3-HO-PCP use have not been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 3-HO-PCP has an extremely brief history of human usage.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

While evidence is lacking, early reports suggest that the chronic use of 3-HO-PCP is likely to be moderately addictive with a high potential for adverse side effects such as psychosis. As with the closely related analog [3-MeO-PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-MeO-PCP) , reports suggest that 3-HO-PCP may be more habit-forming than dissociatives such as [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) , [diphenidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diphenidine) , [ephenidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ephenidine) , [DCK](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DCK) , and [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) . When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of 3-HO-PCP is thought to develop with prolonged and repeated use. If true, this would require users to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it likely takes about 4 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 3-HO-PCP likely presents cross-tolerance with all [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) , meaning that after the use of 3-HO-PCP, all [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) will have a reduced effect.

It is recommended that one exercise extreme caution and [harm reduction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) practices when using this substance.

- Users should avoid taking the substance multiple days in a row or becoming dependent/addicted to it as this seems to be the main common factor in the observed incidences of severe adverse effects associated with closely related substances like [3-MeO-PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-MeO-PCP) .
- The recommended dosage range should not be exceeded as high doses are likely to trigger these effects as well.
- Users should start with extremely low doses and work their way up as slowly as possible. [Volumetric liquid dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_liquid_dosing) should preferably be used due to the drug's potency; most standard milligram scales cannot accurately weigh out doses below 10-15mg.
- [Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) before one has fully sobered up is not recommended and can result in too high of a dose being administered, which may result in highly unpredictable side effects.

Due to the potential risk of psychosis, it is not recommended to combine 3-HO-PCP with any other substances, especially [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , or other [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives) . [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) , such as [volumetric dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_dosing) , when using this substance to ensure the administration of the intended dose.

### Urinary tract effects

3-HO-PCP is likely to exhibit similar bladder and urinary tract problems to those found within [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) when used repeatedly and excessively for extended periods of time, but to a lesser extent. This is likely because 3-HO-PCP is far more potent than ketamine, so significantly less of drug needs to be consumed. Symptoms of ketamine-induced cystitis can become extremely serious and can be described as:

- **Urinary frequency** - Urinary frequency is the need to empty the bladder every few minutes.
- **Urinary urgency** - This can be described as a sudden, compelling need to urinate.
- **Urinary pressure** - This is experienced as a constant sensation of fullness in the bladder that is unrelieved by urination.
- **Pelvic and bladder pain** - Pain can develop suddenly and severely, particularly as the bladder fills with urine.
- **Hematuria** - Hematuria is visible blood in the urine.
- **Incontinence** - This is the leakage of urine.

### Dangerous interactions

- **Stimulants** - Both stimulants and dissociatives carry the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and these risks are exacerbated when the two substances are combined.
- **Depressants** - Because both depress the respiratory system, this combination can result in an increased risk of suddenly falling unconscious, vomiting and choking to death from the resulting suffocation. If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.

## Legal status

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-HO-PCP*

3-Hydroxyphencyclidine (3-HO-PCP) is a dissociative of the arylcyclohexylamine class related to phencyclidine (PCP) that has been sold online as a designer drug.

## Pharmacology

3-HO-PCP acts as a high-affinity uncompetitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor via the dizocilpine (MK-801) site (Ki = 30 nM). It has much higher affinity than PCP for this site (Ki = 250 nM, for comparison; 8-fold difference). The drug also has high affinity for the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) (Ki = 39–60 nM) in animal test subjects, the κ-opioid receptor (KOR) (Ki = 140 nM), and the sigma σ1 receptor (Ki = 42 nM; IC50 = 19 nM), whereas it has only low affinity for the δ-opioid receptor (Ki = 2,300 nM). The high affinity of 3-HO-PCP for opioid receptors is unique among arylcyclohexylamines and is in contrast to PCP, which has only very low affinity for the MOR (Ki = 11,000–26,000 nM; 282- to 433-fold difference) and the other opioid receptors (Ki = 4,100 nM for the KOR and 73,000 nM for the DOR).
Although it was hypothesized that 3-HO-PCP might be a metabolite of PCP in humans, there is no evidence that this is the case. 3-HO-PCP is a metabolite of 3-MeO-PCP.

## Chemistry

3-HO-PCP is an arylcyclohexylamine. Close analogues of 3-HO-PCP include PCP, 3-MeO-PCP, 4-MeO-PCP, 3-MeO-PCMo, and somewhat more distantly ketamine, methoxyketamine, 3-MeO-PCE, methoxetamine and dimetamine.

## History

3-HO-PCP was mentioned by a chemist under the pseudonym "John Q. Beagle" in 1999 in a post on The Hive. The psychoactive effects of 3-HO-PCP have been described by Bluelight users even before its availability as a research chemical in 2009.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

On October 18, 2012, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs in the United Kingdom released a report about methoxetamine, saying that the "harms of methoxetamine are commensurate with Class B of the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971)", despite the fact that the act does not classify drugs based on harm. The report went on to suggest that all analogues of MXE should also become class B drugs and suggested a catch-all clause covering both existing and unresearched arylcyclohexamines, including 3-HO-PCP.
3-HO-PCP is banned in Sweden and Switzerland.
