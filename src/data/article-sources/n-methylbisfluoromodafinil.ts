**N-Methyl-4,4'-difluoro-modafinil** (also known as **N-Methylbisfluoromodafinil** , **Dehydroxyfluorafinil** , and **Modafiendz** ) is an obscure [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) of the [benzhydryl](/w/index.php?title=Benzhydryl&action=edit&redlink=1) class with no history of research. Although it is closely related on a structural level to [adrafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Adrafinil) and [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) , neither a pharmacological nor a safety-profile similarity should be assumed.

## Chemistry

N-methyl-4,4-difluoro-modafinil, or 2-{[bis(4-fluorophenyl)methyl]sulfinyl}-N-methylacetamide, is a synthetic molecule of the [benzhydryl](/w/index.php?title=Benzhydryl&action=edit&redlink=1) class. Benzhydryl compounds are comprised of two benzene rings attached to a single carbon molecule. N-methylbisfluoromodafinil contains a fluorine group bound to each benzene ring at R 4 . It is classified as a sulphinyl benzhydryl molecule, as it also contains a sulphinyl group, a sulfur molecule double-bonded to an oxygen molecule, attached to the carbon of the benzhydryl group. From this sulfur group at R 2 , an acetamide group is bound at its free carbon through a carbonyl group to an amine group. This terminal amine group is N-substituted with a methyl chain. N-methylbisfluoromodafinil is structurally similar to other benzhydryl stimulants modafinil and fluorafinil; it is the bis-fluoro-N-methyl analog of modafinil.

N-methylbisfluoromodafinil is the bis-fluoro-N-methyl analogue to [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) ; it contains two fluorine groups bound to each benzene ring at carbon 4 and an OH- (hydroxyl) group bound to the amine of modafinil.

## Pharmacology

This compound has not been subject to any research, besides one paper discussing its chemical properties. Even though a pharmacological similarity with [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) can be assumed, pharmacological similarity to [adrafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Adrafinil) and [CRL-40,941](/w/index.php?title=CRL-40,941&action=edit&redlink=1) seems more likely. This compound should not be assumed safe in any case, until further, though unlikely, research is conducted.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the user's physical energy levels, N-methylbisfluoromodafinil is commonly considered to be stimulating and energetic, but can be considered as much less stimulating when compared to [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) . This stimulation encourages physical movement and activities such as running, playing sports, socializing, and/or exercising. The particular style of stimulation which N-methylbisfluoromodafinil presents can result in jaw clenching, teeth grinding, or other involuntary movements comparable to that of traditional stimulants at high doses, but are manifested much less consistently and intensely when compared to [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** - Dehydration and dry mouth commonly occur due to an increase in motivation to engage in physical activities as well as an increased sense of focus which causes one to forget to drink water. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)** - In terms of physical discomfort, fluorafanil can cause headaches especially if dehydrated, if you have not eaten food or if you have been sitting in an awkward position for an extended period focused intensely on a task. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)** - The above components are also accompanied by a suppression of appetite which is usually much less intense in strength in comparison to the appetite suppression experienced with [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Diarrhea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diarrhea)** - N-methylbisfluoromodafinil has the tendency to increase the frequency of bowel movements in certain individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational N-methylbisfluoromodafinil use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because N-methylbisfluoromodafinil has very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried N-methylbisfluoromodafinil within the community suggests that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this substance at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

The chronic use of N-methylbisfluoromodafinil can be considered as mildly addictive with a low potential for abuse and it does not seem to be capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users due to its lack of euphoria or recreational effects. If addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of N-methylbisfluoromodafinil develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] N-methylbisfluoromodafinil presents cross-tolerance with all [modafanil](/w/index.php?title=Modafanil&action=edit&redlink=1) [analogs](/w/index.php?title=Analog&action=edit&redlink=1) , meaning that after the consumption of N-methylbisfluoromodafinil all modafinil analogs will have a reduced effect. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with N-Methylbisfluoromodafinil should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - N-Methylbisfluoromodafinil may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - The neurotoxic effects of MDMA may be increased when combined with other stimulants.
- **[MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs)** - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , and some [antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressants) .
- **[Cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine)** - This combination may increase strain on the heart.

## Legal status

N-methylbisfluoromodafinil is currently a gray area compound within most (if not all) parts of the world. This means that it is not known to be specifically illegal within any country, but people may still be charged for its possession under certain circumstances such as under analog laws and with intent to sell or consume.

- **United Kingdom** - It is illegal to produce, supply, or import this substance under the Psychoactive Substance Act, which came into effect on May 26th, 2016.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flmodafinil*

Flmodafinil (developmental code names CRL-40,940, NLS-4, JBG01-41), also known as bisfluoromodafinil and lauflumide, is a wakefulness-promoting agent related to modafinil which has been developed for treatment of a variety of different medical conditions. These include chronic fatigue syndrome, idiopathic hypersomnia, narcolepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and Alzheimer's disease. Aside its development as a potential pharmaceutical drug, flmodafinil is sold online and used non-medically as a nootropic (cognitive enhancer).
The drug has been found to act as a selective atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It produces wakefulness-promoting effects in animals. Unlike modafinil, flmodafinil does not induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. Chemically, flmodafinil is an enantiopure derivative of modafinil and is also known as bisfluoromodafinil (it is the (R)-bis(4-fluoro) phenyl ring-substituted derivative of modafinil).
Flmodafinil was developed by NLS Pharma. As of January 2024, it is in preclinical development for treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome. No recent development has been reported for idiopathic hypersomnia and development has been discontinued for narcolepsy, ADHD, and Alzheimer's disease.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Flmodafinil is a selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI). Its affinity (Ki) for the DAT is 4,090 nM. At the serotonin transporter (SERT), its affinity (Ki) was 48,700 nM (12-fold lower than for the DAT), and it had negligible affinity for the sigma σ1 receptor (Ki > 100,000 nM). The drug has been found to block the dopamine transporter (DAT) by 83%, to a greater extent than methylphenidate without unfavorable concomitant adrenergic effects. The drug is an atypical DRI similarly to modafinil.
The affinities for the DAT of flmodafinil's enantiomers and modafinil have also been studied. The affinities (Ki) were 5,480 nM for armodafinil ((R)-modafinil), 2,970 nM for (S)-(+)-flmodafinil (JBG1-048), and 4,830 nM for (R)-(–)-flmodafinil (JBG1-049). Their affinities for the SERT and σ1 receptor have also been reported. Similarly to modafinil, (S)-(+)-flmodafinil and (R)-(–)-flmodafinil increase dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens in animals. They have been found to increase dopamine levels by up to 150 to 200% of baseline at the highest assessed dose. These increases are much smaller than those elicited by amphetamine or cocaine.
In a study comparing the wake-promoting effects of flmodafinil and modafinil, flmodafinil was found to maintain wakefulness over a significantly longer timeframe than modafinil. While the administration of neither compound resulted in sleep rebound, flmodafinil perturbed sleep architecture to a lesser degree than modafinil. This difference was characterised by an attenuated EEG power density within slow frequencies (<4 Hz) following flmodafinil treatment, though both compounds increased power density relative to placebo.
In contrast to modafinil, flmodafinil is not an inducer of the cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 enzymes.

## Chemistry

Flmodafinil is a racemic mixture of (S)-(+)- and (R)-(–)-enantiomers. The (S)-(+) enantiomer has been referred to as JBG1-048 and the (R)-(–) enantiomer has been referred to as JBG1-049.
Analogues of flmodafinil include modafinil, armodafinil ((R)-modafinil), esmodafinil ((S)-modafinil), adrafinil (CRL-40,028; N-hydroxymodafinil), fladrafinil (CRL-40,941; bisfluoroadrafinil), and CE-123, among others.

## History

Flmodafinil was patented in 2013, and preclinical research has been underway since December 2015. It appears to have first been patented in the 1980s.

## Research

The pharmacokinetics of flmodafinil are being studied.
