Vyvanse.com is the web site for info from the maker (Shire).


They tested it for "Drug Likability" and it rated at half of dexadrine.  The maximum dose recomended is 70 mg. which looks like it equals 35 mg. of dexadrine.


Even though the manufacturer rated it a "half as abusable as dexadrine", the US Government gave it a 100% rating as a Schedule II Controlled Substance.


My impression from Shire's press campaign was to get it scheduled as a Sch. III so doctors could give refills, call in scripts, etc.

So what is it converted to? Meaning, since it's the prodrug, what is the chemical that actually produces the effect then? Obviously some form of amphetamine, but what specifically.


Is it the stomach that metabolizes it? I mean are you 100% sure? Because unless it's metabolized by an enzyme in the stomach, you could mimic the stomach's conditions in a jar (PH, heat, etc) to cause the active chemical to be released.


I would bet it's enzymatic though, but someone neesd to provide more info about this.

it is a conditionally bioreversible derivative of amphetamine, so i guess that's what it metabolizes into. i am not sure how it is metabolized in the stomach...obviously if it's stomach acid, it'll be easy to put it in some lemon juice or something and let it sit for awhile...voila! amphetamine...guess the FDA saw through shire's ploy, too

^its dextro-amphetamine thats been fused to l-lysine, so the body has to seperate the two molecules before it becomes active, essensailly its a extended release dextro-amphetamine that connot be easily converted to instant realease (unless as toxicferret stated you could just put it into acidic liquid to realease the amphetamine). 


my feeling as for shires reason for releasing this is to have the next drug to pimp out to doctors when the copywrite on adderall runs out and they loose theyre bigest cash cow.

It wouldn't be a problem converting it into amphetamine if you had some trypsin around.  The easiest way to get trypsin would be from vomit, but I really can't see amphetamine junkies getting into swallowing vomit.

Exactly right.  They lost the adderall patent war and now they need something very quick.  Fuck shire.  Adderall IS "SHIRE" by the way.  That drug is one of the top 10 prescribed drugs in the world.  The XR version is the only thing keeping them above water, so to speak.


Maybe I'm wrong, but that's what it certainly seems like.

**Vyvanse**


Just was prescribed for my ADHD.  Better for people with ADHD then Adderall IMO... 


Anyway,  was wondering if anyone knows if Vyvanse would test positive for Amphetamines/Methamphetamines in a drug test.   Probation meeting in a few days and need to be prepared.  


Thanks in advance.

Vyvanse is a prodrug or conditionally bioreversible derivative of dextroamphetamine according to info I found.  I would imagine that because of this it would cause a positive on a urine screen, although I have little to no info on it's metabolites.  If you have a prescription for it, just take the bottle in with you when you take your drug test.


EDIT: Apparently it is metabolized into dextroamphetamine.  See here:

**what's funny..**


Funny thing happened to me last week. While visiting my doctor who has 40+ years experience, when asked about Vyvanse I said it's the prodrug of d-amphetamine (dextroamphetamine/dexedrine...) right? He says no. It's Adderall. Technically he's partially correct being that there is d-amphetamine in Adderall in various salts (I read 75% d-amphetamine somewhere correct me if I'm wrong) but In the way it was described to me was out right wrong!


Techni-mumbo-jumbo


The key difference between the metabolism of Vyvanse and d-amphetamine  is "..being a prodrug, lisdexamfetamine has different properties than dextroamphetamine; for instance, lisdexamfetamine is metabolised in the gastrointestinal tract, while dextroamphetamine's metabolism is hepatic."

-- wikipedia.org


This gives Vyvanse a much slower release where as dextroamphetamine sulfate is rapidly absorbed. Common controlled release-type stuff used by fast absorbing drugs.. ie. Concerta (Ritalin) Adderall XR (Adderall) etc etc..


Actually, some drugs have to be prodrugs in order to cross the BBB. Example Levodopa (l-dopa). The BBB or Blood-brain barrier in short is a filter used by the brain to keep naughty chemicals and such out and let good drugs I mean things in. Since dopamine cannot cross the BBB, it has to be administered in its prodrug form (see above) l-dopa which is able to cross the BBB it crosses over and is metabolized into dopamine.


**MODS::**

I'm sure this info is somewhere on the board and if it isn't .. ^^^^

If this belongs in another thread or such please feel free to move it.

Having been on methylphenidate and currently, dextroamphetamine, I'd say that Vyvanse could easily be the better potential option. Compared to methylphenidate, I've found that dextroamphetamine, is by all means, a smoother ride, in that its comedown is substantially less unpleasant and it has less side effects such as jitters, insomnia and headaches. However, it will likely take a little adjustment to find what dose of Vyvanse provides the best therapeutic effects, so don't expect it to instantly perform better than Concerta. IMO, once you find the 'ideal' dose, it'll more than likely provide better results.

I was just prescribed this on Wednesday, I am really hoping it helps me focus. I took 1 30mg capsule this morning and it did seem to help quite a bit. I'll be able to give better info on it in about a week.

I'm not to sure I like Vyvanse. Suprisingly it made me really aggitated and gave me really bad cotton mouth, which comes as a shocker considering how many of the 15mg dexedrine spansules I went through (abused, crushed the little balls of joy) when I was younger. Go figure. I actually was talking to my Dr. about getting switched to something else at a lower dose. From what I've read the 30mg vyvanse equals out to about 10mg dexamphetamine once it's through your system... Maybe I am just getting old (i'm 23) and can't handle speedy shit in my system, but honestly I'd rather be unfocused then pissed off, shaky, and lacking saliva. I know I should give it a few more days until my body is used to it, but it's still a bitch.

Vyvanse works great (i take 70mg/day right now), i switched from DextroStats but still take one dextrostat before each class (so 3 dextrostats a day) to help me focus.

I'm still titrating onto vyvanse and adjusting my whole amphetamine regimen

Just got this script today, looked quite promising. Took two 30 mgs, about to take a 50 (2 30s on a full stomach got me on the same level as 30 mgs of adderall, except more calm and organized. It's a reverse isomer of the dextroamphetamine molecule, i'm still experimenting to find adderall equivalency, but for focus purposes it's a god-damn miracle drug to me. 


For example, I've been on coke about a month, having a couple breaks, 9 days without total out of that whole period, but I used it for both recreational and academic purposes.


Also, i get 120 footballs a month (+4 in-month refills) and find the combination absolutely perfect. 


Granted I am diagnosed with the conditions for both scripts, it still puts me in a state of mind I enjoy so much that I'd take it over coke. 3 blissful weeks since my last break, and I gave my girlfriend a half-gram (all of my personal leftover) for free.


Now that, my friends, is a disclaimer for this shite. Still would like to see a more committed bluelighter come up with an equivalency chart.

Personal experience, 50 mgs powder emptied into coca-cola, saw foaming over (sign of chemical reaction), as well as noticable increase in euphoric effects. Is this possibly an accidentally discovered method of releasing the d-amphetamine immediately?

The hydrolysis of a peptide bond between amphetamine and lysine is what liberates the active drug.  I haven't been able to find specifics on the rate of hydrolysis of *this* bond, but literature indicates that the rates of hydrolysis of most other peptide bonds aren't significantly affected by a drop in pH, which would have initially come from the coca-cola (pH ~ 2.5).

What likely happened is that by crushing the pill and dissolving it before consuming it you increased the surface area and eliminated any time of dissolution in stomach acid, effectively speeding up the time it takes the the drug to take effect.  This is likely what caused the increased euphoria.

I can already pretty much declare that the Vyvanse at just a starting dose of 30mgs is much better than Concerta.

Vyvanse needs not crushing, it comes in a powder form contained within a capsule. Antacids enhance amphetamine bioavailability so I always take them with any oral amphetamine. However, would antacids also reduce hydrolysis of Vyvanse into dextroamphetamine? If so, perhaps an antacid could be taken some time after Vyvanse ingestion to allow the lisdexamfetamine dimesylate to fully convert into the active amphetamine? Any suggestions, ideas? Either way, 50 mg Vyvanse feels very much like 30 mg of Adderall but actually smoother, so far at least. This is my first day on it, and 5 hours post ingestion, the effects are very pronounced and euphoric. It is definitely not useless, and certainly could be abused. It does not feel inferior to Adderall at all. I haven't tried pure dextroamphetamine, so I know not how it compares to that.

trying to find a way to defeat the extended release properties of this "prodrug" is driving me crazy!! there has got to be a simple way, but i think no1 cares because the drug is so new. the 1st time i took it it kept me awake for 48 hours, that is NOT good. someone needs to solve this shit so i can take my drug in the morning AND sleep at night.

**evil**


L-Lysine which this evil amp is attached too much be cleaved via metabolization in order for its amp effects to become effective. A remarkable weak action at that. Wiki says 70mg has a "likeability" effect of 40 mg of Dex. (Party time indeed!)


My someone limited experience with this drug has been odd and not fun. I'd imagine its does the trick for someone with a legitimate ailment however...as far as abuse goes, (opening up and pouring, snorting them...I'd advise against it.


the high to begin with is not fun and no bout with it has ended with anything but vomiting. I'd been drinking which may have played a part.


Perhaps personal, but it gives me remarkable heartburn when taking out of the cap (kinda feels like a stomach full of battery acid.) What makes it even more insidious is the fact that that powder is so fine it just begs to be snooted.


I hate this drug.


Love, Peace, and the Bravery of laser guided weapons,

**Amino Acid Cleavage**


Dear You,


New user. Long time peruser.


I will give free hand jobs to anyone who finds out how to cleave an Amino Acid off of dextroamphetamine with a viable return ratio.


This shit is absolute garbage. My friend with a legitimate need for it says it helps quite a bit (certainly more so than rit and even is Adddie XR) 


As far as getting tweaked forget about it; A nice edge, maybe. 


Important side note (I suppose): This is the new drug of choice in terms of ADD and ADHD for patients who A.) Don't want to be on alternatives or B.) Should no longer be on alternatives.


Keepin' it Stupid Phresh,

That guy from Police Academy who makes those funny noises.

the logical thing to do if u want a 'recreational' effect would be to triple the 30mg dose in the early morning. it STILL wont compare to IR stimulants, but it beats the hell out of that XR shite. i've had plenty of time to emperiment with it and have discovered that its great for mixing with other ADD stimulants. it seems to increase the duration AND euphoria of amps & methyphenidate(IR),a little potentiation as well. my current regiment is 60-90mg vyvanse, 35mg concerta(both right when i wake up) and 40-60mg adderall as needed throughout the day. good luck finding a comedown drug, you're on ur own there

**Vyvanse?**


Done a little bit of looking into this, I had no idea what this pill was. Vyvanse is the only pharmaceutical containing lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, a central nervous system stimulator. This is pretty much adderal. While looking around on all these pages, I found very sparse information on the pill and was wondering if anyone knew anything about these that I would not already know without using it myself. Like how much they would recommend or even if it is any good for recreational use. I don't imagine that it wouldn't be, but I can't get any information on any of its other contents.

it's good for recreational use.  haha, that's why the DEA made it schedule II.  It was indistinguishable from pure amphetamine in blind tests of "likeability" by abusers.  I'd recommend it instead of a coke binge, or methamphetamine or adderall xr.  It has about a 7 hour high, so it's useful for an all night rave or party.


The drug is made up of amino acids bound to dexedrine

By putting it in dilute acid, you can hydrolyze the bond to the amino acids and make it into pure dexamphetamine.  There should be a thread on this.  By doing this (and a few more steps) you can prepare a mix for snorting, plugging, or injection.  Very easy, but, the high is just as good orally in my opinion, which, you are correct, is the only way to use the drug without additional steps.

it is simply Dexedrine bound to an amino acid... 


with the amino acid it is not psychoactive, meaning it cant be snorted/injected/plugged... only orally works...


The acid in the stomach cleaves off that little amino acid leaving you with Dexedrine...


you can recreate this by crushing up those pills and adding an acid... Muriatic should work well enough although it probably isn't cesareans to have it in those high of concentrations... as long as the acid isnt breaking down the dexedrine i don't see a problem with just using it without diluting it... 


basically you reflux the drug in a strong acid... 


this can be as simple as mixing the acid and powder in a pyrex dish and leaving it somewhere warm to evaporate or distilling the HCL off if you want to reuse it...


it make take several of these refluxes to completely separate all of the Dexedrine from amino acid...

Taken orally, and not recreationalized, it is like adderall XR. It takes longer to hit, but that is the only difference. I despise it just as much as dexedrine ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

**getting the most out of lis-dex-amphetamine**


im usually not one for stims, but every once in a while i give them a try.  i came across a couple free 50mg vyvanse capsules (lisdexamphetamine)


so, it's lysine covalently bonded to dextroamphetamine.  adderall is a pile of shit imo, i only settle for the D isomer.  so now i have the D isomer but its time release so im wondering...


1. can i do anything to increase its rate of hydrolysis (aka rate of breaking lisdex into dex) in my body)

2. other suggestions?

3. does cimetidine effect stimulants?

cimetidine does not potentiate amphetamine to my knowledge because I dont believe they are metabolized by CYP 450 enzymes. You may want to double check that cimetadine does not inhibit any other enzymes which could prolong an amphatamine high though. 


Your best bet would be to take some antacid tablets to increase the amphetamines bioavailability.

Well, Cimetidine could potentiate Amphetamine, but it has nothing to do with enzyme inhibition.

From what I have heard the only way to abuse Vyvanse is to take too much. pretty lame product by shire, binding a 70 year old drug with an amino acid.


For reference purposes 50mg of vyvanse should be around 20mg dexedrine (dextroamphetamine sulfate)

I'm prescribed 50mgs of "Vyvanse". This is what I usually do to receive more out of it. Take after a fairly small & healthy meal (or just on an empty stomach for it to kick in faster).... take 3-4 "Tums" about 10-20 minutes after ingestion and maybe a couple more a few hours later, since antacids can potentiate amphetamines. Drink plenty of fluids (8-10 glasses of water) and eat a bunch of fruit. If you wish to feel more of the stimulating effects, drink a couple caffeinated beverages through out the day, preferably green-tea or yerba-mate over coffee... There's hardly even a crash/comedown so just drink some herbal tea, like chamomile or kava-kava, or at the most just take a small dose of a benzo/anti-histamine/or any other CNS depressant, maybe a glass of wine or a beer or two. I take 2-4 mgs of clonazepam (although I have a pretty high tolerance).

you can cleave off the amino acid by refluxing in an acid or base... 


or find a way to increase the acid in your stomach... to increase the rate at which your body breaks down the drug naturally... possibly take it with some orange juice or let it sit in a shot of lemon juice for a few hours...

it is dexedrine bonded to lysine, giving it a built in time-release mechanism.

it also means that it is inactive until exposed to stomach acid or reacted with an acid prior to ingestion.

now why the fuck would you think that someone would call someone their little brother?  common now.

and i didnt give him this shit some kid at college did.  im just wonderign why it fucked him up so bad.  i had heard from other reports that it didnt have alot of psychoactivity.

dont fucking judge me, your on a drug board here, and im askin questions in the name of harm reduction.

Really, vyvanse is just a way for Shire to continue having a patent in the ADHD market. Realistically it's just as abusable as adderall.

It's not unabusable. It just has to be converted to something or rather in the stomach...search on this and you'll find it. It can't be snorted because it would not be active without being turned into....whatever it's turned into...in the stomach. This happens through the stomach's acids.

im interested in this.  dexedrine was too up and down to be theraputically useful.. that and i couldnt stop snorting it.  maybe vyvanse is a smoother longer lasting ride?

Thanks klowns for sharing this with us. I've been extremely interested in People's experience with vyvanse. Everybody has been bashing it but no one's really tried it.


To me it seems like good fun if dosed right.

i take yvanse 50 mg's and i find that taking 3 of those gives me a good clean high, and lasts for 10 hours . its a bit more speedy than adderall and i would prefer yvanse over aderall or dex. hands down.. taking too much on a full stomach sometimes makes you throw up constantly for about an hour... so dont do that.

THats interesting because it is just being converted to dextroamphetamine in the stomach. I dont see why it would be more speedy as adderal has a couple of different amp salts in it.

Take trypsin , a digestive enzyme when you take it. Turns it into IR dexedrine!

I was just prescribed 50mg of Vyvanse in place of Adderall XR (I'm not sure why I was changed meds? but I think Shire is really pushing this drug on doctors). Anyways I haven't tried it but there are some potential advantages.  Vyvanse is an altered version of d-amphetamine (the stronger stereochemical compared to l-amphetamine - higher receptor binding affinity, I'm guessing).  Adderall IR and XR are a mixture of both d and l and their salts. 


I've seen posts about the stomach and metabolism, but I'll explain how amphetamine goes through the body.  The stomach really has nothing to do with the drug - except - an acidic pH can break down amphetamine. This means less of the drug is likely to get absorbed into the bloodstream (this is why you see posts that say you should take tums or mix baking soda with water before you take adderall, dexedrine, etc. and avoid juices).  The remaining undestroyed amount is absorbed in the GI track and into the bloodstream. From the bloodstream, amphetamine is broken down in the liver.


Now we need to deal with Vyvanse. The amphetamine NH2 group is protected by the amino acid lysine, so pH will have very little of an effect.  All of the posts about mixing with an acid (or lemon juice) aren't correct. Since the NH2 group is protected, the drug will survive the stomach acid much more efficiently.  Lysine is cleaved off in the small intestines by the enzyme **trypsin** leaving d-amphetamine to be sent through the body.  The d-amphetamine hits the DAT (dopamine transporter) and increases extracellular dopamine (and norepinephrine and serotonin) i.e. the euphoria and stimulant effects. After doing it's job, d-amphetamine is sent to the liver for further metabolism.  Vyvanse is a pro-drug and must be activated via the enzyme trypsin before it is of any use. Since Vyvanse is "protected", the release is controlled, which isn't good if you are expecting a sudden/sharp effect that Adderall IR or dexedrine offers. Also, Vyvanse can't be abused intravenously or by insufflation. However, one major advantage is the fact that it isn't torn apart by stomach acid. A study shows that 50% more of the d-amphetamine from Vyvanse is present, than if plain d-amphetamine is exposed to the stomach prior to absorption.  


My theory and I'm sorry I can't provide quantities or specifics (I haven't tried it and would never promote the process ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)) is to obtain trypsin from a biochemical supply company and make a solution or purchase a solution.  Trypsin can also be bought as a supplement if I'm not mistaken.  If the Vyvanse powder is combined, an enzymatic reaction will occur and you are left with d-amphetamine, trypsin, and other binders/fillers from what is in the pill.  The extras don't really matter and the amphetamine is now "activated".  For example, 25 mg Vyvanse could yield roughly 7 mg of d-amphetamine (equal to 10 mg Dexedrine) This equivalency is not based on personal experimental data and is in the FDA approval guide (link below). However, it should be expected not all of it will be converted.  Optimal pH for trypsin to work is around 8. 


*I just realized that with this procedure you are left with a liquid.  I don't know the specifics on this (melting pt, ect.) I'll look it up in my CRC Handbook and Merck Index, but I'm assuming that you can carefully heat the solution in a watch glass just enough to evaporate the water to form a powder precipitate.  Note: If the temperature exceeds the melting point of amphetamine, you will lose a lot of your product. 


The reason I believe this will work is because trypsin is added to baby food to predigest it.  Another basic experiment shows that when added to milk, trypsin breaks down casein proteins leaving the milk translucent. What is great about this reaction is that it doesn't involve harmful organic chemicals and really isn't a chemical synthesis (just doing what your body does naturally) and any trypsin left in the final product is harmless. 


The FDA isn't stupid. There was a real push from Shire to have Vyvanse to be scheduled as III instead of II (There are some executive memos in the FDA link below).  I'm sure the FDA took into account all possibilities.


[http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/nda/2007/021977s000_ClinPharmR.pdf](http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/nda/2007/021977s000_ClinPharmR.pdf)

[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15034119](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15034119)


(I have a B.S. in Biochem so I'm not just pulling this from my a** either)... I love it. It takes Shire Pharmaceuticals close to a decade to make a "very low abuse" stimulant and we can undo that in 10 minutes.

There were some statements that were not correct to my knowledge. I won't recollect now who said what, but in short words it's like this:


1. Making your Vyvanse acidic before use does NOT affect metabolism in an important manner. An amide isn't this easily cleaved (you need normally strong acids like conc. sulfuric acid and/or reflux conditions (e.g. higher temperatures) for longer periods like some hours). Citric acid won't do anything then adding a nice flavour.


2. It is correct, that the lysine residue is cleaved by trypsin, but this does NOT take place in the bloodstream, nor in the liver. Trypsin is (if you define it exactly) placed in it's active form outside (!) our body, i.e. in our stomach. A substance is therefor still "outside" as far as it hasn't been absorbed into the bloodstream through mouth mucosa, stomach or (most likely) through our intestines. Look here for some basics about trypsin: [http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/static.do?p.../molecule_of_the_month/alphabetical_list.html](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/static.do?p=education_discussion/molecule_of_the_month/alphabetical_list.html)


3. As said in 1., acid does not affect cleavage of the amide bond *itself*. But trypsin, as an enzyme, has an optimum range for working properly and that range includes temperature (nice 38 °C, coz it's slightly warmer inside of us) and **also the pH** (which is around 2 when we have eaten something).


Just to put the last things together: "Lis" is by means of pharmaceutical action THE SAME as "Dex", the differences are in the kinetics (slower, therefore less rush etc.).


Is this all helpful apart from being annoyingly informative? Yep, it is. Trypsin is extremely easy to obtain (find out yourself, where :D ) and can be used in an enzyme-supported organic synth for getting the "real" Dex out of the "fake" Lis. Procedure should be very easy but as this is against the forum rules, I won't post details.


Peace!

Optimal pH of laboratory use and natural trypsin is ~8. **not 2**


Trypsin is produced in the pancreas (in an inactive form). Trypsin is present in *small amounts* in the stomach and is most readily available in it's active form in the small intestines in an alkaline environment (pH ~8 ) to promote maximum enzymatic activity.  It would be common sense that trypsin would be located throughout the body, but the highest concentration is in the small intestines. *The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition  |  Date: 2007 *


I do stand corrected and apologize on this note: I thought from the pancreas, the activated trypsin was sent to the liver.  The pancreas secretes trypsin and an alkaline fluid into the small intestines through a series of exocrine ducts.  However, I'm not sure where this comment is coming from, but very little, if any, metabolism would occur in the bloodstream. 


Anyways, MurphyClox (I'm guessing a Brit because of flavour and coz), if you have any other ideas about hammering out a clean experiment with good yields let me know. I don't plan on using this for myself, but plenty of my friends would love to have this figured out (and me explain it to them haha). It is a brand new drug, but I am actually surprised no one has suggested this procedure.


In response to my own question about the melting point. Here is some data that I just copied and pasted from wikipedia (I hate doing it, but I'm assuming they are correct). This is for amphetamine. 

**Physical data**

Melt. point 280–281 °C (536–538 °F) 

Solubility in water 50–100 mg/mL (16C°) mg/mL (20 °C) 

**Pharmacokinetic data**

Bioavailability Oral 20–25%; nasal 75%; rectal 95–99%; intravenous 100%

I do have to say I just started taking Vyvanse and it is so much better than Adderall.  I'm sure it is fun to get a buzz off of Adderall every once in awhile or use it to study. But when you do have ADD and have to take ridiculous dosages (usually much larger than commonly abused amounts) and have to do this everyday (multiple times a day) it is really hard on your body. For the first 2 weeks of starting Adderall, I felt like a meth addict. I would crash very hard, I had horrible insomnia, and my body reeked of ammonia (and was extremely hard to cover up with deoderant or even cologne). The negative side effects were improved over time, but still exist.  For me, Adderall IR doesn't last more than a couple of hours which requires multiple doses with very pronounced highs and crashes.  I personally thought Adderall XR was a hell of a lot worse than IR (in terms of feeling awful).  From what I've observed with Vyvanse, it is the same adderall feeling and lasts a very long time with more of a constant effect. So, I am really liking Vyvanse.

i have an adderall prescription, and the longer i've been on it the less i like it. i find it's effects to greatly change over time. anyway, my friend had some of these Vyvanse 75mg orangle/blue capsules. okay jesus christ i just popped one the first day and stayed up for two days. it jacked me up beyond belief. i couldn't eat or stop talking. today i popped open the capsule and did bumps, the powder is really fine and the drip is kinda sweet. i like it, but it does last for a god awful long time, and i just had to take a peach xanax to help me come down to sleep. last night i didnt' sleep at all. how do they get it to last so long? i dunno this stuff is crazy to me, i like it, but i can NOT imagine a kid on this shit.

I really like Vyvanse.  It's such a nice, long, clean amphetamine high.  I recently went on a three-day binge with that stuff - not recommended.  ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Hi, I got prescribed to vyvanse last month and have gone up to 70mg/day.  I like it better than adderall or concerta/ritalin, though I do wish there were a short-acting version for those certain days where I don't want to be affected all day, or where I have an exam at 7 or 8pm (I'm a morning person, lately).  My friend's doctor let her try vyvanse and told her he could also give her dexedrine for a short-acting form, so I may ask my doctor about that.

>>this is why you see posts that say you should take tums or mix baking soda with water before you take adderall, dexedrine, etc. and avoid juices>>


To be precise, isn't it the case that even acidic juices make the environment in one's stomach more basic, as they dilute strong stomach acid?


Otherwise, great post, correcting my misinformation.  No offense, but your post itself appears "stimulant-inspired". ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

[here](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=299781&page=3#post5521763) is the specific post I was referring to.


I'm still very interested in using a Trypsin supplement to gain a little more control over the effects of vyvanse through the day -- another question occurred to me: if it's possible to turn the remaining vyvanse in the system into IR d-amph by ingesting Trypsin, would ingesting a smaller amount of Trypsin cause only some of it to be instantly released (i.e, could trypsin be used to increase the effects slightly for a little while?)


Of course, I'd also be interested in the legality of doing this; if otherwise legal, it sounds like a very useful way to control one's ADHD throughout the day.


I'm not too good with chemistry (I don't know how I passed...) so any dumbing down would be greatly appreciated ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

My psychiatrist was talking about prescribing me that for my ADHD-related issues, and from what I gather, it seems to be just as abusable as Adderall.

By the way (and this is totally unrelated to the topic), what's with the abundance of Deus Ex lovers on BL? I mean I see Newmoonrecord and Daedalus705 both with avatars from the game (awesome fucking game by the way, playing through it right now, it kicks some major ass, definitely in my top 10 of all time), and Daedalus is also one of the characters in the game.

bottom line adderallxr patent is up april 2009. shire has a HUGE investment and wants to continue their increasing profits. what better way, come up w/ a new drug=new patent.they have to add a spin on it, vyvanse the one thats not likely to be abused.BS. it can, and is abused. just another marketing tool. their goal is to get all adderall users switched to vyvanse..sales sales sales.

Just to let you know i have struggled with amphetamine addiction in the pass. I made my mind do some crazy shit from abusing adderall and i got no benificial treatment. A year later I don't smoke weed and i take 50mg of vyvanse at 9 or 10am and another one at 4pm. It doesn't get me high in the traditional amp sense. Usually i feel like im king of the world on addies. However, what vyvanse does is it manages all my add symptoms and allows me to do work whenever I want it. It has honestly turned my life around, and i think people who say it sucks simply use it for the wrong purposes. If you use it for what its supposed to do it one of the best stims out there ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Sorry to bump this, just to let everyone know, I tried a Vyvanse 70mg today. I thought 70mgs was alot so I just took one (even though i bought a bunch cheap.) The girl did tell me it'd be pretty strong but I said (in my head)...."hey! two years ago you were taking 160mgs adderall xr and barely feeling it! This won't do anything!"


Wrong


Off one pill, I'm very very geeked, but in that good, "i work 3x as fast as usual and 10x as well" way. Maybe it's just that my tolerance went down, but I do remember, when I did some community service in December, I took a 30 mg Adderall XR (for the first time since tenth grade) and barely felt it.


Very abusable IMO. Didn't even snort it or anything, just took it.

This drug is 100% abusable. I didn't think it was till a kid I hung out with last Friday was talking about how much he liked it. This kid is highly experienced with uppers (adderall, coke, crack and god knows what else) He was acting very fucking weird and wouldn't stop talking and was acting delusional and just rather strange. I asked him what the fuck he was on and he said he took 11 of his 50mg vyvanse pills yesterday and hadn't slept since then. 


I'd like to give this stuff a try in the near future.

Looks like Shire is funding all the research in the psychological literature concerning the effectiveness and efficacy of this drug. Anyone have time to check the methodology?


This research was supported by New River Pharmaceuticals Inc., Radford, Virginia, and Shire Development Inc., Wayne, Pennsylvania. Editorial assistance was provided by NeoHealth, Inc., Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey.


Title: Efficacy and tolerability of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (NRP-104) in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, forced-dose, parallel-group study.	


Author Biederman, Joseph1; Krishnan, Suma2; Zhang, Yuxin3; McGough, James J.4; Findling, Robert L.5	


Affiliation (1)Department of Pediatric Psychopharmacology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, US; (2)New River Pharmaceuticals, Blacksburg, VA, US; (3)Xtiers Consulting, Potomac, MD, US; (4)UCLA, Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, Los Angeles, CA, US; (5)University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, OH, US	


Source Clinical Therapeutics: The International Peer-Reviewed Journal of Drug Therapy. Vol 29(3), Mar 2007, pp. 450-463


Background: Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is a therapeutically inactive amphetamine prodrug. **It was developed with the goal of providing an extended duration of effect that is consistent throughout the day, with a reduced potential for abuse, overdose toxicity, and drug tampering. Following ingestion, the pharmacologically active d-amphetamine molecule is gradually released by rate-limited hydrolysis.** Objectives: The aims of this study were to assess the efficacy and tolerability of LDX in school-aged children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treated in the community, and to characterize the duration of action of LDX compared with placebo. Methods: This Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, forced-dose, parallel-group study was conducted at 40 centers across the United States. Male and female children aged 6 to 12 years with ADHD were randomly assigned to receive LDX 30, 50, or 70 mg with forced-dose titration, or placebo, PO QD for 4 weeks. Efficacy was assessed using the ADHD Rating Scale Version IV (ADHD-RS-IV), the Conners' Parent Rating Scale (CPRS), and the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement scale. Tolerability was assessed throughout the study. Results: Of the 290 randomized patients (201 boys, 89 girls; mean [SD] age, 9 [1.8] years), 230 completed the trial (LDX 30 rag, n = 56; LDX 50 rag, n = 60; LDX 70 rag, n = 60; and placebo, n = 54). **The most common reasons for study discontinuation (n = 60) were lack of efficacy (LDX 30 rag, 1%; LDX 50 rag, 0%; LDX 70 rag, 1%; and placebo, 17%) and adverse events (AEs) (LDX 30 mg, 9%; LDX 50 mg, 5%; LDX 70 rag, 14%; and placebo, 1%).** Significant improvements in ADHD-RS-IV scores were seen with all doses of LDX compared with placebo (all, P < 0.001), and in CPRS scores with all LDX doses versus placebo throughout the day (all, P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Efficacy was observed by the first week of treatment, and improvements were observed throughout the day up to -6 PM. The most frequently reported AEs among patients receiving LDX were typical of amphetamine products: decreased appetite (39% with active treatment vs 4% with placebo), insomnia (19% vs 3%), upper abdominal pain (12% vs 6%), headache (12% vs 10%), irritability (10% vs 0%), vomiting (9% vs 4%), weight decrease (9% vs 1%), and nausea (6% vs 3%); most were mild to moderate and occurred in the first week. **Conclusion: In this population of children with ADHD, treatment once daily with the prodrug LDX at doses of 30 to 70 mg appeared to be effective and had a tolerability profile similar to those of currently marketed extended-release stimulants.**

I just recently got prescribed this to help me with my concentration issues, took one 30 mg cap a couple hours ago, so far it's actually starting to feel like a subtle, clean, euphoric amphetamine high, not at all like the dirty, artficial, robot-like feeling high I've grown to associate with amphetamines, due to all the bad times I've been through with them (the fact that at least half of those times I took it unknowingly because my pills or my coke was cut with it doesn't help, either).

I'm tempted to take 2 more, hopefully it won't make me geeked out and jittery, and just might improve the positive effects that are already there, but I wonder if there's anyway these could be IVed or snorted.

Shire bought River"something" Pharms for like $2.5 billion to attain the rights for vyvanse because their patent for Adderall Xr is expected to run out in 2009 and that their BIG money maker so they are desperate for a new adderall.


I tried it for a week then went to Adderall, it made me nuts, I was having crazy mood swings and would start bawling for no reason. It was nuts my psyc saus to stop immediatly. Shire is throwing BIIIIGGGG throbacks to docs for scripting it. And it takes two hours to kick in. Fuck it it's all big pharm games trying to make $.

**Vyvanse First Few Days**


Hey all,

 Quick question about Vyvanse. How long does it take to get a stable serum level going? Day one was alright. Day two was great. Day three was a little worse. Today has been awful. (all in terms of ADD mgmt)


 I think Im needing to up the dose but trying to see what someone else has felt...


 This is for therapeutic ADD mgmt.


 Im switching off of 36mg Concerta to Dex-based med. I think Im going to go from 1x 30mg to 2x 30mg Vyvanse tomorrow...


THANKS

Since it is a prodrug, 30mg of this Vyvanse stuff (dextroamphetamine/lysine amide, called lisdexamfetamine, for some reason they mangled the 'ph') is an itty bitty dose, only equal to around 10mg of dextroamphetamine sulfate (Dexedrine).  An adult dose of the Vyvanse prodrug would therefore be relatively high--in theory it would take nearly 180mg of Vyvanse to equal a higher-end clinical dose of Dexedrine XR (e.g. my dose of 60mg/day).  As someone who takes the SR version of Dex (the capsules with the cute little time-release beads), I do have a few questions: how long does Vyvanse last?  How long until the onset of effects is apparent?  Does it feel smooth, with a nice gradual onset and a very gradual drop-off?  I mean, I know the half-life of dexamphetamine, but I wonder if the prodrug takes more or less time to kick in than the SR version.


The reason I ask, of course, is that the old-school Dex XR is cheap (insurance companies really only like to approve generics) and this prodrug is $$$, so I just wonder how it actually *feels*.

In terms of feeling, it is VERY smooth. Don't even notice it going in and out. This is only my fourth day though and I still don't fully understand the pharmacology of it.

280mg for me during the slow peak was extremely pleasurable. Usuallly lasted around 12-14 hours. 


Dose early kids.


Even my rxed amount 140mg was a 10-12 hour lasting amount. Not as intense though of course.

I know this thread was originally posted aaaaaages ago, but I joined just so I could reply, and damnit I will reply either way. It seems to have been dragged up recently, anyway.


I actually am currently enjoying the effects of Vyvanse, so this will be fucking ridiculously long. seriously. a novel. More info than anyone probably wanted to know. but ohhwell. it's just fun for me to write about stuff. bear w/ me. =)


I have a 70mg scrip for Vyvanse, recently moved up from 50mg. I don't think I've even once taken it as prescribed, though - it's no fun that way.

I can't personally compare it all that well to other uppers, as I don't have a ton of experience in that department. I've done coke several times, but really no other uppers, downers always tended to be my preference.

My psychiatrist told me that it's impossible to get a buzz off Vyvanse, because the liver can only convert a certain ammount of it to working amphet at once, and that no matter how much is taken, the liver will store it and only release small ammounts at a time. It sounded like utter bullshit to me(it doesn't even make sence), and not surprisingly, it was.


Everyone I've talked to who's tried it recreationally(like 6 people) seems to think it's really craaaazy powerful, even in lower doses; they all have said that it's definitely stronger than Adderall taken orally(which I find odd, because they're practically the same thing). I wish that were the case for me, but unfortunately I have never seemed to experience whatever ridiculously strong effect it has on the general population.

At this point, being a regular abuser of it for some time, I obviously have a pretty high tolerance. However, even when I'd just started taking it, and had essentially *no* phet tolerance at all[then, my only prior experience w/ amphetamines of any kind consisted of taking 30mg adderall(that I didn't even feel. gyp.) 2 years before], I still required comparitively high ammounts to get a decent buzz.

I don't know if this 'natural tolerance' is because I really am extremely ADD, or if it's just some funky unexplained thing w/ my body chemistry. I'm a 120lb girl, and still a kid - so in theory, I shouldn't need that much.

When I had pretty much no tolerance, it took 150mg+ for me to get a nice buzz, and 200-250mg was what I usually took, occasionally 300mg or 350mg if I wanted to tweak the fuck out. It was really fun stuff, but not mind-blowing, or anything. The euphoria/mental high generally lasted 12-14hrs, and the physical body buzz tended to last longer, 14-18hrs.

Now that I have a tolerance, I can hardly even physically feel anything much under 200mg. 140-200mg is still a good mood lift, but it usually doesn't affect my body a whole lot - I even can sleep it off. I've recently been taking 150-200mg for a mood lift, 250-300mg for a buzz, 350-450mg to get really tweaked. Currently, euphoria/mental high usually lasts 8-12hrs, and the body buzz lasts 10-14hrs.

I'm on Vyvanse 3-5 days/week(probably like 1-3 days of that I only take enough for a mental up, though), unless I'm taking a 5-10 day break to get my tolerance down[unfortunately I keep hitting the fucking "ceiling effect", and it's impossible to get a buzz off any ammount if I don't break every few weeks], or unless I'm on some kind of a week long binge trying to avoid coming down(or if I need to be functioning well for more than a couple days). 


Again, I'm going to point out - it does definitely seem to be a crazy intense buzz for everyone that's not me. My boyfriend took 150mg, once, and surprised me by seeming seriously impressed by how strong it was[though I honestly didn't even expect he'd feel 150mg, especially considering he had a bit of a phet tolerance already. He didn't think it would affect him much, either]. He has a fair ammount of experience w/ uppers(he somewhat regularly uses coke, crystal or crank, and speed, and has done adderall a few times before), and declared that Vyvanse was without question the most fucking powerful upper he'd ever tried. He was tweeeeeaked for like 18hrs. haha. so I guess it's good. I personally don't think it's even close to being more intense than coke, but I'm apparently the exception.


aaaaaanyway.

that was a lot of writing yeah.

haha. I don't even know who would bother to read that.


other stuff that might be of interest to someone somewhere:

- caffiene will improve the buzz a bit, but taking them together *always* makes me a little nauseous. If I'm taking only a low dose of Vyvanse I usually take a couple caffiene pills w/ it, though. it's fab. something to try.

- Vyvanse is prodrug, and so can't be snorted or shot up(why anyone would inject it is beyond me anyway), as it needs to be metabolised before taking effect. this is sort of depressing yeah.

- relating to the above. . .there's a "ceiling effect" which makes it worthless to anyone wanting to take it really regularly w/o breaks. I can't complain though - I don't pay for it, and I'm more than happy to stop and spend a week on oxy(which I *do* have to buy at street value. fucking annoying) instead. (I'm hopefully switching to adderall in a couple months anyway. crossingmyfingers.)

- it takes 1-2hrs to kick in.

- withdrawal is mostly mental, not much physical pain or anything. but of course it still fucking sucks. only has lasted 4-6 days in my experience, though, it's liveable at least.

- uhm yeah basically all negative effects any amphetamine has.

- like with any phet, benzos and opiates make coming down a million times better.


yep.

more info than anyone is probably interested.

butuhm.

I got really into typing all that shit up.

haha.

sorry.

it happens.

I suppose it's possible that your scrip might be too high. hm. 50mg doesn't strike me as enough to cause anyone heart issues, but I'm not a doctor, of course, and have no medical expertise whatsoever. I couldn't say w/ any conviction.


Have you ever had any heart problems that you know of?


If you were participating in physical activity(or really anything that would significantly raise heart rate/BP/respiration - watching a scary movie, whatever), it's possible for that to have triggered palpitations and chest tightness/mild pain. An externally induced increase in vitals, on top of however much vyvanse increased them, could push the heart to an uncomfortable rate in certain individuals that are more affected by stimulants than others.


I personally have had one very unpleasant occurence of heart issues while on vyvanse - palpitations and shooting chest pain, then my legs gave out. However, this followed running up and down a flight of stairs a few times in 80-degree weather, while on 400mg. haha, asking for trouble there.


anyway. 

whether or not the palpitations were partially induced by external conditions, they really shouldn't be occuring. if you have any further issues with this, you should probably talk to your doctor about decreasing your scrip, or switching to a different medication.

Can anyone give me more info on Vyvanse. Just started yesterday on 50mg as prescribed but decided to take 2 more = 150mg> After the 2nd one, the buzz went away and I felt extremely tired. How to keep the vyvanse buzz going and avoid the tiredness? What is the max amount someone can take? I'm only 5'4 and 135 lbs.

Oh, I just wanted a load of lysine to take as a supplement lol. Seriously, sometimes it (Vyvanse) lasts too long, and I don't get adequate rest which in turn messes everything up (food and drug metabolism and makes ADHD symptoms worse). I read somewhere on this board to take a Trypsin supplement. How much trypsin is needed?![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

^ Are you taking it therapeutically or are you trying to get high from it? I think I already know the answer, as no one would think 150mg/day is a therapeutic dose.

150mg is actually a HUGE dose, so you must be trying to get high from it. And if you are, its not very good for that; there's way better forms of amphetamine you could be using that aren't time released like this. Even adderall XR is better for abuse than this.

Seen a lot of people here saying they snorted it w/o effect. That's because it needs the stomach acids to be transformed in amphetamine. It's a very efficient anti-abuse mechanism, but you can abuse it orally just as well by simply taking more than the therapeutic dose. So don't waste it trying to snort. It's useless.

When I was first diagnosed with Severe Combination ADHD with GAD on top of it I was put on Vyvannse at first. I absolutely hated it. And first off it wasn't even approved for adult or teen use at the time. I had sever mood swings and would start crying for no reason. It does seam like a more subtle affect than adderall. Its there but it seams more natural. Anyways I told my doc about the mood swings and she made me quit right away and left me a script for Adderall. This is Just Shires way of trying to save face for their rights of Adderall XR running out in 20009. Shire even spent like $2.9 billion  to obtain Riverside Pharmaceuticals who developed Vyvannse to get exclusive rights to Vyvannse. It

Perhaps you should read the [other drugs guidelines and policies](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=374203). This forum exists for harm reduction, not helping people get high. And certainly not for "convincing your doctor you have ADD" to score amphetamines. We have certain rules we must abide by, and there's also a sort of unwritten, unspoken code of conduct around here. You'll pick it up after a while.

This drug says it lasts 12 hours, but I felt it wearing off after 4, after which I would become extremely irritable and grouchy. The "high" feeling wore off after about a week but I could still feel myself coming off it after about 4 hours. I liked it better than adderall because I could always go to sleep at night and I didn't feel as strung out.

so i have a psychotic appointment tomorrow, and im wondering...


since first time i came into his office he proceeded to shove vyvanse into my mouth (the pamphlets, not the pills. they say the pamphlets are secretly coated with amphetamine transdermal coating..and...) but when i saw that LIS i mistook it for like a l, as in a levo, and thought...this is like l-amp, so i declined and we agreed on trusty dextrostat. so now im thinking...dextrostat is addictive, let's not joke. maybe i can switch to vyvanse and like....all my addiction shall be over?


that is to say i am addicted to amp, but when 2 days pass without me taking it, i suddenly become happy pappy without them.....this stuff...well..anything XR, seems promising. xanax XR changed my life....effexor became XR and i became XTRA   generic in my personality at once....ambien went XR..but well, that one we divide up and use the IR portion (we being the collective we, as in we but not I necessarily)...everything will be XR in the future. 


Personality XR. 


so should i go from 40ish QD dex tolerance to 80mg vyvanse (amFETAmine)/? my insurance has some sort of personal thing going on with Shire....the CEOs must be fucking each other satisfactorily and with much pleasure since the preferred drug list covers ALL shire meds, but it doesn't cover generic librium.....


go figure, as Linda would say. 


so advise? forum? quorum?

I am BP2 and first tried Ritalin to calm me down. Hated it from the start -- very speedy and super-bad crashes. Switched to Vyvanse, started at 30 and got a nice mellow feeling for most of the day. Came down with benzos and slept well. Went to 60 as tolerance built up after a week, then 90. Take 2 after getting up and another an hour or two later. Lasts 12 hours.


You will stop getting a pleasant buzz from Vyvanse after about a week of steady usage. You need to stop or drastically cut back for a few days. Then when you restart, the nice buzz comes back.


I find this drug calms me down and lets me focus on productive work, as well as be more communicative with people -- just as a good amphetamine should. The all-day consistency is far more appealing to me than a short-term high. Being able to get to sleep is also great. 


Watch it if you're an athlete tho -- I'm a cyclist and on a couple of 30s I will push myself all day at very high heart rate unless I consciously make the effort to slow down and take rests. Even after a tough all-day ride I have a nice come-down and good sleep, and can physically recover from the exertion in one day.


The golden rule is a few days on and a few days off. 60 should give you a nice steady dosage.

I take 50mgs a day Vyvanse along with antidepressants and Duragesic 100patches and Xanax .50 (all as directed). It's seems I have fibromyalgia with a BIG side order of Depression, some anxiety and now have JUST been diagnosed with "ADD". I want to be my old self again so I will take whatever they say. I see a psychologist not sure why and I see a psychiatrist for meds. 


So I'm super depressed (I want to live and be my old self again that makes me bitter that I can no longer do that) with anxiety in bed most of the time from the fibro and apparently NOW have trouble paying attention (to what I am not sure I had to quit my job because of all of this (minus the "ADD"). A job I loved and went to college for) I guess so I can have a better understanding of world events as I watch CNN or Fox News.  It's bizarre but I am drained from trying to always be pro-active.


ANYWAY, My point here WAS that Vyvanse if nothing else is a helleva weight loss program. I TOTALLY forget to eat. Just wild. So much for FOCUSING and staying on topic. 


I am new here. I just signed up.  I appreciate all your input on all these different subjects on Bluelight. If I went too much off topic I'm sorry.  With the VYVANSE I guess I am focusing better. I focus on the scale more than I used to ;-) I am waiting for the day to see if it helps me in the office. But that's for an entirely different thread. 


Thanks for being so great to the new ones. That is what gave me the courage to sign up. I am not on these sites often. But I feel like I would be welcome here. 


Thanks for reading.

RockNRoll: If you're like me you won't respond to the usual antidepressants. Anti-seizure drugs (Lamictal and Gabapentin) really helped with my depression -- you might want to talk to your shrink about them even if like me u r not prone to seizures.


I'm levelling off to 30 - 60 mg/day Vyvanse in the a.m. and yes it's an incredible appetite suppressant. Also for me a great antidepressant.  I use Temazepam to get to sleep.


Being home alone and not working is super depressing all by itself, and no drug can cure that. Like everybody else you need to be around people, either working or studying or even volunteering, etc. Even if it's physically uncomfortable try to get out of the house during the day. Good luck.

my doc said he will prescribe me this or XR adderall. it sounds like the group vote is that this has less negative side effects than addy.  is that what im getting? 


if youve been on both please tell me which one youd rather have, and why.

This kid is highly experienced with uppers (adderall, coke, crack and god knows what else) He was acting very fucking weird and wouldn't stop talking and was acting delusional and just rather strange. I asked him what the fuck he was on and he said he took 11 of his 50mg vyvanse pills yesterday and hadn't slept since then.

I don't have ADD or ADHD but I seemed to have gained many of the symptoms of ADHD such as hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity due to my outrageous drug use.  I am also a recovering heroin/oxycodone addict which I think contribute to these symptoms as well.  I got prescribed 30mgs but decided to take two for the first day.  I'll let you know all know what I think.


The capsules are already powder.. does crushing it do anything?


EDIT: after reading the posts, I guess that because it is already in powder form and crushing it up further doesn't do anything.  I was trying to figure out how to make it IR but after 30 minutes of consuming 2, 30mg capsules (i did decide to try and crush them up further) I have a nice buzz and am focused.

It's been a little while since I dosed my 60mg of Vyvanse.  It does seem a bit smoother than Adderall.  I am concentrated, positive, and talkative.  I don't see what people don't like about this drug.  I am a big fan of Adderall but this Vyvanse isn't as bad as some people made it out to be.  I'm still on the fence as to whether I prefer Vyvanse or Adderall but I don't seem to have a problem with either of them.

The concept of drug abuse, the subculture of prescription drug abuse going back to the beginnings of the prescription drug system itself, the laws and regulations surrounding patent lifespan and brand rights, etc lead to a political chessgame between the legislature, law enforcement, chemists, doctors, drug users, drug addicts and PR/marketing depts of Big Pharma companies.

I would definitely go see a doctor or psychiatrist if you think you have ADD/ADHD.  You can go online and just search google for ADD symptoms and see what your results are.


BTW - I'm on day two with my Vyvanse prescription.  I love it.  It is definitely beneficial and still produces euphoria as Adderall does.  The two are very similiar and I don't have a problem with Vyvanse like some other people have written about in this thread.  Vyvanse has my vote.


EDIT: Someone mentioned cotton mouth as a side effect of Vyvanse and I definitely notice the dry mouth.  I have been constantly drinking water.  It can get a bit irritating dealing with a constant dry mouth but if I just drink some liquid it helps.

I've found it hard to sleep the last two nights since I got my prescription of Vyvanse.  The first day I took a dose of 60mg of Vyvanse at 4PM, right after I left my psychiatrists office and got the script filled.  Later that night I went to a party and consumed alcohol which consisted of about 4-5 Hurricane cans (malt liquor), 5 Natty Lites (beer) and a 1mg Klonopin (benzo) and I still wasn't able to fall asleep until about 4AM the following morning.


The following day I woke up around 10AM-12AM.  I got some unhealthy sleep and just tossed and turned on my friends love couch the previous night.  I took another 60mg when I got home at around 12ish and I wasn't able to fall asleep until around 2AM-3AM.  I had to take 2mg of Klonopin to get me to sleep.


Today, I took 60mg of Vyvanse at 10:30AM.  The effects don't feel as strong but I assume that is due to my lack of sleep these past few nights.  I am still euphoric, motivated, and energetic but just not as much as the first two days.  I think the 2mg of Klonopin lurking in my system is contributing to that as well.


Just thought I'd throw all this info out there for anyone who cares.


EDIT: I have one more thing to add about my past Adderall experiences.  When I would take Adderall, it was a common occurance for my upper right shoulder blade to gradually start to hurt as the day went on.  I don't get this with Vyvanse.

Vyvanse is the only drug ive seen DOCTORS write for their own children (whether it actually gets in their little hands is another story, lol)..... Based on my past experiences with ADD treatment and reading over some of the studies, Vyvanse is better for first-line treatment before moving up to Adderall XR, Adderall IR, etc.


All it did for me was piss me off and waste my time, but im a 3-year vet. of the Addy IR 30mg Twice Daily.....


Here some good links to check out, for some legit info on Vyvanse:

**vyvanse**


i take vyvanse periodically and i do n ot have a prescription to it. my friends also use it as well. we feel that it increases our focus and productivity and we often use it solely for studying and writing term papers (college).   it makes us feelll... happy? 


I must question some of the contents of the drug if it is making us happier, then when it wears off u can notice that u feel "worse" for no apparant reason.

I'm not sure if this belongs here, but can anyone give me some info as to why when I take vyvanse I do not become excessively talkative but I do when I take adderall? I know people respond differently but aren't vyvanse and adderall both dextroamphetamines, so shouldn't I get the same effects from both of them? Usually 40 mgs of adderall does it for me, but I take 160 mgs of vyvanse.

well...i was just playing around today, and decided to do a little experiment...

i wanted to know if i could extract the D-amp from my Vyvanse using just Isopropyl Alcohol, and what do you know? it freakin' worked!!! im sooo excited. mind you, the first wash (with more Iso. Alc.) was not enough, so there will be further washes preformed, but the yeild was quite nice, and the high (smoked only) was also nice, but a bit weak. 


any questions, PM me or whatever.

**Long user report: Six months of vyvanse**


(Long but worth reading or you're starting or contemplating Vyvanse.)


Because 99% of this board's members are non-judgmental and care for each other’s well being, I want take the time to submit a long-term user’s contribution about 

Vyvanse. My purpose is to compare the way Vivanse has worked out for us after several months of regular use. (I have not take Adderall so cannot compare.)


Having taken V. every day since last September (6 months), I can tell you my reactions.


I am a middle-aged guy with genuine PB2. I am good at my job but have  trouble dealing with co-workers, especially people who "manage" me.  I don’t get physical but can be verbally aggressive, and also, in different scenarios, am prone to serious depression.


For several years I've worked with a pscyh my age. We have a mutually trusting relationship and are experimenting with different med combos to level out my mood. Because of my depressions he considers me a serious case and will prescribe pretty much what I want. (I am straight with him about how the meds are affecting me, and he's cool with my getting high once in a while as a side effect.)


Oh yeah, one more thing, when I was young I did EVERY drug, legal or not, mostly for the experience. I've done hard stuff but never got strung out. I do have an addictive personality though -- alcohol brings it out -- so I can't use it. But though I no longer desire to get zonked on meds, I don't mind a pleasant buzz now and then. So I know where pretty much everybody’s head is at here. We enjoy recreation but don’t want to hurt anyone.


In case this is of help to anybody, here are my findings after 6 months . . . 


- I was laid off my job and getting pretty anxious so my doc first tried me on the usual downers. I hate being dopy during the day so he put my on a regimen of an upper in the morning (Ritalin-SR 2OMG 2/day) ) and downers at night: Xanax 5MG (generic is Alprazolam).  


- I've done uppers before and know they affect people differently. For me, Ritalin sucks. It makes me jumpy and irritable and the crash is awful. How anybody could give this to a kid is beyond my comprehension. Xanax, on the other hand, is top-notch benzo -- but it's still a benzo so have problems of their own. As in, you build up tolerance and you get super-hooked on them.


- Because I hated Ritalin my doc switched me to Vyvanse, first 30MG/day taken upon awakening. When this did not suffice (you start to come down after about 5 hours), I went to 60MG/day and disovered V's magic method of keeping you in a beautiful productive mellow groove all day long: DELAY THE SECOND 30MG TAB TWO HOURS AFTER TAKING THE FIRST ONE! 


- Six months of usage have convinced me that V is a moderately addictive drug. It is a great antidpressant. Plus, it totally kills your appetite and you can lose all the weight you want to. The nightly come-down is surprisingly gentle but it gets worse as tolerance builds (see below).


- Due to  emerging Vyvanse tolerance my doc let me have three 30MG/day but I saved the third one for fast, 100-mile bicycle rides. (Don't worry, I have a heart rate monitor.) I'd taken up to five 30MG Vs in one day with no problem.


- My doc upped my benzos to three 30MG Temazepam three times a day, PLUS two or three Zanax 5MG for calm me down before bedtime. Life was good.


- After three months on a steady-state of the above usage, I developed a Vyvanse tolerance to the point where it was of very little benefit anymore. (This is pretty impressive length for time for an upper to bring on a tolerance.) 


Tolerance symptoms: I started sleeping in till 8:00. Upon awaking, I'd feel exhausted and groggy. (Through I almost always slept well on the Temazepam.) I'd pop at V as soon as I woke up, then drink some strong coffee. In a half-hour I'd be on top of the world -- but only for a little while. By 10:00 a.m. I'd feel "crashier" than ever before. I had to eat breakfast or I'd feel like my stomach was eating me from the inside out. Even after the second V, a couple of hours later, I was ravenously hungry. (I used to go all day without eating on two Vs and never feel hungry.)


- I could still work pretty hard and steady but my mood was robotic; there were no more good vibes. I was not nasty or negative-manic in any other way, but I was not happy, either.


- Generously, my doc allowed me to replace V for one month with Desoxyn 5MG x 5/day. (No, I'm not going to give you his name.) The idea was to break the tolerance by taking a D only when I felt I really needed to. Being short acting, it wouldn't be in my system all day.


- Of course I ended up alternating the Desoxyn with leftover Vyvanse when I was really down. The combo didn't work very well – that’s how burned out I was. I was awake, busy, and stable, but not feeling good. Eventually, after a couple of weeks, I started feeling exhausted all the time. sometimes I’d sleep 24 hours straight.


- Thus was born my Vyvanse/Benzo habit. So with about 10 days till next seeing my doc, I have through it through and come up with a mission statement: Reduce the uppers and downers to a reasonable level over time. (For me a good balance would be two Vyvanse 30MG every two or three days, and one or two Xanax at bedtime.)


- I started tapering last week but got interrupted by an intense cycling ride across Death Valley. (No shit.) This required a lot of V and D! But I learned in my couple of days of tapering that the Vyvanse is not so bad to withdraw from (gradually of course), and the Xanax works together with the V to help reduce the necessary quantity of both of them to get through the day -- and night.) It's nice to have some Desoxyn on hand for those days you're really wasted but don't want to the long-term effect of a Vyvanse. The idea, of course, is to build up a tolerance.


- Things are a bit out of hand  right now but I’ve got it together and am confident with my doc's assistance I'll reach my goal. At that point I hope the V still helps me through my day, and that I can sleep well. I know I'll not get that nice little buzz again, but I can live without it if I can find the balance that enables these drugs to do what they were intended to do.


Overall, for people like me, I'd recommend the Vyvanse/Xanax combination, starting at a low dosage and keeping them as low as you can. Don't take Vyvanse every day. Try the best you can to avoid Vyvanse tolerance, and let it do its good stuff for you. (Xanax tolerance is inevitable but also can be beat if you have to.)


Good luck and be well.

I have been prescribed 240 count 10mg IR dextroamphetamine (8 a day) for a little over a year now.


Just recently I was introduced to vyvanse and I was amazed at how absolutely perfect this drug is. It is literally my miracle drug.


With dexamps they wear off fast and can leave one with a comedown, regardless of taking more pills. Especially with my tolerance.


My doctor gave me a 60 count sample of these (50's) and I took two when I woke up, for the first 3 and a half hours I didn't feel much it was very subtle but by the 4th hour it was going full swing. It seems as if it releases a 10mg dexamp pill an hour into your system. Usually I am re-dosing all the time with dex and still get tired on the job, but with vyvanse the feeling never left, all day long I had a full blown amp high and was more productive and efficient than ever. I never had to take another pill no re-dosing no nothing. Just 2 pills in the morning and I was flying all day.


The feeling is so much cleaner and even more euphoric imo, there is no nasty comedown. It wears off just as subtly as it comes on. I have insomnia and dexamps don't help with that at all but I was able to get to sleep at night with the vyvanse without having to even dip into my ambien prescription (which is usually impossible). I just smoked a bowl and fell asleep, I haven't been able to do that in years.


I have nothing but praise for this drug. I wish it wasn't so damn expensive. I am probably going to have to stick to my dexamp script just because of cost but I buy vyvanse from friends whenever I can.


It's simply mind blowing, the energizer bunny. It even feels different from dexamp It's just so much cleaner.. I don't know how to explain it, but I'm in love with it. It curb stomps even meth or any other stimulant I've tried which is a lot, and yes I know how bold of a statement that is but I stick to it.


The only thing I worry about is I regularly go to the gym and I worry about the strain on my heart - can anyone tell me how bad it is to work out on amphetamines? Or is it not too bad at all? I don't abuse my prescription, I just take what I need to keep me going throughout my heavy schedule.

I'm a road cyclist and vyvanse helps my endurance without putting a strain on my heart. (I wear a heart rate monitor and also can sense when I'm overdoing it.) By the way, I don't compete in organized racing so therefore am not a cheater.


The bad news: If you use it a lot, Vyvanse will build up a tolerance just like all amphetamines and leave you feeling lousy rather than great. It takes a longer time for V tolerance to build up  -- nearly six months for me. My mistake was using it every day.


Now I'm cutting back to zero using a short-acting amp to keep depression and fatigue at tolerable levels. After a couple of days, Vivanse withdrawal seems a lot less nasty than other amphetamine withdrawals. Mostly you are tired all the time and want to sleep. No Doz tablets help.


I'll restart Vyvanse in two or three months and hope for the best. This time I'll stick with 60MG/day (one on getting up, and one two hours later). Some days I'll take just one. Some days, none.


Vyvanse works very well and is worth the trouble of careful management so tolerance is minimized. I expect the nice buzz will eventually go away no matter what, but its other good properties should hang on for quite a while.


Good luck!

**Caffeine and Vyvanse**


I am addicted to caffeine, and take 400mg every morning in the form of No Doz. I have now gotten to the point where I do not notice very much effect, apart from not being really tired. My friend gave me some Vyvance, 6 pills, 20mg each. He usually takes 120mg for a nice high (he is not perscribed, nor does he have ADD). I was wondering, will taking my normal dose of caffeine along with the 120mg of Vyvanse make me OD or vomit or have a heart attack or what? because if I dont take the caffeine, I will have a headache, and I dont want that to ruin my Vyvanse high. Should I take less caffeine, just enough to combat withdrawl? PLEASE HELP!

That really sounds like alot of Vynase for a non-tolerant person, and combining it with caffeine sounds like an even worse idea. I'd do some searching around and find a lower dose, and take it without the caffeine if you value your cardiovascular system

This stuff **vyvanse** for me was the absolute worst by far out of any of the add meds i have tried.  Those being (addi Ir) (Xr) (Generic Addi Ir) (2 Generics) (ranboxy for me which were great then they stopped them) barr addi Ir Worst ever ) barr dexedrine ok cept for stomach issues) GSK Spansules ok but needed to crush em to get good effect and 50 dollars cuz our insurence it wasnt prefferred.

The comedown and overall feeling of drugged on vyvnase was overwelming.  The comdown for me was manic bipolar to the extreme and that was at (40-80 mg)  addi xr i felt terrible got shi# done this stuff got nothing done ended up feeling terrible( you be the judge everyones body chemistry is different and this is just another rambling biased dextrostat rant lol peace and love Mr Mike.

Oh and the dextrostat i got are the last 75 of this pharmacy's ( gotta go back to the spansule and get higher dose from doc) the barr dexedrine im just sick of the stomach issues and the need to take such a high dose.  The funny thing is if you want the brand dexedrine ask your doctor to sighn dispense as needed, and they still have brand GSK being produced.   wHEN i asked the reason for this the pharmacy said their is more demand for the spansule lmao lmao lmao lmao lmao wutever i just get a higher dose and crush stupid pricks!

**For me Vyvanse acts as a mellow SR Dexedrine**


As every one of us knows, meds affect different people in different ways. From what you (MrMikecop) are saying, I'd like to provide some responses. Keep in mind that I know dick about chemistry.


I've done Dexedrine and other uppers for many years off and on and have never had stomach problems. I have a sensitive stomach, too! Sometimes it gets a big grumbly because I forget to eat, or a bit acid 'cause I drink a Coke. If I were you I would look into those stomach problems you're having. Do you get them when you're not using? Or eating the wrong food? You might have an ulcer.


I'm BP2, serious enough to be on state medical benefits as recommended by my psych. My manic episodes (bad moods, not good moods) and depressions were too much for employers to handle, even though I'm good at my job as a technical writer.


Vyvanse has smoothed me out almost miraculously. My mood is leveled out and it's on the friendly side, my productivity is way up, and at 2 x 30MG per day I am nicely buzzed but am in control of the drug and don't get blissed out in front of people. I feel this is the way my brain should be all the time but it lacks some critical element that Vyvanse makes up for.


It sounds like you're using uppers to get high -- higher than they make you at the prescribed dosage. As a result you've built up a tolerance and that sucks, with V or any other upper. As I said above, I developed a tolerance too. To reduce my tolerance I took a week off and dropped my first V's (as prescribed) today after seven days of total abstinence. (By yesterday I felt completely free of the drug and missing it, not in a craving, addictive way as with narcos, but because I function so my better with it.) 


For me the week-long comedown was not too bad -- the worst part was fatigue and evening depression. Today's very pleasant mood after only a week off indicates to me that the tolerance factor is not high with this drug. If want to experience a nosedive into concrete, just cold-turkey Desoxyn after a few weeks of heavy use.


Of course like any SR upper, even when you're taking it in moderation, every day you experience a crash, and you're right, even with Vyvanse it's not fun. I use benzos (Xanax) to smooth out the landing and they help a lot. In my experience, coming down from Desoxyn or Ritalin is way worse than Vyvanse.


I'd advise laying off all uppers for a few weeks or a month, then try a moderate dose (60MG) of Vyvanse. It might work for you a little more like it's worked for me.

Yes, I've got a fantastic psych. He trusts me and I don't abuse the drugs he prescribes. Well  . . . when except maybe when  I'm on a long bike ride and getting tired and there's a Dysoxyn in my back pocket. Dysoxny is pretty hard-core and I use it only occasionally to avoid building up a tolerance to Vyvanse. Life is good these days.

I got a script for Vyvanse 20mg and will be taking my first dose tomorrow.  I get up at 1pm and will be working at night (probably till around 2am).  If I take a pill when i wake up will it be effective till at least 2am?  I have heard different duration times from different sources..  I have zero amphetamine tolerance.

**Change in dosage procedure**


I'm putting a lot of time and creativity getting dosage right on Vivanse because my shrink and I think it has strong potential for improving quality of life on a long-term basis for adults with BP2 and other problems.


As BP2 I am prone to depression, poor social skills, and lack of motivation. Otherwise, everything is groovy! Vyvance was intended for children with ADHD but has been found to work for adults with different letter combinations variety too.


You'll know V is doing what it was meant to do when you begin to feel pleasantly calm and yet energetic at the same time. (Not "speedy" though.) You'll be motivated and will get a lot done. You will also enjoy life more and be easier to live with.


In my experience, Vyvanse is most effective if the following precautions are taken:


RULE #!: DO NOT BUILD UP TOLERANCE

You can build up a tolerance to V but it takes a pretty long time -- a few months of steady usage. You can lose the tolerance in about a week of cold turkey -- it's not as bad as some. (Be ready for late-night depression.) The best approach is to take just enough to get you centered and a tiny bit buzzed. Do not take any more than you have to.


Everybody's experiences are difference. I have found V to be smoothest upper I've taken yet. It has never made me anxious or irritable -- I don't even know I'm off until one to two hours have gone by. (I am an averaged  sized guy, j-u-s-t- bordering on tolerance but I know how to stay under the line. My dosage is 60MG.


I used to take one 30MG, wait an hour, then take the other 30MG. Now I take both at the same time for a less peaky effect. 


RULE #2: DON'T TRY TO GET TOO HIGH


Vivanse gets you pleasantly high TAKEN AS PRESCRIBED. Why mess up a good thing? If V helps you with your symptoms, consider the getting-high part a bonus. But if you start "chasing"  the high, you'll build up a tolerance and lose the benefits. For instance, I went to 90MG/day for a while and started gaining weight. (See below.) If you sense tolerance coming on, take a 4 7-day holiday.


RULE #3: Don't #)@)$*# STARVE YOURSELF.


Most of us want to knock off a few pounds but with V we can really get carried away. Normal dosage will kill your appetite but you can eat smaller portions of healthier stuff and still loose weight while feeling healthy and looking good.


If for any reason you stop taking V that weight is going to want to come back on pretty fast. Get used to the eating style described in the preceding para and it won't be so bad.


RULE #4: FACTOR SOME WD INTO THE SR

Don't expect to feel V's pleasant effects for the duration of the high. You'll spend 1 - 3 hours of that time coming down, which is never a pleasurable experience where uppers are involved. I'd count on about 6 hours of "medication" then 2 or 3 of withdrawal. Benzos help, but watch it, they are addictive little buggers that build up tolerance big-time.


RULE #5: Don't BS your shrink.

Over several months of usage I have discovered my doc sees this drug from the same perspective I do: You don't need high dosage. If you up the dosage level, you'll develop tolerance. So why bother?


It's probably a good idea to take a vacation from V every two or three weeks, for a few days. It's powerful stuff and induces you to push yourself harder than you would ordinarily. Use Buluelight to keep fellow V users posted on how your experiences have gong -- it's still pretty new for treating adults.

i agree with your 'rules' 100% i'm on vyvanse 50 mg, been on it for three months now. i never used amps much in the past, its not what i like in a recreational drug, but as something to improve my adhd, its worked wonders.


i've been taking breaks on the weekend, and on lay days during the week. i love how gradual it comes up, and how gradual it lays me down. not a crash, more of a slow motion fall, heh. i have a routine of taking my 50 mg in the morning before i eat. 


about the eating stuff, i had a week off from school last month, so i didnt take any, the weight i put off the first month came back quick! now i just keep snacking during the day instead of just skipping lunch, and the anorexic effects are minimal. (weight has never been an issue for me though) tends to keep my mood better in the evening as well.


about rule #4, i dont really notice a shitty feeling in the comedown part of taking vyvanse. around that time i'm usually winding down anyway, and by the time the stimulation has completely worn off, i'm perfect for bed. although i havent been sleeping as much, i still get my 5-7 hours a night. and strangely enough, vyvanse has turned me into a morning person.


and on rule #5, words of wisdom man.


sometimes less is more, in the whole pro to con ratio. the first week i was put on 30 mg, to start on 50 mg after that. this caused some bad insomnia for me, so i dropped down to 40 mg for the first month. just that 10 mg less was perfect. now i feel that 50 mg is a good sweet spot, been just as effective now as it was a month ago.


taking more vyvanse doesnt make the effects a whole lot stronger IME, but it sure does make it last a LOT longer. i like my sleep, and that deters me from abusing it. i'm feeling good of a mid-dose, i dont want to fuck up a good thing.

I take way too many benzos (my next tapering project) and don't have problems sleeping when using Vyvanse. When I overused Vyvannse (90MG) I'd just build up tolerance, and there is no stronger motivator that avoiding tolerance if you want to keep getting the benefits of a drug. At normal usage (60MG) I don't think insomnia is going to be a problem, provided I am willing to take a year or so to taper from the benzos.

i've been off of benzos from about a month before starting vyvanse.  actually since i've started vyvanse i havent touched a benzo.  tried 20 mg of ambien to sleep one night, and that was a trip. 

i usually have a high tolerance to the psychedelic/deliriant effects of ambien, but something about the combo and running on very little sleep, made it quite interesting. zero amnesia, and full blown delirium for half an hour, tell tale ambien hallucinations and all that.


i'm an insomniac as it is, enough so that the rebound insomnia from (ab)using sleep aids is pure torture. vicious cycle. i have a hard time with self control and a big rx to benzos, so its in my best interest to stay away.  with vyvanse, i notice i dont sleep as long, but the sleep is more refreshing. better than any sleep aid has given me, and i've been prescribed the whole gamut of them over the past 5 years. 


good luck tapering, i hope sleep doesnt become too hard to achieve coming off benzos while being on vyvanse.

In my experience, I have used a lot of different stimulants (ranging from pharms to cocaine, and ever cocaine freebase one time) and I find vyvanse to be garbage. It makes me jittery, gives me headaches, and makes my head race like hell! Although, I am rather odd because I find 90mg of oral Methylphenidate to be a more likable high than freebase smoking. No joke, one of the times I did the good ol' 90mg regiment, I wrote close to 3000 words on a friends facebook talking about how much of a good person they were hah. But to be honest, vyvanse is garbage. Avoid it.

yea i'm getting a cold sweat and feel like i'm crashing now..a little depressed. i found adderall way smoother, made my mind clearer, and i could relax and had no anxiety..i didn't even feel like i was on a drug. i don't feel relaxed on vyvanse. i feel a bit speedy and sort of on the edge. my stomach is messed up after i tried eating just snacks throughout the day. 


i hope i can switch to adderall..at least once this script is out. i don't even feel like taking any more tho, to be honest. =/

you definitely need to force yourself to eat while on vyvanse. it's hard at first...you need to find food that you love and keep reminding yourself that if you eat, the comedown will be a PIECE OF CAKE.

when i add weed to the equation feeling the comedown becomes almost laughable.

then again thats just me, and when i have taken adderall and smoked i went psychotic and started praying 8)

Didn't like it or find it to work as well as my regular Adderall for ADHD but can't take the long-lasting kinds of Adderall anyway because I wouldn't be able to eat a thing!

thats strange that people felt adderall to be smoother than vyvanse.

vyvanse is basically an xr dexidrine 


i've had adderall before, and that gave me more perhipial effects because of the levo-amphetamine in it, i assume. i've smoked, snorted and iv'ed meth and coke (smoked the base). and i have to say, vyvanse is the smoothest out of all of them. slow come up, and a gradual enough come down where i dont feel the leftover jitters of adderall and other stims. 


different strokes for different folks, i guess..

Whoa, so that's why I've been getting all those hallucinatory dreams! Along with benzos I recently started taking taking Ambien as well to sleep. The ultra-realistic dreams started happening right away. For example, I'd have a Technicolor dream of being somewhere else -- a motel maybe -- and get up in the middle of the night thinking I had to check out and attend some special event.


I'd wake up (sort of) and be getting ready to shower at, like, 3:00 a.m. when my partner would ask what the fuck I was doing. Then I'd fully awake and realize I was in my own bathroom.


Maybe this is the Vyvanse and Ambien interacting. It's never happened to me before. Thank goodness these are not scary dreams. In fact I find them funny as hell afterward, but realize I can't go on forever with these things, so gotta either develop a tolerance to them or make a meds change.


Like you, I'm an insomniac. I started Benzos years ago. Now, along with the Ambien to knock me out, I take two Temazepam and four Xanax! Be really careful upping your benzo dosage -- they are one of the most addictive drugs and take forever to taper. I started the Ambien recently to supplement the benzos. Maybe I'll be able to taper the benzos and still get some sleep due to the Ambien. In the meantime, I'll see you in my dreams!


A few weeks ago I messed up my back. It's serious, worn-out disc. I don't need to fake back pain or BP2 because already I've already got those problems and don't want to be a non-functioning garbagehead anyway. Nevertheless we all need a break once in a while so . . . The orthopedic surgeon wrote me for 90 Norco 10/325s plus two refills. Let's just say the the right dosage, at the right times, of Vyvanse/Norco/Temazepam can make your day a pleasant one from beginning to end.


Oh yeah, one last thing about some ppl who respond negatively to Vyvanse. This is totally normal, as everybody's brain is different. Because so many here like Vivanse, I would recommend trying it if Adderoll doesn't work for you. (It didn't for me.)

This is my 3rd day and the anxiety isn't getting any better.  The *dirty* feeling is getting worse..extremities are always cold and i'm sweating all the time.  I slept fine the first night, but the past two days have been rough.  It seems like it's lasting longer every day.  Is that because it's building up in my system?  I would think it would start to fade out a little with tolerance.  The first day it lasted about 7 hours, yesterday it was more like 15 hours.  As for eating, i have an appetite, but i feel sick to my stomach after eating anything.  I guess i should explain this to my psych.  I would ideally like to just get some adderall IR.  Then i don't have to mess with waiting 2 hours for it to kick in and being wired 24/7 cause that's what it feels like.  Strangely, it makes me obsessive and less social while adderall makes multi-tasking and socializing effortless.  I don't see how such similar drugs can be so different.

Usually the first few weeks on Vyvanse are the best so if you are going through bad side effects after only three days and not getting any benefit, you should contact your doc and see if s/he can switch you back to adderoll right away. Be prepared to return the unused Vyvanse to the doc or the pharmacy.

thanks man. that's good to know. 


i was able to separate the l-lysine from the d-amphetamine simply using a little alkaline water and protease..let that sit for an hour then ingested. i got a fairly strong rush instantly. it seems much smoother and more effective this way. so i'll see how the rest of the day goes...

well it's getting better..i think. or maybe i'm just feeling it less as i build tolerance cause it seems after about 4-5 hours the main effects start to wear off and i get tired sooner..tho i'm still focused and awake i'm yawning a lot. 


i think i'm feeling like a zombie later in the day cause i'm used to taking a lot of amino acids and vitamins that keep my fatigue at bay, but how do i take them now without killing my amphetamine *buzz*??  I wanna make sure my brain is getting enough nutrients and not getting fried..which is probably what's going on.  


Also, when would it be best to take an antacid?  Before or after taking vyvanse?  


As i mentioned before, taking the pill whole really f-ks with my stomach and the effects are much edgier overall than IR...the simple protease method i used isn't foolproof tho..while i did get a rush and feel the effects immediately, it still lasted way too long for me to sleep well later.   


I should've mentioned I've never had a script for adderall.  I was given one 20mg IR by a friend once to see if it would help me and it was very smooth..didn't even notice it but i was more productive and calm.  I am wary to explain all this to my psych to try to get adderall IR as i've just been diagnosed with ADD last week and this is my first scripted med.  He knows my drug history but is quite liberal about it (he said it's fine to get high occasionally..and mentioned LSD and marijuana as being therapeutic but not to be *overused*) maybe i should just mention the side effects of this xr and how it turns my stomach in knots.  Either way, i think i'll just ride this out for another week till i run out and see him again..and explain this.


What do you guys think?

**Using Adderall to reduce Vyvanse tolerance symptoms**


Sorry if this has already been discussed, but just in case . . . GOMUR and others were comparing Vyvanse and Adderall, but ironically the two work together pretty well. 


If your Vyvanse is starting to "sag" -- where you build up a tolerance and are bagged by lunchtime, a little Adderall will bring back the buzz -- at least, most of it.


I haven't taken Adderall, but when I told my psych I was sagging, he put me on 5MG (1/2 of a 10MG tab) Adderall to be taken in the morning along with my 30MG Vyvanse. (I do this as soon as I wake up 'cause it takes an hour to kick in.) Then, around 1:00 p.m., I take a 10MG Adderall. 


I tried this for the first time today. The Adderall is super-smooth and complements the Vyvanse nicely -- I didn't get any overdose or speedy feelings, just an extension of that lovely Vyvanse buzz I used to have all day. Hey, it's 9:00 p.m. here and I'm still writing. Maybe all I need is a .5MB Adderall in the afternoon.


By the way, psychs are aware of this issue so it won't freak your doc if you ask to try both for a month or so because on Vyvanse alone you are starting to feel "fatigued and unmotivated" in the afternoons, but you don't want to increase your Vyvanse dosage. (60MG is optimal for most people.)

that's not gonna reduce your tolerance at all-  what you're doing is adding a more potent amphetamine which will end up *increasing* your tolerance.

I understand your logic, but was assured by my psych, who's being doing this for a long time, that the two drugs, Vyvanse and Adderall, are complementary and for unknown reasons tend to stabilize the tolerance level so that the user, if taking the drugs as prescribed, will continue to achieve the medically intended benefits without future increase in dosage. 


I have only a superficial understanding of dopamine uptake (embarrassing to say in a community that obviously contains so many chemists). But as a boomer-aged stimulant user -- recreational when younger, medical now (for the most part LOL) -- experience informs me there are two definitions of tolerance:


1) A reduction in the psychostimulant's desired (by the user) effects -- euphoria, appetite decrease, greater physical stamina, etc. -- over time with the dosage remaining constant.


2) A reduction in the psychostimulant's intended (by the doctor) effects -- reduced agitation and distraction, greater ability to assimilate information, etc. -- over time with the dosage remaining constant.


As a certified, card-carrying BP2 I have found that my subjective tolerance (T1) to Vyvanse rose far more quickly than my medical tolerance (T2). In other words, after a few months I wasn't pleasantly high anymore but my BP2 symptoms continued to be subdued.


Hypothesis: Most of my doc's Vyvanse patients are T2 types. This is why he believes the addition of Adderall, for reasons scientifically unknown, will stabilize T2. I am hoping it will also stabilize T1. 


The immediate pleasant effects of increased psychostimulant dosage (via the Adderall) are, of course, meaningless. Finding out whether Vyvanse+Adderall stabilize T1 will require a lengthy interval of taking the two medications simultaneously, at consistent dosage. Four months should suffice. After which time I'll inform the board of my findings. Who knows? The damn combo might just work.

yeah, i have noticed the mental effects to remain fairly steady after the first month of regular use (started at the beginning of this year). slightly diminished euphoria, better appetite, and longer sleep (now back to a 'normal' level, for me at least).


although, a couple of weeks ago, i had a semi-panic attack, more than likely unrelated to the vyvanse, and had trouble sleeping (probably related). doc put me on mirtazapine 7.5 mgs for sleep, and they didnt do anything sleep wise. (i've taken them before, so maybe that can be a factor. although it was over a year since i've last taken it.  


i found that, compared to the other recreation drugs i've done (mostly downers, not that recreationally into uppers) tolerance grows pretty damn slowly. i can be content at this 50 mg dose for a while.

For me, combining Adderall with Vyvanse has no tolerance-aversion benefits. I guess it's a matter of keeping your Vyvanse dosage to the minimum that meets your medical needs. Once in a while you might "forget" and take a little more, and enjoy the experience.

Do you guys think that there is  any possible positive gain in effect if you take 250 mgs of vyvanse within, let's say 5 hours over 150 or 200 mg? I took about that amount for two days straight on friday and saturday (I slept each night) and I was very productive in that I was able to compose almost an entire song (in about 20 cumulative hours, )  but I have a feeling that I might have wasted a couple of pills.

i have found that, for me, anything above 150 mgs doesnt produce any extra effects, just longer duration.

I agree with what Wonda said above. New users of the drug are very sensitive to quantity taken. As they develop tolerance, early users find they don't get as high as they used to by taking more, they just stay high for a longer period of time. Eventually, if they ignore the tolerance they have built up, users will discover that taking more actually extends the withdrawal symptoms, not the high. So you feel like shit for a longer period of time. Sometimes life just isn't fair. (Benzos are a good coming-down med: It takes away the anxiety and enables you to relax, even sleep.)


For Vyvanse virgins like Haicod, large doses (150MG/day) can get you very, very high. So, Haicod, you probably didn't waste any this time -- each one you took either got you higher or extended the high.


But a few months from now, if you continued to take V a lot between now and then, those extra caps would indeed have been wasted -- or even worse, just acted to extend the duration of your crash. (When you first start taking V you don't really "crash." But be patient. Take it long enough and you will.)


As I said a while  back, Vyvanse can continue to be of medical benefit for people like me who need an ADD drug, even though it doesn't get me high anymore. So if you're taking V for medical reasons, stick with the doctor-mandated dosage -- usually 30MG to 60MG per day. If you're taking it recreationally, go cold turkey for a couple of months then try a couple of 30MG caps at the same time. If you get off, you should be able to get off more by taking more. If you feel nothing or next to nothing, don't bother taking more because your tolerance is still there. It takes some people a long time to get their virginity back.

I admit I have ADD and have known that I have had it for a few years (I've only recently decided to medicate) but I try to control my symptoms without the use of meds, or I smoke pot (which isn't an entirely effective medication for this, especially smoking.) So the only time I use it is to get high and be triply productive at the same time.

I only use it two or three days a week, and I don't really find the next day crashes hard to deal with at all just by taking a b-complex, but it makes sense that perhaps a couple of months from now (at the rate that I am going) I might feel them more, but I'll just smoke some pot.

However, when I go back to school in August I'm going to try to use just one, maybe two pills a day, if I find it difficult to get back into the swing of classes (after 16 months of medical leave.)


150 mgs does not get me very very high at all, I just get a nice buzz. I find vyvanse to definitely be weak, but I love it for that. The first time I took 50 mg right after waking up I went straight to bed an hour and a half later, I was so tired.


Would supplementing with l-tyrosine in the future on those days after help?

I already take 500 mg magnesium and used to take tagamet 30 minutes before dosing, but I have since discovered more articles that say tagamet does nothing for vyvanse than ones that say it prolongs the effects.


Btw, I have a prescription for Hyrdoxyzine and that antihistamine is great at relieving the anxiety and nausea on the comedown and for allowing me to fall asleep even though I take about 100-150 mg throughout the night with a 100 mg phenobarbital (which I'm trying to get rid of before I get some benzos.)

Am I the only person that gets an increase, sometimes, (at the least, no decrease) in appetite after dosing this drug? The first couple of times I took it I had to force myself to eat but now I eat meals and big snacks every other hour now. I mean, I have gained two pounds since in the past week whereas everyone else it seems loses a little weight.


I'm not complaining, I'm 6'3 and 150 lbs...it's just strange that I have hardly any negative effect on my appetite anymore.

i randomly start craving a snack now from time to time, like actually want to eat, rather than force myself to.

another friend of mine who tried some was able to eat, and fall asleep without much difficulty, but still enjoyed it. and he's tried other amphetamines before. its much more of a productive amphetamine IMO, due to how gradual its let into the system. no rush, and a gradual comedown.  really clean feeling too, i dont get any jitters, or uncomfortable from vyvanse. 

its a bastard way for shire to earn more money from a patented drug, but it works. its non-formulary under my insurance, which means the co-pay is twice what a name brand formulary drug would be, or six times what a generic would be. could be worse though. also, my doc gave me a voucher that covered my first 3 months of co-pays, from shire. check vyvanse.com, the program expires at the end of june

**Various observations about Vyvanse from an experienced user**


I've been taking Vyvanse at 60MG - 90MG dosage for seven months so far to help manage the symptoms of my condition. My condition is genuine BP2 (not faked to get drugs), with ADD being a secondary manifestation. It runs in my mother's side of the family and has hampered every aspect of my life -- I'm a boomer in my 50s. Fortunately I have a good job and an understanding partner.


Vyvanse helped my ADD symptoms tremendously, as well as relieve the serious depression I had so often. But after a few months, Vyvanse tolerance started building up and its non-medical benefits -- getting a nice smooth high, not needing food, unlimited energy, spontaneous creativity, generally friendly outlook -- all began to fade away. Most of the medical benefits continued to work: ability to pay attention over extended time, reduction of confusion, reduced mood swings, and so on. I still can't get depressed when I take Vyvanse. When I stop using it for a while, I can get high on it again.


Below are some observations that relate to the posts of other Vyvanse users on this board:


Eating: If you start craving food an hour or so after dropping Vyvanse, that means you've developed a tolerance to it. Rather than raise the dosage I recommend cutting back for a few days, then going cold turkey for a week or two. This could bring on some depression, so you should be ready for that. It will also give your body a chance to get back at you for all the weight it's lost, so be ready for food craving. If you're not careful you'll gain a lot -- as in, up to a pound a day.


Pot: I'm one of these people who gets paranoid on pot. I'm glad I don't like it because I've seen how passive and muddled a lot of pot smokers become. I put pot in the same category as booze -- you can get dependent on it and there are consequences, usually not good ones. I would not mess up a nice, clear Vyvanse high with pot.


Tolerance: I've tried baking soda and magnesium, and neither of them have worked for me in terms of staying high longer or resisting tolerance. Adderall is a good way to keep a smooth Vyvanse high running -- but then you have to deal with the insomnia Adderall causes. (For some reason I don’t get insomnia with Vyvanse, but maybe that’s because I use a benzo to help me get to sleep.) To a lesser extent, caffeine helps to perk up a Vyvanse high. You can use coffee, Coke, etc.; but I prefer NoDoze tablets. They are more concentrated and easier on the stomach. Don’t take more than two. One should give you all the help caffeine is capable of providing. 


Because it is so benign, Vyvanse is one of the few drugs you can take or not, and still have a good day. So on many days I hold off taking it. (On those days I won’t be as energetic. But after a week or so of no Vyvanse I’m back at my regular level of productivity.) A week or two off Vyvanse brings me back to the point where I can get a nice buzz again, if not exactly high. I could binge and get high that way, I guess, but I have too much respect for the drug to do that.


Withdrawal symptoms: Haikod -- it's not necessary to "admit" you have ADD. Its not like you had a choice, or you have some kind of contagious disease. At least you have a condition you can cope with – think of what schizophrenics have to go through.


You refer to "next day crashes". That is more of a hard-core amphetamine problem. My only next-day symptom with Vyvanse is that it makes me want to sleep in. The same-day withdrawals when coming down from V are gentler than most amphetamines but definitely are there: clenched jaw, irritability (jumpy response to a loud noise, etc.), tendency to zone out, not wanting to talk, etc. When I get to this state I drop some benzo (Temazepam) and hit the hay. I sleep fine but want to sleep in the next day, probably because I’m done so many things the day before on V! If I’m taking V fairly steadily, every couple of weeks I crash for about 24 hours, either sleeping or just lying there, spaced out. It feels kind of nice. Just make sure you don’t have heavy commitments scheduled for that day.


In conclusion: If you need or like to use amphetamine, Vyvanse will work for you PROVIDED you want a consistent, long-lasting, euphoric high, and still be able to work or function socially. If you want an intense, peaky high, you’ll have to use a different kind of upper. 


In fact, Vyvanse is almost not an amphetamine as most of us would define it. It is very manageable and mellow – no paranoia or mood swings. Treat it with respect and it will work for you indefinitely. The first rule would be: Don’t take it too much or too often, or you will develop a disappointing tolerance.

i'm wondering if vyvanse could be used to help taper off of adderall, if/when that day comes-  i've been on a decent amount of addy for 4 years straight and don't want to stop it just yet but i'm thinking that when it's time, if i could taper down to 10-15mgs addy per day and then switch over to an equivalent amount of vyvanse until i'm down to nothing... maybe it would make the transition easier.  anyone have any experience with that?

alright, I've only been taking Adderall XR pills since september 2008 every once in a while probably about once a week or more.


Today I took a 70mg vyvanse pill, and I like it. It doesn't have the "rush" or as much "euphoria" as adderall, but the fact that it stays constant makes up for it. Usually after 6-7 hours after taking XR addies, i come down a bit, then go back up.


on these, no comedown in the middle, straight productive amphetamine high for a good 10 hours so far.


Only real negative effect I'm experienceing right now is I can barley eat, which is bad considering i didn't eat breakfast or lunch. All i have eaten today was a few bites of a PB and Jelly and 2 snackers from KFC.

The weird shit is that on Adderall XR I can eat fine and even feel some of the effects of hungriness such as rubling stomach, pain or w.e.


On this vyvanse shit, no stomach feeling at all. I didn't eat till 4 PM after getting up at 6am... and i wasn't hungry at all. i couldn't even eat the PB & J because i felt as if I couldn't swallow it.


Only thing Icould eat was the snackers from KFC and that was like at 6.

**The all new Vyvance (Lisdexamfetamine)**


Well, I feel kinda dumb not knowing of this all relativly new substance being perscribed for ADD untill now. Has anyone tried it?

From what I've read its more pure Amphetamine instead of other ingredient chemicals, (Ie. Its more like speed than adderall)


Anyone have any wise information that they would like to share that we Vyvance newbies could have use for?

I have a Vyvance pill that says NRP 140 on it and I was told it was 50mg,

For those of you who have done it, What should I expect?

Is it going to be like 50mg+  or  50mg- compared to Adderall?

Thanx,

Ginger

^ I couldn't find the thread either. We should have one because I could have used some quick answers to basic questions about amphetamines a few days ago.

**if this helps some of you....**


I took two 50mg caps about three hours ago..on a almost empty stomach ..I opened them up and poured the sweet tasting powder in mouth...Took bout an hour to kick in....and they are very speedy..I did not take tums or any other potenating substance..I would give my left nut for a benzo right now to take the edge off a wee bit....maybe a tad bit less potent than adderall but vyvanse are very potent so user beware..I donot take amphetamines on a regular basis..the last time i used an amphetamines was four months ago and then i took five adderall 30mg..So if you were lucky enough to get a few and you don't use alot of amphetamines and want to try..then two 50mg should be way more than enough......Cheers....OP

I've been on 60mg ir adderall all night and I'm thinking about taking a 30 or 40mg vyvanse in a couple of hours. Does anyone know the half-life of vyvanese compared to adderall xr? I want to keep on going but I really don't want it to draw out and last like 10 hours.

Vyvanse seems to last closer to a full 12 hours than any other XR add meds I've been on (Adderall XR, Concerta).  Still, it depends on your metabolism and the dose.  Be prepared for a full 12 hours or more if you're unsure how you might react to it.  Lower doses seem to metabolize a bit quicker, but there's really no way to reliably predict the duration unless you're MUCH more in tune with your liver than the rest of us.

I've been diagnosed with ADD for 2 years now. I was first on Concerta which did a whole bunch of nothing for my ADD, then was switched to Adderall XR. It helped but I hated that bump/uncomfortable boost it gave me when it kicked in. I was then switched to Vyvanse 50mg 3 months ago and it is perfect for me. I don't get that weird bump feeling when the drug kicks in, I gradually notice its affects as the day goes on. It's helped me in school a lot. 


So here's the weird but AWESOME thing about Vyvanse..... You ready for this??

Ok, I've been addicted to Vicodin for 5 years and recently decided to quit. I have been taking Vyvanse as prescribed at it is actually alleviating my opiate W/D. I kid you not. I mean I don't feel 100% but I'll tell you right now if I wasn't taking the Vyvanse I would be curled in a ball on my bed in cold sweats. This drug is absolutely amazing in so many ways. I thank my doc so much for letting me try this. Anyone else get diminished W/D's from opiates when taking Vyvanse?

**Vyvanse after 9 months**


I'm looking over this thread after a couple of months away, and am disappointed to see almost all my posts deleted. I've had a lot of experience with Vyvanse and was sharing it as best I could.


After 9 months of daily usage, here is a "capsule" description of my trip so far:


I'm BP2 (legit) with mild occasional mania and major depressions. Response to other meds was poor. Adderall was best but, as you will read below, not as good as Vyvanse.


I started Vyvanse last August (9 months) at 60MG/day. (Two 30MG caps in the morning.) For six months or so it was fantastic. Aside from a soft but intense and long-lasting buzz its benefits were outstanding for the following: mood stabilization (no more depression!), energy (both mental and physical), ability to concentrate for long periods, and a more upbeat attitude (just keep from talking too much, typical obnoxious speed symptom). OTOH I'm a writer and you can really get carried away, being overly wordy and going off-topic when something new occurs to you. It interferes with your sleep less than any amphetamine I've taken in the past, which is quite a few, but you still need benzos or something else to nod off.


After 6 months I started to build up a tolerance to V and went to 90MG. (Two caps together on getting up, one more at lunchtime.) This worked for some things, but other benefits continued to taper. I started getting hungry again, the euphoria went away about 90%. If I went without it for a day, or even at bedtime when it had completely worn off for that day, I'd fall into an extreme depression. I mean, the get-out-the-Kleenex kind.


Still, I'm not going to give it up unless I have to. Despite the tolerance I'm going to continue V because there is nothing around that is more effective for the problems I originally took it for. I will endure some tolerance-reducing techniques if they really work to get the old thrill back, but I still benefit from it as it is. (If anybody has some sure-fire dexedrine tolerance reduction plans I'd like to hear about them, though. Haven't found anything here that works so far. And I'm not ready to quit for a couple of years.) 


For me benzos are essential for a smooth landing at the end of the day, just a bit as soon as you start to come down, then more at the time you typically fall asleep. 


At the day's beginnig, drop one tab of Norco 10/325 and two Vyvanse 30MG as soon as you open your eyes and your day will get off to a very nice start, even months after the first time you do this. I can see Phil's point about V making it easier to get off pain killers. I take the Norco because of my back (legit) but would give up the Norco if I had to choose between them.


If your life is really messed by up ADD, BP, depression, etc., I'd recommend giving Vyvanse a try and see if it works for you.

It is completely about the stomach metabolizing it. The amphetamine in vyvanse is lisdexamfetamine. I personally have experience with vyvanse. It isn't entirely new. 


When I had gotten some I took 2 70mg capsules and it didn't do much at all until about 3 hours later. Unfortunately the way it is metabolized, no matter how much you take of the drug it can only be processed at a certain rate. So you only get so much of it. Think of it like this. Instead of letting a line of 50people into a store at once, the regulate it to 1 person at a time. Thats how vyvanse works. They did this simply to reduce the abuse of ADHD medication.    


This link will tell you all you need to know about vyvanse: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4p6pEziHMK4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4p6pEziHMK4)

Hope this helps :]

Hello, I am new here:


I went to my psychiatrist who prescribed me both xanax xr (2 mg) and Vyvanse, titrated up to 70 mg. I have issues with generalized anxiety, social anxiety, and depression. I was given the xanax xr for generalized anxiety/social anxiety. I also have a learning disability that falls on the nonverbal spectrum, and my psych thought that this would help with organizational issues. Needless to say I DO NOT have ADHD, and I find it a little worrisome that I was prescribed this med. 


In any case, this drug combo indeed has made me much more talkative, confident, and motivated, I almost feel great! It is to the point, however, that I feel as if it is much too good to be true. I due tend to have crashes at the end of the night (depression, rumination, irritability), and my psych has upped the dose to deal with this. Ultimately, I feel as if the benefits from this drug, for me, are a simple amphetamine high that will eventually dissipate (I have never taken amphetamines, and I can now get a sense of why they can be addictive). 


I was also surprised that my doctor didn't mention that I would feel like this? I mean, for me, it is almost a 70-80% improvement in depression and motivation. I would at least expect him to mention that I might be on cloud 9 for a bit but, really, perhaps, this shouldn't be the goal of the drug?


I hope that I find a drug combo that comes close to this, because it is really helping me with work, anxiety, etc, and I am quite sure this can't last forever.

Confuser,

Surprisingly vyvanse is rather hard to build a tolerance on.. You'll get a mad tolerance for the xanax but as far as the vyv. goes, i've been on it for a year(30mgs) and it has helped me the same for the entire year. I totaly know what you mean, you do exude confidence on it, more open to talk. Its weird that an ADHD medication can help depression but this one does it rather well.

Thanks for the reply, I am at such a crossroads in my life right now that the boost of confidence from the Vyvanse helped me get motivated to continue pursuing my current goal of starting a private practice to help remediate learning disabilities. 


Because of my LD, I frequently become anxious (well, always anxious), and fall into depression...this, then leads to social anxiety (despite the fact that I have friends, and have always made friends). I tend to get 'natural' highs when ever I am successful professionally/academically, and become more social, confident, etc. However, experiencing these successes is often difficult because of my learning issues. Vyvanse, so far, has tended to put me in the same mood that I experience when I have my own natural highs (albeit, a little more amped up).


I am also interested in my psych's reasoning behind prescribing Vyvanse. He knows my cognitive profile (i.e., cognitive abilities, etc.), and that most of my difficulties are, theoretically, due to deficits in the right hemisphere of my brain (making tasks such as organization, visual-spatial tasks, planning, time awareness, etc., particularly difficult). He proceeded to tell me that we were lucky to live in the age of cognitive enhancers and that we should trial a stimulant (while being cognizant that it may increase my anxiety). Sounded intriguing to me but, again, I do not have ADHD, at least not according to my evaluation, or any past school history. So, am I right to assume that Vyvanse may help everyone, regardless of whether or not they have ADHD?

Not exactly.

Confuser, This may help. Think of it like this ADHD is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. There is ADHD, and ADD. ADHD = You are hyper all the time, and you can pay attetion for shit. ADD = You can pay attention but you are very very easily distracted. So you may have just ADD. Meaning you cant focus on one exact thing without somthing else bothering you.

And some people who dont need it may be effected different, so no. Its not safe to say its good for everyone regardless of medical status.

Actually, I think I may have miscommunicated a bit. I didn't mean to imply that it is a good idea to prescribe these meds to just anybody, I think that an ADHD diagnosis should be confirmed first (through observation, testing, etc.). I was just confused that he wanted to give it to me as a 'cognitive enhancer,' despite the fact my neurcog. assessment did not point to ADHD/ADD at all. I would then expect that anyone taking VyV. would have increased motivation, and task completion abilities. 


I did take a crash course in ADHD over the summer for my masters in learning disabilities, and we learned about the distinction between ADD/ADHD. Aside from the CPT, I can't remember what other clinical tests are used to diagnose ADD/ADHD. I was definitely in the normal range for the CPT. As to being distracted, who knows, perhaps I was in school at times, but I am guessing that was more due to just not understanding the material. In college, I could easily sit through a lecture, and take copious notes.


Ultimately, I will continue to follow my psycs guidance, because he has experience working with adults with my cognitive profile. I hope that my motivation continues on this med.

ADHD or not Vyvanse, Ritalin, Adderall, etc. will still be stimulants in your system. So doctors could technically prescribe them for someone they feel needs a boost but is not truly diagnosed with ADHD.

**Vyvanse is the best amphetamine ever, but it's still just an amphetamine after all**


"Ultimately, I will continue to follow my psycs guidance, because he has experience working with adults with my cognitive profile. I hope that my motivation continues on this med . . . "


We've corresponded before. I'm about a year ahead of you on Vyvanse and very similar personality. Despite anything I may have said before LOL I recommend you do not exceed max. 60MG/day (normal size male). You'll get terrible depressions as you withdraw every evening if you start upping the dose. It's the best amphetamine ever but it's just an amphetamine, not a panacea. You've got to work with who you are. 


I'm fighting to get back from 90 to 60, and it's no picnic. If I can eventually get to 30 and stay there, and it continues to be of help (even without euphoria, etc.), I may continue it.


Not being patronizing, just want you to avoid the anxiety/depression aspect of withdrawal. Have muchos benzos on hand. Good luck.

Confuser, I have ADHD and take Adderall, but not all the time, because I want to keep tolerance down. I tried the free trial of Vyvanse but sinece there's no generic for it yet, found it too expensive to get right now.  Like you, I too have "natural" highs. I went back to college in 2000 to finish a college degree I started in 1982 but THIS time on medication. I got all A's, one B, and one C (I had NEVER had Algebra before) and graduated with a 3.86 out of a possible 4.0. Every time I got an A or did well at school, it gave me a natural "buzz", which kept me getting those A's, lol! See, anytime you succeed at something or feel good, dopamine is released and amphetamines also work on dopamine. Dopamine activates the brain's "reward" system. I guess the saying that "learning is it's own reward" actually means what it says! Incidentally, many of our biological functions are linked to dopamine release as well. For instance, the biggest single release of dopamine in our system is at the point of orgasm-which insures the continuation of the human race! Another example is eating-we get pleasure from eating, which keeps us eating, aside from hunger. Unfortunately, the brain's reward system can also nudge us over into overindulgence and addiction. ANYTHING that can feel good, and be good for us, in small amounts, can easily become the opposite if we go overboard. Success is good but being a "work-a-holic" is NOT. Overindulgence in sex and eating aren't good either. I think that a stimulant would probably affect anybody, ADD/ADHD or not, with maybe the only major difference being that stimulants relax ADD/ADHD peeps and "jack-up" other non-ADD/ADHD peeps.

I'm going to try to get Vyvanse/Xanax combo prescribed from my psychiatrist for my depression + sleep issues. As much as I love my poppy tea for depression (helps with sleep too), there's no way I can allow my self to be dependent on it.

I'm the one who is prescribed Vyvanse/Xanax. My psych and I have an excellent working relationship. He trusts me not to totally fuck up -- I think getting high is okay with him but of course  we never discuss it in those terms. It's more like, "The Vyvanse works great all day to keep my mood steady, but then there's a really bad fall-off around dinnertime. I get a very fast and deep depression and can't sleep. After Lorazepam not being strong enough to bring me down gently, he prescribed Xanax without hassle. I take two or three 30MG Vyvanse per day, and three to six 1MG Xanax. This is more than I need and I am cutting back, which is not easy. It's a great meds combination -- just stay at the minimum dosage that meets your needs.

Thanks for the advice, and I will heed it not to go above where I am at. I might ask if I can split it during the day, and eventually lower it to 60. In any case, I am into my third week of Wellbutrin XL and, let's just say, I am a bit over anxious (even with the 2 mg of Xanax ER). So, definitely going to do something about this next week (i.e., discontinue, or lower something)


I still take the Vyvanse daily and that boost of confidence/elation has certainly diminished. After about two hours, of taking the Vyvanse, I still notice some mood elevation for a few hours than a drop into anxiety and scatter brainedness. 


Managing my anxiety, I think, is probably paramount. I think that amphetamines can play a role in managing ADHD (in my case, I don't fully fit the description). So, onto another week.

I tried Welllbutrin and it gave me anxiety so I stopped. The Vyvanse may make the Wellbutrin redundant. Just a thought.

My doctor started me off with 50mg of vyvance, I couldn't tell anything at first. 30minutes later I started for feel more up and awake. What's great about vyvance is you can apply for ''patient assistance'' on their home web page, you wont have to pay for it ever again!! Vyvance is making me want to smoke like a chimny. I've only been on it since 11am.

So I only read a few of the pages, and I was just wondering for recreational use, if I usually take 50 mg of adderall xr what did you guys decide was the recommended dose of vyvanse?

I'm way too lazy to read through the pages and pages of this thread but here is what I know based on my education, and what I just researched in official pharmaceutical references, and I hope to explain this in a way that makes sense.


Vyvanse does seem to be yet another method of an attempt to prevent abuse, by developing it into a prodrug. The Lisdexamfetamine is absorbed quickly via the stomach lining and processed like other orally administered drugs via the liver. From what I've read, this is where the enzymes are that convert the inactive prodrug to the active dextroamphetamine, which can then exhibit its effects. 


As we all probably know, the insufflation of any powder is used to avoid the first pass effect that occurs following oral administration, often resulting in a quicker, more intense "high". Taken orally, the drug passes from the stomach to the liver, where it processes the drug, often resulting in lower levels of active drug in the bloodstream (i.e. lessened effects if you're interested in recreational use). There has been some evidence that there could be a first pass effect that occurs when inhaling a powder as well, so as far as Vyvanse goes, in my professional opinion plain old oral administration is the best bet. The point of a prodrug is for it to be converted to its active form within the body, in this case the liver, so to get the most out of the drug, why waste the annoyance of insufflation when you'll get the best effects by taken as intended orally? 


This process does obviously seem to prevent abuse...as far as I can see? Perhaps the industry finally did a good job preventing the easily abusable regular adderall and ritalin tabs? Seems some people have reported taking high doses orally and had terrible after effects, so maybe Vyvanse should just be left to those who actually have ADHD, or those who occasionally need it to stay alert for purposes of studying or pulling all nighters for work?


Anyone else come to any conclusions based on experience/research? I'm curious to hear from those who use it legitimately (or have tried it in the past) and also those who may use (or have used it) recreationally? As a person within the profession i'm interested to know what if what drug companies do to prevent abuse does actually work to any degree, and if people find ways around it eventually anyway? I know they attempted it with the Daytrana patch, but people now just suck or chew on them and got around that abuse-prevention attempt.


Feel free to send me a message personally ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I'm simply inquisitive and by-partisan. I had my days of illicit use, but have now progressed to educational interest.

**Vyvanse and Depression, Surprising Results**


Hello everyone, been awile ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png). I just wanted to share some information with you guys about my experience with this med. I've been struggling with severe depression for about 3 years now. I've tried it all at this point, SSRI's can burn in hell in my own opinion but thats not what this is about. Roughly 3 months ago now my doctor prescribed me 30mg of vyvanse once daily. The first week was a rough up and down experience but after the first week I got my old self confidence back, I was able to leave the house again, I finally lost the worst lethargy I've ever experience and best of all to me I was able to hang out with my friends again.


To anyone who is offered this as a treatment for depression, these are my results as of about 3 months being on it. Always do the research before taking any medication your prescribed, no matter what the doctor tells you. Right now I'm working on getting past that social awkwardness, but that just comes with never leaving the house for 3 years ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) other then that, things have been great. 


If anyone else has been prescribed this for depression I would be interested to hear your story.

After quitting opiates, I became extremely depressed. But at that time, I was prescribed Vyvanse for my ADD. and it was an extremely useful tool for helping me get my life back on track again. Of course there were side effects but they were worth dealing with.

Of course dextroamphetamine will snap you out of your depression--for awhile. Never become accustomed to using speed for a specific purpose. Amphetamine drugs are powerfully psychologically addicting. 

Be careful with that Vyvanse dude...if you abuse it, you will experience the high. DO NOT chase that high--stimulants are bad news.

Vyvanse is NOT a good antidepressant, and any doctor prescribing it as such is kinda nutty. Reminds me of that 50's mindset , where AMP and benzos were handed out like candy.


AMP and it's many forms do have MAOI effects though! But the comedown effects are going to destroy you if you have any depression at all. 


Eagleman- Suboxone is the best antidepressant IMO for people who have recently quit opiates and are depressed... Even for non - junkies it has antidepressant effects.

I've been taking Vyvanse now for almost two years (70 mgs/day) and have found it to work marvels on my ADD. Its also provides great anti-depressant and minor anxiolytic effects and possibly compliments the other various medications I take like Cymbalta and Geodon for depression and anxiety. This may also be due to ADD's/ADHD's positive correlation, in certain cases, with depression and anxiety.

I'm on Suboxone. It was the boredom and missing the needle lifestyle that got me depressed. And no it's not a good antidepressant, medically speaking, but it can give you a good push once in awhile as long as you don't abuse it.

so after being on vyvanse at 50 mg from feb to may and from july to a couple of days ago, it started to lose its magic late in august. along with issues with insurance/money, i went to dexedrine spansules. 


started at 10 mg today. which is about half of what my dose of equipotent vyvanse is supposed to be. i had a hell of a time finding a major pharmacy chain that had any in stock as well, but the price savings will hopefully be worth it. it doesnt feel much different to me,  maybe coming up a whole lot quicker, but thats about it. i'll update with my personal opinion after a while.


sure, there is a whole lot more abusablity aspect to dexies, but i'd rather not with how much it helps me at a therapeutic level. i've been more keen to depressants/opiates than amphetamines abuse wise, but being treated for adhd has helped me keep that compulsion under control. just have a few drinks every now and then. 


another thing to note, i have a herniated disc in my lumbar (l5-s1), so i have been prescribed norco on and off (7.5/325) for when it gets bad since about late jun, but rarely have i mixed the two. i found pain to be not be as severe on vyvanse, than off of it. my mind spends less time wandering and thinking about the pain, so its more of a mental thing.

Took two of the 70mg orange & blue capsules at 11:30 AM after getting them for free from some kid who apparently is the only person who has a script for them in my area, ingested orally,


I have never tried Vyvanse but I was on Ritalin, Adderall, Adderall XR, and Concerta as a kid, I switched from all of them multiple times, and I haven't been on meds for about 3-4 years since I just decided I didn't want to be on pills anymore,


However, around 12:30-45ish It hit me I began to feel really weird like I haven't felt this way in a long time but as if I knew I've felt it before, and I realized how much I could concentrate and focus and just put my mind to anything and actually learn something and enjoy things and want to do what needs to be done, for the longest time I have been a slacker and an under-achiever, I never really wanted to do a lot, but after the pills hit me I wanted to do any and everything and it was different than the MDMA productivity feeling it was like .. intelligently productive, everything made sense to me and I could think straight. it was perfect.


however, that was yesterday at 12:35-40 PM when they first took effect, it is now 3:27 AM and I'm STILL high. 


I keep thinking I'm seeing things out of the corner of my eye, and that pills are in front of my computer monitor and that having the light off is a bad idea, I keep thinking my vision is blurred when in the back of my head I know it's not, it feels like I can't see in the dark but I know it's just really dark and I feel like I'm getting irritated really quickly, I noticed today that instead of craving attention like usual I didn't want it at all, in fact when people stared at me when I left to hangout with some friends, I wanted to confront them about it but fortunately I controlled myself, I forced myself to drink water and eat dinner my relatives bought for me and a younger sibling, it was horrible, it tasted like who knows what, and I wanted to throw up, same with the water, I wanted to throw up so badly,


basically what I'm saying is I really disliked what started happening 3-4 hours after the pill took effect, and I don't know when it's going to stop and I was just wondering because I am not in the least bit tired and I ALWAYS feel exhausted, I can never pull legit all nighters etc, I always pass out, but my eyes are wide open and I feel alert and for some reason it feels like somebody keeps touching my back and shit, it's not really that awesome, I don't really have a body high anymore I just feel the other effects,


which suck.


So I DEFINITELY recommend doing research on the pill/capsule/etc you get and making sure you know the correct mg's of the pill, because I had no idea at first and just took two of them and now look, I look like I haven't slept in days, and I know I probably wont sleep for days.


If that was too long for, here's a shortened version,


"Don't abuse Vyvanse in large amounts if you don't have a tolerance, but that's obvious, just saying, don't try to be a badass. it will mess you up really bad."


good day BL, i will probably be browsing the forums for the next 24 hours ..

Ive tried vyvanse a couple times for recreational use.  Along with the focused feeling, i experience some mdma like effects. I took two 70mgs (orange and blue capsules) the most recent time and was up nearly three days. At the "peak" I feel euphoric, but regret it after being up for two days lol. Dont take vyvanse is you will need sleep.

Vyvanse is not a great drug for recreational use in the first place. If anything, don't take 140 mgs at a time with practically no tolerance, expecting not to be tweaking for hours on end.

Vyvanse has helped me tremendously with depression compared to a number of anti depressants.  I have been addicted to opiates in the past few years and i can say the same thing.  It also does an EXCELLENT job at reducing my cravings for them.

I've never had euphoria from Vyvanse, just been really talkative and HORRIBLE insomnia.  Also very very very focused on whatever task is at hand, alla Meth.

LOL!


I did this stuff three times before I liked it, first times were terrible. TERRIBLE!


Answer? - lower dose. 


Basically... don't do three  70's in 1 night :D


A 40 gets me pretty well buzzed, with no adverse.


...Yeah, don't take too much, you won't sleep for days. 

I mix the stuff in coffee - delicious. Or just get some coffee in my mouth and pour the powder in. Little bits at a time to get a pick me up so I can survive that day after, because this shit, in any dose WILL keep you awake. 

Also... you'll not want to eat, and if you do, its going to be junk food so make sure you make yourself eat right, and drink water. 

It seems more 'pressing' on the heart than any other drug I've done, not as far as BPM but blood pressure is up, that's not too good. 


Do you think when this patent or whatever expires addies will be easier to get? Vyvance is everywhere around here, probably because we have a stimulant issue in this town and docs think this isn't abusable - ha.

I've been struggling with severe depression for about 3 years now. I've tried it all at this point, SSRI's can burn in hell in my own opinion but thats not what this is about. Roughly 3 months ago now my doctor prescribed me 30mg of vyvanse once daily. The first week was a rough up and down experience but after the first week I got my old self confidence back, I was able to leave the house again, I finally lost the worst lethargy I've ever experience and best of all to me I was able to hang out with my friends again.

I was extremely depressed a few years ago and was on all kinds of ssris that didnt work and then i got put on vyvanse and it has worked incredibly good for me.  I have been on it for 2 years now, 70mg a day (worked up to that mg) and I have not been depressed to any degree that I was before at all.  I have actually worked a job and raised my gpa up in college since.

When my psychiatrist first put on Vyvanse 30mg I my heart would be racing during the peak of the medication but I wasn't having very much increased concentration or alertness. I then realized that I was drinking a lot of Cocacola and having a large coffee every morning. Since then I've basically cut out all caffeine from my diet and have moved up to 50mg vyvanse at 5am (when I start work) and then the three days a week I have school my psych prescribed 10mg mixed amphetamine salts since I don't get out of class until 8pm. With this new combination I have much better focus than before and I feel like my heart rate is a little slower than it was on the 30's w/caffeine. On the 50mg/10mg combo my resting heart rate is usually anywhere from 85-105bpm(I'm a 6'2 male age 20 that weighs 145lbs and in descent shape.) 


          The vyvanse 50mg taken at 5am usually wears off right around 4 or 5pm at which point I take the amphetamine salts which last right up until I go to bed. I can say if i didn't get prescribed xanax for my G.A.D. it would probably be much harder to go to sleep. Also, I get Nucynta 75mg x4 a day for my lower back. I have arthritis in my facet joints, a very arched lower back, and spasms down there. Anyways, I've found that taking the Vyvanse/Amp.salts helps keep my mind off the pain and mental cravings for Nucynta. At the same time if taken together or at least while one or the other is active they feed off of each other quite nicely. I basically turn into superman and can get a days worth of work accomplished in 3hrs.

Be weary of the Vyvanse  - too much can be terrible

Cut the caffeine out and take 30-60 mg to start. and see if you like it if so go up to 70. Any more than that is just unplesant >![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Yes I agree with the above statement cut out the caffeine. I like the increased focus and energy from Vyvanse but 50mg is all I would want. Before I cut out caffeine I had taken my once a day dose at 7am, at 4pm later in the day I was sipping on a rockstar energy drink...bad idea. My doc said they last around 12 hours of primary effects which I have found to be true in my case.

I currently take both Adderall and Vyvanse for the treatment of ADD. The days I wake up early enough, I'll take the Vyvanse because it has legs, meaning it stays with me throughout the whole day, keeping me focused and in a nice little happy mood. The days that I sleep in late, I'll stick with the Adderall because it's not as long lasting and I can still sleep on it. If I take the Vyvanse too late in the day, I can't get to sleep. I'll just toss and turn. 

In answer to your question - Does Vyvanse show up as Amphetamines on a drug test, no, it does not. I get UA'd about 2-3 times per week and according to my case manager, i've tested positive for Amphetamines for every single one of my tests, except for one. And that one time, I assume, was because I had taken the Vyvanse and not the Adderall due to sleep reasons. And when she asked for the printout of all my Rx's, she said "That one doesn't show up."

That is just my experience. And since you've got a scrip, you're golden anyhow. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I am Rx'd 60mg of Dexedrine for ADHD... 2x 10mg / 3x Daily.  I can switch to 2x 70mg Vyvanse and not be too bummed.  It's good for ADHD... as a 25 year old and such (not speaking for the kids here).  I think it's probably (opinion) less habit forming for me and also is not as effective for the really bad days when I can't stop moving!


I do say in theory, that I would take it if Dex ever dissapeared from the market ![:!](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/argh.gif) 


It is 100x more reliable than Adderall xR and even Dexedrine SR which I think SUCK (both)... I cant deal with the roller coaster they are in thier nature.


Vyvanse isn't xr/sr/ crap.  It's legit 10-16 hrs of sustained release Dexedrine-ish effect.  I think it is not a  bad drug at all... wouldn't pick it to abuse per se'.  But it could be done.  I would rather be given the chance to try Methedrine (Desoxyn), I bet a low dose would be perfect... but I won't know thanks to the police state!

**Is Vyvanse Safe?**


Short Story: Doctor wants to prescribe Vyvanse, mom doesn't want me to be medicated, and doctor refuses to write me a prescription until mom says ok.


Is there an article somewhere that shows how good Vyvanse is, without giving the negative side effects?


Even if this medication has some negatives, as most ADD medications can have a pretty hefty list, I would rather have an article that tells how wonderful this medication is, and sort of skip past the negatives a bit.


I've searched and can't find a completely positive article.

This question could apply to others as they may just want to know the positive effects of Vyvanse.


If this doesn't make sense, please ask and I will elaborate. Thanks!

I don't believe it is in the nature of harm reduction that BL stands for to give a source that only has positive information. Knowing and understanding the side effects and risk of a drug are VERY important, and to ignore them and just read the positives is pretty stupid. You are basically asking us to help you score drugs, in the form of tricking your mom into thinking that Vyvanese is all good and no bad, and that's not true of any drug.

I'm sorry, you had taken my post with a different view than I had originally intended.


I know I have ADD. My doctor knows I have ADD. My mom knows I have ADD.

HOWEVER, my mom is against taking any medication that has mind-altering effects.


That being said, I know all the side effects that Vyvanse has to offer. As I have said, most ADD medications can have a pretty hefty list. I am not ignoring the risks, I know these very well, I would just rather show how helpful Vyvanse can be in order to prove to my mom that it might be worth trying. 


My mom has spent the past week looking up the negatives of the drug-She also knows them very well and doesn't need me to show her any more. If you try to find why something is bad, I am sure your going to find it (As you did with my initial post). I am just trying to prove to my mom that the drug is not ALL BAD and does not cause all side effects listed, but instead can be used to treat ADD positively where the pros will outweigh the cons.

The side effect profile is pretty low for vyvanse, IMHO. 


[Here ya go.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19453202?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&ordinalpos=3)


hopefully that link is operational, if not, just go to pubmed.com, look up "vyvanse side effects," and grab what you need.

I agree, out of the ADD Medications out there Vyvanse is probably the one with the shorter Side Effect List.


Thanks for the link Pallidamors! I was hoping for a link something like that.


If anyone thinks they have a better link, post away, I won't refute any help given.

If you only want positive information on the drug, have you tried the manufacturers website?  Manufacturer's usually don't say anything bad about their own products ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png).


That aside, vyvanse is an amphetamine, and the safety in amphetamines depends on how the user uses them.

If your doctor thinks that the positives are going to outway the negatives you should have your doctor explain to her why he thinks its a good idea. I think she'd trust the doctor more than some article online

Your thread has been merged to the Vyvanse Mega Thread.


If you actually have ADD or ADHD, then Vyvanse could help you out.  If you're only interested in the pills for recreation, I would say forget it unless you know you could keep it moderated.  


I wouldn't take ADD meds every day unless you actually have ADD and need them to function every day.  And even then, taking them every day might still not be the best option.

I have to disagree with you, it most definitely will show up on a urine screen that tests for amphetamine. I know this because unlike you, I was only taking Vyvanse at the time I got tested and it did come up as a positive. Plus... it is an amphetamine. What most likely happened to you (testing negative) is the same thing that happened to me on several different occasions. I was taking bi weekly tests for Probation and at the time I was taking Xanax 1mg twice a day every day, even still a few of my urine screens didn't test positive for benzo...even though I had just taken my morning dose earlier that day. Also a couple times they sent it out to a lab and 2 out of 10 times they did that it came back negative even though I know it was in my system. The testing staff as well as my doctor were both stumped by this... leading me to believe that no drug test is perfect, even lab tests. But like you said if you've got a script it doesn't matter, I just find it interesting.

**Vyvance overdose?**


I have been perscribed Vyvance for ADHD for a little over three years now. I've found that it has started wearing off much faster than it used to, and I've started taking two 50mg pills per day about 5 hours apart. It seems to be the only way to keep it going as long as I need it to. But I am concerned that 100mg per day might be too much. 

How much is an 'overdose' of Vyvance? 

Are there any long-term side effects of me doing this? Is it safe?

that would depend on your tolerance. but since i believe theres a limit to how much vyvanse your stomach will convert to amphetamine at any given time (at least i think its rate limited), it should be harder to OD on it.


100 mg is not excessive for someone who has been on it as long as you. i've taken 75 mg with no tolerance and felt fine. have you noticed any health issues with this new dose? like rapid heartbeat, flushed face, paranoia, etc? i think you're probably fine, but if you notice any health problems you should contact your doctor.

I agree about the decreased intensity during W/D's while on Vyvanse. I have never experienced a withdrawal, but when I haven't taken my pain medication for several hours I don't have as much of a psychological craving for the Nucynta, and it seems to distract me from my pain.

I know this because unlike you, I was only taking Vyvanse at the time I got tested and it did come up as a positive. Plus... it is an amphetamine. What most likely happened to you (testing negative) is the same thing that happened to me on several different occasions. I was taking bi weekly tests for Probation and at the time I was taking Xanax 1mg twice a day every day, even still a few of my urine screens didn't test positive for benzo...even though I had just taken my morning dose earlier that day. Also a couple times they sent it out to a lab and 2 out of 10 times they did that it came back negative even though I know it was in my system. The testing staff as well as my doctor were both stumped by this... leading me to believe that no drug test is perfect, even lab tests. But like you said if you've got a script it doesn't matter, I just find it interesting.

Yea forgot to mention it might result in a positive for meth-amph, although this didn't happen in my case and is was included in the 12 panel screen... still very likely.

One 70 mg Vyvanse emptied into a small amount of coffee works for me every morning. I drink my coffee black, but when I dump Vyvanse powder into it, it tastes sweet, like amphetamines always do. It hits you VERY fast.

Ok...got prescribed to Vyvanse yesterday by my psych doc.  Im starting back school at age 27, and was on Ritalin when i was young for ADD, now going back to school and working full time (50+) hours/week, i have been using Addys 20mg IR recreationally for the past 3-4 weeks, everyday except weekends for work reasons.  so the doctor hastly gave me a script for Vyvanse 30mg/day, when mention childhood ADD.  LONG STORY SHORT----I took my first 30mg this morning at about 6:30am (2hrs ago), and get the same effects off of this med as in adderall IR (but takes longer), how long it last is yet to be determined, but except it to last all day!  Ive got a 30day supply and gonna use everyday until my next appointment and see how the effects are and discuss with doctor. Id rather not p the dose to 60mg the first day, but MIGHT?!?!?  It seems alot smoother, not an QUICK HIT, running around trying to find something to do type shit! which in my case is good, for focus at work.  I have no intention on trying to alter the XR form of Vyvanse, and if u want that QUICK HIT, try something else, cause its not gonna happen with this med. 


Also: I am prescribed to 2mg of Klonopin/day, and also Trazadone for sleep at night...so between the two, i think we will be just ALRIGHT....also i have a SLIGHT dependeance on opiates, have been taking 2mgs of Suboxone/day for the last week or so, to ween of, I had no problem with addy and Subs, but that at 5pm I was ready for relaxing and could fall asleep (if that helps anyone?)


Later

**Strength of Vyannase??**


The first time I took 1 pill I felt the effects really strongly.  Very positive feelings, lots of focus (maybe too much into 1 thing-such as doing a word problem)  Then a few weeks later I took it again.  Im not sure if its because I was more stressed or what but it wasn't as strong for me.  OK after taking it for 10 times I get it if its not as strong, but the 2nd time seems a lil unusual to me.  What are your experiences with it?

Vyvanse has done wonders for me. it last so much longer and is more smooth than both ritalin and adderall. I took 3 50mg an hour ago and im already speeding. The only down side i see to this drugs recreational potential is its long duration, it is almost impossible to get to sleep on vyvanse, i recommend taking a modest amount of DXM when you are coming down it helps me get to bed but be careful mixing an upper with a downer. 


for the next day yi would  smoking some bud to ease the comedown.

my doctor rode the vyvanse ship a year or two ago whenever it came out, he took me off my 80mg of adderall XR a day and placed me on (!!!! three 70mg vyvanse !!!!) I could only take one and stand it, I didn't like it at all, three would make me so uncomfortably sped up its out of control. 


Finally after basically not using my vyvanse and just giving it away, I have had a new doctor and he said the max daily dosage is 70mg and wouldn't prescribe 3 a day, I asked him if I could go back to adderall XR he agreed and now I am back on adderall xr, now I take the 30mg XR's twice a day, so 60 a month and to be honest. ADDERALL LOCKS YOU IN. and you become superman at anything your doing, especially things like video games online/multiplayer my reaction speeds are up like 500% and im always on the top of the leader boards, while on vyvanse It helped concentrate but was just CRAP. even though its the same amphetamine salts along with dexedrines it just wasn't working...


also it cannot be abused in any way, vyvanse cannot be snorted because it has to pass through and be digested which is a big reason doctors which to it, but to be honest I like to snort maybe 10mg of my Adderall capsule every once and awhile, either way adderall is just so much more effective, don't buy into the vyvanse crap if your doctor only gives you that or concerta and refuses adderall, find a new physchiatrist.

**Vyvanse**


I have very bad adhd. And i am prescribed 30 mgs of vyvanse per day but i don't take it unless i need to do alot of work that day. Basically Vyvanse is just another way for the makers of adderall XR to make more money since the patient for Adderall XR is expiring next year.  But another reason they are prescribing it is to people who have a history of substance abuse... the way vyvanse works is that it is an organic ameno acid (not an amphetamine) until it passes through your large intestines... Then when it is metablolized, it turns into an amphetamine.  This way you can't just open the capsiles and cursh them and snort them or if you are stupid try to inject them...all the college kids are gonna be really pissed.. well not really since most of them get prescribed concerta and rits an generic adderalls...and the dexatrine...the is the worst for abuse...

^ It's just as abusable, just because you can't snort it doesn't mean it's not abusable, it just means people who think you can.. and do so.. are going to be disappointed. But you're right, It's just a way for the company to keep making money.

You guys seem to be implying it's a bad thing Shire Pharmaceuticals is seeking to profit from Vyvanse. This doesn't negate the fact that the drug is superior and more effective in many ways to Adderall & Adderall XR. The medication is able to deter many potentials for abuse (IV, insufflation, inhalation, etc.) while providing a 12-hour therapeutic effect in one capsule.

agreed. Or 12-hours of speedy fun for those of us who are occasional recreational users. I have experience with ritalin IRs, ERs, and adderall IRs, XR's... all strengths. The vyvanse 70mg imo is vastly superior to the ones Ive tried as far as mild crash, smooth stimulation and somewhat subtle euphoria that doesn't make me look like *as much* of a jackass as when im sped out on the other ones. Not doing uppers anymore really, just my 2c. My name is spaz Im an opiate addict, thanks for lettin me share. PEACE AND BE SAFE! -spaz

It's not really.. a bad thing. I Just know I wouldn't feed this to my kid. That scares me that there are 8 year olds on this stuff *every day*. Knowing that it can mess an adult up.... NO way that I'd ever give my hypothetical child a drug like this. Parents need to be more informed as to what this actually is, and school systems need to stop pushing for drugs and start pushing for alternative remedies that actually solve the problem at it's source, play therapy is good. As for adults, there are similar things that help. I don't agree with treating disorders exclusively by drugs in most cases, medication should be used as a 'bridge' of sorts, to control symptoms while the problem is being solved at the source. Nobody should have to be on medication indefinitely. Although ADHD drugs 'solve' the problem it's only treating symptoms... Poor twacked out kiddos.

I too have ADHD as part of my overall Bipolar 2. This combination is a barrier to learning and carrying out tasks without going overboard or getting sidetracked.


After a year of use, Vyvanse continues to be somewhat effective in these areas, though only about 50% as much as before. As for the euphoria and weight loss benefits, they are totally gone.


I figure I'd have to stay off V for several months to  eliminate the tolerance I've built up after a year's daily use (two 30MG caps each morning). And stopping Vyvanse when you're depression-prone is NOT easy.

Just saw the shrink today. Starting on Vyvanse 70mg day. Problem is I have a needle habit. I wanted to try to shoot some. Everything I've read on this mega-thread says it's not gonna work. The Doc told me about the protein that has to be split off for the amphetamine to work, but he told me, that happens in the bloodstream. So he said snorting would be useless, but I said we'll IV'ing would get it my bloodstream, then it would work right? He sad "yes, I guess it would". So is he misinformed, or is it possible/worth it to IV. Keep in mind that although the benefit might not be all that great, if the downside isn't totally worthless, then I get my needle fix once in awhile. That has been very hard to get over, so any tips on how to shake that craving would be appreciated.  BTW I have a 28 yr. drug history, with everything from weed to heroin (clean now except for the Dr. script) and I never IV'ed a drug until my last stint in rehab about ten yrs. ago, when the other inmates taught me to "quit wasting my money" So much for rehabs, when your hearts not in it. Please excuse the rambling tangent

I have a scrip for Vyvanse 70mg. It really does help me out, I tend to get so much more shit done on it. I don't take it everyday though, usually 4-5 days per week. Its kind of weird though, some days it really helps me be more focused and talkative at the same time, other days I feel like Im a zombie.


Only side effect is usually some dry mouth and if I drink caffeine I get jittery. I also find it tends to wear out a little quicker than I like after lunch. It takes bout 1-1.5 hours to kick in.


I don't think I would flip out if I stopped taking it, I would just go back to a more "slacker" mode. And I like the fact that it is not a rec drug, I would be a little too tempted to do lines of Ritalin or adderall.

I figured out how to do this a while ago. You have to react it with trypsin, a stomach enzyme , and then do an acid/base extract. 


I wrote a thread about it a while ago detailing the whole process .... 


I guess you could skip the A/B extract if you can de-activate the trypsin, otherwise the trypsin can eat through skin from what I hear. 


I would love to be able to IV vyvanse... believe me . It's possible, but I don't think it's been done. 


PM me for a trypsin source...

**shooting Vyvanse**


shooting up Vyvanse is very irresponsible and idiotic. Take the drug how it was intended... orally, in the amount it was intended... w/e the doc prescribed both MG and amount per day. 


Vyvanse isn't crack and it's not intended to get high on. It's for add/adhd. The fact that someone has to ask if it would work via IV should be an even bigger red flag not to try it. No wonder medications such as Vyvanse and Nucynta etc. get placed in schedule II.

if you people wish to abuse prescription stimulants, why not take the IR varieties?

instead of trying to cleave the lysine off the vyvanse, you could instead get switched to dexedrine IR

just my thoughts though..


i should be getting changed to dexamphetamine tomorrow, switching from ritalin (which has little therapeutic value for me)


on a side-note: in regards to study (cramming during nights before exams and whatnot)

how does vyvanse compare to dexedrine IR?

and how is the "high" in comparison?... therapeutically and recreationally

Vyvanse 50mg= about 25mg generic aderall but a lot smoother, longer lasting, and not as harsh of a come down(if at all) also get mixed amph salts for night classes which is great for about 4 hours and does produce a more noticeable "high" but probably due to the rapid release properties

I've been using vyvanse a lot lately.  Started with 50mg a day and it was marvelous!  I had slight euphoria but no anxiety, incredible focus, great cognition (especially mathematics), and increased sociability.


Fast forward to almost a year and I take 120 mg a day and while I get focus and increased cognition I've lost the happier side of the drug.  Instead of being chatty and happy I'm very easily agitated by people and generally avoid conversation now.  I have had adderall boosters that were IR and I had a better effect.


SO... I'm going to try to get Adderall instead of vyvanse.  The claim vyvanse lasts 12 hours is just not true for a LOT of people and I'm one of them.  An enzyme governs the release and enzymes can have so much variability it isn't even funny.  After just a month I would take my 50mg vyvanse and 6-7 hours later crash the fuck out.  Adderall for some reason is longer lasting for me, idk if it's the l-amp or what but it just seems to work better (obviously we're all different).

Hey, right now i am taking 40 mg vyvance, and I have also noticed the strong tolerance that build up to it.  I've taken adderal before and I did not seem to build up up tolerance to it as quick as vyvance.  Seeing as the body gains a  ashortterm tolerance to dextroamphetamine that rapidly builds up upon repeated use and diminishes quickly upon abstinence, Im wondering if this increased tolerance isdirectly related to the  long duration of vyvance.


For example, lets say Person A takes adderal at 8 am on Monday whereas at the same time person B takes Vyvance, and both doses result in nearly eqivelent peak Blood plasma levels.  Assuming that adderal is out of Person A''s system at 2 pm (6 hours post taking) and the vyvance has left Person B's system at 5 Pm (9 hours post taking), Person A would have an extra 3 hours per day to reduce his tolerance.  It might not seem like alot, but with daily use the 3 hours would-imo-build up into an avoidably high tolerance to the drugs effects.


After a few days, vyvance would lose that confident kick which ADD innatentive people such as myself rely on as the motivation to go to school and thus become a succesful professional.


Just my 2 cents.

I get a bottle(30pills) of 70mg vyvanse and I get another bottle(60pills) of 20mg amphetamine sulfate pills a month. Screw uppers I'm better off taking tests and going to school sober. I've "been on" this shit for a while now aka I just sell my bottles every month. Gettin $100 a month is better than eating 90 pills and feeling like shit and loosing weight and all that nonsense.

Interesting thought on just taking tests sober and the Like...

Personally I Am so scattered by 11am without vyvance( I take 70mg/daily) that it would be unbearable to try and focus on my work without it.

  When I take my medications as prescribed I am "sober" as they simply correct certain nuero-chemical imbalances making life otherwise intolerable. I know for many they are just to get high, and hey, I'm cool with that! To Each Their Own.

   The one main complaint I have about these medications is that stark increase in hearing I experience for the first hour or so and at times mild paranoia. Is that common?!

   I find that making sure to eat something prior to taking the medication makes all the difference on most unpleasant side effects tho...

    Finally, I neither condemn or condone selling medications to others but, if you are going to, then you can get A HELL OF A LOT MORE than $100 for all that!! Holy slapdappiteedingadong-fuckcrunchies!! You need to consider going up just a bit!!  (;

Your dosing is way to high to produce any positive effects that make this regiment le drugs worth it.  If your taking that regiment daily its no wonder why its not working, your tolerance has been raised to the point where your abusing your body by "taking it as recomended".  CHill out from it for a while (4 days at least) or take very small doses just to get you by.  Take it after that and I assure you you will get the original kick you need to get by.


Taking high doses like that will cause a massive tolerance to the positive effects and only a minor tolerance to the negative effects.  


Taking weekend breaks and using supplement to make my stomach alkaline has allowed me to stay on an effective forty mg regiment (maybe taking longer breaks and bigger doses if i know i have a shit load of work to do in the next week)


If you do it right, a well-scheduled low dose regiment will get you more focused and confident than a huge ass daily regiment.  Huge regiments produce uneasy energy, social anxiety, and the paradoxical desire to do absolutely nothing but twitch and meaningless repetitive amphemetic routines.

Is there a way we can temporarily change this in ourselves?

 For me, 80mg Vyvanse's actually good parts are gone within about 5 hours.  Same with 60mg and 40mg(which I don't ever take unless it's JUST to focus a bit more on work and get it done faster).  I usually dose 60mg for my enjoyment, which I think is lower than most people, but higher doses wear off just as fast.


So the question I asked up top, and also wondering about L-Tyrosine as a crash (partial) cure(I also eat like I know I should on Vyv, start out with fatty foods then eat vyv +25minutes, eat protein and fat and carb all day long).

well, i ran across about 20 or so of the orange/blue 70mg vyvanse caps and also about the same number of grey 36mg concerta caps too. oh and about 50 of  these old generic adderal ir 5mg pills, they are blue and chaulky, and i dont think i've ever even felt the addy's even taking 15 or so of the 5mg ones. Anyways, fast forward few weeks to last night, i decided to give it a go, and for some reason I just popped 4 of them with 4 5mg adderal's and about a hour after i started to bearly feel it hit.  that was around 2pm, and by 4 i was grinding my teeth like i had done bunch of coke. and was pretty damn tweaked out, able to act fairly normal but deff felt like i REALLY underestemated them.

so i think its pretty much warn off now since about 630am and instead of going to bed im thinking 1 70mg cap is sounding good, its 840am now day 2, so ill take it now and prob try to crash out good this evening.


overall im pretty impressed with vyvanse compaired to adderal and adderal xr's


on a side note, when I used to WD from pretty heavy opiate use the first few times i'd ride it out prob bout a week and once im starting to slowely feel better, but lathargic i'd take like 90-120mg of adderal xr that i'd crush the beads. and that felt about as speedy as the vyvanse last night was.... very compairable, 280mg VYV vs 120mg adderalxr


anyways, i better go take that 70mg now so i can relax tonight, sorry for the long and prob scattered post, just...well you guys know how it gets, LOL.


thanx

I am prescribed Vyvanse 70mg capsule per day,and it works by combining with lysine in the small intestines according to my shrink and my perosnal resource backs this up,, lysine makes the drug active and it takes approxamately One Hour to work,as my shrink said there is no coming up type of rush as with other stimulant pharms, he said after an hour give or take a while "you are just there" maneing it is working,an dunlike adderal which is a combination of dl,amphetamine salts ,Vyvanse converts into d,amohetamine..The abuse potential orally is lower than other drugs because the lysine (in whatever form it is in d,lysine or whatver I do not know, but lysine in a naturally occuring essential amino acid made by the body,and you can only take about 140 or so mgs and then the lysine is depleted for enough time,in your small intestines that further dosage will pass un-activated through the GI tract.

4 70s is a lot.

  25mg=about 7.5mg d-amphetamine, so 280 would=84mg d-amphetamine.  Adderall is 87.5% d-amphetamine, so 87.5% of the 20mg you took would be 17.5mg.  17.5+84= 101.5mg d-amphetamine.

  120mg adderall is 87.5% d-amphetamine so 105mg d-amphetamine 15mg l-amphetamine.


So your guessing (combining the 20mg adderall and 280 vyvanse) was very close!

I believe 60 mg of vyvanse is about equal to 25 mg of ir dexedrine.  it stops there you can not do a conversion accurately into adderall because they are very different.  The racemic form of amphetamine (addys) work for some while the D (right handed molecule) of amps work wonders in others.  Personally Adderall did not treat my ADD, but dexedrine did.  There is little evidence on why this occurs but lots of speculation.  Talk to your doctor for he/she is there to help! Good luck.

**70mg of Vyvanse for one with no tolerance and... [**


I recall seeing a megathread for Vyvance, but I didn't see it.


I was wondering 2 things.

Me and my friend Soda are going to be taking Vyvance this weekend.  I have like a gram's worth, but I don't know how much is safe.  Any help dosing?

I am prescribed 70mg and take it every day, and he has never amped before.


Also, I recall reading somewhere that the chemicals must be converted in your stomach or something, so is that a no-no to good ole snorting?

a little research can go a long way

...theres a good place to start. lots of good info. personally, i would just start with 20mg's, and then work your way up from there, dosing every hour or two until your satisfied. no need to put yourself at risk just cuz you wanna dose all at once....these drugs last a long time so you can dose incrimentally and still get the saem high. We dont know your personal health issues(and you many not know of a hidden health issue) so its best to start small and work your way up. not much else to say really.

nonono, he's talking about lisdexamfetamine, which is not d-amp. 70 mg of lisdex is equivalent to 30 mg of Adderall XR. 70 mg would be a pretty good dose for a first time, even if you have taken speed before.

70 mg of Vyvanse is equivalent to 30-35 mg of d-amp. It's quite different from Adderall XR. I love Vyvanse.

I'd say have your friend start out at like 30 mg. That would be like having him eat 3 of those 5 mg d-amph IR tablets (roughly). So if I were in your shoes, I'd take one of your 70 mg caps, open it and dump out about half the powder, and re-cap it. Give your friend that. 70 mg will get a non-tolerant person SPUN, believe me. Even half of that dose should get him pleasantly amped.

And no you can't snort it.

mkay first of all I know my amphetamines very well, obviously I wouldn't make the mistake of confusing d-amp and l-amp. What I'm saying is that on the Shire website they compare 30 mg of Adderall XR to 70 mg of lisdex. 72% of Adderall is d-amp salts, so 30 x .72, 30 mg of Adderall is 21.6 mg of d-amp, I think there's 2 different d-amp salts in Adderall, but going off just that ^^ which is a REALLY rough estimate (because Adderall doesn't just contain d-amp sulfate like Dexedrine) then 70 mg of VyVanse is roughly equal to 21.6 mg of Dexedrine Spansules. So maybe we should start going off that instead of saying 70 mg lisdex equals 30 mg of Adderall XR? Idk.

^^Scratch that, 25 mg of Vyvanse is equivalent to 10 mg of Dexedrine Spansules, so 70/25=2.8, 10 x 2.8=28 so 70 mg of Vyvanse is equivalent to 28 mg Dexedrine Spansules.

How long on ritalin? and at what dosage? The effects of vyvanse are ALOT smoother than ritalin, due to the D-amp / MPH difference. I am 6'3 145lbs, and have been taking adhd meds for... 3-4 years now. I am at a dose of 50mg, but due to my current situation I'm taking like 100mg-150mg a day. But also my tolerance is wayy to high.

contrary to popular belief, you can get high from snorting vyvanse. i experimented with the 50 mg & found that when you take the pill orally & wait for it to hit you, it is then possible to snort the powder & get some recreational use out of it. i'd still prefer adderall over vyvanse any day though.

Does Vyvanse have any (mild) psychoactive effects itself??  The Wikipedia page called it a "psychoactive drug and stimulant prodrug".  Or do they just mean that it is psychoactive in that it gets converted to amphetamine?  Selegiline has some short 2-3hr effects, for instance, but acts mainly through MAO inhibition and possibly (?) metabolism to l-amphetamine.

A friend of mine obtained a 50mg vyvanse.  I'm not familiar with it so I don't really know what to tell him.  He's usually taken about 10-15mg of adderal XR at a time in the past (just to study).  I did the math and it seems that 50mg vyvanse is an awful lot by comparison, so I told him to hold off on taking it, because I think 50mg of it will have him quite high and not in a mood for studying.  Half of that should put him close to 10-15mg of adderall XR, correct?  Again, the point is just studying not tweaking.

**Taking Vyvanse a couple hours before waking up?**


Hi all. Just seeing if anyone else has tried this with any success. So this morning, I slept through class and woke up at 10am. I figured I would just sleep in some more. I had a couple 60mg Vyvanse that I planned on taking today. I decided to take them before I fell back asleep so they would help me start my day faster when I woke up for the day. I feel the effects of the Vyvanse, but it's not as strong as it usually is. Yesterday I took only one 60mg Vyvanse and the effect was greater than the two I took today. Has anyone tried taking ADHD meds before waking up? Was it as successful as taking them when you were already awake?

for me amphetamine tolerance grows fast as fuck, quicker than benzos and opiates

if i do 1-10mg line of adderall the next day 10mg isnt even fun.... and tolerance is perminant it seems, because when i first got into adderall 1-5mg got me going, now it takes like 30mg + caffeine...it's probably a combination of both, but my ADHD friends say they can take like 90-100 mgs and feel nothing....

Do you mean, like, setting an alarm for 8 AM where you wake up in order to take your Vyvanse and then go back to sleep hoping to be extra ready for your 10 AM class?


Going from personal experience doing this with Vyvanse, dexedrine, d/l-amp combo (adderall), focalin and ritalin I gotta say the results are a mixed bag. Sometimes I spring right outta bed; other times I'm awake but actually feel more zombified than I usually do when waking; and sometimes I stay asleep despite the presence of stimulants!


Difficult to give a hard and fast answer to this one...

When I was in college, I was prescribed adderall. I also had difficulty waking. I experimented by setting my alarm ~45min before I had to wake up, having my dose and a glass of water next to the alarm, taking the dose when the alarm went off, then going back to sleep. It worked like a charm. 45 minutes later, I was awake and energized, ready to learn. It became my morning ritual. I highly suggest it. Missing class repeatedly is not good.

Man it's the same for me, I *really* wonder why (and how, too) it could differ from person to person. You'd think more DA and NE coursing throughout your prefrontal cortex would wake anyone up, especially after a good night's rest.


When it DOES work (for me), though, boy does it work!!!

So am I correct that towards the beginning of this thread it was agreed that subjecting the powder in the capsules of Vyvanse to lemon juice would release the dextroamphetamine?  Similar to what I've done with the XR Adderall balls in the past.

You might be able to fall asleep on it, but I wouldn't count on it.  


I'm going to merge this into the Vyvanse Mega Thread.

IME, 1 gram of vitamin C 2 or so hours before you want to go to sleep helps a lot. Melatonin or weed helps too.

^^ My girlfriend would fall asleep on hundreds of mg's of apmhetamine. 


I never understood that...


Also, thoughts on being prescribed vyvanse for anxiety? My girlfriends cousin is 15 and I don't know how long he's been getting it but he is prescribed 70mg Vyvanse daily purely for anxiety.

buuump. new user.

have a question about tolerance.  I took 60 mg of vyvanse today (for recreation) and it was fun. I want to take 140mg tommarow.  Will i barely feel the 140 or not even feel it at all since i took some today? ive read so many diffrent peoples views on tolerance its got me quite confused.  before today i had only taken vyvanse once last week 100mg and it was really good.  My plan was to space it out and take it once a week to avoid getting tolerant fast.  The only reason i took it today was because i didnt like my classes today so i wanted to make them fun.  i wont be doing it after this though im strictly saving it for once a week on weekends.  Thats why i want to tomarow because its friday and well i want to be up partying and stuff haha. anyways sorry for this long post back to the main question...Will i be to tolerant to feel 140mg since i took 60mg yesterday?

depends what kind of anxiety you're talking about, but I find vyvanse helps my social anxiety tremendously in good doses.  


IMO vyvanse is way more worthwhile than adderall... it might not give a rush like a crushed up parachuted adderall would give (if you could even consider that a rush), but the extremely smooth peripheral stimulation and length make it more enjoyable.

I've always loved amphetamines. When it comes to recreational use I know where they can take you. I asked for Vyvanse when I got nervous to ask for adderall. I was so pissed I never gave it a chance until now. Vyvanse was prescribed to me 100mg a day. Adderall tolerance for me builds over night. I have not seem to experience vyvanse tolerance for the past few uses. Also when I take adderall I take it obsessively and can't help but to do kore than planned. I usually plug or sniff adderall and am killing my body. Vyv gets me feeling nice ten times longer and prevents me from abusing. Food does not seem to affect obsourbtion of vyv at all. I never feel the need to redose vyv, I take it once and forget about it. Adderall won't get off my mind if that's what I'm on. Vyv in my opinion is very close to meth. Better than adderall by far. Euphoria for 8hours no crash or strung out feeling. Perfectly recreational or useful. I prefer to concentrate it makes me feel happy.

**vvyanse still effecting me??**


i took 120mg of vyvanse thursday and had insomnia and fast heart rate all night (normal) but the next day i had terrible anxiety attacks and paranoia that kept me from being able to stay at school. there were times i thought id pass out and i kept having like dark thoughts and stuff. ive never experienced any of this in my life and this is the 4th time ive taken vyvanse. well i saw my docotor and she said it was a combination of the vyvanse and sleep deprivation. so i went back to my house tried to  sleep but still had insomnia.  took 5mg ambien and fell asleep around 530pm. so this morning i woke up, after 15 hours of sleep, feeling fine, minor headache which i assume is from the ambien. but then i started having some of those dark thoughts and some anxiety and my heart still races every now and then. is this still the vyvanse?? is it not out of me after 3 days? and what should i do about this or am i going to be like this forever? because thats my biggest fear right now

I don't know anything about vvysane or how long it will effect you for.  I do know from my own experiences and that of a few of my friends, whether the panic attack was drug related or not, once they start they're around for a while.  It's called anxiety, bro.  Shit sucks but it only shows up slightly until one day something triggers it.  I have my anxiety a bit more under control now than I used to, but it's still something I deal with regularly.

Yours could be something else and might subside naturally because amphetamines are fucked up like that.  That's why I don't touch 'em lol my heart races enough *without* this crazy chemical in me.


good luck tho man.  Hope you get this all figured out

try eating a little more than just french fries, and try to eat a little 'healthier'.  I'm not say go and eat an all organic spinach an sprout salad, but eat something rith some real substance.  McDonald's is fucking terrible for you, and also has a lot of salt.  If this is how you normally eat you may have way too much sodium in your diet which can cause high blood pressure and all that fun stuff.  

I'm not going to cite a source now  but there have been studies shown that an unhealthy diet can greatly intensify an anxiety problem.  Ether way, even if it has nothing to do with anxiety, poor diet will generally make you feel like shit and can cause some of the symptoms you've described

Just feel like sharing my experience with vyvanse

I am prescribed 70mg of vyvanse daily for my ADD.

70mg vyvanse = 30mg adderall

And I'm a fairly small guy. 130lb, 5'8"

I'm not sure why my doctor prescribed me this much but I notice that if I take it everyday then I don't eat hardly at all and come home from work very tired and not know why because I feel full. I just empty the capsule into some choco-choco milk and drink half and save the other half for the next day. Works perfect for me.

Anyone taking Vyvanse to help your attention with anything: you aren't suppose to notice or feel any effects from it. It is suppose help you with whatever you are doing without you noticing. so you get just the edge you need and that's how I feel when I take 35[ish]mg

I personally would say never use vyvanse recreationally because if you take, say two 70mgs you could easily be up for 24 hours+ and want to do nothing but sleep and stop thinking. Believe me. Been there, done that, got a t-shirt. Go with adderall if you actually want to get high on amphetamines but I hate amphetamines. Do what you want. I'll gladly answer to the best of my knowledge

Peace

If you actually have ADD amphetamines wouldn't/don't give you any kind of high, right?


Or is a large enough dose able to produce effects akin to a "high"?


I've been taking generic adderall 10mg for a while and I feel no high whatsoever. 


I guess I start to feel onset of the effects but it's not a super enjoyable feeling.


Maybe 10mg is just a small dose.

A large enough dose of amphetamine will get anyone high.  I have adhd and therapeutic doses will have a paradoxical effect but give me enough and i will be twacked.

I love vyvanse, I have access to 40, 50, and 60mg capsuls.


it gives me a ton of energy, makes me confident and talkative, and makes me enjoy working. I will seriously impress my bosses when I take it, but I usually save it for when I work doubles. the best part is that it lasts all day, at least 12 hours, and I can usually fall asleep fine afterwards. also, when I wake up the next day, I will usually still have energy and a desire to work. there are the occasional times where it will keep me up all night, but I don't feel exhausted in the morning at all.

how much difference does plugging make with plain instant release dexamphetamine?


It is a bit gross so is there any decent benefit?

^You can't plug lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) as it is inactive until converted into dextroamphetamine in the digestive tract.  Snorting/plugging/IVing is useless.


If you have a dextroampheatmine preparation, and posted in the Vyvanse thread for some reason, then I know for most amphetamines rectal is maybe 20% better bioavailability and like always a much faster come up.

I have a few questions that have yet to be answered about lisdexamph, if they have been answered forgive me because there is quite a bit of nonsense in this thread.


Are there any CYP2D6 inducers widely available?

How long does your enzyme efficiency return to normal after a dose of vyvanse, or how long after a dose would it take to get the full effect from the same amount again?

How much lisdexamphetamine can your enzymes process from a single dose before they are worn out to the point where adding more wouldn't be effective? (aka ceiling dose)

On the topic of a ceiling dose, I'm not sure what dosages you have experience with, but when my prescribed dose was first increased to 70mg I took 140 mg at once, and I'm pretty sure all of it was effectively metabolized. When it started to kick in I had some pretty scary hypertensive symptoms, but they quickly subsided. I have ADD and a lot of experience with high-dose mixed amphetamines, even in combination with meth as well, but at least for me it seems that dextroamphetamine in particular has a very distinct *comfort* ceiling, beyond which the side effects far outweigh the benefits.

I think you are misunderstanding how lisdexamfetamine is metabolized.  It undergoes hydrolysis in the G.I. tract and it's metabolism is not hepatic until it is dextroamphetamine.  That being said the answer to your questions are as follows.

I apologize if what I'm about to say has been repeated but I want to attempt to clarify and educate those who are interested in Vyvanse...


...especially those who may be curious about intravenous route of ingestion...


Lis-dexamphetamine (Vyvanse) *is* water-soluble (792 mg/mL). The reason it is considered a pro-drug is because the amino acid lysine is attached to the dex-amphetamine molecule (very similar to the adderall molecule). This causes the drug Vyvanse to be metabolized by the body at a more stable constant rate (preventing overdoses).

Although, the gastro-intestinal system contains enzymes (like proteases, trypsin) that breakdown this pro-drug to its most efficient form, enzymes *are not solely* needed to cleave the amino acid lysine.  A moderately strong aqueous acid solution will work. Emphasis here is that it will work *to an extent*, nothing will work as well as your digestive system will.  However, *as a **very **general rule*, anything water-soluble at room temperature will travel through your blood and to eventually to your liver where it, along with all blood, is filtered.  Therefore...


Safest way:

-Let it dissolve in room temperature DI (de-ionized) water for 25-30 min.  Distilled water is safe as well

-Filter at least 2x

-To the Moon!


More dangerous way:

-Let it dissolve in a mixture of a weak acid (lemon/grapefruit/orange juice, vinegar, ascorbic acid a.k.a. Vitamin C) + room temperature DI water in a 4:1 ratio for 15-20 min.

-Filter at least 2x

-Good Luck!


The second method is more dangerous because you must take into consideration the possible bacteria (acidophiles) within the acidic fruit juice or vinegar. Remember, aseptic technique (performing under sterile conditions) is key for intravenous use!

Neither of these methods are in any way safe (DI / distilled water are not sterile) and plain water will NOT break the peptide bonds, making the dextroamphetamine active. You'd be much better off using enzyme complexes externally, and even then the amount of processing one would have to do to make a solution that could be injected with *any* degree of safety would be enormous.

I am on a lymictal, Trazodone, Pristiq, and Topamax. I am Lymictal for Bipolar, Pristiq for Depression, Trazadone for the racing thoughts at nights causing me not to sleep, and  Topamax help curb my appetite from boredom eating. I have wandering thoughts during the day, can't stay focused, when I have a conversation I forget what we are talking about, we I was saying, and to stay focused....that's a lost cause!! Cleaning my house... I can't stay in one room for more than 5 minutes cause I get distracted, and praying... I read a post earlier and I laughed because she said she said she says the same the thing over and over again. When I am writing, I write the same the same words twice! What is going on? I myself think I have ADD, I know i have OCD, is anyone on this combo of meds and on any ADD meds?

^Tell your Dr. how it's making you feel and what happened. A dry mouth is a side effect of taking D-amp. Haven't you heard of meth mouth LOL. I would try drinking more fluid's or waiting until you see your Dr. again.


vyvanse is still addictive, you just cant really abuse it. And it sucks compared to straight up D-Amp. But hey cant make an orange out of a apple.

**Catalytic effects of Stomach Acid??**


Well the ant-acid which I always take with Amphet's as well is more of a comfort thing for me, I get terrible reflux when eating sizable mg amounts of dextro amphet.    However looking at the bond I'm willing to bet that it will not be dependent on acidity of the stomach to happen, but the acid probably does catalyze it a little.


You could always try and see and write us a nice little comparison ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

However, would antacids also reduce hydrolysis of Vyvanse into dextroamphetamine? If so, perhaps an antacid could be taken some time after Vyvanse ingestion to allow the lisdexamfetamine dimesylate to fully convert into the active amphetamine? Any suggestions, ideas? Either way, 50 mg Vyvanse feels very much like 30 mg of Adderall but actually smoother, so far at least. This is my first day on it, and 5 hours post ingestion, the effects are very pronounced and euphoric. It is definitely not useless, and certainly could be abused. It does not feel inferior to Adderall at all. I haven't tried pure dextroamphetamine, so I know not how it compares to that.

How so?  if it breaks down to the real deal in the GI track you should be able to orally abuse it.  It looks like it's a 2:1 on the drug after it's been metabolized so doubling the expected should do it.


I'm getting some tomorrow I'll post back about it.

**vyvanase**


well i just got switched from ritalin to vyvanse.. i popped 5 30mg and disolved one in some orange juice and chugged it. this was about 2 hours ago. i still feel nothing. of course i was snorting 20mg rails of ritalin every few hours a few days before getting prescribed vyvanse. 


ran out of ritalin one week prior to doc appt, no drugs to take, all out of kpins,hydrocodone, nothing.. i felt like shit.


now a week later after 5 of these fake speed pills my withdrawls from other drugs dont seem so bad. but there is really no high.


i'm 5'10

215 lbs

120-150mg of vyvanase at once and nothing.


i have been trying to get my doc to script me some focalin or adderall but she said it was too addictive but when i go back i'm telling her flat out i am not taking anything but focalin or adderal because this shit for me, vyvanase was 180$ for one month supply.


i preferred ritalin. fucking bitch, who is she to tell me somethings too addictive, i'm the one taking it, i'm the one thats the addict or not. give me what i fucking want you whore doctor.

well i did try pouring the powder out of the capsule into some freshly opened ginger ale with all the carbonation in it and it fizzed like crazy when i swirled it around.  i just chugged it. i dont know if that could be a step in getting rid of the anti-abuse mechanisms or at least one of them? cause when i said fizz i mean like super fizzle violently.  


i have no chemistry knowledge but i'm guessing theres a way to defeat this compound cocktail they put in for time release..

an easy way please cause i dont really feel like doing the whole drying on a pyrex dish i just want it not so weak . like i've taken probably 10 30mg pills in the last 3/4 hours and i can barely feel anything its like after 3 or 4 cups of coffee without the coffee jitters.

**What potentiated my vyvanse?**


3 weeks ago I went on a reckless binge with Vyvanse.  I ate approximately 600! mg. throughout a 24 hour period.  I took nothing else that day except some beer.  it seems that my tolerance should be through the roof. 


6 days ago I did an unknown amount of 2ct2 (maybe 15-20 mg.) which is said to be a mild mao-a inhibitor, and from what I have read should have pretty much been out of my system after 4 days.  


Last night I ate 60 mg. of Vyvanse 40 minutes after taking one Gaviscon (which contains the same ingredient in Tums).  This is the first time I have attempted to potentiate the amphetamine effects by increasing alkalinity in my stomach.  I had a very pleasurable 3 hour high that started about 1.5 hours after ingestion, with noticeable after effects lasting another 4-5 hours.  This was probably one of the most euphoric experiences I've had with amphetamines (never done meth), interestingly because this dose was pretty low.  At a certain point the effects reminded me of a medium dose of mdma without the touch enhancement and rolling eyes effects.  


Does anyone know if the Vyvanse was potentiated solely by the Gaviscon, or could the 2ct2 I took 6 days ago have had an effect? Or was it simply a matter of not having done any amphetamines for 3 weeks? I just don't get it.

well consider youself lucky then cause i took some potentiators too and it just made it edgier and no euphoria to speak of and thats with taking about 25 at once. i was just up and unable to sleep, more annoying than anything else.

I try to keep my stomach neutral in its PH levels when I dose lisdexamPhetamine (cute, Shire), because I don't want to take my chances with messing up my experience. However, given that the half-life of the prodrug molecule is an hour or less and that you had taken it 15 minutes prior to what is sure to be full conversion to the dextroamphetamine, it is a possibility you potentiated due to timing. Antacid-induced potentiation of oral non-prodrug amphetamines seems to have a consensus of ingestion around 15 minutes before dosing the amphetamine. That's my best guess.


I seriously doubt the 2C had any effect on your experience other than perhaps placebo at best.


Not doing any amphetamines for 3 weeks (which seems to me to indicate you use enough to build a significant tolerance) would undoubtedly, in my mind, be the culprit. Amphetamines are rather strange too, with intermittent dosing by a chronic user, there is even a chance of increased sensitivity (reverse tolerance) to explain the euphoria. How likely this is to happen, I do not know, but either way your tolerance would definitely have decreased significantly at that point. And I personally find Vyvanse to be quite euphoric at times (I'm not talking meth euphoria though), and prefer it to Adderall or any of the methylphenidates both recreationally and for its indications. 


Magnesium seems to have very noticeably affected the effects on me. First time I dosed was supplemented with it and lasted 6-8 hours. I took a similar dose with the same amount of supplement two days later (now) and have been feeling full effects for 15 hours now. This makes me wonder about further about magnesium and what kind of variables are involved in getting this reaction, because I just can't help but feel these two factors are related.


Vyvanse is a substance I have learned to appreciate with over time. I would definitely consider it an acquired taste.

i had my first appointment with the psych today, expecting to leave the office with IRs (which i have been self-medicating / abusing quite regularly the last few months). he wrote me out vyvanse which ive tried a few times.


frankly i was relieved. IRs can get out of hand, especially if you're looking to keep your tolerance down (they're too tempting to put up the nose!)

**Speedy help please!**


I used to be an Adderall lover, took it often for recreation, just listened to music -read- and smoked cigs. Great philosophical high!


A friend is willing to give me a meeger 30mg Adderall tomorrow which is fine, better than nothing. 


He is going to give me some Vyvanse aswell, but I dont know what the hell to make of it, even after reading hundreds of posts etc...


I want to combine them- but Im a bit afraid. Have no idea what to expect... 


My best guess is to take Vyvanse first, sit on it for an hour, then start hitting the Adderall... I dont know...


Please help me figure out whats the best ASAP! Im so exited ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

you say you used to abuse adderall. how long ago was this and what was the magnitude? you refer to 30mgs as meager (do you mean XR or IR?). im assuming then that you have some objective level of tolerance. How many mgs is your vyvanse pill? its not dangerous to mix the two, necessarily. substantially its the same active ingredient delivered differently. i have taken the two together quite some times; as long as you know your general tolerance for amphetamines you'll be ok. 


yes. vyvanse first, adderall (assuming you mean IR) after 2-3 hours. this might seem like a long time, but you need to give the vyvanse time to metabolize into dextroamphetamine. i suppose this will also depend on what you want to get out of this experience. magnitude of high? or length of high? (wait longer). if you mean adderall XR and you're looking for the best bang for buck, the option of crushing the beads and snorting the 30 over a period of time (maybe 10mg every couple of hours?) exists... but i would NOT recommend this if you are unaccustomed to this practice. if you're going for a marathon you're basically set taking both orally, almost regardless of the time lapse between the two. i haven't tried XR and vyvanse together but i'd imagine that the peaks and valleys caused by the adderall would be mitigated by the vyvanse which has a much more linear effect, for the most part. 


of course the **best **idea of all is to take the vyvanse alone first, and get a feel for it before you mix (it sounds like you haven't tried them before). but it also sounds like you're limited by supply. ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Urgez your the man, thanks for the quick reply! 

Good points- and good questions. Im guessing IR is generic? And XR is the bead/capsul form? (Im so lazy to research) I used to do up to 100mg of generic, and up to 60mg of XR over a roughly 16H period-(a year ago).

Im definitely a long haul kind of person- the longer I can last the better. Not sure how much Vyvance Im gonna get... Thought it would help me stretch the 30mg of ADRL over a period of about 10+ hours keeping "peeky". Looking to have epiphanies about the universe over that time (which is my usual goal) haha. So Im trying to stay as 'UP' for as long as I can. 

My main concern was how they reacted together since I have never tried Vyvance before.

Dude^ Start with the vyvanse, just one; see how you feel.... then add 10-20mgs of adderall at a time... spaced out by an 1 1/2 for each one. ANd don't go above 30-50 mgs

I found this on vyvanase when I was researching it. Jus got it scripted. 


> yvanse (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate) capsules may be taken whole, or the capsule may be opened and the entire contents dissolved in a glass of water. The solution should be consumed immediately and should not be stored.

Why? Bacteria? is unlikely.


Also


> The dose of a single capsule should not be divided. The contents of the entire capsule should be taken, and patients should not take anything less than one capsule per day.
> 		
> Click to expand...


My doctor said I can open the capsule and take half of it at first if I want and also if I need extra.


Also what's the maximum anyone has ever been one? I started at 50 will got 100 in 2 weeks.


Oh it came from:

ive done 140mg of vyvanse in one day. mind you i had taken a lower dose the day before so my tolerance was up some. if i took a 4 or 5 day break i wouldnt take more than 90mgs in a day just because one time i took 120mgs in a day with a week break before and  had mad panic attacks, paranoia, and almost passed out lol.

I went from a 10 mg dosage of adderall to a 30 mg dosage of vyvanse it says its the same thing but since I have ADHD I would have expected it to help me concentrate just like my adderall. I have been off the adderall for about 2 1/2 weeks because its $154 a month for 30 pills of the lowest dosage. Anyway the vyvanse felt so good but i i did have a stomach ache before I took it and when I got home I went up stairs and shit, I had bad diahreea and normally it burns and stings but this kicked in right before I sat down and shtitting became fun to me. I don't plan on getting addicted but it sure is a good way to have fun!!

Here is what I did while experimenting with turning vyvanse into dexamph.


Put it in lemon juice and slight amount of vinegar. Boiled it for about half an hour.


It's definitely dex amp. Kicked it 15-20 minutes later.


I did this based on reading about how to break a peptide bond. One way is an enzyme and the other is boiling in strong acid for 24 hours. I was hoping that some cleavage will be done with my method and it seems that it worked.


Oh and the talk about lemon juice being acidic so it slows down the absorption of amphetamines seems to be wrong from what I read. It actually turns alkaline in the stomach.

do you have a source for the boiling thing? sounds very interesting and quite simple. also after you boil it do you just drink it?

**OMG, question about Vyvanse.**


Ok so I take around 130-150 mg by parachuting it at around 1 p.m no later than 3 p.m iv noticed, right now I'ma try a lil bit earlier to dose BECAUSE although through out tha whole day I'm pretty upbeat, concentrated & tweaaked ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) But when it starts getting around 10 or 11 I personally start feeling it to dissapear quickly (atleast those obvious main effects). So while around 12 I'm feeling tha comedown & yes it sucks a little bit but not bad, so few mins or so into 12 I pop 1mg Lorazepam (knowing it helps with comedowns-sleep) then wait 30 mins or so & im laying down trying to go to sleep peacefully but either my eye lids slooowly open themselves up without me trying or I just lay there ina kinda awake-sleep state but its not sleep at all, so i quickly dissolved .5 or 1mg more lorzepam to do tha trick.. but nope.. still laying awake all night. Even more to my frustration last night was IN between tha 2.5mgs of lorazepam I took, I slipped 6mg MELATONIN pills ( 2 3mg's) .. Stiill nothing satisfying, about an hour or two sleep here n I will always keep waking up, ugh .


**Sorry for tha long backstory but finally my question is WHY IN THA BLUE HELL Is vyvanse lasting so damn long& preventing me from sleeping decently, even chewing up benzos & natural sleep aids ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) ?? Is it the moderatley high dose I take, for recreational? 


P.S. Also, would it possibly be better to spread out my full Vyvanse dose, maybe couple hours apart (like starting hour 1 after tha first dose kicks in) would that give me tha best out of it ? Thank youuu**

Vyvanse is a pro-drug for dextroamphetamine (a.k.a. Dexedrine, d-amphetamine, dexamphetamine, etc).  Because your body has to convert the Vyvanse into dextroamphetamine before you feel effects, spacing out your doses will probably make it last even longer than it is now.  


Vyvanse does, by its nature, last a really long time.  I wouldn't recommend taking it in the afternoon, it was designed to last all day and into the evening (think going to school or work for 8-9 hours and then doing homework afterwords, etc).

Yeah Iv read up about that, supposedly to last 12 hours max but I guess with huge doses that may increase :/  Only reason because, I usually wake up around 11a.m 12p.m cuz its Suuummer guys ![(:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) & I usually go outside with friends or do sum tasks so being focused, concentrated & feelin tweaked is great then, dont think being tweaked out stuck inside would be that much fun ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Not a problem man.  And yes, it is going to last longer as you increase the dosage.

What is the best method of administration for increasing the potentiation of vyvanse? Would letting it settle in 100 degree water help degrade some of the fillers in the powder? Then drinking the water after about 40 minutes?


I know changing your stomach PH is a way...

If you read the patent literature on lisdexamfetamine, you'll see that they boiled it in concentrated HCl for 24+ hours and reported no significant degradation into amphetamine. Its actually a pretty interesting read, they did all sorts of stuff to lisdex and the molecule stayed intact through it all (strong acids, bases, extreme temperatures, etc). I'm fairly convinced that the only way to liberate amphetamine from lisdexamfetamine is through enzymatic catalysis. 


I highly doubt boiling in lemon juice and vinegar would liberate any bound amphetamine at all; I always feel vyvanse kick in within 15 minutes, there's plenty of trypsin in the small intestine so the conversion should happen quickly. I bet if you ran some analysis on that soln it would have shown up as 100% lisdex.

is itpossible to use l-tyrosine to cleave off the l-lysine?

I'm prescribed 70mgs Vyvanse once a day and it takes about an hour and a half to start feeling an increase in focus. I took 140mgs yesterday and still felt the same as 70mgs. Its a very subtle stimulant imo and is definitely better addiction wise(almost impossible to abuse) compared to the other ADD meds out there. If you're looking for a rush and nice euphoria, turn the other way lol. But if you are legitimately looking for an increase in focus/concentration w/o the speedy stim feeling, then its a pretty good choice.

Of course not, tyrosine is just an amino acid. 


I'm not aware of any simple compound capable of cleaving d-amp from lisdex. The cleavage only takes place in the presence of the serine endopeptidase called trypsin, which is the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the hydrolysis of peptide bonds in positively-charged residues like lysine.

I'm new so sorry if I'm not doing this right, but I have tried a handful  of different add meds. Adderal used to be my favorite until I started having horrible.side effects such as picking at my face to the point of permanently scaring it, going absolutely crazy psychotic and delusional, massive crippling panic attacks, etc. I recently started Vyvanse and I love it . It gets the job done and it just feels like so much more of a cleaner high. I can sleep at night on it. I can eat, although my appetite is a little decreased but at least I can eat a descent amount. With adderal I could not eat anything. So definately theraputicly(yes I know that's not spelled right) imo it is the best add med, but if your looking to abuse and get all "thwacked out" It's not the best. And yes I have abused the s*it out of these meds but currently I am taking them as directed and I have been very satisfied. If heaven forbid one of my children were to get diagnosed with ADHD and I had no other option but to put them on meds I would definately recommend Vyvanse. And of course I'm not a Dr and I don't know a whole lot I'm just speaking from my own experience with taking these meds. I doubt it did but I hope it did possibly help someone. Thanks for taking The time to read this, sorry its kinda long![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

The first time I took Vyvanse, I ingested 2 50mg pills and... I was GONE. I was literally jogging in place, as I took a shower, because I couldn't stand still. At no point in my life have I ever felt the desire to just run. The euphoria was insane, on par with an MDMA experience. I've never had a more enjoyable experience on any prescription Amphetamine. I'm not sure what happened with you, but I definitely prefer Vyvanse over anything else.

K so this is my first time posting on here.. dont even know if im doing it right so sorry if im not. Im a 19 year old girl and i got 40 mg vyvanse from my friend when she was done with her perscription. im pretty small.. 5'3'' and 112 pounds. i took on this morning for my exam around 8:30 and it worked great and i feel awesome. Wondering if it would be bad idea to take another one now to study for the rest of my exams better. This isnt my first time taking a stimulant but it is my first time taking any kind of adhd/add medicine.

How can i potentiate vyvanse after ingesting it? or cant i? i feel like the effects have lessened not gone away on my fourth day of taking it. maybe its because i took it and went back to sleep so im still kinda waking up? any vitamins or maybe pepto? I have prometh DM i know dxm reverses tolerance or do i need to go get pure dxm? and when should i take the dxm?

I've gotten away with eight-hundred mgs over the course of a day, with only a little previous amphetamine experience.  I think you could get away with 200 mg at once.  I was doing 150 at once, repeated with about another 100 once it kicked in, throughout the day.  Not very wise in my opinion, but I got away with it.


One of my favorite experiences with Vyvanse was when I ingested 100-150 mg. and went right to sleep.  I woke up feeling an awesome dopamine release that reminded me in ways of waking up to the effects of MDMA.  It was lovely.  I only wish I had a woman with me at the time.  I may have actually potentiated the effects this time though.  I took an antacid some time before ingesting the Vyvanse.  I don't know if that increased the effects or not.

anyone whose prescribed vyvanse, can you tell me if you've felt as if your craving for other drugs has diminished? Maybe its just me, but I havent realy even wanted to do anything else really, even some of my favorites. Just want to know if anyone else experienced this.

^

its cause Shire pharm reps are pushing doctors hard to switch over to their new cash cow.. i cant deny its a well designed medication, but its not for everyone. frankly i was prescribed vyvanse first, but bullshit it lasts 10-12 hours maybe its in your SYSTEM for that long. but vyvanse has a much worse comedown than adderall for me, to the point where i was having massive mood swings towards the tail end of my work day. i got adderall booster prescribed honestly the vyvanse is just an after thought for me as it kinda works behind the scenes while the adderall gives me that kick that im used to. 


the only way to potentiate vyvanse, short of all that cleaving nonsense, is to alkalize your blood through pH balancing diets (lots of greens and disgusting stuff, no thanks lol)

I need to take this stuff for my ADD, but the doctor is stubborn and won't adjust my dose properly...


...So, I set out, did a LOT of research, and learned some tricks to boost the efficacy of my normal dose.


**My understanding is this:

**

Vyvanse is a pro-drug.  This means it must be metabolized in your gut by various digestive enzymes in the liver.  These enzymes are commonly called "protease", and there are more that act on the chemical its-self.  There are only so many digestive enzymes in your gut at any one time, serving as a "capper", and creating a ceiling effect.  This is partially why it is extended release, because the Vyvanse molecule MUST be altered in order for it to become psychoactive.  In simple terms:  Each molecule has to wait their turn in line before the Vyvanse is turned into Dextroamphetamine.


So, logically, I went to go buy some **digestive enzymes** from the local walmart to take with the Vyvanse!


Lo and behold, it helped!  A lot, too!  I was taking 40mg with little effect before I did this.  Taking the digestive enzymes (one capsule 30 minutes before, and one capsule at the same time as taking the Vyvanse), and I noticed a MARKED improvement in onset.  I was thrilled with the results, actually.  Please be weary of crappy digestive enzymes.  Many vendors will sell low-grade stuff which doesn't work too well.


The above is one seemingly good way to make this stuff work better.  I'll share a few more.


**Magnesium** seems to slow tolerance to most all amphetamines, or so I have read and experienced, including the dextroamphetamine in Vyvanse.  I have a bottle of high quality magnesium tablets that I take, once an hour beforehand (in the morning), and once while consuming the Vyvanse.  This seems to me to help quite a lot with lengthening the effective time of the medicine.


**Anything acidic in terms of orangejuice or vinegar will destroy the Vyvanse.**  This is critical and important to remember.  The way Vyvanse is taken out of the blood stream is about 30-50% excretion from the bladder and the rest through other means.  If your bladder is acidic, (or indeed your body in general is acidic), the vyvanse will be processed and removed from your system much faster.  In short, anything acid is the enemy of ADD medicines, and will shorten duration and intensity.  So if you want to get the most out of your medicine, avoid them!


*******If I want to get to sleep and the medicine is still working, I drink a glass of lemonade to get rid of the medicine in my blood.


**I also consume a spoon-full of baking soda.** I dose this the same as I do the Magnesium.  This ties in with the acid avoidance tip, except it is the exact inverse!  The more "basic" or alkaline your urine/body becomes, the harder it is for your body to excrete the medication.  I try to tend towards alkaline foods in the morning to promote the Vyvanse, skipping the OJ, and start eating more acidic foods later in the evening to get rid of it so I can sleep.  This increases the strength, (I'm roughly guessing, here), by about 20-35%.  It also extends the medication's coverage for another two hours.


I do hope I helped some of the people who aren't seeing what they would like to get out of Vyvanse as far as symptom control.  These tips helped me A LOT, and my ADD symptoms are mastered.  If this helped someone else, I am happy to have spent a while writing this.


But be warned to those who want to use these tips to abuse Vyvanse and "get high":  You are on a road to destruction. :^/

you are RIGHT in saying that Adderall fucks you up better than Vyvanse, but the reason most people think this way is because most people take these kind of drugs as "Study drugs" or just to make school more fun.  Adderall IS stronger, but it lasts much shorter and is much more tweakier IME.  Both are great drugs, but IMO Vyvanse is for school/projects and Adderall is for mixing with other drugs/partying

Oh, and another thing:


Vyvanse was incredibly useful in Opiate Withdrawal for me.  I know this may sound counter-intuitive with it being a stimulant, and one might think that it might make all of the symptoms of withdrawal 10x worse.  But it seemingly doesn't.


It just so happened that I had to get off the pain medicine from a recent back problem/surgery about the same time as I was placed on the Vyvanse.  That, and the doctor was unwilling to prescribe me the Vyvanse as long as I had the prescription for Oxycodone.  I was on the Oxycodone for about 5 months for a spinal problem at 30mg a day.  I hate to admit it, but I was starting to crave the Oxycodone.


Anyways, I ended the painkillers practically cold-turkey and started right off the next day with Vyvanse.  Not one single craving.  Not one single withdrawal symptom except for clammy hands and some minor aches in my legs.


I thought I would just throw that out there.  Might help someone somewhere. *shrug*

The ultra-realistic dreams started happening right away. For example, I'd have a Technicolor dream of being somewhere else -- a motel maybe -- and get up in the middle of the night thinking I had to check out and attend some special event.

Be really careful upping your benzo dosage -- they are one of the most addictive drugs and take forever to taper. I started the Ambien recently to supplement the benzos. Maybe I'll be able to taper the benzos and still get some sleep due to the Ambien. In the meantime, I'll see you in my dreams!

Nevertheless we all need a break once in a while so . . . The orthopedic surgeon wrote me for 90 Norco 10/325s plus two refills. Let's just say the the right dosage, at the right times, of Vyvanse/Norco/Temazepam can make your day a pleasant one from beginning to end.

And yes, I too have had some very odd things happen while on both ambien and Vyvance  I, personally, believe they interact.  If I don't go immediately to sleep after I take the ambien, I start to hallucinate and my eyes go crossed. :^/


I have used Ambien for a long time, and never before had I experienced hallucinations like that untill I was put on Vyvanse.

These enzymes are commonly called "protease", and there are more that act on the chemical its-self. There are only so many digestive enzymes in your gut at any one time, serving as a "capper", and creating a ceiling effect. This is partially why it is extended release, because the Vyvanse molecule MUST be altered in order for it to become psychoactive. In simple terms: Each molecule has to wait their turn in line before the Vyvanse is turned into Dextroamphetamine

Vyvanse isn't metabolized in the gut by trypsin like you'd think. It is converted to dextroamphetamine by the hydrolytic action of red blood cells. That's why monkeys/humans liked IV lisdexamfetamine. And why the DEA made it schedule II. You want to turn it into dextroamphetamine, leave it in some blood. Not these digestive enzymes.


Really vyvanse is fucking pointless since it's schedule II. Clobenzorex, and benzphetamine are cheaper prodrugs for dexamp and dexmeth. IV adderall/dexedrine isn't a problem in the first place.Shire is solving a problem that doesn't exist. It just another cash cow for shire now that Adderall XR is generic, which also was no real advancement above Biphetamine(10mg amphetamine and 10mg dextroamphetamine in an ion-exchange resin, the famous black beauties) Desoxyn gradumet or Dexedrine Spansule. Hell adderall is an irrational combination of different amphetamine salts with no advantage over dexedrine.

A dirty little secret is lisdexamphetamine isn't extended release. lisdextroamphetamine's(opps, i mean lisdexamfetamine, can't have people thinking it's speed) half life is less than 1 hour, and it peaks in 1 hour. blood levels of lisdexamfetamine 'low and transient' and gone in 8 hours.

Who's willing to bet shire will 'discover' Vyvanse XR right when the patent of Vyvanse expires?

Er, I am confused.  Everywhere I read that it is metabolized in the "small intestines" by an enzyme excreted from the pancreas.  Such was my understanding.  *confused*


Like my physician told me a few weeks ago when I started: 


"Vyvanse is the middle road I am willing to go, here.  All of those other medicines end up being shoved where the son don't shine or pushed into a vein with a needle.  No.  I only prescribe Vyvanse because of it's abuse proof qualities, meaning it can't be used any other way than the way I WANT them to, which is not getting high, and having control over their add".


You mention that the enzyme is in the blood, so why then aren't people shooting it up and all manner if other illicit uses?


Do not mistake my intentions here as rude. I love to further understand these things for fun. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

What you've witness is the power of Madison Avenue marketing. My doctor, who chastized me for smoking marijuana and being an all around druggie, was all like Vyvanse is fucking great, meth/weed is bad. The reason is because Shire has brainwashed everyone into thinking Vyvanse actually represents an advance in ADD treatment. Why take risks and spend billions on new shit that probably won't work when you can tweak(ha!) an already effective drug, the 130 year old amphetamine, then advertise and promote the shit out of it, and make just as much money.  The theory in developing lisdexamphetamine was that it would be broken down by trypsin and it could be only taken orally, and even then there'd be a ceiling dose that would overwhelm the trypsin. However if you look at the FDA approved prescribing information([http://pi.shirecontent.com/PI/PDFs/Vyvanse_USA_ENG.pdf](http://pi.shirecontent.com/PI/PDFs/Vyvanse_USA_ENG.pdf)), under clinical pharmacology and drug abuse and dependance, you'll see that lisdexamfetamine is metabolized by the blood cells quite rapidly and primates including humans liked IV lisdexamfetamine, not as much as IV coke or plain dextroamphetamine, but still way more than placebo.


It's not suprising Shire is doing this scam, they did the same thing with adderall. The mixed salts in Adderall were supposed to have a different absorbtion rates. But if you look at the prescribing info for Adderall([http://www.rxlist.com/adderall-drug.htm](http://www.rxlist.com/adderall-drug.htm)) and compare it to plain old dexedrine([http://www.rxlist.com/dexedrine-drug.htm](http://www.rxlist.com/dexedrine-drug.htm)) you'll see both had similar half-lives and similar peaks in 3 hours. They probably mixed dextroamphetamine with amphetamine to copy the infamous Biphetamine, which was a very popular street drug from the 60's-80's. Hell the levoamphetamine probably only adds side effects, no suprise adderall was once pulled off the market in Canada and other countries.


As to why nobody has shoot it, I'm almost certain someone has, just no ones posted about it on the internet yet. Really the kind of people who would slam it would rather get meth/coke. The average tweaker does more methamphetamine in a day then the maximium medical doses of amphetamine in a month.An ADD script isn't going to replace your dealer. Adderall isn't much of a street drug, it's shit college students take to balance work, party and study and to counteract fatigue from all that and sleep depravation, not so much to get high. Not many people IV adderall/dexedrine either, even though you could. It won't be great like IV dexedrine, probably won't have much of a rush, but it would feel stronger. I'd probably be like IV codeine, stronger but no rush like morphine.


But Vyvanse isn't the only prodrug of amphetamine. There are TONS, all generic so there's no money in studying them for ADD.Clobenzorex, Fenethylline, Amphetaminil, benzphetamine, dimethylamphetamine, fenproporex, mefenorex, phendimetrazine(not an amphetamine but similar), the list goes on. Prodrugs of amphetamine isn't an original idea. Many probably got lower abuse potential than lisdexamphetamine.

At no point in my life have I ever felt the desire to just run. The euphoria was insane, on par with an MDMA experience. I've never had a more enjoyable experience on any prescription Amphetamine.

I am prescribed 100mg Vyvanse ( two 50's) as a first starting dose. He seems to think that because vyvanse is studies in children and young teens, that 70mg would be the highest dose for a healthy clinical response in teens around 13. He lead me to think 140mg is the limit. I totally feel vyvanse and all day too.

Adderall IS stronger, but it lasts much shorter and is much more tweakier IME.  Both are great drugs, but IMO Vyvanse is for school/projects and Adderall is for mixing with other drugs/partying

Adderall isn't any "stronger" than Vyvanse, but it does take effect significantly faster--how much so is dependent on MoA--and is more potent per-mg since it's not ~75% non-psychoactive like the composition of Vyvanse.


When you look past the inactive fluff used for time release, and get down to the "active ingredients", Vyvanse is hands down going to be more potent than Adderall's racemic mixture of "amphetamine salts". To oversimplify things, d-amp is the isomer that causes the characteristic amphetamine effects and euphoria related with increased dopamine levels, while l-amp tends to be relatively non-dopaminergic and for the most part, just increases norepinephrine levels resulting in more peripheral effects like increased heart rate, etc. [This post](http://h2sampk.com/tag/dl-amphetamine/) regarding the presence of l-amp in ADD/ADHD medications goes over some basic talking point of the matter.


While dosing for Adderall is easier to manage, the straight d-amp from Vyvanse is going to produce a cleaner, smoother high with less pronounced negative effects. I've concluded that, as for my preference, the trade-off of Adderall's faster peak plasma levels and more convenient dosing, is well worth it for the vastly preferable, and longer lasting, effects of Vyvanse.


I took 210mg earlier tonight, so with the conversion factor of 0.2948 lisdexamfetamine->dextro-amphetamine, the end result is roughly 60mg of d-amp. This dose of Vyvanse is far preferable to any of my past forays into the realm of heavy (100mg+) doses of Adderall. I can actually catch a nice smooth buzz without getting all jittery and yucked out feeling like the d/l-amp mixture.

I much prefer vyvanse to adderall O.O


I find 60mg of adderall just makes me fucking cracked out and tweaking. 100mg of vyvanse (approx equi-dose) however provides me a NICE euphoric, mentally and physically stimulated high, which generally lasts 8-10 hours. All of which are nothing but FEEL GOOD. With Adderall I get cracked out to shit for 8 hours then i get greeted with a pounding headache and extreme tiredness almost instantaneously. (i.e. no comedown, go from hero to zero in no time at all)

Hehe, sounds all too familiar. A few years back I had a couple instances where I tried to get "spun" via huge doses of Adderall, and trying to achieve a meth-like high was pretty much totally unpossible. =_=;  I got up to about 280mg or so on the second attempt and I just ended up being all cracked out for ~30hrs while feeling physically sick and sporting a stubborn headache the whole time. Never wanted to try to get high on mixed amphet salts again after that...

If only dexies were more easily found in my area! As a self-proclaimed aficionado of fine stimulants—and veteran of many-year, nasty IV meth habit—I can safely say that dextroamphetamine is effectively my favorite stimulant right behind 4-MAR, which seems to be extinct these days. I've been thrilled to have found 70mg Vyvanse in large quantities a few times over the past year. They're basically a XR Dexidrine with some extra baggage (the relatively low dosage ceiling, variables involving enzyme cleaving, etc), but I'll take their smooth, clean, composed buzz over methamp or cocaine any day. Well, at least for the purpose of just riding a stimulant buzz à la carte, but if opiods are involved and I've got IV gear involved anyhow, I lean back towards coke and meth when shooting.

I am a stimulant abuser, but i recently realise that i might have been tryin to medicated my self so i went to the psych doc and considering its been 11month i'm fully sober(no alcool either) he prescribe my Vyvanse. It works...for half a day (30mg) than i get a lil down but i recently realise that drinkin a coffe help me gettin my day done at least. Im going to the doc next week to give them my 4week review , and considering that they not i am an addict i fell akward to tell them that i think i might need a lil 10mg more. I also have this habit of eating so FAST that i was wondering if maybe my systeme get rid of the L-lysine faster. However i read 20 page of the thread and im surprise to see ppl sayin they need 70mg or 100mg...you really need that much?! i have been takin meth and amp for several years and i really dont see how revelant it is to take that much vyvanse!?!? Since i started i always took only one a day and im planning on being a good boy because this could be one of the key for my hardtime working in society but i worry that i might get use to it and end up takin 70mg a day me too


-Sorry for my poor english

peace

I am feeling that vyvanse is not working the way it was before and not lasting more than 7 hours. I'm taking 70mgs (the highest per pill). Its very sad cause it is the only thing that really helped me with my adhd and my motivation/depression. I'm going to ask my dr to up my dose, maybe 100mgs? I hope it gets lil stronger and last more. Would apreciate your opinions. I don't have the option for boosters cause I live in Brazil and here we only have concerta, ritalin or vyvanse. And Ritalin/concerta doesnt work at all. So any help would be great. thank you guys.

Skibler, do you take 120 all at once or you spread them. if so, how do you "manage" it, I mean how long you wait for the second dose. And if you take all at once, does it last longer enough?

I sometimes take 140mgs at onces and I think it lasts maybeee a little bit longer, but taking it all once just gives me more intense effects throughout the day. But idk about lasting longer, I tend to always take mine pretty late in the day anyway around 1pm but I can usually sleep by 12.


I get extreme dry mouth from vyvanse, which isn't uncommon to my knowledge.


And idk about anyone else, but if I take my dose and then sleep until it kicks in, it's really awkward and strange waking up lol. Not sure how to explain that one.

do these feelings of high tend to continue after long-term use or not? I know there is tolerance, but even with it can I still feel a burst of motivation along with focus or the magic fades away. With ritalin and coke I never produced tolerance though

The cotton mouth is completely unbearable for me on vyvanse. Today at school while on 180mgs i could not get enough liquids to reduce the dryness. The taste left by the dry mouth is what gets me though. IMO its the worse taste ive experienced in the longest time.


As for dosing before sleep i feel the same. Last night i set an alarm for 4 A.M. woke up to the alarm and parachuted 150mgs then fell back asleep. At about 6 i felt the effects and abruptly woke up with the oddest feeling.. almost like i had slept for weeks and my body had gotten the fullest rest possible along with lots of head tingles. This set my day up for a productive attitude ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I wonder if Vyvanse is a better choice for subtle, background ADD relief over Dextroamphetamine Extended Release Spansules, which I use to give me a steady level of medication for 8-12 hours at a time. I've never tried it since dextroamphetamine seems so much simpler and more reliable.

^ 50mg of Vyvanse a day is actually a perfect amount, as strong as 16.7-20mg of d-amp over 8 hours, so good choice on not increasing it.


If I ever tried Vyvanse I think 40-50mg would be a perfect dosage for me. I should really try it, as I try very hard to keep plasma levels consistent with Dextroamphetamine, which is a lot easier using the ER spansules over the IR tabs, but still requires a lot of conscious effort and attention. I would really like to take one capsule of 40-50mg in the morning and be done with it.

i started with 20mg ans increased it 10mg per month until now...the addict inside of me have the tendancy to think that the effect wear off at the same time that the ''uphoria'' but i have to remember my self the real reason why im takin it...so i decided to wait until im actually building a tolerence before increasing it.

This is totally how I am honestly. Once the 70mgs stopped giving me euphoria and such, I was like oh! Time to double it. And then eventually that euphoria ceases and I have to stop taking it for a few days to get any type of effect. But honestly, it does help with the ADHD regardless of euphoria or not.

I'm just a bit worried about when I start college again in the fall that I'll have a super tolerance or something since I've been on it since December now.

whats the best way to prevent nausea while taking vyvanse? I usually eat before I take it, and stay hydrated. Is this all I can really do? I usually take 60mgs and I don't have much experience with stims. Thanks.

If you get nauseous while on any stim, you're most likely over doing it...try a lower dosage maybe? I've also heard that low dose Benadryl can help with nausea, but I'm not a 100% on that one, if anyone can verify that that'd be cool lol.

How do I lower my tolerance to this shit BESIDES taking Magnesium supplements. I have not taken it for four days now, and have exercised (weigh training) every day, along with restful sleep and healthy diet. When I take my next dose on monday (6 days off of it) will the effects be more pronounced? Any suggestions? Thanks guys

Why is chelated magnesium not an option? Have you looked into low dose dextromethorphan?

is it normal for vyvanse to hit you in waves?  i took about 45mg an after about an hour it hit me hard... felt jittery/increased heart rate/sweaty etc.. .then it went away and about 30 minutes later it came back... like in waves... i got the impression this drug was supposed to be a smooth, clean ride. no?


also, in what way is vyvanse extended release?  is it E-R because the d-amp isn't active until the l-lysine is removed or even after the l-lysine is removed not all of the d-amp gets into one's bloodstream all at once?   it feels like in my experience today the d-amp hit me all at once (around the 1 hour mark post-ingestion).


also... kinda late to ask now but is 30mg fluoxetine + 250ug of buprenorphine going to be OK to combine with vyvanse?


on drugs.com interaction checker it says mixing SSRIs with amphetamines is dangerous and is a risk for serotonin syndrome.  how likely is this?  it said one women stopped prozac and a week later took 1 dose of phentermine and got jittery, confused, stomach cramps, etc.  i'm experiencing those except not really confusion... should i be concerned or is it just jitteriness from a high dose of amphetamine that i took after not taking any amps in years?


also... vyvanse is making me slightly queasy/nauseous and its making me sh!t my brains out... safe to take 2mg loperamide?

I dont get how that guy cant sleep for 48 hours after a single dose. For me it prooves the vyvanse placebo 12hr bullshit. for me its just a delaying release drug. I mean, my body convert all in 1-2 hours so it takes time to kick but comes strong, peaks high and lasts 3-4 hours only.

for exemple, eat lots of fatty foods and then take a IR dexedrine = Vyvanse ©

Vyvanse is, in my opinion, the best drug for treating narcolepsy/add on the market. The way it is absorbed keeps tolerance from building rapidly and keeps a person moving for the full span of the work day. IR type medications, I feel, are better for producing creative works and school assignments during a short period of time.

IT seems to me that this drug affects people more differently than any one i've seen. When I take it, it works for exactly three hours, followed by two-three hours of a comedown. After that I am completely normal and can eat/sleep. Other people I know that have taken it are up for 12-14 hours, some for 8, some for 20+.....

In my experience with vyvanse (first amp ever had, would dose 150-200mg) I get a comeup to begin after the 1hr mark, end up peaking for 3-4 hours but it seems like there's multiple mini peaks like it comes in waves. Here is a related image suggesting that [http://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0028390812003437-gr2.jpg](http://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0028390812003437-gr2.jpg)


After it peaks for however long and is no longer going to peak anymore, I have the longest comedown. I can still feel the dopamine uptake for hours, steadily for a long time then  it very very slowly begins to wear off. I'll still feel like there's a bit of dopamine uptake 18-20 hours later.


At first I thought vyvanse wasn't a preffered form of amp, but I've grown to like the extended experience. I dont really enjoy drugs or ROAs that have a quick absorbtion and then a peak then comedown. Smoking weed is similar in that respect too. I always cook it for the strong extended long high.


I'm still up and feeling it some from 150mg I took at 10pm last night. 8:30 now. The most I've taken before all at once was 200mg, but one time I took 100mg and then another 150mg a hour or so after the first dose began to kick in. That double dose was quite strong, I was using it to get through a 3 day period of kratom withdrawals. I've been told by my friend who studies chemistry that amphetamines are quite toxic. I could really feel that in the double dose I took. I was tweaked and enjoyed it, but my body felt very unhealthy and I'd get random twinges and minor pains randomly around my body. I remember my left testicle would twinge with a pretty decent amount of pain at random intervals, and that persisted until 2.5-3days later. I also stayed up for 3 days that double dose and got my first taste of sleep deprived amp hallucinations. It's interesting territory, I'd like to explore and research it more, but it's just not worth the excessive stress on my body. I guess a taste of that is enough. I wouldn't dose that high again. 150mg seems like plenty to have fun and not overdo it. Perhaps I'd try dosing a second time 12 or more hours after dosing previously.


Nitrous chargers go very well with amps! Heh... sorry for my poorly organized thoughts. Was speedin up all night blasting bass music the whole time (which feels amazing on the body).


Edit: I forgot to mention, this last night where I took 150mg was the first time I experienced any significant teeth grinding. My teeths are a bit sore this morning, I'm very sure this teeth grinding was brought on by sitting out at night in my car (missing a window) and the shivers/tightness from the cold temperature promoted teeth grinding.

For harm reduction, try 50 mg of magnium for stimulant-induced teeth grinding (bruxism). It works well. Also, bruxism is very bad for your teeth. You can chip your teeth, and basically file down your teeth in a noticable way, and it can cause cavities (by causing gum recession, according to my dentist, an expert on it). Use a night guard. You'll want what is the most expensive kind, which is from a dentist, and very hard (although I've heard from one person with a cheap dentist that received a soft version. Don't use that). It costs $400 or so for it, and I imagine that means the dentist marks it up the standard retail markup of 50% (or is it 100%?)


Vyvanse for me is a miracle. When i am orescribed short-acting stims, I do not try to get high, or get high by accident, even, but I do have a habit of taking more than prescribed to complete an essay or study for classes. This ineviably means I must spend a week or two without any stimulants, which severely affects my grades. On Vyvanse, I don't take more than prescribed, since it stops metabolizing after 200mg anyhow, and besides, I don't enjoy insomnia, so I am not tempted to re-dose after 7 AM.


140 mg of Vyvanse equals 60mg of Adderall XR, which is what Adderall dose works for me. But even though my current doc prescribes me Adderall 20mg 3x/day (60mg/day), she will not prescribe me more than 70mg of Vyvanse, because that's what is the"maximum dose" in the PDR.


my insurance, however, prior authorized me for up to 170mg. So I'm switching to a clinic that focuses on AD/HD (a hospital, repuable clinic) on the hopes they'll me more sympathetic. I want to get it together and not suffer withdrawals from taking more than prescribed of Adderall early in th month. Taking more than prescribed of an amphetamine is the most absurd thing ever, because you're just guaranteeing withdrawal for when the bottle is emptied out, and who wans that? I don't understand why anyone would desire that. I'm trying to get better, and I hope some in this thread try to as well.

I was taking 30 mgs of Adderal IR throughout the day for depression and ADD, however the nightly comedown would cause me to feel suicidal, binge-eat and fight with my boyfriend which is definitely not what I want. I don't have insurance (or a job, being a full-time student takes enough out of me) so Adderal XR was out of the question. Shire has a patient assistance program for Vyvanse and after some paperwork and laziness on my part, I got the free drug card. Unfortunately, it can only be used to prescribe the medication for usage once a day. My doctor switched me from 30mgs of Adderal IR to 30mgs of Vyvanse. From what I have read she pretty much decreased my Adderall amount. It makes a huge difference. Gone is any of the anxiety, but I'm also about ready to go to bed at 5PM. I spoke with her on the phone and she told me to take some Adderal IR in the afternoons which is sort of problematic with my whole eating schedule (which I didn't discuss with her). I took about 15mgs of Adderal IR about an hour ago to finish my homework/stay awake and as of now, it's just getting my digestive system kicking. Anyway my doctor told me to think about how much we should increase the Vyvanse (I'm straight up thinking 30 mgs, to 60 mgs because taking two seems to get me through the day) but I am worried I may seem "pill hungry". I currently have prescriptions for 2 anti-anxiety medicines, 1 muscle relaxer, 2 stim prescriptions (sort of) and some Prozac.

you can definitely feel the effects over 200mg. at first anyway. The length of time its taken whether its as perscribed for a week or nonstop for 2 or so days, tolerance builds fast and the effects of vyvanse can be dramatically lowered no matter how many you take to try and boost it back up. After being up for 30 hours it becomes depressingly clear that the first dose high that's being chased is never coming back...until the next perscription, that is.  MY question is, IS there anyone out there that has taken and can tolerate crazy high doses of vyvanse?  I'm talking about 800-1000 mg within a 30 hour period... and still going??? also, Sadly neglected to get any kind of potentiator.

So I took 140 mg of vyvanse for the very 1st time and felt nothing. Just my heart rate went up and my blood pressure, but no focus or energy, nor any "high".  Da fuq is up with that?! All I keep reading online is about ppl who took like 60mg and got focused, energetic and high...

800mg-1g over 30 hours is really a ton. I get what you're asking but that seems a bit extreme, seems like you'd have to have a high tolerance to be doing something like that.


 As for your question, I don't take stims very often, but I have access to vyvanse and sometimes will take it recreationally. With pretty much no tolerance, I'd take 150-200mg and just be really high all night and still be high and slowly coming down the next day. I really prefer the extended-release mechanics of vyvanse. It would really linger around in me and I typically have trouble falling asleep.  I wouldn't typically redose at all since I would be up for like 2 days from taking the one dose. 


I have 'bumped' by redosing after the initial dose, but I'd rather not extend the duration of the entire thing. I feel like being up for 2 days for getting high on a drug is a lot to set aside just for just getting high. So I don't do it very often and I don't have any craving or desire to do it again anytime soon. I'm like that with most hard drugs. I sure do enjoy it a lot the times I do indulge though.

I have been on psychostimulants for many years,i believe since I was nine or ten.  I an now eighteen. I have been on such a myriad of different medications that I could barely begin to recite all of them (sarcasm, but really I have been on a shitload of different formulations/types of speed. In response to the above stated question, I have taken RIDICULOUS amounts of both adderall and vyvanse in a relatively short time period.  This is going to be an extraordinary feat so read on to be amazed.


I was in seventh or eighth grade, and an avid world of warcraft (WoW) player. I'd noticed that I had trouble sleeping when I took it, (i already stayed up until 5 am to get the most play time in and be able to farm materials for gold when theres few others doing so) so I went to the medicine cabinet and got my 90 day scripts of addy and vyvanse (my doc was the shit when it came to prescribing meds) and since I'd been on them for around 5 yrs I had a tolerance, so I started out taking several of each. Enticed by how elevated my playing ability was, and my level of alertness, I continued taking several every few hours, loving the amazing rush that speed gives (i have an incredibly addicting personality, I would later end up using heroin by age 16). 


It was the summer and my dad traveled 5 days a week year round, and I was a very rebellious adolescent, so my mother left me be. Two days, dozens of 30mg adderall and 50 mg vyvanse in, I.went to my friends house to have a WoW get together, and subsequently brought the pills. I noticed that after a few days, I was at a constant peak due to redosing. At about day five, I started to have lapses in time. While my friends slept (i offered them some of the miracle pills but they said no) I would play like a fanatic and eat the speed faster than my body could process it, and would unknowingly black out and come to several hours later for a brief period of time with new items and giving people advice to people on how they specced  incorrectly. I'm amazed now how at age thirteen and fourteen I was able to have highly intellectual conversations with fully grown adults, this drug really is powerful, and I fully believe it to to be a super-drug.


This continued for three and a half days, and totalled eight and a half days. I do not recall a great majority of it, but I passed out after taking shots of vodka and drinking beer (one of my first drinking experiences) and laying down. I fell asleep on a monday at 8am, I remember this only because my friends parents left for work, and woke up on thursday with an annihilated immune system. Upon returning home I took even more pills and after one more night of gaming, felt horribly ill and went to sleep. When I woke I had a horrid cough and was taken to the doctor. I was diagnosed with severe pneumonia and had to be put on a bronchilator (spelling) right before my family and I went on vacation to california. In conclusion, this is an awe inspiring drug, both adderall and vyvanse, but if abused enough has severe repercussions.


I am now eighteen, as previously stated, and that was my first, yet unintended abusing of drugs. I have since became fascinated with psychoactives, and have done extensive research on all drugs (erowid is a close "friend" and I have subsequently used a great deal of hard and exotic drugs, which first began when I took MDMA at age 15. I abused MDMA like I did my meds and it has lost its magic. This continued when I smoked methamphetamine a week after I turned sixteen, and used various 2C-b,e,i phenenthylamines, and my current drug of choice is heroin. 


In conclusion, when it comes to euphoria, adderall IR is in my opinion the clear champion for those with a significant tolerance to stimulant drugs. 2 30mg adderall IR get me well through a school day (5 hours) and vyvanse not giving me any euphoria, just a generic"speedy" feeling. I'm currently on 150mg vyvanse, and it is great for concentration, as I've never articulated that ordeal in such detail, or ever had the patience to do so, but I as an addict, love that rush I get from adderall IR. 


I probably took in upwards of one or two thousand mgs of them, albeit there were invariably some times when I missed the usual dosing pattern during my black outs. I have had people believe I am making up this story but I see no reason for me spending the 15-20 minutes to fabricate this event and type it from my phone. My life at the moment is an (in)direct consequence of this event, and it releasing the monster of an addict from inside of me.

I basically don't want to smoke pot since I started taking it. I'm spending a couple days without my daily dose though so it looks like I'm gonna need to smoke a bit. I also have less desire to get hammered every night. I still do though old habits die hard.

How long have you been taking it?  Eventually, the mood and motivation effects tend to diminish as you become tolerant to them (the used to use amphetamines as first line antidepressants before iproniazid and imipramine were invented in the 1950s, and the problem was that they worked great for a while but eventually stopped helping with mood AND now the patient was a daily amp user), though the focus effects should remain relatively constant provided you don't decide to periodically up your dose.  Anyhow, good luck, and always think about it very carefully before you decide to raise your dose (in consultation with your doctor or not), as if you never raise your dose, your tolerance will only get but so high, but once you start taking higher doses, your tolerance may very well take off and then your normal dose won't work well at all.

I think the anti-depressant effect is lasting; people have a hard time distinguishing a high from an antidepressant effect. There's no reason to believe the dopaminergic system is an anomaly relative to the other monoamines in this sense, or even in regards to peptides/amino acids.

Great drug... One of the few Rx drugs I can't IV (which is a good thing) while still getting the same effects. I had to stop taking it due to the cost once I got off my dad's insurance when I turned 26. I was on Dexedrine Spansules for a while, but they were super expensive too (I think I had told my doc I needed to switch prior to losing my insurance so I could find a good substitute). There's an article out there about how the price increase in Dexedrine Spansules versus inflation are majorly skewed. Now I'm on Ritalin, and hate it as I have a good reason to IV it (baby speedball when mixed with my oxymorphone).


I am majorly ADHD (or whatever the correct term is nowadays)... I IV'ed meth once and had to take a nap afterwards. Does anyone else with a valid Rx for Vyvanse find that the drug makes them drowsy? Or am I just a weirdo? I hate Adderall as I think the L-Amp in it causes all the horrible side effects. On Vyvanse I could eat, concentrate, had energy (I'm narcoleptic too), didn't talk too much like on the Ritalin, and could sleep if I wanted to. Again, great drug if you are ADHD.

Sadie the ball python found that smoking cannabis while on amphetamines caused her gums to hurt more than they already did while on the amps - despite being highly vigilant about avoiding drymouth. So, now she has very little desire to smoke as a result.

Vyvanse is currently in phase three trials as an adjunct to major depression treatment, if that isn't evidence enough I don't know what is.


And they had more advanced scientific techniques back then for studies than is popularly thought.


Can you source that its loses its AD effect? Remember, we're talking about treatment for depression, not a high.


What makes it so different from bupropion?

Being in a phase 3 trial = proof of long term antidepressant efficacy?  After learning a bit about the industry and the research process, I'm generally skeptical (until I see more evidence) of efficacy claims of drugs that get approved, let alone ones that are still in trials.  Many approved antidepressants are known sometimes to lose efficacy in the long term.  


Vyvanse certainly has a short antidepressant effects, and also I suspect has a clinical role as an adjunctive to an AD, and I'm sure in certain treatment resistant cases it could be the thing that makes the difference.  But there is a reason that stimulants went from the first line treatment for depression to rarely if ever used for that indication.  Leslie Iversen's excellent 2006 book *Speed, Ecstasy, Ritalin: The science of amphetamines* includes a discussion of the history of their use in depression and cites some of the turning point studies.  A 2009 [review](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006722.pub2/abstract)of 24 randomized controlled trials of psychostimulants for depression found that "There is some evidence that in the short-term, PS reduce symptoms of depression. Whilst this reduction is statistically significant, the clinical significance is less clear."   A 2007 review [article](http://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00023210-200721030-00004)argued that stimulants have a role, albeit limited to certain situations, in the treatment of depression, although the evidence it cites is also short term.


Looking through some of the older studies, there are a lot of reasons to question the long term utility of amph as an antidepressant.  For example, in Ann Intern Med. 1 April 1971;74(4):605-610, "Amphetamine was found to be less effective than placebo in the treatment of depressed outpatients by British general practitioners... In still another British study, amphetamine also proved less effective than phenelzine, and no better than placebo, in the treatment of depresion.  In a Veterans Administration study, dextroamphetamine was no more effective than placebo in treating hospitalized depressed patients." (p. 606).


Joseph Schildkraut, the guy that came up with and popularized the catecholamine hypothesis of affective disorders, similarly took a negative view: 


"The psychomotor stimulants (for example, amphetamine, methamphetamine and methylphenidate) cause mood elevation, increased alertness and enhanced performance in normal subjects.42.43 These drugs may alleviate some of the symptoms of depression in certain depressed patients, but such beneficial effects are often transient and may be accompanied by a number of unwanted side effects. A review of the clinical pharmacology of these compounds may he found elsewhere.2.42 It is fairly generally agreed that the psychomotor stimulants have relatively little to offer in the treatment of the major depressive disorders. 1·2.5·7 These drugs, however, may prove to be of some value experimentally, in separating the various types of depressive disorders. For example, in one study, after the acute administration of methamphetamine, patients with the diagnosis of "neurotic depression"* were found to have a euphoric response, whereas patients with "psychotic depressions"* experienced dysphoria.44 Recent preliminary findings suggest also that the response to d-amphetamine may be useful in predicting the clinical response to imipramine in depressed patients." (pp. 198-199)

(Schildkraut, J. J. (1969). Neuropsychopharmacology and the affective disorders. (First of three parts). The New England Journal Of Medicine, 281(4), 197-201.)


Anyway -- this, and my personal experience, has lead me to believe that the antidepressant effect of amphetamines is not lasting.  I think part of the problem is that it can have a tendency to destabilize mood.  I'm not talking about at recreational doses-- just normal doses, I feel better than normal when it is kicked in, and mildly irritable when it wears off.  Perhaps I'm wrong -- I certainly wouldn't tell anyone who experienced lasting anti-depressant efficacy from amphetamine that their experience is wrong.  I just think it would be uncommon.


As for bupropion, I don't understand your question.  Are you asking why it works?  Are you suggesting that if it works, then amphetamine has to work because they are similar?  Anyone who has taken bupropion and amphetamine I think knows that the subjective experience is not really similar.  Bupropion's antidepressant effect, unlike that produced by amphetamine, takes a week or more to show up generally, and the mechanisms are poorly understood (as is the case with all antidepressants) but I think there is good evidence that the final common pathway is neurogenesis in the hippocampus, as every effective antidepressant regardless of pharmocological mechanism induces this effect via downstream changes.  There are some people who don't totally accept the hypothesis and there is some evidence that is difficult to explain, but I'll leave it to the neuroscientists.  Bupropion induces this neurogenesis, amphetamine doesn't (though unlike bupropion, amphetamine does induce neurogenesis in the ventral tegmental area and the substantia nigra pars compacta).  If you are asking why they work differently, that's a complicated question but in short they don't have the same mechanism of action.

I've been having some fun with IV Meth for a few days last week. Today i ran into some adderall and vyvanse from a friend. i popped 40mg adderall IR(2 20mgs) sublingually, which i think gives a better high than just swallowing it, and 60mg vyvanse. It's an interesting combo if you're into uppers. I'm also mixing it with xanax, soma and IV dilaudid. I think i like adderall better though for coming closer to that meth feeling. Vyvanse is more of a smooth upper feeling high that lasts a long time(which is something i like). I popped the 60mg about 4hrs ago, So i'm going to take 1 30mg pill so the buzz keeps going. I actually wasn't where i wanted to be even after the vyvanse started working. But hopefully with this extra one, it'll get me to where I want to be. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yesterday at around 3 in the afternoon, I popped a vyvanse that I stole from my cousins! I loved it, lasted so long, I've come down now and it feels like I've gotten a good nights sleep even thought it's been 24.5 hrs since I last sleep and 21 hrs since I've eaten anything because this drug can suppress your appetite.

Okay guys since I didn't see much more than speculation on the first five pages of this thread I would like to report that I was prescribed 60mg Vyvanse capsules and I took my first one this morning and it is FUCKING amazing.  The perfect amount of focus without the uncomfortable side of dex or adderall.  If you're taking this for school work I highly recommend it.  There is, however, very little to no rush.


Good for sitting down and coding a website though.  I should note that it is aggravating my tinnitus something fierce, but hey side effects.  What can you do?

well my m.d. switched me from 40mg a day of methylphenidate IR to 40mg a day of vyvanse.  the first dose of vyvanse i took made me sleepy and i passed out for about 5 hours.  after that, though, it gives me a decent level of energy but not much help in terms of focus/concentration like IR amphetamines.  And also the vyvanse lasts 7-8 hours MAX.  my dr. wrote me an Rx for 10mg adderall IR to take at 5pm when the vyvanse wears off but 10mg of adderall didn't do anything, had to take 20mg to get any effect from it.  


also, i asked my dr. what is the highest dose of vyvanse he prescribes to his patients and he said he had one guy on 70mg of vyvanse QID (280mg / day).  he said that it varies for everybody (metabolism, liver/kidney function, etc)

Hey guys. Quick question. I have been getting the 40 mg vyvanse capsules. I want to shoot them up. Everbody says, dont shoot pills up. I understand it is killing me slowly. But does it get you high? Everybody said dont shoot addys, dont shoot subs, dont shoot this dont shoot that. Well everybody who likes to actually get high, shoots these drugs anyway, despite the risk. So can you break vyvanse down in an acid like lemon juice or vinegar with a positive result. ie a good rush when you shoot it? Or does this pro-drug actually prevent this by any means? WHo has shot vyvanse, what were the results? thanks guys.

Injected vyvanase is still a prodrug, don't expect it to work like IV amphetamine. Obviously it will "work" in the same way that taking it orally will if you IV anyway, but don't expect a rush.


It still has to be broken apart by peptidases and that happens only slowly outside the body.

I've decided to challenge this thought.


EXPLICIT WARNING - I AM AN IDIOT, DO NOT EVEN REMOTELY CONSIDER TRYING THE STUPIDITY I AM ABOUT TO DISCUSS.


My first attempt failed, but I'll continue trying. 


40 mg Vyvanse capsule, half capsule of probiotic digestive enzymes,  1 part water, 1 part concentrated lemon juice. Low heat. 


There's definitely an initial feeling, but it completely vanishes in seconds. Zero euphoria.


1 ML solution Ivd right antecubital. 


I'll continue tweaking and trying. I'll post updates later.


I don't need to hear how dangerous/stupid/impossible/nonsensical this is. I'm doing this out of absolute curiosity. It's similar to hacking a secure site or looking through someones email when you know you shouldn't. 


To be continued...

So I am new to the use of amphetamines, I have done about  everything else. Are you saying vomit contains natural trypsin meaning  if you were to vomit and saving before eating food etc. and taking vyvance for example that  it would remove the lis or lis dex? Remember I am not a chemist nor to I  dabble in amphetamines. Closest knowledge I have to this is ex-morphine  addiction (intravenously.)

I'd recommend it instead of a coke binge, or methamphetamine or adderall xr.  It has about a 7 hour high, so it's useful for an all night rave or party.

By doing this (and a few more steps) you can prepare a mix for snorting, plugging, or injection.  Very easy, but, the high is just as good orally in my opinion, which, you are correct, is the only way to use the drug without additional steps.

Vyvanse is Incredible! Wonderful euphoria, SWIM used massive doses of benzos for swim's anxiety and it was awful. V is a god send but for swim 150, 200mg is the spot.  swim got 2mg kpin prn, took swim 18mg of that to sorta feel it. Benzo is so love and hate, but on V there seems to be an powerful anti-anxiety property for swim with GAD. The BEnzo tolerance is ramped up swim hopes for the consistency in a well regulated stimulant to finally taper of the Benzo. Vyvanse is a wonderful drug, and has a lot of potential, I'm worried about what IR remedies I can ask my doc for to keep me at a therapeutic dose? Maybe when I'm not a newby I'll make a thread between philosophical differences between therapeutic and euphoric or are they the same......

No need to use SWIM/SWIY.  I also get some anxiety relief from Vyvanse.  I think a lot of my general anxiety stems from my ADHD syndrome, and because Vyvanse so subtly and effectively relieves my ADHD symptoms, it also relieves my anxiety.  I have been prescribed xanax for panic attacks for years, and I have come to resent having to use it.  I do not like xanax as a recreational drug, but I do find it effective for nipping a panic attack in the bud (though it generally leaves me feeling a little stiff and cold after it does its job).  Vyvanse seems to resolve these issues before they manifest, which is nice, but I do find myself feeling a little stir crazy at the end of the night (a state for which, on occasion, I could see a less intense benzo coming in handy).  I know that it has been contested by some people in this thread that Vyvanse could be useful for the resolution of anxiety symptoms, but, in my case, I have found it indispensable.

Hi this is my first post but I was wondering about my tolerance to vyvanse. I get my own script every month along with two other fifty mg scripts. So I end up with about 90 50mgs a month. I've only been taking them recreationally for about three weeks. Before that I never touched them. It's now to the point where I'm having to take 3 in the am and three at about 2 o clock to keep my productive and focused feeling going. I'm also starting to have extreme paranoia and anxiety at night at my house. I was just released from prison and living in that environment for as long as I did might have contributed to the view that I have on life and my reactions to things. Like I said you were never very safe in there and now I don't feel safe when it gets night time and sometimes during the day. I have done some bad things to people and maybe it's my conscious but I was wondering if maybe it's the meds everyday and no sleep or what. I do have a naturally high tolerance for any sort or stimulant. Even methamphetamine doesn't affect me as it affects other people, or maybe I'm just asking too much out of these substances. Just want some opinions or advice on the subject and if I put this in the wrong place I'm sorry like I said it's my first time

Some people seem to think that adjusting the ph of the solution to mimic that of the stomach will help separate the lysine from the dexamp so the drug can be abused.  The general consensus is that the cleaving of the lysine is enzymatic and takes place elsewhere, so mimicking the environment in the stomach would be counterintuitive.  A lot of this thread has been devoted to hashing this out but nobody can seem to settle the argument.  The enzyme theory seems more logical to me, but I'm no pharmacokineticist.

Okay so I'm getting two 30mg vyvanse pills tomorrow and I wanna know what it will do to me? Like what will the high be like? Should I take both pills? Should I take it during school? I've never taken any pills like that, so I have 0 tolerance. I'm also a 5'11" male about 135-140 lbs if that has any effect on it...

I imagine you'd want to avoid lemon juice altogether. Like you said, the lysine cleaving is enzymatic.

Vyvanse had me cleaning my house with a toothbrush, doing other peoples homework, going on 5 mile runs, answering so many questions in class that the teacher told me to shut up, and not eating for 2 days. Not condoning usage it makes you feel really strung out too and I reckon it could have bad long term effects down the road.

Disclaimer: this is purely harm reduction for safer (ab)use.


I have already posted this but im way too lazy to copy paste it...also higher mg is obviously better to have.


If you want to get high from vyvanse you only need a few things. 

91% iso alcohol

Coffee filter

Shot glass

Butter knife

Pyrex dish.


Ok break those  puppies open, put in the shot glass.


Pour in enough alcohol to cover powder....stir gently.


Pour thru filter into pyrex.


Evap over electric heat...you'll see some off white precipitate coming and you want that for form SLOWLY, until all alcohol is gone and it begins to BARELY bubble and turn a more light gold color.


Then its done and we used to either bomb it or chase off foil because it doesn't work well in a glass bulb.


This whole deal shouldn't take you more than 30 minutes. 


Anyhow be safe have fun.

I learned an important lesson: if you are a 150-lb female, 250 mg in 24 hours is not fun, especially when the high is at its peak. It will likely make you feel jittery, nervous, wobbly, and just kind of weirdly overwhelmed for a few hours. I did get my essay done though, and it's *really* good.

For anyone who still is lost on the idea that Vyvanse is only metabolized in the GI tract, or that trypsin breaks down the molecule to dextroamphetamine, I encourage you to read this document I have linked. It has been proven that lisdexamfetamine (LDX) is in fact broken down by red blood cells. It is NOT broken down by any trypsin or pancreatin enzymes. For the sake of harm reduction to anyone who may be attempting to break down vyvanse into dextroamphetamine for the purpose of anal plugging or insuffulation. Do NOT USE TRYPSIN OR ANY RELATED ENZYMES as they are harmful to your intestines and/or nasal passage when plugged or snorted. Also if you have been attempting to cleave that lysine bond with trypsin, and you have been thinking you were "feeling" the effects of straight dextroamphetamine, THINK AGAIN.

Here you go. This took forever to find after digging past all the garbage that Shire has put in front of the real information behind the body's reduction of their precious Vyvanse.

That is a very interesting post ghf. I had just spent 20 minutes reading about enzymatic cleaving of the covalent l-lysine bond by trypsin on another website, and to come here immediately afterward to find you saying that it is broken down by the red blood cells? It was thought-provoking. Both sides have a sliver of science to prop them up pretty convincingly.


If we had the resources we could perform several different experiments (using pepsin, trypsin, acids, bases, proteins/enzymes/whatever's on the red blood cells (comprehensively, you see?)) to ascertain which methods, if any, would lyse the lysine bond to an appreciable degree. I mean.. Of course we could; the equipment is always the issue. But we have a (mostly) serious community, and so I see no reason why we couldn't standardize some  procedures and get freaky with some simple, non-dangerous experiments.


I'm on the tail end of a 60mg lisdex experience (T+9:15) and this idea has me quite fascinated, aha. It should not be any great feat for someone who knows their chemistry to think of all the experimental possibilities and draw up some experiments. I could totally do a couple..


But this is where the equipment comes into play. I mean, and this is the big question, how would one go about measuring the composition of the resulting substance? The only ways I can think of straight off require some funds, or at least access to expensive machines. 


Is it possible to perform a subsequent reaction that attaches the lysine to another relatively harmless molecule (protein or not) after any of these reactions occur? If so, or even if not, it may be possible to precipitate dex-amp out of solution (or precipitate lysing, but that's just what I just said, re worded). From there we could possibly weigh the precipitate (after drying) and then, using molar mass stoichiometry, we could discern how much dex-amp was in a given mass of precipitate.

Knowing that information for each individual reaction (and subsequent precipitation reactions) we could compare the yield and ratio of dexamp to the, hopefully inert, binder for each individual product.


Just food for thought; I would need help with the serious reaction calculations, but perhaps this post gives other seekers a new perspective on the problem.


Man... I was hit pretty hard by 60mg. This stuff is actually really nice. I wouldn't want to get pure d-amp, but I know others might, so that gives me an excellent outlet for my intense curiosity. This problem is so simple, but so very difficult to solve when one is groping around in the near-darkness. Consider this my attempt at turning the light up just a few degrees more.

You, Sir, are a moron.*  I would suggest doing even a tiny bit of reading before you make such emphatic statements.  If you're going to tell everyone that something commonly accepted as fact is actually false, you would be well advised to double check your work.  Re-read that article.  I have the full copy, but you can find everything you need in the abstract.


It says that lisdexamfetamine is metabolized to dexamp by an aminopeptidase in the red blood cell cytosol.  Did you bother to look up the word peptidase?  Since it has the -ase suffix, you know it is a type of enzyme, and the peptid part...  hmm, sounds like peptide...  Oh yes, peptidase, enzymes which cleave peptide bonds.  You should look up examples of that type of enzyme.  I'll wait a second while you do so.


Done now?  Okay, good.  Now don't you feel stupid, or what?  Yeah, trypsin is a common peptidase.  It is perfectly capable of cleaving that bond in the lisdexamfetamine molecule to release plain dexamphetamine.


Moreover, that study doesn't say that LDA isn't metabolized to DA in the gut, it just shows that LDX is metabolized at least to some extent by red blood cells.  It looks specifically at how red blood cells metabolize LDA in vitro, it doesn't address how the drug is actually metabolized in vivo.  The idea that red blood cells actually do the conversion would suggest that injecting the drug would make it work significantly faster- bypassing long route it had to go through the stomach, small intestine, active transport by amino acid transporters, and more before finally hitting the blood.  That may be true, actually, I'm not completely sure, one small study found peak plasma concentrations of dexamphetamine to occur at 2.58hr after IV admin, while much larger studies find about 3 to 3.5hr for oral admin (with wide variability).  Because of the wide individual variance, I don't know how much effect you can read into the seemingly faster time to peak plasma from such a small sample size.  Too much noise going on to ascribe the difference to any one cause.


  *I wanted to say idiot, but that suggests you're incapable of intelligence, and I don't think that's the case.  I think of a moron as one who is capable of beneficial change.

Hello, I am currently prescribed one 70mg Vyvanse per day.  I hadn't been on any amphetamine product before this, and 70mg feels like a lot the first day or two, but the body quickly adapts.


Anyway, I'm wondering if anyone else experiences gas from vyvanse?  Not so much gas, really, but more constant burping.  I think I'm constantly swallowing air.  I am definitely moving my tongue around constantly and doing shit with my mouth, and I suspect I'm swallowing more often and taking in more air with it.  It's really quite uncomfortable.  I have found that drinking a bunch of water during the first couple hours after taking it seems to reduce this side effect.  I thought sucking on jolly ranchers would help, but after a couple hours with dry mouth it makes my teeth feel dirty.  Not a very pleasant thing.  Mints are a little better.


Also, I don't have much amp experience, but is it normal to experience a crash from a 70mg dose?  Not on the first few days, but after two weeks one night I felt damn near suicidal, and it lasts so long.  It's been over 12hr now and I still feel it's effects.  I can sleep now, but I still feel that wired kind of buzzing feeling.


Fortunately it helps me lose some weight, last month I lost 20lb during the two weeks I took it, but the first couple days after I quit I put 12 back on (so, -8lb), just drinking and eating normal.  Over the next week, though, I got back to being down 15.  I want to lose about 10/month, so that's a decent start.  Only need to lose 10 more anyway and I'll be at my ideal weight, with about 15% body fat.  I could probably knock that down to 10% with some work, but I'm dealing with an injury which makes it hard to stay active enough to maintain that level.

I was on Vyvanse for the coupon to try it but I took 2 70's in the AM and 1 in the PM and it was worthless.  I was on Dexedrine tablets and Spansules and those were nice.  I get the Barr Adderall 30 mg XR generic that shire makes and puts different writing...  I am wanting it less and less now.  I get sick of it sometimes.  They used to give me a lot more than they do now.

It looks specifically at how red blood cells metabolize LDA in vitro, it doesn't address how the drug is actually metabolized in vivo.  The idea that red blood cells actually do the conversion would suggest that injecting the drug would make it work significantly faster- bypassing long route it had to go through the stomach, small intestine, active transport by amino acid transporters, and more before finally hitting the blood.  That may be true, actually, I'm not completely sure, one small study found peak plasma concentrations of dexamphetamine to occur at 2.58hr after IV admin, while much larger studies find about 3 to 3.5hr for oral admin (with wide variability).  Because of the wide individual variance, I don't know how much effect you can read into the seemingly faster time to peak plasma from such a small sample size.  Too much noise going on to ascribe the difference to any one cause.

**Hahaha. Thanks for the comment, bud. If you read the article again you'll find out that the tests with isolated aminopeptidase enzymes that specifically cleave lysine and prefer to cleave lysine on carboxyl groups resulted in NO NOTICABLE DEXTROAMPHETAMINE when put in solution with lisdexamfetamine. The only significant conversion of LDX to dextroamphetamine was with blood related samples. Not including plasma. 


It's really funny how you jump to the conclusion that I'm a moron because they say LDX is converted by a peptidase, BUT they actually did a test with TRYPSIN and OTHER AMINOPEPTIDASE. You would have known that if YOU READ THE WHOLE ARTICLE. Turns out that you're the moron. You have got a lot to say for someone who DIDN'T EVEN READ THE ARTICLE. Delight me with some more uneducated opinions. I would love to hear them.**


Assay for LDX hydrolysis by

aminopeptidase B

Treatment of LDX with a commercial preparation of aminopeptidase

B did not result in detectable d-amphetamine

release from LDX, despite linear, bestatin-sensitive production

of β-naphthylamide from a lysine-2-naphthylamine

reporter substrate


**Previous studies have ruled out several classes of enzyme

as being responsible for the hydrolysis of LDX. Incubation

of LDX with dipeptidyl peptidase IV, cathepsin G,

elastase, and trypsin, or in simulated gastric or intestinal

fluid, all failed to elicit significant loss of LDX or generation

of d-amphetamine.**


**It's surprising you were able to pull such a long insulting speech out of your ass only knowing a sliver of information on the studies of LDX and the conversion to Dextroamphetamine. By the way if you look it up on any reliable source how lisdex is converted they will say it is broken down to dextroamp in the blood. Lisdex doesn't even need to go through the stomach, GI or liver. The reason why there is a small difference between IV and oral is that lisdex is inactive AND is too large to pass the BBB, but dexamp is. Lisdex is converted at a set rate determined by the enzymes in the blood. It usually will take 4 hours for full conversion. Dexamp on the otherhand causes such pleasurable effects because it readily passes the BBB to the brain's DPT and serotonin transporters. Lisdex is unable to do this because it is limited by the speed of enzymes converting it to dexamp. LISDEXAMFETAMINE is an inactive chemical. Its all about the blood, buddy. Try majoring in biochemistry and report back to me on your conclusion.**

I'm still confused why you still think you're right.  How do you think blood cells are doing this conversion?  They contain enzymes which do the physical conversion.  Perhaps trypsin itself doesn't (I still can't find any reason why it wouldn't, and I haven't read the studies it cites, but it's possible there's some reason it can't), but enzymes are doing the work, be they in the gut or the blood cells.  I don't dispute the location, I dispute your claim that enzymes aren't responsible.

I am aware that LDX is converted by enzymes. I'm simply trying to prove the point that the enzymes are in the blood and they are not enzymes previously believed to convert LDX to Dexamp. 


I'm mostly curious at this point if it is a combination of enzymes in the blood that convert LDX possibly from variables caused when those enzymes are placed together. Just a thought.

Yes it does. i find it less motivating then Adderall, but strong control over ADD. I find it vastly superior to Ritalin. I am currently on 70 mg of Vyvanse daily, but I found great help as low as 30 mg.

He thinks he is right because he is directly quoting a peer-reviewed article that obviously states the facts of this matter; you are wrong.


Also, he is not claming that enzymes arent responsible. He is claiming that trypsin isnt the catalyst... and he is obviously right considering the results of that experiment are in the article he posted.


Try using your own brain for two seconds before calling other people morons, particularly when you dont bother to actually read the (excellent) information they post.

Well I aint nearly as smart as ya'll...i take 100mg a day of this stuff n i am supper happy...my doc told me to take 1000mg of Calcium Citrate with it if I need a boost...guessing that works on blood pH..all I know is if my wife takes 50mg and 1000 mg of the CaCitrate girl gets freaking tweeked n horny as hell..much like she does on X..but for a longer run..I even get a good buzz on and I've lived on high doses of ADHD shit for along time..12yrs.  Also to mello it out some 120 mg of lamactal seem to do the trick...any thoughts would be awsome cause I want to know if using the trypsin would really trip it out?

This is an accurate thread....it varies from person to person.  My experience with vyvanse sucked. No euphoria.....not even an amped feeling, or wanting to clean lol.  I felt edgy when I felt it at all....then exhausted for days, and unable to sleep.    I am STILL feel horrible 3 days later. Never again... Nothing good.   Maybe you'll be the  person that has a great experience  Not worth trying it in case you're one of the ones that gets edgy, then feels horrible for days.

This is a few months old I know. 

You are right. But you are also wrong. The reason trypsin does not cleave lysine from the d-amphetamine in this case is because of exopeptidase(Exp) and endopepsidase (Edp). Trypsin is a endpepsidase

Edp's will only cleave peptide bonds at non terminal ends. Exp's will only cleave peptide bonds at terminal ends. LDX is a dipeptide making both ends terminal. Therefore trypsin can not cleave this bond. I have a thread about this at this link if you would like more information on this.

[https://drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=279469](https://drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=279469)


Secondly. The IV administration effect of this drug is lessened because it is metabolized in RBC's. The transporter PEP1 is required to carry LDX into the RBC to be metabolized.

So, I got at least one script of lisdexamfetamine after months worth of being on Addy 30 XR, 10 IR. There's a story there, but maybe another time. I talked my way back into lisdex by saying it's more consistent than Addy, and that is true, it really is.


The last time I had Vyvanse was back in May of this year, and I only had one script of it, I believe..not a whole lot to judge it on overall, being that I had just very recently started taking stimulants again for my ADD. I remember having mixed feelings about Vyvanse, and concluded that I wanted the rush more as well as control and drastically increased onset of Adderall.


Anyways, here we are 7 months later, and I'm trying the same dose (50mg) once again. I have much more experience with amphetamines now from this year, and not exactly for the better (amp psychosis about 3 or 4 times), but I've learned my lessons.


I got it filled yesterday, and I knew to expect a good 3ish hours before it was fully kicked in. But, yeah, you most certainly have to be patient with this drug, but once it kicks in, it's worth it (to me, at least). All D-Amp, consistently pumping through you, vs many ups and downs, and a much smaller percentage of d-amp, with Adderall? No thanks, I prefer this stuff, and so does a friend of mine that took it for the first time, with experience in years past with other stims.


Sure, there's really no conceivable rush, so to speak, but it's still noticeable enough of an onset to still be pretty pleasant. What I used to do was down a partial shotglass of baking soda about 10 mins before downing the capsules, and it is a noticeable difference in half life.


Last thing I'll say is that I basically OD'ed off the Vyvanse script I had back in the spring, but that was my stupidity and impatience. I probably had taken 3 or 4 50mg caps, within several hours, biking around the city in warm weather..ran out of water, and not a whole hell of a lot of nutritional intake before I left the house, either. What eventually resulted was INSANELY intense euphoria...more-so than I had ever experience on Addy's. I couldn't walk but a few steps down the street without getting really light-headed and feeling like I would pass out if I tried to go much further. And it was clear that downing a bunch of water wasn't really doing shit ultimately to make it start fading away. There's an end to the story, but it's really probably not anything too shocking. It involves vitamin C (someone bought me an orange, not knowing the truth..thinking it was just exhaustion), and that and sitting the rest of the mental ride out ended it soon enough. Scary shit.

Hey everyone, I got access to some vyvanse and tried it out. Took 40 mg, had a horrible first 45 minutes, then some shakes, anxiety....done so many drugs that I wasnt worried, rode it out....about 2 hours in it was mild, no dry mouth, no real noticeable euphoria, had 3 beers, which helped calm me a bit during the metabolizing period...


took another 40 mg, had about 15 minutes of the same dirty feeling after they started working...and an hour later slight dryness in mouth, pretty calm but I get stuff done which is nice and my intention....some tension in muscles....took another 40 mg but this will be the end of it for me...never really liked amphetamine or coke anyways....


if anything oxycodone is way way way better for me......take a flexerol/cyclozobenzaprin in the end at you have a great night sleep.


it was worth the try, but then again I always have to take so much compared to others to get high.


I rermember in the past while I did heroine and some friends would do an 1/8 pr a 1/4 and be nodding out...I'm like what??!!!


anyways, this was my experience, gonna go do some more house choires and probably smoke some of my sour diesel

vape and let go of any thoughts of doing this again.

I'm glad you are ok chrisincville!!!


I got the opesite problem its just never enough for me, could be that my body chemestry is all screwed up because of 15 years of drug addiction everyday....

It just can change how things chemically pan out....like downers gets me energized normally....I have a presciption for tamazepam but whats recreational 

about it if i cant remember nothing at all? what I wanna remember is sitting with awesome euphoria all evening feeling happy and relaxed....so I didnt

even pick them up last time. This is not me normally  but perhaps a change is happening.


I find a good 80 mg of oxycodone and a cyclozobenzaprine and some wine to be just great for me, and if my wife calls I can easily be calm and assertive

most of the time LOL


btw I am on 120 mg right now but I drink lots of water, I eat and make sure to get what my body needs.

PEPT1 is a transporter of amino acids found primarily in the intestine. Many drugs also can be substrates of PEPT1, LDX included, even if they are not amino acids or peptides. PEPT1 is responsible for the absorption of LDX from the intestine to the systemic circulation but most likely is not what RBCs use to either uptake or metabolize LDX. It is most likely an aminopeptidase that cleaves lysine off LDX but it isnt fully elucidated yet.

After being clean for 10 yrs from massive coke addiction,I discovered Adderall..I can take approx 70-80 mg of Adderall,but usually takes about 120-150mg of Vyvanse for same effect. Seems much weaker to me personally

That's because Vyvanse is a little different than Adderall.  The total lisdexamfetamine dose only yields 30% actual dextroamphetamine once the lysine is torn apart.  So if you took 150mg of vyvanse, then you're getting 45mg of pure dextroamphetamine.  An easier way to remember is that for every 50mg of vyvanse you take, it yields 15mg of d amphetamine.


The amount of d amphetamine in the Adderall dosage you stated is a little higher than this.  That's why it seems weaker.

Vyvanse is a great drug. Second( subjectively speaking ) to actual dextroamphetamine. My effects were all smooth. Slightly tweaked at much higher doses. My sweet spot was 120mg to 140mg, but 70mg worked all day long. I noticed if I took a small dose of Adderall on top of the Vyvanse, about an hour or so in, it felt like 10+hours of nice Adderall.

vyvanse is the best. I'd pick it over everything (upper wise, opiates are my one true love) but the VERY BEST quality IV shard. only prescription amphetamine I've ever really gotten anything out of.


EDIT: ah man ...ODing off 150-200mg vyvanse ...never hurts to have a reminder of how different people's chemistry can be. I used to take up to 600mg (took 350mg my first time, probably a little too much for my first time, I really only needed a minimum of 300mg to get going when I was just starting out on a binge) at a time and even work and ride horses out in the sun at a barn for hours at a time during that time to no immediate ill effect. but man I loved that shit.

I agree with you Speed King.  It virtually lacks a come down, as well, compared to other psychostimulants.  And the long duration, up to 12 - 14 hours, is pretty nice.  I took a little too much my first time - 200mg - yet it was still quite a surprising experience as to what I thought it would be like...my only other psychostimulant experiences at the time being methylphenidate and some cathinones.

IMO it has a HELL of a comedown, long and drawn out, compared to meth and coke. that may be my opinion because my experiences w/ meth (only done coke once or twice and experienced no comedown to speak of) have never involved going w/o sleep more than 48hrs and when I was doing vyvanse I never went less than 3 days, rarely less than 5, and once even up to 9, usually between 5-7 days. but generally when I did meth I had no problems whatsoever IVing and smoking meth all morning then sleeping soundly at night (then doing it again the next day) and never felt too shitty in between; maybe because of l-dex's long half-life but once I started feeling like I was coming down 10-12hrs after it kicked in I would feel REALLY shitty for a REALLY long time, like another 12, 16 hours plus before I could finally crash and get some sleep. it was rough.

methylphenidate has a famously awful comedown so if you're comparing it to that though I can see why it may not seem so bad ...though I've never done ritalin personally so I can't say from experience

I have been on vyvanse for a little over three months now, I am prescribed 50mg for binge eating disorder and I have to say that it works great. The problem I have though is that sometimes I have depression topped with anger. I was wondering if anyone else has had this happen and if you do what can I do about it.

Totally can see the "anger" part as being valid - likely even prob very common - the depression, however, I don't know. This type of med should actually help such things. I'd def talk to your doc.

I decided to hold out on using it during the weekends and instead pop a triple dose (120mg) on some week days to get me through some of the more boring/hard school days. I knew I could get some sort of high off them since I used to know someone who often popped these. I have done this twice up till now. The euphoria I got from my first try was incredible, probably one of the most productive days of my life and as a bonus it made me more sociable and empathic overall an amazing day! The second time was very much less so. I still got a slight high from it but nothing comparable to my first try, my focus was there though. These were seperated by 3 days on the 40mg and 2 weekend days where I didn't take anything. My question is, does this mean I am developping a tolerance to Vyvance? The school year just started and I can't really afford for my 40mg to stop working (I legitimately need it) and having to pump up to 80mg or something for the focus effect. I have 0 experience with amps or anything like that (I haven't done anything other than weed and shrooms) and don't really know much about them or how they work. Yeah I know, I'm dumb for popping pills I know nothing about I just trust my doctor I guess. Also, would doing a triple dose once a week be harmful or addicting? I'm 16 weighing around 135lbs. (Sorry for the bad grammar and wording, english isn't my first language.)

The first high you get will be the best because your brain releases massive amount of serotonin along with dopamine which is why you get the empathetic effect + Feel like a god. that never happened to me again. Only the first few times. Best high of my life not even IV opiates compare. I never IV meth but i imagine thats the only thing that could  MAYBE top my godly experience...

From my understanding and some research I did though, Vyvance shouldn't have a huge effect on serotonin, the effects are mostly on the dopamine side of things or am I wrong? It shouldn't drain it dry like MDMA would and I should still have a shit-ton of serotonin left... I would understand if it were my 10th or so time getting high off Vyvance in a month but getting such a big "high-loss" on my second time just seems weird to me.

It is perfectly normal to not feel the empathy related high in the same intensity after what is essentially a two day break followed by taking the same dose that previously gave it.

I took 20mg of vyvanse after a break. I dosed at 9AM. around noon I was Peaking and felt like i was coked up happy for 2 hours. Listening to music, dancing, acting high on life. After 3PM I took a shit that I held on to all day. after that it all went to shit. The come down sucked SO bad considering the low dose I took. I couldn't bear it and took a benzos at 7Pm and knocked myself out. I would just stare at the wall and think about how miserable I feel.


Do come downs lessen with daily use? **Also I feel like my come down was triggered after I took a shit???** I haven't taken vyvanse in so long I forgot how it felt like daily use.

I find comedowns certainly lessen with increased use. Fairly quickly too. A week, maybe 10 days and I barely notice.

So 48hrs after the mere 20mg vyvanse dose and I'm absolutely exhausted. Massive brain fog. I will probably be useless all day. Seems the withdrawal symptoms peaks on day 2.

I'd hazard a guess it has a bit to do with your urinary pH (among other things), depending on which you could still have ~50% of the drug in circulation after 24 hours. If I take a weekend long break from the meds (no dosing on saturday or sunday) it is not uncommon for me to just sleep 20-24 hours which is basically the whole sunday. It's pretty freaky for a person who is used to sleeping ~6 hours a night. YMMV, everyone is different physiologically and has different habits of life. Too much schoolwork to take a longer break, but I'd definitely like to try it.


EDIT: Out of curiosity, why are people so obsessed about the specifics of LDX metabolism? Is it the idea of in vitro cleavage? Assuming you succeeded and the molecule begins to hydrolyze, wouldn't you end up with freebase amphetamine which would kind of render the conditions for an enzymatic in vitro reaction useless? I mean, let's say you order a commercial enzyme that has glycerol added for storage purposes. As soon as the enzyme starts doing it's work, wouldn't the reaction product basically halt the reaction? I'm assuming the oily amphetamine hangs around in the solution thanks to the glycerol. In vivo you don't have this kind of problem thanks to circulating blood for one. Not saying it's impossible to cleave the molecule outside the body, most likely a very complex process on top of being quite costly and I'm reluctant to believe it's worth the effort.

Update': I recovered halfway into day 3. I remember that afternoon, i just had a coffee , protein shake, then snap an hour later I'm instantly back to normal. 


I took a 2 month break before trying the 20 mg. Which is a tiny amount of amphetamines. I felt really good for 4 hours, then all downhill.

There are substances that will almost definitely lengthen / maybe increase the effects but may be target dangerous if they work well.


I'm not going into those. In HR's sake I don't see a benefit to my repeating this info.


Vyvanse is the best form of dex I've ever had... It really doesn't need potentiation it lasts too long, potentiated effects could be very dangerous.


I did it a few times, wasn't happy with the result. The same potentiator for IR dex worked well, but Vy just lays so long. If not and you're prescribed a raise in dose is much safer.

^ Yes. Do not potentiate Vyvanse. This could be where I messed up when I was prescribed 20 mg of Vyvanse each morning. I had Gabapentin at home that the doctor did not prescribe, I got it from someone else. Ok so I would use the Gabapentin to potentiate the Vyvanse and that very well could be the reason I ended up spiraling down into the worst paranoia you could imagine (schizophrenic type paranoia) and landed in the psych ward over the weekend.


That paranoid episode was the scariest ever. I'm bipolar 2, but never experienced a psychotic break like that. Imagine your worst nightmare full of ALL your insecurities except it happens to you in real life. I went through a day of thinking my entire family were conspiring against me. I thought what was talked about on television was about me. I questioned everything I got in the mail. A full day and night of that and I couldn't take it. When EMS came, I thought the medics were trying to kill me. I was kicking and screaming. The most frightening experience of my life. 

So please DON'T potentiate!!! It does last all day and night, just let it work its magic.


So after a couple of days off of everything in the psych ward, my mind was perfectly clear again thank God. When I had that psychotic break that felt like schizophrenia, I was afraid my mind would not come back and that maybe I would be like that forever. Anyway, doctors saw that I was clear-minded and let me go home Wednesday. Right out of the hospital, I had to go straight to a psychiatrist appointment I already had and explained everything to her. 


Ok so my question is: Are there people who take Vyvanse "as needed" or not every single day? I tried it yesterday by itself, no Gabapentin at all and honestly felt like a million bucks. I got a lot accomplished and feel like the best version of myself. It took a lot to get my Vyvanse authorized by insurance so I don't want to lose it completely because of what landed me in the hospital. I see my psychiatrist again in 2 weeks and I think I'm going to confess I potentiated with Gabapentin and that could be why everything got out of control. Hopefully, she would still prescribe it to me. 


Vyvanse really does work wonders for Bipolar 2 and also anxiety if you take it correctly and don't add anything. I have a tendency to be scatterbrained so that's why the psychiatrist prescribed it, to help with ADHD. Trust me, you don't want to have an experience like I did so I'm just warning you guys. Especially if you're bipolar, you're already prone to being triggered by medicines mixed together.

I am a big insomniac and adderall XR made me lose sleep, thats why I am now on Dexedrine IR but when I take it at 8am, around 4pm I get kind of dysphoric and unproductive. So I was wondering if Vyvanse was lasting a little shorter than Adderall XR so that I don't get a mild comedown after about 4-5pm and dont get increased insomnia.


I was also wondering the difference of duration between dexedrine spansules and vyvanse, I know the Dex spansules last shorter than Adderall XR but IDK about vyvanse duration.


Also My dexedrine dosage is between 7.5m and 10mg in the morning and when I take 7.5mg I usually take the 2.5mg left at about 12pm but it just push the comedown back to 6-7pm instead of 4-5pm. But when I do that my sleep is incact which is kind of the most important for me.

Vyvanse lasts all day and night. That's why I started making sure to take it early in the morning, like 6 or 7 am. Sometimes I still have insomnia. It's always good to have a sleeping pill to make sure you get rest if you still feel like you can't sleep at night. Maybe your psychiatrist can prescribe one. You don't have to take it every night. I don't take mine every night, just when I notice for sure I won't be able to sleep.


Vyvanse is smoother than Adderall as far as you won't have a depressing crash that makes you want to kill yourself, but Vyvanse lasts ALL DAY long. I have experienced a little bit of a mild comedown from Vyvanse in mid afternoon, but I would drink coffee to boost it. Still, it was enough energy to get me through the day.


I have no experience with Dex. Only Adderall and Vyvanse.

Thanks for the answer, I am already taking daily benzo for insomnia, and I know I won't get a dose upgrade just because I asked for a longer duration ADD med, It was already hard to have my insomnia treated because I do not tolerate sleeping pills other than med-long duration benzo, the short duration make me wake in the middle of the night.

Depression & Tolerance 


Hello All, 


This is my first post in this site and first post ever in any kind of thread or website. Thank you in advance to anyone that takes the time to read this and offer their advice. 


I am a 24 year old female and I am in my sixth year of college for my bachelors degree. It's taken me six hard years to finally get my shit together enough to be in my final semester of college. I am expected to graduate in December if I can get a handle on my life enough to finish my current classes. I was prescribed adderall 40mg XR by my family doctor after asking for it because everyone on campus was taking it to focus on school work and I wanted to try it but was to afraid to buy drugs. In high school I made great grades and graduated at the top of my class. When I started college I completely lost all drive and focus. Maybe it was the freedom I all of a sudden had. I didn't have to go to class like I did in high school so I didn't. I lost my scholarships then transferred schools closer back to home. I eventually failed out and had to go to the community college. I finally got my associates degree and then went back to the University to finish my bachelors. 


When my doctor prescribed me the adderall it was like everything made sense. It was clear I was struggling with ADHD. I started focusing harder. Things I was learning in class was starting to be so much clearer and I was actually learning the course information and remembering it all. Remembering and retaining the information has always been an issue I've struggled with making test and exams an unpleasant experience. Adderall had solved my problems. I was taking the medicine on school days that I needed to focus. Sometimes every other day and sometimes once a week. (I need to add, adderall made me grind my teeth like a meth addict and made me very feel very embarrassed.)


After a year and a half of taking the Adderall I grew tolerant to it and it wasn't working anymore. I started falling behind again in school and failed more classes. One day a fellow ADHD friend and college student told me about vyvanse and offered to let me try one of hers to see if it helped. She had also been prescribed adderall then made the switch to vyvanse. I tried one of hers and it was amazing! I was more focused and motivated than adderall had ever made me feel! I talked with my doctor and we made the switch to vyvanse 70 Mg. XR. Everything was so much better! My grades were great and I was going to class and was motivated in life as a whole. 


This July I took a required organic chemistry summer course so I could graduate this December. I am not book smart and science is my worst subject (I'm a business major). It was everything I could do to get through the course and I barely did. I passed with a grade that was two points above the cut off. But I passed and that's all that matters to me. The class met every day and we had an exam every Friday. We covered 5 chapters each week. I was taking my vyvanse everyday because of the course load. I started noticing a huge tolerance build up by the end of July.


My Fall semester started in August and it's currently November. It's everything I can do to just make myself go to class. Allot of times I don't go. My tolerance has built up to the Vyvanse 70 mg XR. I am extremely unmotivated to do anything at all. It's almost as I'm depressed. I sleep all the time and can't even motivate myself to do housework chores like dishes or laundry. I can't get myself to study or do the online assignments or quizzes for my online class. If I don't pass these last 5 class and get an overall GPA of a 2.0 I won't graduate and will have to retake classes in the spring semester. I want so badly to finally graduate in December and to get a big girl career job I really do, but I don't have the drive to even get out of bed sometimes. My relationship is struggling and my sex drive is nonexistent. 


My main focus is to just get through this semester then go from there! 


I need suggestions on how to make the vyvanse work again?! Should I ask my doctor for Adderall and vyvanse so I can alternate? I had tried and tried to research this and there is so many people saying so many different things. What is DXM? Will it help? What about chelated magnesium? I know what this is and that some people say it reduces the tolerance build up. But how do you take it? How many Mg and morning or night? I have a two month trial back of namenda (memantine) that a friend that works at a doctors office got for me from the free sample stash. I have read lots of people say this works but no one says how many Mg and what time of day to take it. Please someone give me some advice! 


The very last thing I want to do it build up any type of addiction! I am not a drug user whatsoever! I only take birth control and vyvanse. I only take medicine that is prescribed by my doctor and not for recreational purposes! This is one of the reasons I am afraid to tell all of this to my doctor and seek her advice. My town is a very small rural town and prescription pills are a huge problem here. I would say half the population in my town has been or is addicted to prescription pills/street drugs. I don't want her to think I'm just another pill head trying to get more drugs. My parents don't think ADHD is a real thing and that I shouldn't take any medicine at all. I do casually drink with friends but am no where near an alcoholic. I would say I drink maybe once every two weeks if that. I do smoke cigarettes, probably a pack every other day. 


Please someone help me or steer me in the right direction to find a solution!

How about a booster of IR Adderall or Dexedrine to use when needed? Slippery slope though.

In my experience, yes. Concerta&Ritalin (i don't remember what the name of the active drug in those two are)are closer to cocaine in their make-up&effect, as Vyvanse and Adderall are amphetamines, and I get MUCH more agitated with the Concerta and the like.

I went to the doc today and asked her if I could try Vyvanse again. She wants me on Zyprexa to make sure I'm balanced out first. Zyprexa is a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic. I don't want to take that crap. When I see her in 8 weeks, she said we'll discuss the Vyvanse again. I guess understandably she wanted to put a break between it but I told her I'm fine now. Jesus...annoying.

What is the best way to help your body absorb vyvanse? I have been cleansing for a few weeks after I ran out of my 30mg script a week and a half after I got it. I used vyvanse to help me stay awake all night a lot this summer due to taking calculus and physics (I know, what in the he'll was I thinking) and it sort of turned into a bad habit for me. My tolerance was so ridiculous I would take three to five 60mg capsules in one 36 hr period, then sleep a night, and repeat the next night. I know this is terrible for me and that it could turn into a big problem, that is why I stopped and have been cleansing. When I get my script in a few days I want to take one a day and avoid redosing. But I want it to be very affective as well so I can get my school work done. Any thoughts?!

I need help with Vyvanse tolerance. Any replies saying not to abuse them surely won't help as I already know this and am trying to stop. That is why I need your help. I have been taking 75-100 mg Vyvanse a day and am prescribed 50 mg. I feel I need to take more because if I don't take at least 75-100, I get wired, but get no focus. Seems like I always have brain fog -- even when I do take the 100 mg. I assume this is because in the past I have abused amphetamines like crazy (6-10 months ago) and now have super high tolerance or no dopamine. How long of a break should I take to reset tolerance/brain chemicals? Whenever I don't take them I feel super depressed

I don't want her to think I'm just another pill head trying to get more drugs. My parents don't think ADHD is a real thing and that I shouldn't take any medicine at all. I do casually drink with friends but am no where near an alcoholic. I would say I drink maybe once every two weeks if that. I do smoke cigarettes, probably a pack every other day.

I know that Vyvanse needs to be metabolized before it turns to dex, but here's my question: If you were to pop one, when would you reach the point of no return, where throwing up would no longer serve as an expedient. Long story short, took a 70mg and a half a few hours ago, absent mindedly I took another 70mg and the other half. About an hour passed by before I decided I probably over did it and decided to throw up. Would that be too late for most people? I'm early 20's about 185 pounds

Relax. 


You took the equivalent of ~ 50 - 60 mg dexamphetamine xr. 

Which is quite a bit, but nothing to worry about IMHO. 

If you are really concerned consult a hospital/physician.

Does anyone know how to reset your D2 receptors? I abused amphetamines for a while a few months ago and don't have time for tolerance break. They give me energy , but no focus (still have brain fog all day). Does anyone know ways to help resetD2 receptors in frontal lobe and increase dopamine levels and release?

There is not such thing as reseting receptors, your liver is just metabolizing it too fast for it to get in decent amount in your brain. You can take something to inhibit the decomposing enzyme in your liver (piperine).

D2 antagonists or the D2/D3 partial agonists will help restore your homeostatic D2 receptor state more towards normal through what's known as "upregulation" - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation). 


 But I've got to tell you - they might be a little unpleasant and probably precipitate withdrawals - depending on how much you've used, similar to how flumazenil can precipitate benzo withdrawal in certain individuals when they overdose. 


Were you using consistently everyday? If not, this is a good way to go.

To all those who want to slam meth. Be careful about Crystal Meth. After using it for 5 or 6 years, I now suffer from delusions, paranoia and anxiety. And it'll have you thinking the craziest shit is currently happening to you. 

I'd advise to stay away from this drug. It'll ruin your brain and you'll wish you'd never touch it. It'll also bring you into contact with truly horrible people. The lowest of the low. They'll use you and abuse you because they know you are dying for a "hit"

or a bump.

So I see my psychiatrist today and she started me off with 20 mg months ago and it was too strong. I looked up the lowest dose and I didn't know it comes in 10 mg. I'm going to ask for that.


It always pays to look up the lowest dose of a medicine first because psychiatrists are known for giving you a high dose first. It's ridiculous.

I'm too lazy to make a Ritalin thread. I think I'm going to stop it for a while at least. It is making me completely apathetic and sad. I've lost interest in things I used to enjoy. More suicidal thoughts are creeping in. It also causes tension in my head, like a slight headache and everything feels doom and gloom. Maybe I should just be done with amphetamine type drugs. I'm tired of crying and being miserable. This is only the 3rd day. I felt good on the first day. Also I just read it's bad for your heart as an adult.


She started me on a stimulant (Ritalin) and then reduced my klonopin to only one 0.5 pill a day. So that means I only have 30 pills total. What the fuck? Who can get by on only one 0.5 klonopin a day especially when you're supposed to take a stimulant twice a day and of course there's a "crash". These doctors are fucking retarded!

Ok. I found a silver lining. I did my research and looked up if there are any interactions between Gabapentin and Ritalin. There are no interactions. The Gabapentin will help with the Ritalin edginess and I won't have to rely on klonopin much. So this is great news. I'll try it out tomorrow. Not a high dose of Gabapentin, but it's nice to know I'll have something at the end of the day to calm my ass down.

However, would antacids also reduce hydrolysis of Vyvanse into dextroamphetamine? If so, perhaps an antacid could be taken some time after Vyvanse ingestion to allow the lisdexamfetamine dimesylate to fully convert into the active amphetamine? Any suggestions, ideas? Either way, 50 mg Vyvanse feels very much like 30 mg of Adderall but actually smoother, so far at least. This is my first day on it, and 5 hours post ingestion, the effects are very pronounced and euphoric. It is definitely not useless, and certainly could be abused. It does not feel inferior to Adderall at all. I haven't tried pure dextroamphetamine, so I know not how it compares to that.

I have been prescribed Adderall XR as well as Vyvanse and Adderall instant releases in a time spanning from 2013 until now...

I can definitely say that without question as long as you have the self-control to be on them and take them correctly Adderall instant releases are by far the most effective at least for myself.

everyone thinks that Vyvanse is a miracle but I have heard horror stories about it.  I had my two instant release Adderall change to a 60 milligram Vyvanse once a day about two years ago and it took one month before I told them I would not take the Vyvanse anymore. the stuff just does not make you feel normal.  everyone else I know that is ever been prescribed Vyvanse has bad stories about the way it reacts with them and they ended up asking to be taken off of it or put on something different.

if you have to take any of these medications... from my experience, the easiest to wield is Adderall instant release.  you see people on these forums trying to compare prescription medications to illegal substances and to be honest I don't understand that but I am 30 years old and already had my chance to live a - lot while in the Marine Corps until 2011.  

if you are going to the doctor to walk around in a euphoric state all day every day you are going to the doctor for the wrong reason.  people already know this and they get irritated when they hear people tell them what they already know. these medications aren't meant to allow you to walk around high all day....

I wanted to second this post. The reality is that so many millions of people are in need of these medications just to function at a fair or " normal " level with the rest of the world not afflicted with ADD or ADHD. I unfortunately suffer from ADD mainly with a touch of the ADHD as my fingers fumble and feet need to constantly move ( shake ) if I am not medicated. I also can not sit in one spot for more then 15-20 minutes with out getting up if not medicated. I am in my early 40's and have had this as long as I can recall.  I see so many people seeking advice about how to "get off" on Adderall and it really makes me LOL. I mean the drug is missing the one methyl group for a reason. Hello. It just is not doing the same thing at the same rate of absorption in the brain cells so you will NEVER get the same effect of the street drugs with these medications. It is rather dangerous and playing with your life to attempt it. I am 200+ lbs and 6ft+ tall and 40 mg is my maximum dose per day to resolve symptoms and keep me in a rather normal emotional state. The frustration  I get when watching videos on YouTube and reading posts by people comparing or trying to make Adderall and Ritalin type medications equal to or in the same category with Street made methamphetamine is rather over whelming at times. It makes people like me jump through hoops every-time we move or have to see a new treating physician for the first time. BTW technology is advancing to the point there are now types of brain imaging that can definitively rule out ADD/ADHD so get ready for the medication to not be given out to people that simply lie and deceive to get them.

In a week i go back to be put on an adhd medication my doc knows i was on meth but i have been clean for over a month now. Yay me cause thats a lifetime on the meth world...anyways i told the doc that meth helped me focused would that lead him most likely in the adderall or Vyvanse direction? I have taken Vyvanse from someone i know before and i told them i didn't feel a damn thing while they are over there washing their cars and getting there life in order and im like well i need some meth then you guys suck! Point is i didn't feel anything but thirsty and lazy...plus Vyvanse has no generic my nephew used to be on it and it was $273 for a 30 day supply or 30 pills... what is the generic for adderall? Id rather have the doc give me adderall? I need stimulating meds thats how my brain works... even though i can take 12 klonopin or xanax and still walk straight and am functional which ppl never understood  (not anymore im being a good girl and staying straight ) BUT IS TELL PPL I GOT EFFIN ANXIETY PPL JUST CAUSE IM NOT ROCKIN THE CORNER DOESNT MEAN IM NOT FOREEAL! DAMN! anyway thats for another post.... QUESTION WAS.... SINCE MY DOC KNOWS THAT METH HELPS ME FOCUS WHICH WAY WOULD HE MOST LIKELY LEAN WITH THE ADHD MEDS?

We don't discuss how to get meds from doctors in this sense on BL, but to put your question to rest, it is HIGHLY unlikely a doctor who knows you have a fondness for non-prescription methamphetmine will prescribe you ADHD medication on that basis. To qualify for treatment with ADHD medication, one would need to be first evaluated by a qualified diagnostician with a referral to the appropriate treatment based on their results.

Then go for it! Hopefully you get what you need med wise. I believe I have read somewhere that Ritalin was essentially submitted for methamphetamine with positive results. Perhaps see what he thinks about trying something with that drug in it.

I do not recommend re-dosing (Taking more before you come down from the initial dose) because it is a waste and will just make you stay awake longer, not any higher. If you want to get high on amphetamines, I just recommend you don't start. It can lead to addiction. However, having said that Vyvanse is special and different from Adderall in quite an intelligent way actually. Adderall is Dextramphetamine, while Vyvanse is Lis-dextramphetamine. It may seem like a small difference but it changes the way you can take it entirely. The "lis-" part is a protein (Lysine) that was added on so that the pill must be swallowed to allow the liver to break off the protein (essentially, it doesn't exactly work like that) but then it becomes Dextramphetamine. That way you cannot insufflate, inject, smoke, or do anything other than take it orally. This helps prevent abuse. But I would recommend staying around 80mg or lower because I, personally, am 160Lbs and 80mg does the trick. It is "safe" (You'll live but damage may occur) to take more, but I don't know the threshold or what the dangers are so you may want to research safe doses for your weight and age. 


That being said, even just taking 80mg, waiting til it kicks in, and smoking a nice indica heavy medical marijuana strain. It feels very relaxing and the Vyvanse stops the heavy sleep inducing effects from the indica so you just feel really damn high but pretty awake, If you smoke the right strain toward the end of your trip it will help with the come down. Vyvanse makes me, and many others that I know quite agitated and aggresive on the come down and it helps relax you so that you aren't as much of an asshole and you feel nice and relaxed rather than angry. 


If you have trouble sleeping, I recommend either smoking more Marijuana to basically make yourself passout, or use Melatonin or other over the counter sleep aides. But again with those, (speaking of the other sleep aides, Melatonin is safe in doses as much as 50-80mg but can result in vivid or bad nightmares from high doses since a normal dose is 3mg-5mg.) be careful because in high doses they are dangerous and can be addictive as well. 


Sorry for the long post and lots of info, I am currently on 80mg Vyvanse myself, and high. Unfortunately I couldn't get medical quality, but its still decent if I smoke enough.

I will say that a little herb does help with sleep but I found t to on do so if used sparingly. 


I wouldnt call dextroamphetimine a trip, I prefer to it as a life changer that has changed my life for the better starting some 10+ years ago. If only it worked when I was a kid, instead it just gave me anxiety and I felt like I couldn't breath at times and I had no clue that the medication wasn't suppose to work like that.

I remember taking these highly dosed melatonin pills to sleep and the first time, I had a wet dream so I shrugged it off the first time and said "it was because I drank copious amounts of water", but then the second time I did it, I concluded that the novel tryptmine can have some shitty side effects.

I have recently been prescribed Vyvanse for my ADD and sleep disorder. For the past 14 years I've been on Adderall XR and different dosages through the years as well as becoming tolerant as hell which in turn I started self-dosing and running out early. My XR's only ever lasted 4 hours so I would redose every 4 hours and was taking overall 60-70mg total a day.

I've been researching the crap out of hacks and tips and educating myself on everything to do with my meds and duration and how to make them last longer etc so I am well aware of the ph balance thing.

But being new to Vyvanse it's hard to get used to the fact that it's different than adderall as far as not working for an hour or 2 because it's not activated until it hits the bloodstream so it's a new routine for me to work around, I started a few months ago on 30mg Vyvanse then 60mg and now 70mg. I also have 10mg IR adderall for boosters because my vyvanse only lasts approx 4 hours, then I get a headache (anyone else?) and I've resorted to redosing vyvanse with pre-split 70mg caps (so 35mg vyvanse) and take it approx 2.5 hours after my last dose to keep it going .......... does anyone else do this?

Trying to make my vyvanse last longer but not run out of my script faster and my doc will only prescribe it once a day. I used to love my adderall but honestly now I try to wait as long as I can to take it because of the harshness and how the crash 2 hours later is worse- I rather just keep dosing vyvanse all day!

Just be careful with dosing Vyvanse all day. I never thought a psychotic break could happen like I experienced, but it did.


I'm no longer on Vyvanse because it triggered paranoia. Today I was prescribed Adderall IR 15 mg in the morning. It will help me concentrate and get more things done. I'm not interested in abusing it. I haven't had Adderall in many years and I forgot about the miserable comedown. I'll see how it goes.

longest lasting medicine/combo for tolerant stim user with ADD & sleep disorder


I've been on adderall for over 14 years for add and have had sleep issues since then as well. A recent sleep study showed I don't get enough stage 3 sleep and my stimulant meds are now being prescribed by my sleep doctor. I was introduced to vyvanse. worked my way up to 70mg and 10 addy ir twice a day from previous 20xr once a day 10ir once a day.

The vyvanse does actually keep me awake but still feels like it wears off too fast just like my adderall xr did. I need the duration to last to help me through my 12 hour work shifts and productivity at home.

When I am off meds i almost fall asleep driving. it's bad. 

What else would last 12+ hours? Any combo or special dosing regimine?

What about dexedrine instead of adderall ir? 

I'd like something similar to adderall.

I prefer Dexedrine to Adderall in every conceivable way. I'd say it's worth a shot, definitely bring it up to your doc.

I have BP2 and we suspect Add or adhd. We are going to test for this soon. You say this also helps with your BO? If so that is great news! I hope I have the same results. I hope I can get my doctor to prescribe V for me as well. Do you have any advice as to how I can get him to use this specific medicine for me? Thanks MELZ1108

Howdy Melz, welcome and glad you're finding helpful advice.  


Just a reminder to everyone, even though it hasn't been a problem, we can't give advice on how to get specific scripts.  We don't want anyone to look like they're trying to mislead their doctor, even if it's all well-meaning.  


Broad good-faith generalizations are OK.

That was from November 27th when I was first prescribed Adderall IR 15 mg in the morning. So it's been about 4 months with only 15mg in the morning. 


Saw the psychiatrist today and asked for an afternoon dose. She told me the Adderall IR would stay in my system 9-10 hours, uh no! The Adderall IR wears off in a few hours. I don't know where she's getting her info from, but you have to play along with doctors to a certain extent. I told her an afternoon dose would not disrupt my sleep whatsoever. It took some convincing, but today she decided to do 12.5 mg am and 12.5 in the afternoon. That way it's twice a day and not only once in the morning. Just glad I got through to her. 


The pharmacy had to order 12.5 mg Adderall for twice a day which should be available tomorrow. 


The psychiatrist is mistaken thinking Adderall IR lasts 9-10 hours. You won't feel anything after a few hours. Bottom line. So I'll wait until tomorrow to get 60 (instead of 30 pills) for am and pm. At least it worked out.


Best thing about Adderall IR is no suicidal comedown like with Adderall XR. Every one is different though.

Amphetamine has a half-life of around ten hours.  There's plenty still in you in the afternoon.  How long it works for your focus depends on dosage.  


Before you had 450mg of mixed amphetamine salts a month, now you get 750mg/month, 66% increase in daily allowance.


I hope it works; tolerance is nasty, and a bid dose means it'll come faster.  Before you'd come down every night, start the day at zero.  Now you'll always have some in you, never taking a break.  


If you take it together, you'll get more high than therapy, which means a comedown every evening.  If you need it for work/school, try to stick with a dose you can't actually "feel".


A 30mg Vyvanse will give you more dextroamphetamine than your 15mg Adderall, btw.  A 70mg vyvanse will give you a fat smear of twice the base amphetamine as your new 25mg dosing.

Thank you for the explanation! What I was trying to tell her is even though the Adderall IR lasts in your system, I don't actually "feel" the concentration and motivation after about 4 hours. There isn't a nasty comedown, it's like a bit of a tired feeling and no focus. I can tell it has worn off. 


The worst comedown was from Adderall XR, not IR like I have. 


I tried Vyvanse before the Adderall. Vyvanse triggered paranoid psychosis. It was the worst experience of my life and I ended up in the hospital with a new diagnosis of bipolar 1 with ADHD. I thought my family were conspiring against me and that the government was after me. It didn't help that I was learning about different things going on in government so it spooked me big time and made me extremely paranoid along with the Vyvanse.


Thank you for the suggestion, but Adderall IR is working well and absolutely no paranoia. I'm lucky my psychiatrist even let me try another amphetamine, but the hospitalization from Vyvanse was close to 2 years ago and I think she trusts me because she's seeing improvement and I'm in a steady relationship.


Just want to mention, the best thing for Adderall comedown and even withdrawals is Gabapentin. Lyrica would work too I suppose, but I only have Gabapentin. It smooths everything out and makes you feel normal and stable. It's been a lifesaver for withdrawals.

Well, now I'm worried that you're taking a half dose of something that not long ago caused a psychotic episode requiring hospitalization.  I imagine if you're bipolar you're also on medication for it, hopefully, and amphetamine doesn't usually work with those on board.


Plus, one of the big precipitators of mania (aka psychotic episode) is disturbed sleep, something amphetamines are known to do once in a while.

Recently was forced to switch to vyvanse. I initially didn't mind it, but now it's very hit or miss. Has ups and downs. Whereas adderall was predictable I knew when the comedown would happen, with vyvanse I'll think I'm coming down then get hit with a little and it's just an irritable feeling.


Once I go back to adderall I'll never be touching this stuff again. It may work for some but not for me.

Thank you for your concern, but Adderall IR doesn't make me paranoid at all. Vyvanse did. I'm no longer on Vyvanse.

The psychiatrist was worried that an afternoon dose of Adderall IR could possibly keep me awake, but I've experimented in the past by taking one in the afternoon and I was still able to sleep like a baby at night. 


Like if I take Adderall IR at 2 pm, I'm already "down" from it by 6 or 7 pm. I don't sleep till 10 or 11 pm anyway.


Adderall does wonders for my ADHD and lifts me out of a depression. It's like a smooth energy and focus, nothing hyper like with mania.

Yeah, it's best to stick with what works well with your chemistry. With Adderall, some prefer IR and others prefer XR. I just remember the worst suicidal comedown from XR when I took it in my early 20s. Back then, I didn't even know an IR version existed. I'm never going back to XR.

I am always surprised by the hate Vyvanse gets, considering it's the purest available, and the strongest.  Most people who have an adverse reaction would think of the levo-amphetamine in their Adderall, with its still-unexplained quad-salt racemic mixture.


Some might recognize that a single broad crest of absorbed drug would be a lot more "even" and predictable in its effects, especially considering Vyvanse isn't affected by what you eat for breakfast, like both Adderall IR and XR.  I think it's got the highest concentration maxima too.


Speaking of breakfast, I think half the kids out there complaining about what they think is a comedown are really feeling their blood sugar plummet, after it was held artificially high with the drug, and they weren't hungry enough to eat lunch.  A long acting version helps with that.


Hopefully, everyone realizes that an active ingredient is not transmutated into something chemically alien in your brain when you switch the letters after the brand.


But dang it, you just can't snort Vyvanse, can you.  Doesn't have the same resale value.

Something that I didn't know for the longest time is that with all stimulants, acidic drinks should be avoided. I was clueless about that. I used to take it with a soft drink or fruit juice and that stops the medicine from being absorbed properly. 


Found this somewhere on the intranets: 


"All of the stimulant-class medications are moderately strong bases (pH 12-13). If these medications are present in the lumen of the gut with organic acids such as citric acid or ascorbic acid (vitamin C), the stimulant medication is ionized and cannot be absorbed from the gut into the blood stream. The following foods should be avoided for 1 hour before and after taking a dose of stimulant class medication:

Citrus fruit

Citrus juices

Fruit juices with citric acid as a preservative

Sodas/carbonated beverages

Kool Aid, lemonade, Gatorade

Poptarts, granola bars, breakfast bars,

Oral suspension medications

Vitamins and food supplements containing vitamin C."

Some stimulant medications like amphetamine are alkaloids with a pKa around 9.5, same as most amino acids.  Unique to meth/amph is that acidic foods reduce their absorption.


This isn't true for Vyvanse, which isn't amphetamine in your guts, but actually lisdexamphetamine, which looks like a weird dipeptide to your body.  It's absorbed in a different way, and not affected by intestinal pH to the same extent.


From the Adderall XR package insert, I found this graph of concentration over time for XR and IR dosing:


![](https://i.imgur.com/AIXhEGP.png)


You can see that they're indistinguishable.  Or, a hold of about an hour before the 2nd IR dose kicks in.

Very interesting, thanks for the chart! I'm only going to take it with water from now on. 

I've read about people taking Tums 30 minutes before Adderall in order to reduce the acid in stomach and make the medicine last longer, something like that. It works for some, but others said it gave them the worst headache ever for the whole day and only increased side effects. I'm not going to take any chances.

No, absorbed with amide to lysine still intact.  Hydrolysis happens in red blood cells, long after absorption.


Minuscule chance of hydrolysis occurring in gastric phase, but that probably takes enzymatic assistance.  I don't think anything specifically cleaves KF bonds.

It's quite the misunderstood drug for one. I think most of the hate it gets is from people used to amphetamine formulations that weren't in a pro-drug form, which is new to them. People switched from their beloved adderal or dexedrine to 'yet another new drug', I'm sure there's a psychological factor somewhere there. There certainly are people who prefer lisdexamphetamine over other forms of amphetamine, perhaps they just aren't as vocal on the internet? If we make a fair comparison (equivalent amount of base to base, IV RoA to eliminate bioavailability variances) Vyvanse will end up having a lower Cmax and longer Tmax by the virtue of it's nature as a pro-drug, when compared to d-amphetamine sulphate for example. There may be individual metabolic variance at play which affects either of the drugs positively or negatively, for me though Vyvanse has always been the reliable one, with the onset of effects beginning at the same time like a clockwork at least.

I always prefer dex amp in any form over things with mix salts and such.  Granted I have found that doctors do not like to prescribe straight dexadrine, always going for the adderall.  Makes me wonder if they added the levo amp to adderall to cause all the tension in your muscles.

If someone were to shoot Vyvanse, it would get converted into amphetamine in their blood, no stomach needed.


Your red blood cells do the conversion, not your stomach or your liver.  But it means you won't get any kind of IV rush, you'd still have to wait for the conversion to happen.  So there's no point in doing it by IV.

The purest would be Dexedrine, pure Dextroamphetamine. I would switch from adderall XR to that in a second if my doctor would prescribe it. Or I would at least try it as D-Amp is far superior and without the negative side effects. Vyvanse just doesn't translate to that for me.


I bodybuild so my blood sugar is something I monitor daily as I want to be as insulin sensitive as possible, and I'm eating 5-6 meals a day. The only way I can explain vyvanse compared to adderall is it lingers and is an uncomfortable up and down feeling. At least with adderall I know when and what to expect, and depending on how my diet/nutrition is, how effective it will typically be.


Edit: I will say I'm not going to completely rule it out, that would be ignorant, because body chemistry changes. For example I use to hate XR and only like IR. One day I may end up loving vyvanse in comparison. I also ran the same dose as my xr dose so maybe a small increase, say 30mg of vyvanse I would have better experience with.

I would avoid taking tums or baking soda with adderall to potentiate the effects. Short term yes it works but eventually it?s going to offset the pH balance in your gut and you will start producing more stomach acid, then can interfere with the medication further. Just take it with a normal breakfast and don?t overthink the whole acidity thing. I advise against taking it with orange juice or vitamin c tablets but a breakfast with some acid producing foods isn?t going to render the med useless. You will typically barely notice a difference.


 In the mornings I take my Adderall with 5 whole eggs or a cup of eggwhites, a half cup of oatmeal(unless I'm going lower carb), and usually a cup of "acidic" coffee lol. It still works fine.


  My theory with headaches and negative side effects many people complain of with adhd meds is due to lack of hydration and a lacking diet. My gf would go all morning without eating and probably only have a coffee and then text complaining she doesn?t feel well, head hurts etc.. of course she is going to feel like shit! Then your body produces more cortisol and other things which can lead to fat gain and hormonal imbalance effecting mood and well being further. (That's greatly simplified btw lol)

You understand that Vyvanse becomes pure d-amphetamine right there in your blood, right?


I find steady levels of amphs help maintain steady (too high) levels of blood sugar.  But I know how fickle that is, and not sure why I keep talking like a salesman for this shit.  Eat whatever amphs you want kids.


ETA: but agree, skip the tums, it'll just be adding salt to your dehydrated body.

Exactly.  Amphs raise blood sugar, but make you skip meals.  You're gonna crash at the end just from blood sugar issues.

Yes I know the lisodex converts. In theory that sounds great, the bodies pH doesn't effect it etc. but it feels nothing like d-amp for me.


I see what you're saying though, kids can't abuse it, and for a good majority of people it is the superior med.

Hello


Haven't posted on here for quite some time. I didn't have time to read  the whole thread so I am unaware if someone has already suggested this.


Wondering if required dose was placed in large spoon. Add some protienagous (sp?) enzyme to the water. Stirr (not shaken) and wait a minute or two  and theoretically viola-uncongigated dextroamphetamine ready to go. Sorry about the spelling-spellcheck?


My current best theory. Haven't tried it.  Anyone have?

Never tried it and don't care to. If I am going to take vyvanse it's going to be the oral route as it's intended. I wouldn't want to lose any of the active ingredient.


I guess it could work by trypsin and a buffer, but again you could lose active ingredient. I have never tried it though, and don't know what temp it would need to be etc..

Thing is, trypsin cuts after lysine, and should do the job no problem.  but that's not what happens in your body.  Trypsin is excreted by your pancreas (as a kind of pro-enzyme) but for some reason doesn't do the bulk of the hydrolysis.  


You can buy trypsin and other proteases as a supplement, for people with chronic pancreatitis.  I wonder if even using fresh pineapple or papaya juice would do it.   But then I'd have to look up what papain cleaves and I don't feel like it.  I'm sure there are hundreds of sites with threads on using enzymatic cleavage.  A lot easier, I'm sure, to just eat it, and use the enzymes already in you.

I?ve found 2x dosing of vyvanse e.g. 30mg at 8am and 30mg at 11am works better than taking the whole dose at once first thing in the morning. If it take anything over 30mg at once my eyes become laggy but I don?t have this problem when splitting the dose.


The only problem is even when I take the second dose at 11am, I won?tget to sleep until 4am later, so the next day is a write off.


Does anyone have any tips for getting to sleep after vyvanse without more meds?


I feel Vyvanse really sorts out a deficiency of dopamine production that I have in my pre frontal cortex. I feel how a normal person must feel - focused, not spaced out, calm, in control, I don?t get embarrassed and go bright red. Only problem with is it can be inconsistent, there can be crashes, I can get jittery and of course the sleep issues.


Vyvanse has shown me what life can be like (it?s not a euphoric or high feeling, it?s just an enhanced me, at work and socially). The peak effect however seems to be 1-2hr after taking and it slowly fades after that.


I may have to try adderall XR, unfortunately Dex spansules aren?t available in the UK and Dex ir is really really bad for me - even when it is working it feels nothing like Vyvanse at all.

I suggest taking your first dose early 8am then a second vyvanse dose around 9-10. That would help with the sleep issue. At least it has for me. It's a lingering drug for sure, feels out of my system but still unable to sleep. I'm just so used to that steep adderall comedown it was easier to plan for. I can definitely see vyvanses place, and that in the long run would be more therapeutic.

Any one else notice how Adderall doesn't work at all if you don't get enough rest? I was up early today, I could've used about 2 more hours of sleep. I took my medicine and didn't really feel it at all. If anything, I felt really sad and empty. It was a reminder of how important it is to get a full night of sleep or the medicine will be ineffective for the day.

How similar is Vyvanse to time release 12 hour Dexadrine and time release 12 hour Adderall?


I realized that either I'm pretty sensitive or my doctor prescribed too much cause he gave me 20mg instant release Adderalls and they started causing me to have really bad panic attacks (I should add that I did also experiment with doses as high as 40mgs).


I started cutting the pills into 4ths and halves and realized that the proper dose for me is really between 5-10mgs and anything more than that makes me freak the fuck out.


My friend suggested I try to get a prescription for the lowest milligram Vyvanse which is 10mg because it would slowly release into my system and be gentler but still give me energy so I'd like to try it, but my doctor thinks that (even though he's willing to prescribe it) my insurance might not cover it, which would mean that it would just be too expensive.


He's also willing to prescribe 12 hour time release Dexadrine and 12 hour time release Adderall, both of which my insurance will pay for, and so next time I see him if I find out my insurance won't pay for the Vyvanse I'm going to try for one of those.


How different really are the effects of Vyvanse from a similar mg dosage of time release Dexadrine or time release Adderall?


Would they be fairly comparable and probably able to give somewhat similar, gentler but more consistent results with those dosages rather that would be less likely to cause anxiety than the full blast of instant release 20-40mg Adderalls which cause me to have panic attacks??

10mg of vyvanse should basically be unnoticeable to an adult human. That's equivalent to 4mg of d-amphetamine. Unless you were planning to re-dose them, in which case, yeah, they might be too expensive for your insurance to cover (vyvanse is officially intended to be a once-per-day solution, and each pill is priced accordingly).


**Vyvanse (lisdexamphetamine) is not a time-release formulation, it is a pro-drug, so its molar mass is different from regular amphetamine.** In fact, the lysine portion makes up roughly 60% of the mass of a lisdexamphetamine molecule, so 70mg of vyvanse = ~30mg of dexedrine. Converting vyvanse to adderall is harder, because vyvanse metabolizes into d-amphetamine, whereas adderall is pretty much a 3:1 mix of d- and l-amphetamine.

Someone who benefits from the l-amphetamine portion of adderall might find 70mg of vyvanse roughly equivalent to 30mg of XR adderall. Someone who'd do better on pure d-amphetamine might find it to be equivalent to 40mg of XR adderall, with less anxiety-inducing side-effects.


Now, unlike "true" extended release drugs, vyvanse doesn't release amphetamine at a constant rate, but it is still considered a very smooth experience due to the very gradual come-up and come-down. In fact, XR adderall or dexedrine might hit you quicker because these kinds of pills are often formulated in such a way that part of the dose is released instantly, to allow for a quicker come-up.


I'm still unclear on what your actual daily dose of adderall is, though? Are you only taking a quarter to a half of a 20mg adderall per day, so your total daily dose is just 5-10mg? Or are you basically taking the whole 20mg tablet over the course of the day, just divided into 4 doses of 5mg?


If the latter is the case, I would suggest switching to 40mg of vyvanse, or 15mg dexedrine spansules.

When you say this:  "10mg of vyvanse should basically be unnoticeable to an adult human. That's equivalent to 4mg of d-amphetamine"...**do you mean 4mgs over the course of about 12 hours?  Or 4mgs in a 4 hour time frame? ** 


Because I can tell you I most DEFINITELY can and do react very well to 4mgs or so taken every 4 hours and that's probably an ideal dose for me.


**But if you mean 4mgs over the course of 12 hours?  Yeah, that's nothing.**


Well AT FIRST I COMPLETELY fucked up and didn't only try 20mg pills in one shot, but even 40mgs, and FREAKED THE FUCK OUT (I'm a VERY anxious person who also wants to quit coffee (but can't) and that causes me anxiety.


So regardless of what I am on i am drinking at least 6 cups of coffee which makes me freak out worse (actually, you will probably say I am crazy, but one reason I want the right dose of amphetamine is to quit coffee (I've done it MANY times before WITHOUT getting dependent on Dexadrine either, just fucked up again and got addicted to coffee again...I was able to do it with 2.5-5mg Dex tabs in 7 days and when I did it I was able to cut my Klonopin dosage down by 75% which is another motivation).


Anyways, to answer your question: once I realized my body could not handle 20mgs or even 15mgs of Adderall in one dose, I went down to 10mgs, but that was still too much.


The pills can only be divided evenly into 4ths, so that means anything below 5mgs won't break off evenly and you are taking tiny crumbs which is no good.


Today I even freaked out on approximately 9mgs of Adderall (I did also have 7 cups of coffee though LOL...NO QUESTION that makes it worse...)


I also freaked out on 7.5 mgs, but when it comes to that dose, 7.5 in 4 hours is about the most I can handle and MAYBE not flip out if I also take my Klonopin.


I**t seems that I REALLY should not have any more than 5mgs of either Adderall or Dexadrine in my system in a 4 hour period, and i'd probably be better off with 2.5mgs in that period, but in general, 5mgs SHOULD be ok if I were just to drink a little less fucking coffee.


So what I have been doing is trying to take 5mgs of Adderall 2-3 times a day, and I don't want to do it every day, or even every other day...as little as possible.**


So based on that....what would your dosage suggestion be for 1) overall dosage and would you suggest 2) Vyvanse  3) Extended release Dex or 4) Extended Release Adderall??


Also, again, 5) is there truly a big difference between the way that a comparable dose of Vyvanse feels to extended release Dexadrine or extended release Adderall and  6) does that dosage chance dramatically if I have to choose extended release Dex/Adderall over the Vyvanse?


7)  would you suggest extended release of anything basically over the short blast of an instant release pill, regardless of what it is for someone as anxious and sensitive to stimulants as I am?


Let me remind you again, I basically can't tolerate anything more than the equivalent of 5mgs of Dex/Adderall in my system over the course of a 4 hour period without risking a panic attack, but when I stick to 5mgs or less and don't drink too much coffee I often get good results.


(Sorry just a couple more questions...):  8 if your first suggestion happens to be Vyvanse but my insurance won't cover it, what would your second suggestion be for what I am looking for in terms of A) dosage B) Dex (instant or extended)  C) Adderall (obviously MUCH lower dosage than what I'm on, instant or extended).


And 9) ** if I did choose to take 40mgs of Vyvanese **(sorry these questions are endless...) and it lasts about 12 hours, **approximately how many mgs of Dexadrine or Adderall do you think it might feel equivalent to in each 4 hour time frame??** 


(I reference stimulants that way since both IR Dex and Adderall last about 4 hours...)


**Actually, when I was much younger I was prescribed 5mg pills of Dexadrine and functioned quite well on just taking 2.5mgs every 4 hours about 3 times a day, but sometimes I'd go up to 5mgs...so perhaps I should ask for that again since I trust it more experience wise?**


**And just so you know, I think I react WAY better to Dexadrine than Adderall.**


Thanks

A total dose of 10 mg of adderall spread out over the day should be equivalent to a single 20mg vyvanse capsule taken in the morning. If anxiety is your main issue and your insurance will cover 1 capsule of vyvanse per day, this would be a good choice.

As I said, vyvanse is much weaker per miligram because more than half of the mass of each vyvanse molecule comes from the lysine. Again, 10 mg of vyvanse = ~4 mg extended release dexedrine.

You probably can't go wrong with 10 mg of extended release dexedrine either. If you're already drinking coffee, I seriously doubt you need the extra adrenergic stimulation from the l-amphetamine in adderall.

I'd expect 40 mg of vyvanse to feel equivalent to about... a total of about ~15mg of IR dexedrine or 20mg IR adderall, taken over the course of ~6-8 hours. Hard to say exactly, because vyvanse has a pretty slow initial come-up.


It's hard to say what works best for each individual patient.


Even ER capsules often aren't "purely" ER, but represent a compromise where a portion of the dose is still released instantly.

Some prefer vyvanse's very smooth and gradual come-up, where they can take the pill and only feel the onset of the effects 2 hours later. Others prefer to have a regular ER capsule that gives them an ever-so-small jolt of energy right after taking it, and keeps them at a relatively constant level of mild stimulation for the rest of the day. Others prefer the flexibility of being to able to re-dose small amounts of the IR version throughout the day as needed.

If it's worked for you in the past, then yes, I see no reason why it wouldn't work for you. If having to re-dose small amounts isn't inconvenient for you, then spreading out two 5 mg pills of dexedrine over the course of the day seems like a perfectly sensible - not to mention very economical - solution for your issues.

Has anyone ever noticed inconsistency in the amount of powder in each capsule? Some googling brought up a few threads in other forums with various speculations on the issue though no definitive answer. 


I am prescribed 60mg daily and noticed this morning that the capsules range from being nearly full to half full of the powder, a rather large difference. Now the next logical step would be to weigh the capsules and see if there is a major discrepancy as this was just by holding up to the light. Unfortunately I had to leave for work and have not had the chance yet but will tonight. 


Before I go accusing the pharmacist of pinching the powder perhaps there is something I'm not aware of like condensing etc? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Alright well I weighed them and they all weigh 200mg (capsule and contents) despite the appearance of visual inconsistencies. One weighed 220mg. 


Upon further inspection I noticed a few actually seem to have a plug of powder stuck in the middle giving it the appearance of being half full when you flip it over each way. 


I also weighed some old 40mg caps and they weigh 200mg as well.


On a different topic I will say that I love vyvanse and it has changed my life over the past year I've been on it. However, consistently I only get 5 - 6 hours out of each dose. I know the d-amp is still in my body but subjectively it drops off hard and I literally can go to sleep at that point. 


I've talked to my psychiatrist about it and he is adamant that increasing the dosage will increase the duration, hence the jump from 40mg to 60mg. But it just feels like I get a stronger peak effect without an increase in duration. At this time he is not open to adding an IR booster dose in the afternoon. Many days are spent trying not to redose, which I have done and been able to sleep just fine. Taking another of course leaves me without for a day. Hell, maybe that's a good thing for tolerance sake. Some mighty fine rationalization there lol.


I try to hold off taking it in the morning so the effects will last through the day but it's very difficult for me to do. I work 10 - 12 hour shifts and it really helps me in the morning as well. 


I've also tried splitting the dose ~30mg at 7am and again at 12pm. This obviously increased the duration but the peak effect of each dose was incredibly diminished as to be expected. After being used to 60mg at once it was not nearly as effective. Also, just a pain in the ass. 


I eat consistently throughout the day, stay hydrated etc. I wish there was a reasonable way to increase the duration or that I was one of those people that actually get 9-12 hours out of it. I'm almost not wanting to take it because it's so difficult to deal with the drop off but the positive aspects still outweigh the negative.

I have to agree that Vyvanse unfortunately doesn't feel as tolerable as dexedrine ER/IR, or even adderall. It feels more anxiogenic to me than any other amp preparation. The only thing it really has going for it in my eyes is that it seems to last a bit longer than Adderall XR or Dex spansules. 


I don't think it's trash, but I couldn't take it anywhere near a daily basis as I do with dexedrine.

With Aderrall IR, I'm going through my script too fast. Ugh, addiction sucks. I try to hold out and not take too many, but tolerance builds and your brain tells you "Take more!"

I feel like I'm not quite "myself" on it and I couldn't even enjoy the woods with my b/f because I was disconnected from nature and its beauty. 


It turned on me eventually. 


Today I took only half of a 12.5 mg IR pill and actually I feel fine! Not all tweaked out, but that's only because I'm not tempted with a full bottle since I'm down to only another half of pill and that's it. If I could keep a low dose like that, it would be great. 


When I see the psychiatrist soon, I'm going to tell her not to write me another script for Adderall IR. Time to try something different. I don't know what though. At least it didn't make me paranoid at all like Vyvanse did. If you can't control your dosage, time to let it go, right? Time for me to anyway. I want to feel my spirit again.

20 mg IR Adderall is a really high starting dose! No wonder you freaked out. I have 12.5 mg IR pills. Ask your doc for 5 mg IR pills next time, that's the lowest dose. 


Vyvanse made me paranoid so if you do try that one and see any signs of paranoia, stop using it.


I can't sort through your other posts right now, but PLEASE stop drinking so much coffee with the Adderall. It's a very dangerous combination with all that caffeine.

No Adderall today, but I feel even better than I did while on it because of Adrafinil. I had some 300 mg caps left from many months ago. Took one of those and I feel clear-headed and with clean, smooth energy. Not hopped up like Adderall.


I told my b/f I'm quitting and he's supportive which is wonderful. I was afraid of losing him because I was so used to getting my personality and motivation from a drug.


Not going to demonize Adderall because it worked really well until it didn't. Just please be sure to recognize when there are more negatives than positives on it: like constantly feeling the need to increase dose and chase that feeling you had at the beginning. Only the negatives will become more apparent like irritability, feeling cold/angry towards people and your significant other, low sex drive, not wanting to eat all day or exercise like you should, feeling disconnected from the world around you, wanting to isolate more. 


Just be careful guys. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Do people find vyvanse (or any Rx amphetamine) more therapeutic if used daily as prescribed or like doubling doses a few days of the month and taking a few days off? 


As I posted above, vyvanse doesn't last long enough for me and I often feel compelled to redose in the afternoon. Considering creating a regimen of mostly 1 capsule/day, 2 capsules/day for like 4 days, and 4 days off to reset. idk, just thinking

I find that taking my PRESCRIBED dose only when needed is the best route. So 1-2 times a week. Best way to keep tolerance down. Doubling doses will eventually lead you on to more and more, as well as taking it daily will lead to tolerance.


Just my experience. Many will disagree.

Thank you. I think it's just realizing you can't live that way anymore. The scary thing is when you start to believe your identity is in the pill and you feel like you can't live without it. Something in my spirit said "That pill is NOT your identity! Your identity comes from God."


I believe that's why people stay a slave to Adderall for too long and even kill themselves when they can no longer get it because their entire identity is wrapped up in it. I hope people know there are other options. That's why I've been mentioning Adrafinil. It really helped after quitting. There were absolutely no withdrawals.


I laugh without it feeling forced, it's genuine. I look in the mirror and see myself again. I'm not all frowned up like on Adderall because I was constantly over-analyzing everything. I feel my spirit again. There is freedom on the other side for those who feel stuck and desperate on it. That's all. Thanks again.

The weird thing is that most other people seem to be saying that Vyvanse is LESS anxiogenic than Dex or Adderall.


That's the reason I'm interested in trying it, cause everyone says it is smoother.

Really?  Why? You think it can cause heart attacks or strokes or something?


Cause my doctor said not to be too concerned about the combo of coffee and Adderall, but I do notice how much anxiety I get when I combine a lot of caffeine with it.


Actually, I really want to use Dex/Adderall or Vyvanse to cut down on or quit coffee.  Some might say it is odd logic, but I used Dex to quit coffee many years ago but eventually got addicted to coffee again, and me personally, I think I am better off without drinking coffee cause of my anxiety.


Then again, I don't know if I can believe everything this doctor says, cause he said Adderall doesn't increase blood pressure or heart rate, but I have a hard time believing that can possibly be true, but he's a very legit doctor who's be known in his field for years, so I have a hard time believing he could be wrong.

So do people REALLY feel like Vyvanse is "smoother" and less anxiety-producing than Dexadrine and Adderall?


I know I don't like Adderall very much now and react better to Dexadrine, but Vyvanse sounds interesting, so I can't decide what I should ask for this month.


The other thing I want to know is: do Adderall and other related stimulants cause really bad withdrawal symptoms?


i mean I shouldn't be asking people who aren't doctors because my doctor already told me last month before he prescribed me Adderall that they don't usually, and that he knows people who have taken them regularly for years and gotten off without withdrawal, but a friend of mine told me that even though they don't usually cause real withdrawal, that you can have a few days of lethargy after you stop if you've been using too much.


I've been using about 5mgs of Adderall about twice a day  5 days a week for the last month, so will I likely get bad lethargy when stopping?


I'm thinking it shouldn't be too bad right?


But I'm still most of all wondering whether or not I'm going to want Vyvanse or Dexadrine this month, since my doctor will give me either, and I know what Dex dosage works for me, whereas I have never even tried Vyvanse, but it sounds very promising.


Thanks.

It's very individual but some people do not tolerate the levoamphetamine in adderall very well. Dex is what it is, dextroamphetamine and it's more euphoric. The levo can contribute to a lot of the anxiety and negative cardiovascular effects of adderall. Personally I like dexadrine but do not like vyvanse. Vyvanse is a bit up and down and I don't really feel it. But if I'm being honest with myself Vyvanse is probably the better actual treatment for adhd. If I would have started out initially with vyvanse I believe I would like it a lot more. My reasoning for preferring adderall is I can get in and out quick and not have a lingering med in my system. I like to be able to get done what I need then it be out of my system, because sometimes I take the med at different times of the day. I also don't get any anxiety from adderall though, if anything it's the opposite it relives me of any anxiety.


You are on such a low dose that you probably wouldn't experience much withdrawal at all. It also depends what you consider withdrawal. Because physically there are no symptoms, but the mental aspect sucks. You will probably be a little more tired/brain fog and get the urge to take a dose.

Your doctor is wrong, Adderall absolutely does increase blood pressure and heart rate. It can cause heart attacks, strokes and death. You drink way too much coffee with it, especially since you're noticing it's making you anxious. It's bad for your heart. Do your own research on your medicines to be safe. Look out for yourself.  I don't trust your doctor at all. 

He's giving you wrong information. 


From this site: 


[https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/adderall-effects-on-body#1](https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/adderall-effects-on-body#1)


"Stimulants can make your blood vessels constrict, raise your blood pressure, and make your heart beat faster. In some cases, Adderall can cause further interference with your blood circulation. Your toes and fingers may become numb, or start to hurt. They may even turn blue or red.


Serious side effects of Adderall include heart attack and stroke. Contact your doctor immediately if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or fainting. Adderall can lead to sudden death in people with preexisting heart conditions."


IS IT SAFE TO MIX CAFFEINE AND ADDERALL?


"Although ingesting a small amount of caffeine with Adderall is unlikely to be harmful, mixing these two stimulant drugs is not a good idea.


If you or your child has a prescription for Adderall, it?s best to limit your caffeine intake, as it will intensify unpleasant side effects. Each substance can cause nervousness and jitteriness. Each can interfere with sleep, so taking them together can lead to a serious case of insomnia. Try switching to decaffeinated versions of coffee, tea, and cola.


This combination of drugs can be especially harmful if you have pre-existing heart disease, high blood pressure, or an anxiety disorder.


If you use Adderall for nonmedical purposes, you?re probably taking a large dose and endangering your health, whether you take it with caffeine or not. To avoid symptoms of withdrawal, taper off slowly and see your doctor."

Well, one thing I've learned long ago is that you cannot trust everything a doctor says. Adderall withdrawals were awful for me. During past experiences going through withdrawals: I was irritable, depressed, couldn't get out of bed, no energy or motivation whatsoever, felt like a shell

of a human being. It has you questioning your own identity. You feel lost without it. It's psychological too because you crave the drug. There probably are some people who don't have a bad withdrawal experience, but it can be debilitating for a lot of people. It's probably another reason people are afraid to quit. 


When I kicked Adderall, Adrafinil (Modafinil) stopped all withdrawals. Adderall depletes dopamine after a while and Adrafinil gave me the dopamine I needed to have energy, focus and a good mood to keep going. So ordering Adrafinil is an option if you have bad withdrawals. Find a quality source and start low, 100-300 mg.

Adrafinil is something I'm taking temporarily to function until I see my psychiatrist next week and switch to something else. 


Vyvanse made me paranoid and caused amphetamine psychosis so be on the look out for paranoia with stimulants. I'm done with stimulants now.


Just to be clear: I'm talking about ordering Adrafinil for stimulant withdrawals which is legal and a prescription isn't needed. Modafinil/Provigil is the prescribed version and better for your liver, but surprise surprise, my insurance doesn't cover it.

I don't know how my doctor could have said what he said.


That being said, I think I'll be ok because 1) I don't take large doses of Adderall  2) I don't want to keep using it anyway and want to switch to Vyvanse  3) I want to cut down on caffeine as well.


And I think in order for it to cause deaths and heart attacks and strokes you'd have to take more than I do, which is never more than 5mgs in a 4 hour period.  You have to realize that my caffeine tolerance is MASSIVE and for me 2 1/2 cups is probably equal to like one for you, and I'm a healthy guy, so I do not believe at those doses I am at any risk for what you are talking about, just anxiety and not feeling good.


It upsets me he'd say what he said when I know that's not true, and he's a good doctor so why on earth would he say such a thing?


I mean is it possible for a doctor to be good in one way and not in others and be wrong about such simple info?


he's been doing surgeries of all kinds on people for his whole career of like 40 years and is a legit doctor, so why would he say these things that are clearly wrong?

Well, thanks for scaring me both on account 1) of making me think I'll get Adderall WD which I DON'T believe I will and 2) telling me how bad Vyvanse was for you.


Of course, you were just telling the truth in terms of your story, but I doubt I'll get bad Adderall WD and I DO believe my doctor that FOR MOST people it probably doesn't cause WD if you've only been taking it like a month.


I will get Adrafanil if I feel I need it but for .e personally, I took Adrafanil before and also did not like the side effects or how it made me feel, and it felt weaker than caffeine also.


Bu t I bet that I won't and expect I won't have more than maybe a small amount of lethargy for a couple days max.


I mean, I've only been using it for a month.

> It's very individual but some people do not tolerate the levoamphetamine in adderall very well. Dex is what it is, dextroamphetamine and it's more euphoric. The levo can contribute to a lot of the anxiety and negative cardiovascular effects of adderall. Personally I like dexadrine but do not like vyvanse. Vyvanse is a bit up and down and I don't really feel it. But if I'm being honest with myself Vyvanse is probably the better actual treatment for adhd. If I would have started out initially with vyvanse I believe I would like it a lot more. My reasoning for preferring adderall is I can get in and out quick and not have a lingering med in my system. I like to be able to get done what I need then it be out of my system, because sometimes I take the med at different times of the day. I also don't get any anxiety from adderall though, if anything it's the opposite it relives me of any anxiety.

Thanks.


Yeah I very much doubt I'll get any real WD from the Adderall or much lethargy.


It still seems like MOST people seem to be saying that Vyvanse is the one with the fewest side effects cause it is the most gradual throughout your body, so I'm thinking that's what I'll go for, but I'm still having trouble deciding between that and very low dose 5mg Dex pills which have worked for me in the past.


But even those have some side effects I don't like, and I'm thinking Vyvanse may have even fewer, so I think I may try that.


I do also like the ability to have doses that can last a shorter amount of time, but on the other hand, for someone like me there may be less abuse potential in terms of redosing with Vyvanse, plus, I struggle with my sleep schedule and sticking to a regular wake up time and bed time, so in a way Vyvanse could help for me cause I'd be afraid to take it too late and have trouble sleeping at night, so I'd probably wake up earlier to take it and be sure it wears off before bed time.


On the other hand, you say it could linger in the system more cause it lasts longer, but I'm not sure that's true, since it also moves through the system more gradually which is why it is supposed to leave less of a crash, and my brother said he got no Vyvanse crash like he does with Dex or Adderall, and less crash should = more natural sleep afterwards I'd think.

Guys, I'm still having trouble deciding whether to ask my psychiatrist tomorrow for Vyvanse or Dexadrine.


Adderall gave me way too many side effects, and I know from experience that 5mg dexadrine works well for me (I'm sensitive to stimulants), though it has SOME side effects, but a lot of people I know are making me think that Vyvanse might be better because they say it has the fewest side effects for them, though some other people on here have said they got more side effects from Vyvanse.


Most of all, I just want whichever will give me the least amount of jitteriness and anxiety and be the smoothest.


And how long do most people find Vyvanse lasts for them?


Cause some people say it lasts only 6 hours for them or 8 hours but it's generally listed as lasting 10-12 hours.


Thanks

It wouldn't hurt to give Vyvanse a go next. All you can do is try it out and if you don't like it, switch to something else. Again, I'm sorry for making you nervous. I have anxiety too, it's not fun. So you've only been taking Adderall for a month? You should be fine. I had been on Adderall IR since February at least so yeah, the withdrawals and side effects became worst in my case.

I wouldn't be too nervous about withdrawals, especially if you don't abuse amphetamine recreationally. You sound like you are on a low dose. If you take it every day for a couple months or more, then you may notice you feel a little sad for a day or two when you stop. This feeling goes away relatively quickly with rest and is not typically painful or uncomfortable like an opiate or sedative withdrawal.


It sounds like Vyvanse may be worth trying for you. Although I didn't like it much, I didn't feel like it had a crash either. If you decide to go back to something else, perhaps dexedrine spansules (extended release) may help bring you down more gently. If you have instant release, some people find that taking half a pill for the last dose helps to mitigate it. 


In my experience, crashes become rare as I get used to the medicine. I take intuniv (guanfacine) and this seems to help make the medication smoother as well. Supplementing magnesium may not make a difference but it doesn't hurt. By far the two most important things are making sure I eat and stay hydrated even if I don't feel like it.

^ Haha Well it seems like you made a good choice with Vyvanse. I saw my psychiatrist today and told her to stop the Adderall. Not gonna lie, there was a voice in my head saying "What are you doing?!" Even the pharmacist came out and was like "You're off Adderall now?" It hit me hard that I was letting go of one of my favorite drugs, but I was only romanticizing the good times. Like a breakup. 


It was the right decision, but now I have nothing else to stimulate me or give me motivation. Adrafinil is still working. I'm going to stick to that and go back to working out. Developing a healthy lifestyle is more important. I can't go back to amphetamines so...that's that.

I'm still off of Adderall and I realize the majority of this year on it made me feel like I was in a warm, secure bubble. Everything felt just fine, except it really wasn't. Maybe it was a lie. A false sense of security. Off of it, I feel every emotion deeply and you realize a lot in your life needs to change. You can't just ignore it anymore like before. The veil is lifted. I'm not comfortable just zoning out for hours and hours on something shiny and distracting anymore. Doing actual chores feels like a nightmare. Adderall made it enjoyable.  This isn't easy, but being on it wasn't working anymore either. I'm just trying to convince myself it's not worth going back to. I have to stay strong and fix my reality now instead of relying on that pill to make everything feel ok. Being off Adderall and not in a relationship anymore is a double whammy, but it needed to happen. Sorry, venting. 


Amphetamines...if you can handle them, great. They are so deceptive though.

Re: Duration of Vyvanse


I have been on vyvanse for close to a year now. Started at 40mg once/day and the effects would last for 8 - 9 hours. After about 6 months the therapeutic and noticeable effect of the medication would wear off around 4 hours post dose at 40mg. Dose was increased to 60mg with the goal of increasing duration of effects. Initially, the dose increase did result in both stronger effects and increased duration. However, it did not take long for this to dissipate. Obviously this is a result of tolerance. Now I am in the same place as before, effects wearing off 4 - 5 hours post dose at 60mg. 


I feel like I may as well be taking IR medication. Have others noticed or experienced such a limited duration of action with this medicine? For being marketed as providing 10 - 12 hour coverage I would expect to get more than 4 hours. The mid-day crash is getting rather bothersome to the point that it may not be worth continuing to take. I have discussed with my psychiatrist and thus far they are reluctant to add an IR booster in the afternoon; at this point I'd rather be taking an IR med twice daily or hell even a reduced vyvanse dose twice daily lol

This is 100% my experience with Vyvanse regardless of the dose. A big crash ensues 3-5 hours later now, even if I use it twice a month (40mg). I found Dexedrine XR (spansules) to be "smoother" and last longer which is not supposed to be the case.

The other day, my psychiatrist told me Adderall doesn't have a tolerance. What a joke! Many of these psychiatrists do not know what they are talking about when it comes to amphetamines. They don't warn patients about what happens down the line when tolerance develops. 


When you start to develop a tolerance and you have to keep upping your dose, be careful. It can get to a point where it doesn't work anymore at all. Amphetamines are not sustainable for a lifetime. It's not something you can keep taking the rest of your life. Health problems can develop, especially when you keep increasing your dose. It's dangerous for your heart and it can eventually cause psychosis or much worst.


It's really no different than taking coke or meth. It's just that amphetamines come in a bottle and is pushed on people by doctors. It's a shame really. I can't believe they even give it to children.


Whatever dose you're on, it isn't going to work for long and you will keep needing more and more. That's how it goes. I'd say quit while you're ahead and make a life without it. Then again, while it was still working for me, maybe I wouldn't have listened to someone telling me that. Many people won't listen until it's too late. Some things you have to go through and learn on your own.

Basically...


I think it's pretty smooth, but way back when I found it to start working t+ one hour, peak at t+ three hours, and start decreasing at t+ four hours, until basically gone at t+ seven hours. It makes sense on paper, but once settled in, the paper can't deny significant benefits for three hours, decent effects for maybe five.

Thanks for the productive responses. Guess I'm not the only one! I wonder why it continues to be touted as a long acting medicine when it clearly is not? Surely others have reported this to their providers.

It is really strange how uninformed doctors are...or are they pretending not to know how dangerous amphetamines are? It seems like they don't care about the damage that's done as long as they are making money from it. It should not be glamourized.


Since I've been off Adderall for 3 months, I've been doing a lot of research. The stories are all the same about people reaching a tolerance, then abusing it and finally having to quit for good. It ruins lives. Luckily, I don't have a spouse or kids or that many responsibilities right now. People who quit amphetamines and build up such a big life while on it, usually have to lose it all and start from scratch. Check out 

[http://forum.quittingadderall.com/forums/forum/4-tell-your-story/](http://forum.quittingadderall.com/forums/forum/4-tell-your-story/)


It's mostly people who are quitting Adderall, but it also applies to Vyvanse, any amphetamines. 


The amphetamines always stop working, then you're only risking your life by continuing to take it. It's best to get sober now and learn how to live without it. It would suck to be much older with tons of responsibility and having to start all over again.


Adrafinil and Modafinil has been helping me through the quitting process. Some people prefer not to take anything at all, but I've gotta have something. It feels awful when you quit because your dopamine is drained. At least Adrafinil/Modafinil gives a boost so you don't feel dead. 


The quitting forum I linked is helpful because people who quit successfully talk about what supplements they are using and it's great to have support from those who understand the process.

In my opinion, assuming equivalent dosing, I'd say Dexedrine XR spansules are more efficacious than Vyvanse in terms of pharmacokinetics in practice (obviously not on paper). I'd say you need about 20mg dex to match 40mg Vyvanse since the latter is more bioavailable. Adderall XR is the worst out of the three, the crash is awful. 


I do wonder how oral d-meth/Desoxyn compares since it's supposed to last much longer and be smoother for therapeutic purposes.

You're saying 70mg Vyvanse is equivalent to 20mg Dexedrine in spansule form? 


I just did the math, that's only if the d-amph from the spansules is 100% bioavailable which is highly unlikely unless if you have an artificially alkaline stomach via a PPI or something.

Idk results vary, as do calculations. From being on both, maybe 25=70. Rate your experience, though. One's experience is much more telling than calculations/experiences of others.

From what I understand, Vyvanse has a ceiling that Adderall doesn't. But I've read of conflciting evidence as well.

It certainly should be less anxiogenic than adderall. Perhaps some people metabolize it differently. I don't see how it is possible for it to be less anxiogenic than dex unless people are mistakenly thinking that 10mg of vyvanse is equivalent to 10mg of dexedrine. 


Vyvanse should by all means feel like a more smoothly released dexedrine XR spansule, but they just don't. I'm sure some people like it more than I do, but I've not met anybody who prefers it to dexedrine certainly.

Perhaps. But I'm not alone in feeling the great effects for maybe two hours, then the several-hour comedown. Just that factor, the comedown time, could make it less anxiogenic than dexedrine. This is if its worse than the faster, but stronger, dexedrine comedown. Imo adderall has less of a comedown. But I didn't take it all at once. Same thing with dexedrine. There's something about taking one dose that seems to get to people, regardless of what happens when it's inside.

Because the pharmacokinetics of two identical drugs can dramatically alter their effect in the body. In terms of anxiogenic effect, it should be reduced with vyvanse since blood levels will tend to be more curved and less peaked than either dexedrine IR or XR.


This is because Vyvanse is converted mostly by blood cells to dex, rather slowly but steadily. It cannot attain the same 'peak' serum concentration as dexedrine, and although RBCs have a decent capacity to convert lisdex into dex, it will nevertheless reach a saturation point of conversion with a high enough dose (a maximal concentration) that falls far below what can be achieved when you abuse dexedrine (whose peak is essentially unlimited by comparison).


This is why vyvanse is generally less desirable as a drug of abuse though, of course, it can still be abused.

Hello this might be the wrong thread and I don't know how to make a new one, not used Bluelight in years, new account aswell. But I have a good experience with drugs but what I'm on about is amphetamine(speed). I am Currently in a city miles away from my town. Because off my probation, i have no contacts for speed but i have acquired these boxes off 50mg Lisdexamfetamine capsule tablets. And i have Community Service to complete but I keep not being to get up, well i set alarms to wake up, but have no energy to be borthered to go, and will end up back in prison again. I already readed that it's only active orally, but if anyone as any information to how much it converts to in liver per milligram compared to either Street speed or pure, as I think i need and can't illegally obtain normal base amphetamine oil or powder /paste amphetamine sulphate. And these tablets are maybe the life saver to prevent me going back to prison help me with my Community Payback. I also have My own Methylphenidate Prescribed medication, but I don't take as they not a clear headed stimulant unlike amphetamines, but I have a good experience off amphetamine, a few years ago i use to have easy availability to very high purity amphetamine oil, used to be that strong, just handling it, it used to go thru your skin and make you buzz, even just smelling the fumes off the ounces used to hit ya, make ya head tingle, but that was years ago, i been moved to this area by Probation not had real speed for atleast 3 mths so weaken tolerance, but I aint stupid i have good good chemical knowledge, experience and history, i used to take and supply certain research chemicals intill the 2016 uk blanket ban. But if yous know what I'm asking, need information about lisdexamfetamine compared to normal speed, as I gonna end up back in prison keep messing my Community Service about.. I've took 200mg lisdexamfetamine dimesylate about an hour ago to try see how there are, I don't know if can maybe feel them or not, but i also been drinking the whisky today aswell, but i not got my up in morning but have again Friday so i got about 24 hours to try get as much imfomatin i can. And any and all help is appreciated and all helps with harm minimisation, and I would appreciate if there no comments back saying that not taking them is the best harm minimisation as I intend on taking them anyway.

Hey there Bugzey, welcome to Bluelight ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


Given that you just wrote that great big wall of text, I would think it safe to say that you're pretty high right now on that very high 200mg dose ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) 


While 50mg lisdex is technically only equal to around 15mg of pure dex, it's significantly more bioavailable than other forms of oral amphetamine (more 'gets into' the body), which means people need less for the positive effects to work. And so it's difficult to compare doses to regular speed.


This is doubly true since Vyvanse won't tend to give you a 'high' like you might be used to or expecting from regular speed. This is because it's called a 'pro-drug' and converts too slowly and gently into the active compound - dexamphetamine - for that to really happen. So please don't expect that effect, or you'll probably end up taking way too much and will still feel unsatisfied. In other words, Vyvanse isn't really suited to many of the kinds of 'fun' experiences and euphoria most seem to want from their amps - which is why they made it this way. 


If you just want to be motivated and productive enough to get up in the morning and have a good day, try not to take more than one single 50mg capsule per day, first thing in the morning. You may not 'feel' it as much as you're expecting, but it will definitely work.

Interesting. Does anybody else find adderall to have an easier comedown than dexedrine? One of the rationales behind the alleged therapeutic superiority of adderall is that each of the 4 component salts metabolize at slightly different rates leading to a smoother mode of action in even the IR formulation. 


I don't find either adderall or dex to have a significant comedown unless I'm starved/dehydrated. However, I can feel the adderall comedown at least somewhat whereas I feel zero crash from dex IR even after staying up for several days.

Hi all! I'm new here so bear with me while I learn ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was a child, and it's affected me all through out my adult life, although I haven't been medicated during most of my adult years. I've been an addict since my mid 20's...I'm 43 now. Opiates were my drug of choice although I did enjoy obtaining Adderall or Ritalin when I could because it DID help me significantly. 


Anyway, I've been on Suboxone for over 10 years now and I do feel that's numbed me even more significantly. My psych told me that Vyvanse will help me to concentrate and maybe help me to get my shit together finally. But i'm a bit concerned taking it with my suboxone, and I'm prescribed Gabapentin as well. 

Has anyone else ever mixed these medications with Vyvanse? And if so what was the reaction, if any?


He started me out on 50mg...I have yet to take the medication. I'd like some feedback before mixing all of those meds if possible. 

thanks!

Welcome to Bluelight DizzyDawn ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


It won't be harmful to combine vyvanse with those other medications, though it may take some getting used to as it's a stimulant and may blunt/rebalance certain familiar 'calming' aspects of both the suboxone and gabapentin, to some extent. If you're prescribed gabapentin for chronic pain, it should actually synergise somewhat though.


If you're a little hesitant to try the vyvanse, might I suggest you ask to start at a lower dose, such as 30mg, for at least a week or two or until you're either comfortable or feel you actually need to increase the dose.

Yes, welcome! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) My advice is to be careful that you don't want to increase your dose to counteract the numbing/depressant effects of Suboxone. Amphetamines are very dangerous at increased doses and they are bad for your heart.


Gabapentin tends to take the edge off and mask the effects of the amphetamine even more, making you think it's ok to increase your dose. I really don't think it's a good idea at all to mix it, just letting you know. 


You have a history of addiction and even though your drug of choice was opiates, Vyvanse could very well become your new favorite addiction since you have a prescription now.


A few years ago, Vyvanse made me extremely paranoid and I had to be admitted into the hospital  for psychosis. I think the Gabapentin had something to do with it because it dulled my senses and made me feel like it was ok to take more Vyvanse. Gabapentin can cause you to miss those important warning signs, like racing heart, anxiety, etc.


A few others here are more pro-amphetamine because it still works for them, but I am not. 


Tread lightly with this drug. Take care.

This is very wise! DizzyDawn, you should definitely ask the doctor to lower your dose. I was started out on 20 mg when I took it a few years ago.


At 50 mg, your tolerance will increase fast and there won't be much room to grow.


It bothers me that you were started on that high of a dose to begin with. Once again, proving how ignorant doctors are when it comes to prescribing amphetamines.

To be fair, I take a sedating medication at the end of the day. But still. 70 mg vyvanse had a bigger crash than more of the equivalent of adderall. It seems that, for me, four doses spread throughout the day (XR) and a fast crash work out well. But I also meditate at the end of the day. Basically, there are other variables to take into account. But this has been my experience. Way long ago, Vyvanse was effective. 


Dizzy, I would take the medication if you can fully understand and accept that the mood-increasing, social, possibly anti-anxiety effects will wear down to just energy and concentration (if you choose to concentrate). Don't up your dose to chase that effect--it's a dead end. Yeah, you can always start small and taper up, but your doctor knows your optimal dose. Just be honest with the person. Easy.


Also, amphetamine can be terribly addictive. Even just abusing it once can send you down the slippery slope in a very short time. Seriously. Don't take more than the bottle says!


When it comes to amphetamine, if it's indicated medically and you don't take more than the recommended dose, you can expect to be relatively solid. This stuff has been mass-ingested for 80 years. People used to pop 325 mg racemic amphetamine at once from tearing it out of inhalers. In terms of toxicity, it can hurt the brain more than the heart. But that's if abused. Otherwise, your doctor knows what is safe and proper.


There are sites that offer conversions. 70 mg is about 30 mg Adderall, from what a doctor told me. Some people, having never taken the stuff, take 30 mg adderall ir and just can concentrate. Others become high as hell. Needless to say (I think I did say), any euphoric effects are expected to be way toned down over use. If you don't abuse it **at all **, some of the initial effects might stay. It's just way too easy to say "I just wanna try this" and ingest more than you're supposed to. A friend did this. Only hospitalization stopped her.

Psychiatrists don't know everything. I find them to be ignorant about amphetamines. They surely don't understand the withdrawals that come with it. One person here told me their psychiatrist said it doesn't affect your heart. That is wrong information.


My last psychiatrist told me Adderall has no tolerance. She was wrong about that. I didn't even bother explaining the PAWS I'm going through since I quit 5 months ago. 


Of course you should listen to your doctor, but also do your own research.

Thank you for the welcome! I did take less this morning, probably around 30mg, as you suggested, because after reading the forum and reading others' experiences with the drug yesterday, I felt that 50 would most likely be too much for me to start out with. I also read how Gabapentin did have some negative effects to a couple people, and others used it to "come down" at night to sleep. So this is how that went...


I woke up early, around 7am, mixed a little over half of the power into my morning coffee (something I'm not sure I'll need anymore..) and waited. Within a half hour I was feeling the effects and it wasn't harsh at all. I feel as if my brain actually came back to life...seriously. I was able to focus on each task throughout the day...which is something I struggle with on a daily basis.. I was able to do my housework and it actually HELPED with my horrible social anxiety...I actually answered a phone call guys....if you knew me you would know this is something I don't do.  I don't talk to people anymore. I've become a recluse over the last year. But I think Vyvanse might actually pull me out of this crater I fell into. 


One slight problem though...LOL. And you all can probably guess what I'm able to say next. It's 12:24am and I've taken my Gaba..thinking it would help me lay down and actually sleep. Hmm. I actually think I might need to take another because I do NOT feel it. <sigh> I mean, is there a happy medium? I don't want to take benzos...been there, done that. And it's not a road I wish to travel down again. but. I do need to figure out SOME way to sleep. suggestions anyone?

Hi! And thank you so much. I'm SO HAPPY I found Bluelight. I've never found a site/forum where I could be completely honest about my life and not feel like everyone is judging me. I think I've found my new home. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I don't feel like I will abuse the Vyvanse, but I do understand and your point is very valid that I could start to abuse it. I did start myself off at 30 mgs instead of 50...and that's only because I read a lot of posts yesterday and  I realize 50 mgs is a lot to start off on. Like I told CFC, the feeling I got from it wasn't a 'high'...it was more like my brain actually starting to work right. It's hard to explain, but I hope you understand. I wouldn't want to abuse a drug that I obviously need so desperately. But I can see the potential is there. 


Have you been diagnosed with ADD/ADHD as well? And if you are, and you're not pro-amphetamine, what do you find works for you?

After coming out of my doctor's office the day he wrote me the script, I had to stop at the front desk to make my next appt and show them the script so they can add it to their charts/computers or whatever. One of the counselors was working the desk and her eyes got HUGE when she saw the dosage and she hopped up and said, "He's starting you out on 50 MILLIGRAMS!?!" I'm like, "Shit, I don't know, he told me it was a normal adult dose, and that if it seems to be too much for me, to let him know and next appt he'd change it." She acted like she didn't believe me and she handed the script to the receptionist and told him to take it back to Dr Clark and make sure that's what he wants to do. About 2 minutes later he comes back out and says to the counselor, "He said he appreciates your concern, but that's what he wants her to take."


so...you're not alone in your surprise. Being new to Vyvanse, all I know is what I have read here and what my psych has told me about it. I do agree with you (and the counselor now) that 50 mg would have been way too much for me. I mean, it's 20 til 1am and I'm still wide awake and wondering if sleep will even come to me tonight. and this is me after dosing 30 mg around 7am.

Fancy seeing you here ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 

You've got some wonderful advice here. thank you for explaining that the "anti-anxiety, mood-increasing effects" won't last. I get that. Bummer. But i get it. I'm just happy that i can actually think again, have a conversation again without running away. The concentration and energy are what I need. But I also need to sleep at the end of the day lol 


I did notice one other positive effect that Vyvanse may be having on me. You know the other problem that I posted about, that you replied to? Well, I found myself doing that a LOT less today. It just didn't seem to even cross my mind even half as much as I usually do. And let me tell you...if Vyvanse helps me quit that nasty habit... it will probably literally save my life. hmm. 


I did start myself out at a lower dose, 30mg instead of the 50. Do you think that was a mistake? I admit, previous posts had an effect on that decision. But, as my psych did say, it's what he wanted me to start out on. And he made that very clear to his staff that questioned him about the dose. I just can't imagine how long I'd probably be up if I took the whole 50 mg, ya know. 


How is the tolerance aspect? Will I build a tolerance fast or will it take some time? Is there any way to keep from gaining too much tolerance?

WTF REALLY? I've had bad doctors/psychiatrists those are the ones that make you question if they even have a valid medical license. SMH. I might not be an amphetamine expert by any means, but knowing that your heart rate is affected by amphetamines is given. I thought so anyway lol. As well as the tolerance aspect. I mean doesn't our body build a tolerance to just about everything we take in? especially if you're doing it everyday. duh.  


Thank you all so much for the welcome, advice and personal experience. I'm going to try to close my eyes and see if sleep will come. count a few sheep..count backwards from 100...

Might even try meditating.

I completely understand what it's like when you first try it, it's like everything finally clicks and the world makes sense. It's like you've found the answer to all of your problems. I get it. That's how it made me feel at first too and this is what is referred to as the "honeymoon stage". The more you take it, tolerance develops, the dose increases and it backfires. Try not to take it every single day if you can help it. Take breaks and keep your dose as low as possible for a while.


Yes, I've been diagnosed with ADHD, generalized anxiety disorder and major depression. I've been on Vyvanse at one point. After the psychosis, I tried Adderall. I don't like either anymore because they both helped, but only in the beginning. I felt "normal" and like I had a future because I was finally getting out of my house. I had a boyfriend and was getting things done. It was like a miracle drug. I was a recluse too and agoraphobic at my worst before the medicine. Tolerance built and it started to backfire. It actually gave me more anxiety and kept me trapped in my head ruminating all day. My personality changed for the worst. It made me irritable and caused me to isolate from people. Basically, all the great results it gave me in the beginning, it took back in the end. 


I quit 5 months ago and I haven't found anything else that helps. I've been back in a dark, reclusive place. It's disappointing. I started seeing a new therapist and I will see a new psychiatrist in January to find an anti-depressant that can help to lift my mood. So basically, I just have to live without any ADHD help and learn how to get through it on my own.


Amphetamines are not sustainable for a lifetime. 


All I can say is keep your dose low and don't take it every day.


I do not understand why your doctor is so adamant about keeping you on 50 mg even after it was brought to his attention by someone else. He honestly doesn't sound like a good doctor. It doesn't make sense. If you started at 50 mg, your tolerance would be sky high really soon. He should start you low so you can work your way up.


Meditation sounds like a good idea for trying to calm down at the end of the day. What I've noticed is a lot of people start drinking more and get addicted to other substances while taking amphetamines to bring them back down.

I started drinking more wine to take the edge off while I was on it and other things I won't mention. Bad habits seem to come with it. Maybe if you only took the Gabapentin at night, like a lil' to comedown. I don't know...

Well. Bummer, dude.


I'm sorry you had such a bad experience. And I hope to learn from them if possible. Last night I was thinking that I will definitely have to skip days, if anything just to keep my body rested well. I know that I'm going to hear different things from different people, the negatives and the positives. And I promise to take all experiences into account. Especially with this drug being so new to me. But... I have taken Adderall before (recreationally because I didn't have a script, yet I used it to function better---if that makes sense?) And I was able to stop without a problem, and that's something I wouldn't be able to do if I wanted to abuse it. Examples being my addiction to just about every other drug ever created--opiates, benzos, etc... I'm "normally" very hyper, scatterbrained and I don't want to say "clueless", but that's how I feel without this medicine. Like I'm walking around in a fog that I can't find my way out of.


 Opiates and benzos gave me the down I needed to relax myself enough so I quit worrying (caring actually) about the rest of the world and my problems. They were my escape, yet they weren't a solution. Even though I felt I had found a solution, I obviously hadn't. 


And it's quite a let down to think that Vyvanse might not be a long-term solution for me as well after reading your experience. You've given me very good advice and I thank you for your input. I'll definitely take into consideration everything you've told me and adjust my dosages accordingly. 


Yet, I have to disagree about my doc. He's actually quite wonderful. Although we might think his decision for starting me on 50 mgs is overboard, I'm sure he has his reasons for it, even if we might not understand. I don't have a medical degree and I definitely don't fully understand psychiatry to the level he does, although I do my own research. I fully 100% trust him with my life. He saved my life a couple years ago. And probably many times after that if I go into detail in my own memory. He's willing to adjust my dose if I tell him that 50 mgs is too much, and that's what I plan on doing when I go back in a week. I plan on having a long discussion about everything I've learned. 


Last night I put on a guided meditation on YouTube and I fell asleep very soundly until 9am this morning---which is something I NEVER do (sleep in)

I'm not a drinker, I don't enjoy alcohol, and I've already told myself I will NOT turn to benzos. if I can fall asleep with meditation and my gaba alone at this point, I'm happy with that. and yes Gabapentin at night only from now on.

Meditation sounds great for you. I didn't mention benzos because that can be addictive too, like you said, it's best to stay away. That's what's so alluring about amphetamines, they make you want to function and actually be a part of life. Unlike benzos and opiates where you just want to shut off from reality.

Sounds very interesting! Looks as if they'll be using it to treat much more than depression now! Any time you dont have to add another pharmaceutical to the mix is a plus in my book. I'm sure it's a pretty penny, but I'm also sure it's worth it.


It's taken me a LONG time to be able to focus and enjoy the quietness. I have 3 children and silence hasn't been a part of my life in a VERY long time xD  I started with guided meditations to keep me focused so that my brain doesn't go off in it's natural direction of EVERYWHERE. I also am very impatient.. And I'm still learning. But I have found it most helpful to me in the evenings because I struggle with sleep (even before the Vyvanse) and meditation quiets my mind and soul enough for me to fall asleep. Try a guided meditation on YouTube and use headphones (they help a lot especially if you have a lot of background noise). If it's something you wish to do anyway. If not, disregard lol

I hope that you've tried the videos and they've helped you. 


I do have a question for others who take Vyvanse, or for anyone more experienced with amphetamines than I. I am trying to skip days and I'm still taking around 30 mgs (although it's kind of hard to dose just pouring it out of the capsule). I feel that my body is adjusting now, although I still notice that I'll get a little nauseous sometimes. It seems that only happens when I mix it with hot tea though? I'm sure "what" I'm mixing it with shouldn't make much of a difference, but I can't think of anything else that would cause it. I actually vomitted a couple times. Is this normal?


Also, I'm finding it a bit easier to fall asleep in the evenings now because the medication doesn't last near as long anymore. Now this is a good thing in the evenings of course, but I'm a little concerned that my tolerance is going to build up quite fast and I really don't want to keep adding more and more. 

Is there anything else i can do to keep my tolerance from building up so fast? 


Hope you all had a good holiday ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Doesn't sound normal to me. All you took with it is tea? And you vomited? Tell your doctor. I'd do so ASAP. Just to be safe.


So the tolerance to "hyper-focus", mood boost, anxiolytic, and pro-social behavior are fine. In essence, you really only need to be concerned about focus/narcolepsy--guessing it's focus. All other positive effects are really just side effects.


But this vomiting is disconcerting. Especially if you just take it with everyday tea.

^ Yes, it wouldn't hurt to mention it to your doctor. How much tea are you taking with it? Is it 2 tea bags or 1?


I remember feeling really nauseas a few times from using 2 tea bags in one cup (8 oz) so it must've been too strong...and that wasn't even with any Vyvanse included.


When it comes to tea and coffee, it's best not to take much of it with amphetamines. Caffeine spikes up the anxiety when taken with amphetamines.


For some reason, it doesn't agree with your body when you mix it with hot tea so try not to do that anymore. Feel better!


Here's more information about caffeine and Vyvanse:

Word indeed. But theanine might help to balance things out. It's the main relaxing agent in green/black tea.

Mmmhmm, which is why I have L-theanine capsules now. If L-theanine is taken with coffee (or tea), it takes away the anxiety/jitters associated with caffeine.


In DizzyDawn's case, L-theanine capsules could help, BUT it's probably best to just limit caffeine or completely stay away from it if possible. You do want to be aware of the warning signs if something doesn't agree with you while taking Vyvanse.

Note on vyvanse dose schedule to share with community: 


I've been on vyvanse for about a year and am currently prescribed 60mg daily. I have experienced issues with duration of effects only lasting 5 - 7 hours followed by a hard crash. I've been experimenting with different dosing strategies for some time and wanted to share with the community what is working for me. 


I am splitting my 60mg vyvanse dose in half using a digital scale to weigh and re-capsule two 30mg doses. I ingest 30mg upon waking and the effects last 3 - 5 hours with the reduced dose. Somewhere between T+3 - 5 hours I ingest the second 30mg. For example, I'll take 30mg at 9am and then another 30mg between 12pm - 2pm. 


With this method there is a noticeable return in effects and I am able to cover the entire day more or less as opposed to a large dose of 60mg in the morning, followed by an extended crash. 


I've also noticed an increase in the initial side effects almost as if more d-amphetamine is being metabolized. Specifically facial skin drying out and pupil dilation being the most pronounced. 


The other thing I have found to be highly effective is taking 30mg pseudoephedrine approximately 2 hours after ingesting vyvanse. For me, it is increasing the physical stimulation nicely without causing unwanted side effects.

Out of curiosity, why not dissolve the contents of your capsule in for example 500ml of water and drink half of it? I'd imagine volumetric dosing is more accurate than weighing small amounts of powder. Definitely less of a hassle at least. Personally, for whatever reason I don't get much effect from taking a second dose of lisdex during the day. I feel like the duration of therapeutic effects is usually long enough, but I have 2x 5mg IR d-amp pills a day as needed if one dose of lisdex isn't adequate. Because it just kind of dumps all the d-amp in a slightly delayed fashion, slightly smoothing out the blood levels towards the end of the effect feels quite helpful. Makes vyvanse/elvanse a little more similar to how for example Concerta works, imo.

It's not too hard to split. I can do it in about 2 minutes now with a digital scale. It is a pain in the ass for sure and there is room for error. I've heard about the volumetric dosing, I guess I just like the fact that I know how much is in each capsule. 


I wish I had an IR booster. I've brought it up but it's a no go this far. I agree with you that lisdex sort of just dumps all the D-amp in a delayed manner but I don't feel it after 4 hours. I experience a 2nd noticeable peak if I wait at least 3.5 hours between doses.

I'm experimenting with 9-MBC. It's a potent nootropic stimulant, but no crash like amphetamines. Some people compare it to deprenyl (selegiline) an MAO-B inhibitor. It enhances dopamine and helps focus, energy and thinking clearly. It potently stimulates neuron and neurite growth. It's neuroprotective and can protect the brain and CNS from toxin-induced damage.  Long-acting results unlike other nootropics or caffeine that fades quickly. Basically perfect for someone like me who is determined to stay off amphetamines. I'm feeling good. 


This is my second day using it. I've read that it takes a few days to really kick in so I'll keep taking 15 to 30 mg daily and see what happens.

I've been taking 9-MBC for a week. Started at 15 mg, then doubled up to 30mg every morning. There is no nasty speedy stim feeling, it's subtle, but my mood is brightened. I can tell it's raising my dopamine. I can appreciate a bright, sunny day instead of feeling miserable about it. So this is good for lifting mood and depression. If anyone tries it, don't expect a "kick", you will start to notice some positive differences in your outlook of the world.


I don't feel a boost in energy. Actually, it seems to make me feel very calm and almost sleepy. That calm feeling might not be the norm though, could just be me. I still take caffeine pills for more energy. My mind is clear, no fog. It doesn't make me hyperfocus on anything, but whatever I set my mind to, I can focus on it well. It's hard to explain, but it's like you can control exactly what you focus on. It doesn't control you. So overall I like it and it gives you a brighter outlook, but it's more subtle than I expected.


It's definitely great for anyone trying to come off of amphetamines and prevent withdrawals. That's not easy at all so it's always helpful to have more options out there.

I take 40 mg Vyvanse a day, for recreational dose i tried 40 mg at 8 a.m. and 160 at 16 pm. That worked very well for me i was super focused and pretty fun, felt smart the whole evening. Couldn't sleep well though, good thing i had zyprexa.

I’m trying Vyvanse again after a long time and a very short history with it. What I want to know from regular Vyvanse users is:

• What hour do you usually take it?

• Have you lost any weight since you began taking  it?

• Do you have trouble sleeping?

• Would you use DXM to get to sleep if you didn’t have any Benzos?

Thanks so much!

1. When waking up, or a few hours after.
2. Not really.
3. No.
4. I would try to be active during the day in order to fall asleep more easily. Using other drugs to cope with stimulant side effects always lead to abusive behavior. If you're good with that, I see why not.

Ya, with Vyvanse is takes 3 hours for peak plasma levels are achieved AUC / C-Max...with larger doses of 150mg the C-Max is increased to 4 hours, to 4.5 hours at 200mg (because Trypsin has to cleave the l-lysine off the d-amph molecule)


Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) is metabolized into l-lysine and d-amphetamine which is why it takes 3 hours for peak plasma levels, in addition to a longer duration of action at 13-14 hours in adults. As per Shire, for every 20mg Vyvanse it’s approximately 5.9mg of d-amphetamine base equivalent.


Very smooth gradual onset, 3 hours peak, and lasts 10-14 hours. Goes really well with 1.5 grams of Phenibut as they kick in at the same time and complement each other well. (Like a lame version of Dexamyl lol)

Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine) is a prodrug which metabolizes into d-amphetamine.


Once orally ingested, Lisdexamfetamine is absorbed in your stomach and GI track and the molecule enters your bloodstream. Once in the bloodstream, an enzyme called trypsin cleaves the Lysine amino acid from the amphetamine molecular structure


3 hours after ingesting Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine) levels of d-amphetamine are at peak serum levels in your bloodstream and have a duration of action approx 8-10 hours (total duration 10-14 hours), featuring a slow and steady increase of d-amphetamine, then slowly fades away 10 hours later 


Dexedrine IR & Spansule XR are vastly superior 

Adderall IR / XR beads are also superior to Vyvanse. The 25% levo-amph in Adderall is actually very advantageous to the dextro rotary stereo isomer. It helps the d-amph last longer and increase / release more dopamine in the CNS


Ritalin (Methylphenidate) & Cocaine have a near identical mechanism of action and are very euphoric and effect CNS stimulants 


Phenmetrazine was also a heavy hitter, apparently more euphoric than i.v. Methamphetamine (Methedrine/Desoxyn)

Biphetamine 20mg (Black Beauties) were a smash (basically Adderall 75% d / 25% l) 

Desbutal (Methamphetamine & Pentobarbital)

Dexamyl (d-amphetamine & Amobarbitol)


In the golden era of pharmaceuticals / 1950’s America they had insane stimulants 


Methylphenidate & Phenmetrazine 

Benzedrine/Dexedrine/Methedrine

Methedrine 20mg i.v. glass vials for injection 

Dexamyl/Desbutal/Biphetamine 


Valium (Diazepam) was the reigning supreme Benzodiazepine …..still is today, unmatched benzo, all others trash


Dilaudid & Demerol were the most commonly used euphoric opioids, Dilaudid more of a pure opioid, Demerol like an opioid + Cocaine/Ritalin…..i.v. Vials were a highly sought after item for recreational use

I think Methylphenidate (MPH) and Cocaine have near identical mechanisms because both MPH and Cocaine are only dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. In contrast, d-amphetamine is both a reuptake inhibitor and also **[releasing agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_agent)****. **But cocaine is very cardiotoxic.

I was prescribed Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine) 20mg capsules (5.9mg d-amph) and took 2 capsules every morning (12mg of Dexedrine XR basically). It gave me EXTREMELY dry mouth and mild heart palpitations. No doubt it’s an effective amphetamine medication with reduced “likeability” only oral administered, can’t be snorted or abused as IR Dexedrine could


I personally find Methylphenidate (Ritalin) MUCH more pleasurable and effective.


Biphentin 40mg (40% of dose IR / remaining 60% of dose released 4 hours later) 10 hours of coverage. I usually take 40mg to 50mg empty all XR beads into glass motor & pastel, covered with zip lock bag and pulverize beads into fine powder, converting XR Biphentin into IR Ritalin….taken with a meal to speed absorption and 3.oz of Jin & ginger ale (ethanol increases d-MPH “Focalin” concentrations by 40%) significantly enhancing its euphoric/ pleasurable subjective effects


Ritalin (Methylphenidate) is strikingly similar to Cocaine in their MOA and doesn’t reduce appetite, cause dry mouth, or impaire quality of sleep. I absolutely love Ritalin & Oxycodone…..the only 2 drugs on earth to ever give me TRUE euphoria.


Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine) definitely has its uses and is a very effective amphetamine medication


Ritalin & Focalin

Adderall IR & XR

Dexedrine IR & Dexedrine Spansule XR

Desoxyn 5mg IR


I’d personally go with low dose Desoxyn (d-Methamphetamine) 5mg tablets…..2-5 tablets daily max. Starting one tablet in morning and another around 1pm after lunch. An actual relatively safe amphetamine medication taken at low therapeutic doses.


President JFK would receive regular IM injections of depo-Testosterone 200mg and IV injections of Methedrine 20mg glass ampoules by his private physician “doctor feel good” lol …the doctor to all the famous Hollywood stars and VIP patients …..this cocktail was used to restore his “youthful vigor” apparently


Injecting IV pharmaceutical grade d-Methamphetamine in addition to IM Testosterone would be like an atomic bomb of pleasurable confidence & vigor, WOW….I could only imagine, and have taken many legally prescribed medications extremely similar to that, including IM 200mg Testosterone…..so I know how amazing that would be


Elite U.S. combat operators (SOCOM / Seal Team 6 / DevGru / Delta Force Recon, etc) prior to seriously demanding operations (like the Bin Laden raid) are all given Testosterone injections 2 days prior to reach peak serum levels in the blood stream, and orally administered Desoxyn / Dexedrine while in the Helo while enroute to the LZ


Their all JACKED UP, cocked N locked & ready to rock ……every single inhabitant inside Bin Ladens compound were “neutralized” with precision head shots, his sons, his wife, few guards, EVERYBODY was shot dead…..SEAL Operators spent 10min gathering all intel, HD thumb drives, files, paperwork, etc…..DNA tested to confirm dead body was in fact the HVT, photos taken, zipped up in a black body bag, loaded in the remaining stealth chopper (the second stealth chopper lost lift and crashed outside the walled compound- SEALS loaded it up with C-4 explosives & incineration device to melt all classified technology inside stealth chopper to prevent it being analyzed by Pakistani Military)


On the deck of a U.S. Nimitz class Battle Ship he was given burial at sea to prevent his grave site being turned into a shrine, in respect of Islamic tradition, etc his body was slid off the side deck into the water


U.S. Navy SEALS …..just another day at the office (really) …..this SEAL operator with his face blacked out on this documentary stated….. “ not to take anything away from the Bin Laden raid, but we conduct and execute operations like that ALL THE TIME, many of them the general public will never hear or know about”.


God Bless the U.S.A.


(Apologies for that meaningless ending there lmao….my morning Brompton Cocktail is peaking and I’m watching the American Military Channel, cleaning my toys while the GF is working at the library until 5pm)


Edit - OMG second apology lol, just realized I already left a post on last page lol…..ok, no more for me lol. I’m done lol

I used to have it prescribed, 50mg per day. I loved the motivation etc but it was making me nervous a lot. I don't get the scripts anymore but I must have accumulated like a year supply and take it occasionally it will probably take me a decade to finish them. 

Do they expire somehow?

Does anybody knows how to eliminate that anxiety?

Vyvanse and amphetamines are prescribed to increase focus. My experience with these drugs is that I can get very focused, just at the wrong things (writing pornographic novels, drawing fantasy maps, etc). On the other hand: In the good old days I would occasionally take some amphetamine, perhaps once a month or less frequently. What I discovered then is that this would sort of "clean up my mind" so that I could stay focused (for real) for several weeks **afterwards**. I have more recently experienced a similar effect with vyvanse, although not as strong. The first few days after taking vyvanse my mind is very focused, but on the drug itself I'm 100% unproductive when it comes to work or doing anything sensible.  Has anyone else experienced this?
