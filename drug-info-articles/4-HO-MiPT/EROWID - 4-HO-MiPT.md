4-Hydroxy-MIPT (or 4-HO-MIPT) is a tryptamine very similar to 4-Acetoxy-MIPT. It is found as a slightly off-white powder and is usually taken orally. Dosages of 4-Hydroxy-MIPT are slightly lower than for 4-Acetoxy-MIPT.
 NOTE: The following dosages are EXTREMELY tentative. We have only a few reports of use on which to base these. Do not treat these as a reliable guide.

**4-Hydroxy-MIPT Chemistry** 
 **by Erowid** 
---
 
 
4-HO-MiPT and Acetoxy-MiPT are closely related chemicals. It is possible that 4-Acetoxy-MiPT is metabolized into 4-HO-MiPT in the body in much the same way that Psilocybin is metabolized into Psilocin before it reaches the brain. They will both have very similar effects when taken orally, though dosage will be slightly different.
