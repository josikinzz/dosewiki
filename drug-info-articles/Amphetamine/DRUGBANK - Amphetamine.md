## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as amphetamines and derivatives. These are organic compounds containing or derived from 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.

### Background

Amphetamine, a compound discovered over 100 years ago, is one of the more restricted controlled drugs. It was previously used for a large variety of conditions and this changed until this point where its use is highly restricted. Amphetamine, with the chemical formula alpha-methylphenethylamine, was discovered in 1910 and first synthesized by 1927. After being proven to reduce drug-induced anesthesia and produce arousal and insomnia, amphetamine racemic mix was registered by Smith, Kline and French in 1935. Amphetamine structure presents one chiral center and it exists in the form of dextro- and levo-isomers.
1
The first product of Smith, Kline and French was approved by the FDA on 1976.
15
During World War II, amphetamine was used to promote wakefulness in the soldiers. This use derived into a large overproduction of amphetamine and all the surplus after the war finalized ended up in the black market, producing the initiation of the illicit abuse.
1

### Indication

Amphetamine is indicated for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) as well as for the treatment of central nervous system disorders such as narcolepsy.
1
In Canada, it has been approved for the treatment of ADHD in children 6 - 12 years of age and adults (18 years of age and older).
21
ADHD is a complex disorder associated with the substantial heterogeneity in etiology, clinical presentation, and treatment outcome. ADHD comes from a complex interplay between interdependent genetic and non-genetic factors which cause complex mental disorders in children and teenagers.
8
On the other hand, narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder typically resenting during adolescence and characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness.
9
Amphetamine is also being used nowadays off-label for the treatment of obesity, depression and chronic pain.

### Pharmacodynamics

From its mechanism of action, it has been demonstrated that amphetamine augments the concentration of noradrenaline in the prefrontal cortex and dopamine in the striatum on a dose and time-dependent manner. The indistinct release of neurotransmitters which include adrenaline is known to produce cardiovascular side effects.
5
There are old reports of a cognitive enhancement related to the administration of amphetamine in which improvements in intelligence test scores were reported.
2
In ADHD, amphetamine has been largely showed to produce remarkable improvements in school performance, behavior, and demeanor.
1
The effect was shown to be produced through both racemic forms and to this date, the use of racemic forms 3:1 (D:L) is very common.
3
The therapeutic effect of amphetamine on serotonin does not seem to have a significant clinical effect on ADHD as observed on comparative studies with amphetamine and fenfluramine, a powerful serotonin releasing factor. However, the indirect effect on serotonin might have an effect on the depression and anxiety profile of ADHD.
6
Studies regarding the illicit use of amphetamine in which heavy consumers were studied proved the generation of a paranoid state which flagged this drug as a psychiatric danger compound.
16
This observation was supported by the continuous reports of misuse in patients under depression.

### Absorption

Amphetamine is well absorbed in the gut and as it is a weak base hence the more basic the environment the more of the drug is found in a lipid-soluble form and the absorption through lipid-rich cell membranes is highly favored.
11
The peak response of amphetamine occurs 1-3 hours after oral administration and approximately 15 minutes after injection and it presents a bioavailability of over 75%.
17
Complete amphetamine absorption is usually done after 4-6 hours.
18

### Metabolism

Amphetamine is known to be metabolized by the liver under the action of the CYP2D6. The metabolic pathway of amphetamine is mainly defined by aromatic hydroxylation, aliphatic hydroxylation, and n-dealkylation.
19
The formed metabolites in this pathway are 4-hydroxyamphetamine, 4-hydroxynorephedrine, hippuric acid, benzoic acid, benzyl methyl ketone, and p-hydroxyamphetamine which is known to be a potent hallucinogen.

### Half-life

The half-life of amphetamine highly depends on the isomer. For d-amphetamine, the reported half-life is of approximately 9-11 hours while for l-amphetamine the half-life is reported to be of 11-14 hours. The urine pH can modify this pharmacokinetic parameter which can vary from 7 hours in acid urine to 34 hours for alkaline urine.
11

### Toxicity

The mean lethal serum concentration is reported to be of 6.4 mg/l. Acute amphetamine overdose can lead to hyperthermia, respiratory depression, seizures, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, hepatic injury, and coma. Some of the neurologic effects have been shown to be agitation, aggressive behavior, irritability, headache, and hallucinations. In the cardiovascular site, there have been reports of arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke. Lastly, in the GI tract, there are reports if abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, cramps, anorexia and GI hemorrhage. A dose of 1-2 g of amphetamine is known to cause severe intoxication but some chronic abusers can report usage of even 5-15 g per day.
19
In animal studies, there is no evidence of carcinogenic potential, not clastogenic or to affect fertility or early embryonic development.

### Mechanism of action

Amphetamine's structure closely resembles catecholamine neurotransmitters, characterized primarily by a long planar conformation, an aromatic ring, and nitrogen in the aryl side chain. Like endogenous catecholamines, amphetamine is actively transported into presynaptic nerve terminals via monoamine reuptake transporters, which require association with two sodium ions and one chloride ion. Because amphetamine acts as a competitive substrate, increased concentrations lead to greater internalization of amphetamine.
1
Once in the presynaptic terminal, amphetamine competes for storage in VMAT2 (Vesicular Monoamine Transporter 2), displacing other monoamines. This action induces the release of neurotransmitters into the synapse through a process known as reverse transport.
4
The d-isomer is approximately fourfold more potent than the $l$-isomer in promoting dopamine release via this mechanism.
5
The mechanism of action is further complemented by the inhibition of both monoamine reuptake and monoamine oxidase (MAO), which act synergistically to significantly elevate monoamine concentrations.
1
Amphetamine does not act as a direct inhibitor but rather as a competitive substrate, classifying it as a weak dopamine reuptake inhibitor, a moderate noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, and a very weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Consequently, the l-isomer exhibits significantly lower potency in this specific action.
5
Amphetamine acts as a weak inhibitor of the mitochondrial-bound enzyme MAO, the catalytic enzyme responsible for degrading excess neurotransmitters. Although this mechanism is often considered minor due to its weak inhibitory nature, it remains a component of amphetamine's overall action.
1
Amphetamine is a modulator of glutamatergic neurotransmission, primarily via its action on the dopamine system.
12
The mass release of dopamine caused by amphetamine subsequently signals to the glutamatergic system, leading to long-lasting changes in synaptic plasticity.
12
,
13
Amphetamine's entry into dopamine neurons triggers the endocytosis of the excitatory amino acid transporter EAAT3, reducing glutamate clearance and potentiating excitatory synaptic responses mediated by ionotropic receptors.
13
Chronic exposure also alters receptor composition, such as the downregulation of the NMDA receptor NR2B subunit in the striatum, which is a key molecular change underlying behavioral sensitization to the drug.

### Volume of distribution

Amphetamine is reported to have a high volume of distribution of 4 L/kg.
11

### Protein binding

The reported protein binding of amphetamine is relatively low and register to be of 20%.
11

### Route of elimination

The elimination of amphetamine is mainly via the urine from which about 40% of the excreted dose is found as unchanged amphetamine. About 90% of the administered amphetamine is eliminated 3 days after oral administration.
11
The rate of elimination of amphetamine highly depends on the urine pH in which acidic pH will produce a higher excretion of amphetamine and basic pH produces a lower excretion.
17

### Clearance

The reported normal clearance rate is of 0.7 L.h/kg. This clearance has been shown to get significantly reduced in patients with renal impairment reaching a value of 0.4 L.h/kg.

### General Function

Sodium-ion dependent, high affinity carnitine transporter. Involved in the active cellular uptake of carnitine. Transports one sodium ion with one molecule of carnitine (PubMed:10454528, PubMed:10525100, PubMed:10966938, PubMed:17509700, PubMed:20722056, PubMed:33124720). Also transports organic cations such as tetraethylammonium (TEA) without the involvement of sodium. Relative uptake activity ratio of carnitine to TEA is 11.3 (PubMed:10454528, PubMed:10525100, PubMed:10966938). In intestinal epithelia, transports the quorum-sensing pentapeptide CSF (competence and sporulation factor) from B.subtilis which induces cytoprotective heat shock proteins contributing to intestinal homeostasis (PubMed:18005709). May also contribute to regulate the transport of organic compounds in testis across the blood-testis-barrier (Probable)
