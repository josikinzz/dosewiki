**Dimethoxybromoamphetamine** (**DOB**), also known as **Brolamfetamine** and **Bromo-DMA**, is a psychedelic substituted alpha-methylated phenethylamine, a class of compounds commonly known as amphetamines. The phenethylamine equivalent of this substance (lacking the alpha-methyl group) is 2C-B.

This substance has no history of human usage prior to the 1991 publication of its synthesis and pharmacology in the book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved) by Alexander Shulgin. In modern times it is used as a recreational drug and an entheogen, rarely sold on the streets and almost exclusively obtained as a grey area research chemical through the use of online vendors. It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin and described in his 1991 book.

In terms of its pharmacology, this substance acts as a selective 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptor partial agonist. Its psychedelic effects are thought to be mediated via its actions on the 5-HT2A receptor.

The DOB experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical effects:**

The physical effects of DOB can be broken down into six components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - The body high of DOB is manifested as somewhat intense in comparison to most classical psychedelics. The sensation itself can be described as a constantly present yet somewhat mild energetic pins and needles sensation that encompasses a person’s entire body. It is usually static in its position and felt over every square inch of the skin as if it was coming from behind the users body. Occasionally however it manifests itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves.
- **Stimulation** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, DOB is usually considered to be extremely stimulating at levels which do not become overwhelming and are encouraged instead of forced. This results in a shakiness and unsteadiness of the hands at high dosages but encourages trippers to move around, run, dance, climb and generally engage in physical activities. The level of stimulation varies between users however with some people reporting it to be somewhat similar to amphetamine in its intensity and others reporting that it is extremely subtle even at higher dosages. In comparison, other more commonly used psychedelics such as psilocin are generally sedating and relaxed.
- **Enhancement of touch** - Feelings of enhanced tactile sensation are consistently present at moderate levels throughout most DOB trips.
- **Nausea** - Mild to extreme nausea is reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes once the tripper has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **Vasoconstriction** - This effect is usually only present at higher dosages but can be particularly uncomfortable.

**Cognitive effects:**

The head space of DOB is described by many as one of mental stimulation and a powerful enhancement of a person’s current mental state. Many user report that it may not be as deep as other traditional psychedelics such as LSD or Psilocin and that it is comparatively empty in terms of its insightfulness.

The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes:

- **Introspection** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of a non-social setting in which the user is alone.
- **Increased empathy, love and sociability** - This component is inconsistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as MDMA and 2C-B but still prove strong enough to provide long lasting therapeutic effects.
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Time distortion**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**

**Visual effects:**

*Enhancements*

DOB presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally includes:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colour**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

DOB presents a full and complete array of possible visual distortions which generally includes:

- **Drifting** (*Melting, Flowing, Breathing and morphing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in their appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition**
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of LSD, 25I-NBOME or 2C-B than that of Ayahuasca, Psilocin or 2C-E. They can be comprehensively described as unstructured in their organization, algorithmic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, small in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, sharp in their edges and equally rounded and angular in their corners. They give off a synthetic feel to them that at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of Level 7A visual geometry over Level 7B.

*Hallucinatory states*

DOB is capable of producing a full range of low and high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is significantly less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. These effects include:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - Although DOB is technically capable of producing of hallucinatory states in a fashion that is on par with psilocin or DMT in its vividness and intensity, in comparison, these effects are extremely rare and inconsistent. Whilst traditional psychedelics such as LSA, Ayahuasca and Mescaline will induce internal hallucinations near consistently at level 5 geometry and above, DOB will for most simply go straight into Level 7A visual geometry. This lack of consistently induced hallucinatory breakthroughs means that for most, LSD is simply not as deep of an experience as certain other psychedelics.

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of DOB are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly includes:

- **Enhancements**
- **Distortions**
- **Hallucinations**

**Health effects, addiction potential and tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational DOB use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because DOB is a research chemical with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried DOC within the psychedelic community suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly but nothing can be completely guaranteed.

DOB is not physically addictive and many users experience a frequency self-regulating quality to the drug. Tolerance for DOC seems to be very mild and does not build up without repeated use over a short period of time.

**Legal Issues:**

- **International:** DOB is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
- **Australia:** DOB is schedule II
- **Canada:** Listed as a Schedule 1 as it is an analogue of amphetamine.
- **New Zealand:** DOB is Schedule I (Class A) in New Zealand. DOB would also qualify as an “Analogue” under New Zealand’s catch-all Analogues section in Schedule 3 / Class C of their drug laws that would make 2C-I, 2C-E, DOI, DOB, ephedrine, and pseudoephedrine Schedule 3 compounds in New Zealand.
- **Poland:** DOB is controlled in Poland.
- **UK:** DOB is Schedule I/Class A in the U.K., making it illegal to sell, buy, or possess without a license.

**Conclusion:**

Although DOB could be considered as bland and generic in comparison to DOC and other more traditional psychedelics, it is still a worthwhile experience and perfect for recreational events. This substance can be generally described as a less insightful version of LSD with a longer duration, generic visual and an emptier headspace.

 Drug Interactions Contra-Indications
 
---
 
 DOB is a phenethylamine with a character similar to 2C-B but several times longer in duration. Because of this duration, many people prefer to do it earlier in the day. Caution...DOB takes a fairly long time to onset (up to 3 hours) for most people. Do not redose thinking you haven't taken enough. 
 
 As the effects of DOB first come on, the user feels a rush of energy which can be exhilerating or uncomfortable, depending on the person and the dose. A small majority of people report slightly less stomach discomfort than with 2C-B, although, as with all substances, each person reacts differently and there are also reports of higher discomfort than with 2C-B. Some people also report a greater ability to both eat and sleep with DOB than with LSD. 
 
 As DOB settles in, it has a long plateau (3-10 hours, depending on person and dose). Higher doses extend the length in addition to increasing the effects. .Some people boost their DOB experience with a small supplement between T+3 and T+6 hours. The booster usually kicks in a bit faster than the original dose (45 minutes). 
 
 
- light doses of DOB last from 6-12 hours
- medium doses of DOB last from 8-16 hours
- heavy doses of DOB can last more than 24 hours
 See [DOB Dosages](https://erowid.org/dob_dose.shtml) for information about dosage. 
 
 As with many other entheogens, its often best to avoid eating for at least 2 hours (4 is better) beforehand and don't eat until after the peak. 
 
 Light Effects: (plateau between 3 and 6 hours) An increase in energy, feeling of mental clarity, opening of mental space, less confusing than low doses of LSD, very light visual activity, visual patterns superimposed on vision, enhanced texture perception, shift in colors. Some people find it possible to sleep on low doses of DOB, though probably not at the peak. 
 
 Body load usually manageable. Nervousness, edginess, some body discomfort, stomach tension, yawning. 
 
 Medium Effects: (plateau between 4 and 8 hours) Increased duration, energizing, pronounced visual effects, marked clarity and reduction of emotions. Some people suggest this might be a good therapeutic tool in cases where excessive emotion might be a problem. 
 
 Fairly high body load. Muscle and jaw tension, tension headache, eye discomfort, achy back spasms, nausea, general body discomfort. 
 
 Strong Effects: (plateau between 6 and 12 hours) Long duration, visual brightening, able to connect with ideas, heart-opening happiness. 
 
 Overdose: (3.5 + mg) Reports of moderate overdoses appear to often be the result of individuals deciding an hour after their original dose that because they aren't feeling anything they didnt take enough. Be Careful! DOB can take up to 3 hours to onset for some individuals. 
 
 The overdose experience seems to be one of memory loss, irrational and sometimes violent behavior, and the possibility of causing harm to oneself (not noticing pain?). 
 
 CONTRA-INDICATIONS DOB can be quite harmful at high doses. Significant overdoses can cause serious vasso-constriction of the extremeties...possibly resulting in nerve damage and/or gangrene. There are unconfirmed reports of two people who accidentally ingested 75 mg (over 30x the regular dosage) and needed to have their legs amputated because their circulation had shut off and caused gangrene in their legs. 
 
 The use of DOB can be a problem for those with circulatory problems, heart ailments, glaucoma, hypertension, hepatic or renal disease, aneurism, or stroke history. 
 
 DRUG INTERACTIONS DOB can be dangerous if mixed improperly with other drugs especially [MAOI's](https://erowid.org/chemicals/maois/maois.shtml) or other liver-enzyme affecting chemicals. Mixing with stimulants is not recommended. 
 
 **[GHB:](https://erowid.org/../ghb/ghb.shtml)** 
 For some people, GHB has little psychoactive effect during a DOB experience, though it can be used to help sleep at the end.

## SYNTHESIS

## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 2.0 mg) âThere was a continuous tremor at the physical level, and an incredible Moebius strip representation of reality at the intellectual level. I was able to enter into personal problems easily, and get out again when I chose to. During the next day, there were brief lapses of attention, or little fugue states, and it was not until the following evening that I was completely myself again.â

(with 2.8 mg) âAbout three hours into this I had a severe cramp, and had a near fainting response to the pain, and yet there was no pain! I felt that I was very near a loss of consciousness, and this was most disturbing. There were flashes of depersonalization. I saw rings around the moon with prismatic colors, and there were long-lasting âafter-imagesâ following any viewings of points of light. I was still a good plus 1 at 14 hours, but did manage to sleep. It was the next day before I was again at baseline.â

(with 3.0 mg) âThis was a complex, but a very good day. It involved making a large pot of chicken-vegetable soup, and listening to H.L., my favorite Saturday morning fundamentalist Christian radio preacher, bless âim. The Democrats are not exactly all anti-American dupes of Moscow (or the Devil), but to H.L., they are practically, almost, next-door to it. The Rapture is supposed to happen tomorrow according to a certain book, newly published (just in time, looks like) and he is busy softening the possible disappointment of those who may find themselves unchanged Monday morning. Wunnerful. Itâs been one heck of a good experiment, and I canât understand why we waited nine years to try this gorgeous stuff. Without going into the cosmic and delicious details, letâs just say itâs a great material and a good level.â

(with 0.5 mg of the âRâ isomer) âI am underway, and this is a smooth intoxication. I am completely functional, but still really a plus two. I would not choose to drive a car. Not very far. I felt a rather quick dropping to a plus-one at the fifth hour, but there is a residual stimulation still the following morning.â

(with 1.0 mg of the âRâ isomer) âBy the fourth hour I am absolutely a +++ and am searching the kitchen for food. But what I eat is only so-so. There is not the introspection or intensity of 2.0 milligrams of the racemate material, but this is a rewarding place nonethless. At the 18th hour, there was some fitful sleep, with bizarre dreams. The next day I was still hungry for altered spaces, and successfully challenged the residual plus one with LSD and, as is usually the case, acid cut right through the detritus and allowed a direct shot up to a +++ again.â

(with 1.5 mg of the âRâ isomer) âThis is a +++ but it is vaguely irrational. I feel a heavy body load, but then the temperature outside is over a hundred degrees and I may not be in the best of all physical environments. I would not wish any higher dosage. There were cat-naps at the twelth hour, but most symptoms were still there at the 18th hour. A good experience. It would be interesting to compare this, some day, with 3.0 milligrams of the racemate.â

(with 0.5 mg of the âSâ isomer) âThere are no effects at all.â

(with 1.0 mg of the âSâ isomer) âThere is something warm and nice at a couple of hours into this, but I am no more than threshold, and the effects are very slight. By the fifth hour there are no longer any effects.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
This is one of the last of the experimental compounds within the phenethylamine family on which any animal toxicity studies were performed by me prior to human studies. A mouse injected with 50 mg/kg (ip) showed considerable twitching and was irritable. Another, at 100 mg/kg (ip), had overt shaking at 20 minutes, which evolved into persistent hyperactivity that lasted several hours. Yet another, at 125 mg/kg (ip), lost much of her righting reflex within 15 minutes, entered into convulsions at 50 minutes, and was dead a half hour later. A fourth mouse, at 150 mg/kg (ip), entered into spontaneous convulsions within 10 minutes, and expired in what looked like an uncomfortable death at 22 minutes following injection. What was learned? That the LD50 was somewhere between 100 and 125 mg/kg for the mouse. And an effective dose in man of maybe 2 mg (for an 80 kg man) is equivalent to 25 μg/kg. Therefore the index of safety (the therapeutic index, the lethal dose divided by the effective dose) is well over a thousand. I feel that two mice were killed without anything of value having been received in return.

Actually, it is very likely that the damaging, if not lethal, level of DOB in man is a lot lower than this ratio would imply. There was a report of a death of a young lady following the snorting of an amount of DOB so massive, there was the actual recovery of over nine milligrams of the drug from her body tissues in the post-mortem examination. It was said that she and her companion had thought that the drug they were using was MDA and, taking a dosage appropriate for this, effectively overdosed themselves. He survived, following convulsions and an extended period (several weeks) of being in a comatose state. Tragic examples have been reported that involve arterial vascular spasm. But in most overdose cases ascribed to DOB, the identity of the drug has remained unestablished.

As with DOI, the presence of a heavy atom, the bromine atom, in DOB makes the radioactive isotope labelled material a powerful research tool. Studies with DOB labelled with either 82Br or 77Br have been used in human subjects to follow the distribution of the drug. The use of a whole body scanner permits the imaging of the intact body, with the travelings of the radioactivity easily followed from outside. A fascinating finding is that DOB goes first and foremost to the human lung where it accumulates for a couple of hours. It is only afterwards that the brain level builds up. There is a strong implication that some metabolic conversion occurs in the lung, and it is only after this that the truly active metabolite is available for central action. This is consistent with the relatively slow onset of effect, and the very long duration of action.

As with all the other psychedelics which can and have been studied as their optical isomers, it is the âRâ isomer of DOB that is the more active than the racemic mixture, and the âSâ is certainly much less active, but it has never been run up to fully active levels. The alpha-ethyl homologue of DOB is mentioned under ARIADNE. The positionally rearranged isomers of DOB are discussed under META-DOB.

**4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine** (also known as **dimethoxybromoamphetamine** , **brolamfetamine** , **bromo-DMA** , and commonly as **DOB** ) is a [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) class that produces unusually long-lived [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . It is a member of the [DOx](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOx) family of psychedelic amphetamines.

While DOB had first been synthesized in 1967 and briefly tested in 1971, it took until the 1991 publication of the book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) ("Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved") by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) to be documented in-depth.

Today, DOB is used as a recreational drug and an [entheogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogen) . It is still rarely sold online but is more commonly found in the streets the form of misrepresented [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) due to its ability to fit onto similar-sized blotter paper. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of DOB in humans. Along with its sensitive dose-response, unusually long and unpredictable duration, many reports also suggest that this substance may be overly difficult to use safely for those who are not already very experienced with using [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) . It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

DOB or 4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxy-amphetamine is a molecule of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) class. Amphetamines are substituted phenethylamines containing a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain and a methyl group bound to the alpha carbon R α . DOB contains methoxy functional groups OCH 3 attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 as well as a bromine atom attached to carbon R 4 of the phenyl ring. DOB is the amphetamine analogue of the phenethylamine [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) .

DOB has a stereocenter and *R* -(–)-DOB is the eutomer. This is an important finding as it is suggestive that it is targeting different receptors relative to most other [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) where the *R* -isomer serves as the distomer. The toxicity of DOB is not fully known, although high doses may cause serious vasoconstriction of the extremities. DOB is one of the most potent compounds in [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) .

While the active dose is similar to that of DOI, another psychedelic amphetamine, DOB has been shown to have a higher efficacy in triggering downstream effects mediated by 5-HT2 receptors, making it likely to be slightly more dangerous than DOI in overdose, due to greater vasoconstrictive action. Omission of the amphetamine related α-methyl leads to 2C-B, a compound that possesses a lower affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor and is a weaker receptor agonist which results in drastically reduced vasoconstriction.

## Pharmacology

DOB's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2 receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) family as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . DOB appears to be quite selective for the 5-HT 2B receptor and is often used in scientific research when studying the 5-HT 2 receptor subfamily. It has been suggested that DOB is a prodrug metabolized in the lungs. Due to its selectivity, DOB is often used in scientific research when studying the 5-HT 2 receptor subfamily. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

Excessively high doses of this hallucinogen may cause diffuse arterial spasm. The vasospasm responded readily to intra-arterial and intravenous vasodilators, such as tolazoline.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - DOB is usually considered to be extremely stimulating at levels which do not become overwhelming and are encouraged instead of forced. This results in a shakiness and unsteadiness of the hands at high dosages, but encourages the person to move around, run, dance, climb and generally engage in physical activities. The level of stimulation varies between users with some people reporting it to be somewhat similar to [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) in its intensity and others reporting that it is extremely subtle even at higher dosages. In comparison, other more commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) are generally sedating and relaxed.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of DOB is manifested as somewhat intense in comparison to most classical [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . The sensation itself can be described as a constantly present yet somewhat mild energetic pins and needles sensation that encompasses a person’s entire body. It is usually static in its position and felt over every square inch of the skin as if it was coming from behind the user's body. Occasionally, however, it manifests itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - It should be noted that this effect is not as reliably induced as it is with substances like stimulants or entactogens, and can just as easily manifest as physical discomfort without any apparent reason. DOB and other psychedelic amphetamines tend to lean towards physical dysphoria more so than other psychedelics.
- **[Changes in felt bodily form](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_bodily_form)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - Feelings of enhanced tactile sensation are consistently present at moderate levels throughout most DOB experiences.
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)**
- **[Bodily pressures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_pressures)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)**
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)**
- **[Muscle cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_cramps)**
- **[Necrosis](/w/index.php?title=Necrosis&action=edit&redlink=1)** - Serious overdoses have sometimes led to necrosis. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Mild to extreme nausea is typically reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes once the user has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Stomach cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stomach_cramps)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - This effect is reported to be more common than with other psychedelics and can feel prominent and uncomfortable.
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Increased salivation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_salivation)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)**
- **[Diarrhea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diarrhea)**
- **[Restless legs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Restless_legs)** ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#_morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Depth perception distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depth_perception_distortions)**

- **[Brightness alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brightness_alteration)**
- **[Diffraction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diffraction)**
 
#### Geometry
 
DOB visual geometry can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [25I-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25I-NBOMe) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) than that of [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, algorithmic in form, synthetic in feel, brightly lit, multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, sharp in edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, equally rounded and angular in its corners, non-immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity. Higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry over [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
DOB and other [substituted amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamines) produce a full range of high-level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more or less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) . These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - In comparison to other [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , DOB is extremely high in internal hallucinations when approaching higher dosages. They are more common within dark environments and can be comprehensibly described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme.
- **[External hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations)** - These are often present during the comedown and can include [shadow people](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Shadow_people) , among other indescribable beings. These external hallucinations are often lucid, interactive, autonomous, and robust. As [sleep deprivation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation) and [stimulant psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant_psychosis) surface, a [trip sitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Trip_sitter) should accompany individuals sensitive to stimulants for the last part of the comedown. The visual effects of psychosis have been reported to blend into the psychedelic visuals around the 16-24 hour mark, sometimes accompanied by auditory hallucinations. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The head space of DOB is described by many as one of prominent mental stimulation and a powerful enhancement of a person's current mental state. Many users report that it may not be as deep as other traditional psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) and that it is comparatively empty regarding its insightfulness. 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** & **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)**
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This component is inconsistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are much weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , but still prove strong enough to provide therapeutic effects.
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Suggestibility enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Suggestibility_enhancement)**
- **[Language suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)** - While DOB is technically able to produce states of ego dissolution, it tends to more often than not develop only in extremely high doses, with grave physical and mental side effects being apparent and is often of a terrifying nature.
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects

- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring but seems only to be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- Transpersonal states are reported to be less consistent and reproducible than on other psychedelics like [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) . This can perhaps be attributed to the noticeable physical and stimulating effects that this substance produces, which tends to interfere with the ability for the user to immerse themselves in the experience fully.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational DOB use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because DOB is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal reports from those who have tried DOB suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

DOB is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of DOB is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 4-7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7-10 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). DOB presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of DOB all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Overdose

The risk of a DOx overdose is present starting in or past the heavy dose range with sensitive people, or when a DOx is mixed with other substances, particularly [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) or [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) . Non-oral routes also seem to exhibit a higher chance of overdosing, perhaps owing to differences in bioavailability, potency and unpredictability of dosage and effects. The effects of a DOx overdose typically include bizarre, [delusional](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion) and sometimes violent behavior, [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [numbness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) . The user may not be able to communicate and can be severely agitated. At appropriately high doses, more serious side effects such as [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attack) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) which in turn further affect a dangerously [elevated heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) , [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) and [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) may occur. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Severe vasoconstriction typically develops to its peak several hours into the intoxication and may require medical assistance if blood flow is significantly cut off for extended periods of time.

In the event of an overdose, [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) can be administered to mitigate the hyperagitative effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] A powerful vasodilator may also need to be administered to prevent a hypertensive emergency, or in more serious cases, necrosis, organ failure and death from the resulting hypoxia. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] As a result, emergency medical services should always be sought in the event of a DOx overdose.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of DOB. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Effects
At the beginning, typical effects of amphetamine unfold, such as increased alertness, accelerated pulse, slight euphoria, increased self-confidence and urge to talk. Afterwards, the effect changes: one often feels a strong urge to move, sensory perception, feelings and empathy are heightened, colours are perceived more distinctly. With DOB and DOI, coloured, superimposed, pulsating patterns are perceived. This effect is weaker with DOM.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Since the effect of DOB comes on late, the danger of overdosing by refilling is particularly great. The long duration of action poses a psychological burden. Confusion or anxiety is common, especially at high doses. Some DOB users report a burning or pressure sensation in the bladder. At high doses, temporary paralysis, inability to communicate or insensitivity to pain (caution: risk of injury and accidents) may occur. Teeth grinding and strain on the cardiovascular system are also possible.

### Long-term Risks
Due to the long and intense effects, use - especially frequent use - carries the risk of a loss of reality, which can manifest itself in schizophrenic traits and anxiety states. The consumption of DOB can trigger latent (hidden) psychoses.

## Safer Use
- DOB are not suitable as party drugs and should only be used by experienced users.
- Plan your trip ahead because of the long duration of action.
- Never consume DOB alone and only when you feel very well mentally and physically and are well rested!
- Pay attention to set and setting: only take DOB in a place where you feel safe and avoid unwanted disturbances from outside! Prepare yourself well for the trip and prepare yourself internally for the long duration of the effect.
- Drink enough water during the trip.
- Mixed use of these potent substances should be avoided at all costs.
- As amphetamine derivatives, DOB can be particularly draining because of their long duration of action. Light vitamin-rich food, fruits, vegetable juices, vitamins and minerals promote a soft landing after the trip has subsided and can weaken a hangover.
- Plan enough time for recovery after the trip (at least 1 day)!
- A trip with DOB should remain an exceptional experience. Make sure to take long breaks from consumption so that the experience can be processed.

*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/dob/*

DOB is a psychedelic known for its potent nature and long-lasting effects. It is pretty uncommon, though some use has been reported since the 1970s.

It’s a clearly stimulating drug, distinguishing it from a psychedelic like psilocin.

The substance is part of the DOx class of substituted amphetamines.

---

DOB = 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine; 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenylisopropylamine; Bromo-DMA; 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine; Brolamfetamine; PBR

PubChem: 62065

Molecular formula: C11H16BrNO2

Molecular weight: 274.158 g/mol

IUPAC: 1-(4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)propan-2-amine

---

## Dose

#### Oral

**R-DOB**

Range: 0.5 – 1.5 mg

**Racemate**

Light: 0.2 – 1 mg

Common: 1 – 2 mg

Strong: 2 – 3 mg

---

## Timeline

#### Oral

Total: 12 – 24 hours

Onset: 1-2 hours for some effects, 3-4 hours for full effects

Although the psychedelic effects generally subside within ~24 hours, stimulation and insomnia sometimes persist up to 36 hours, which is influenced by the dose.

Because the drug can take hours to become clearly active, impulsive redosing is a concern. Don’t redose even if it doesn’t appear to be working in the first couple hours!

## Experience Reports

[Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_DOB.shtml)

## Effects

#### Positive

- OEVs
- CEVs
- Stimulation
- Mood improvement
- Music enhancement
- Tactile enhancement
- Sexual enhancement
- Auditory hallucinations

#### Negative

- Increased heart rate
- Increased blood pressure
- Increased temperature
- Vasoconstriction
- Muscle tension
- Insomnia
- Confusion
- Anxiety

DOB can be compared to 2C-B and LSD in terms of its core effects. Though it lasts longer than both and may have an overall higher rate of negative experiences.

It generally causes less thought-warping (e.g. thought loops, very strange thinking) than a psychedelic like psilocin, but confusion and severely altered thinking are still possible.

The thought-related effects seem highly variable. Some describe it as “stronger” or more difficult than LSD, while others find it leads to more easily working through emotional, intellectual, and analytical content. In the latter class, this effect contributes to the substance being viewed as having a “clearer” mental state. Its propensity to occasion analytical and intellectual thinking is viewed as a significant positive effect by some.

Some of 2C-B’s sexual and entactogen effects are also present with DOB. It’s generally more stimulating.

Dissociation has been reported quite a bit. It may involve a feeling of detachment from the body, mind, or environment. This is sometimes reported to a lesser extent on the following day.

Users can feel very happy and more empathic. They can also feel distraught, anxious, and stressed.

There are a few factors that may raise the chance of a positive experience. Those include having prior psychedelic use, truly understanding what you’re taking, and having a complete 24+ hour period available.

#### Negatives

A lot of users find it’s difficult to ever feel “at ease” on DOB. The negative physical effects can include mild to severe nausea, muscle cramps, and a general feeling of unpleasantness.

#### Sensory effects

Sensory enhancement is common. There are conflicting reports about the visuals.

While many users report significant visual effects, some of the earliest and formal reports indicated visuals aren’t a major part of the experience. In fact, it produces little to no visuals at common doses, according to some reports.

When visuals are present, they’re generally reported as more along the lines of distortions of perception than a lot of colors or fractals. More complex changes can occur, such as faces being altered to a significant degree.

#### Stimulation & sleep

DOB is very stimulating and has a prominent amphetamine-like quality. The stimulation may appear in the first 1-2 hours before the psychedelic effects really begin.

Its stimulation can be uncomfortable, leading to feelings of jitteriness and unease.

The feeling of stimulation may balance out and become less uncomfortable by about 3 to 5 hours, though not always.

DOB’s stimulant quality can contribute to a user feeling physically stronger and possibly more confident (mainly in terms of having “confident” thought processes).

Sleep is sometimes possible by ~15 hours. Others find wakefulness is provided for at least 25-30+ hours. It may increase the chance of vivid dreams and there could be some residual mental effects upon waking.

#### Impact of dose

The threshold for any notable effects appears to be around 200 ug.

At light doses, DOB can cause color enhancement, minor visual changes, an impact on emotions and perceived meaning, and fairly clear psychedelic-like thinking.

Common doses can lead to more stimulation, easier exploring of conceptual/emotional/intellectual items, light to moderate visuals, tactile enhancement, and the other core effects. Some of the bodily effects include muscle tension, nausea, and general discomfort.

Strong doses raise the chance of visuals as well as the chance of discomfort, confusion, disorientation, and greater thought changes.

The duration is influenced by the dose. Light doses may only last 12 hours, while common/strong doses can last for 18-24 hours or longer.

#### Formal research

A 1971 paper from Chile looked at the impact of the drug in a psychotherapeutic setting. It was given at 0.2 to 2 mg orally.

As the dose increased, so did intellectual and emotional stimulation. Meanwhile, no dose effect on perception was apparent. The drug was basically devoid of perceptual distortions.

DOB enhanced “intellectual and emotional thinking” with an “increase in the level of fluency and attention while maintaining full communication capabilities.”

It was compared to MDA. It differed in that subjects were more active and had greater contact with the environment.

There was a sense of greater significance with ordinary events and there was a motivation towards introspection, similar to other psychedelics.

The paper concluded by stating it “would appear to be potentially as useful an adjunct to psychotherapy as MDA.”

DOB at 1-2 mg lasted for 11 to 24 hours, with an onset for some effects of about an hour.

#### Animal tests

Experiment with beagle dogs

DOB at 0.05 mg/kg and LSD at 10-15 ug/kg led to similar physiological responses in terms of pupil dilation, increased heart rate, increased temperature, and increased respiration.

Experiment with cats

DOB at 0.1 mg/kg produced head and body shakes, as well as limb flicks.

---

## Chemistry & Pharmacology

#### Chemistry

It’s a substituted amphetamine in the DOx class and the amphetamine analog of 2C-B.

The substance is distinguished by a bromine atom at the 4 position and two methoxy groups.

DOB has been developed as a radioligand with 3H, 77Br, and 82Br.

#### Pharmacology

Often sold as a racemate, within which R-DOB is the more active form.

It is likely operating through serotonin receptor agonism. 5-HT2A may be a primary site of action, with 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C also potentially affected.

DOB has CYP2D6 inhibitory properties, but not to the degree that interactions are likely, according to one report.

**Animal research**

Paper 1

A study using guinea big trachea found DOB led to partial agonist effects at 5-HT2 receptors that were blocked by ketanserin, pirenperone, and Ly 53857.

Paper 2

Suggested serotonergic and possibly dopaminergic involvement in the drug’s activity.

Test used behavior in cats: head-body shakes, limb flicks, and abortive grooming.

A larger haloperidol dose (0.4 mg/kg rather than 0.2 mg/kg) significantly reduced head-body shakes and limb flicks.

Activity in cats was blocked by cinanserin, a 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C antagonist. Methysergide was also effective in preventing all behaviors.

Paper 3

Repeated DOB application in rats led to a significant reduction in frontocortical 5-HT2 binding sites and 5-HT2 signalling.

Although it had no affinity for glutamate binding sites, it also reduced mGlu2/3 signalling. This suggests tolerance to shaking behaviors in rats may not just come from 5-HT2A downregulation but from adaptations of downstream glutamate receptors.

#### Pharmacokinetics

DOB first accumulated in the lungs after IV administration, followed by the liver and brain. It was immediately found in the lungs, the liver’s max concentration appeared in 0.5-1.5 hours, and the brain’s max concentration appeared in 3-6 hours.

Similar distribution was seen after oral administration, but without the initial pulmonary concentration.

The drug is highly metabolized. Only a small amount of unchanged drug is excreted.

At least some demethylation from CYP2D6 is present and one of the demethylation metabolites is 2-methoxy-5-hydroxy-4-bromoamphetamine.

A study in rats suggested DOB undergoes single or double O-demethylation, oxidative deamination, and then reduction to the corresponding alcohol.

## History

#### 1967

First synthesized by Alexander Shulgin.

It was created to look at the impact of 4-position substitutions on metabolic stability.

#### 1971

The first published report about the drug appeared.

Shulgin found in toxicology tests that the LD50 in mice was around 100-125 mg/kg (IP), while the threshold dose was about 0.004 mg/kg. This was taken to mean the therapeutic index (LD50 in mice/ED50 in humans) was around 1,000. We now know the safety ratio is much smaller.

It was decided a clinical trial should be pursued and one was carried out at the University of Chile (see: Effects section.)

#### 1970s

Confirmed to be a highly potent psychedelic and unique among psychedelics at the time for possessing a high atomic weight atom (bromine) that’s important to its action.

DOB was proposed as a tool for brain scanning and it was eventually developed as a radioligand.

Shulgin used it as a radioligand, reporting that in himself and three others it first accumulated in the lungs post-injection. This was supportive of DOB potentially being a prodrug.

#### 1978

A study suggested serotonergic and possibly dopaminergic actions of the drug based on results from cats.

#### 1970s – 1980s

Use was reported in Australia, Germany, Greece, New Zealand, the UK, and the US. One report showed unit doses in the US ranged from 0.93 to 2.8 mg.

It was particularly important in Australia and to a lesser extent New Zealand, with it first being detected in the former in 1976.

Between 1976 and 1981, it was seized by police in Auckland, Sydney, Adelaide, and Brisbane. DOB was seized more frequently than any other hallucinogen, whereas it represented just 2% of seized hallucinogens in the UK around the same time.

Since there was a high seizure rate among police and a low rate among Customs, it was suggested manufacturing was taking place locally.

“Thousands” of doses were reportedly analyzed by local labs. It was generally present as the HCL salt and sold on blotter paper. In 1982, there were eight new blotter designs observed by a laboratory in just a few months.

Evidence from analyses indicated the concentration varied significantly. In one example, the strength per unit was 1.4 to 4.6 mg.

The variable doses and the fact that it was generally being sold as LSD (or like LSD) contributed to overdoses. Multiple nonfatal and fatal overdoses were recorded around this time. Two treatments listed in the case reports were diazepam and haloperidol.

A clandestine laboratory in Victoria, Australia (1980) was found to be synthesizing DOB from 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde.

Another laboratory in the UK was found to be synthesizing with an eight-step method from hydroquinone.

#### 1993 – 2008

The Netherlands’ Drug Information and Monitoring System (DIMS) reported an analysis of 33,006 MDMA tablets. DOB was rarely detected during that time, with a rate of about 1-10 cases in some of the years.

DOB’s dose per tablet ranged from 0.4 to 5 mg, with an average of 0.9 mg.

#### 2005

Authorities in Sao Paulo, Brazil received 31 gelatin capsules containing a small amount (estimate of 1.5 mg) of white powder.

Similar capsules were reported by the Brazilian federal police. They originated with three different sources and all were connected to “rave parties.”

DOB was found in those samples.

#### 2005

Multiple drugs were seized during a vehicle stop in Burns, Oregon. Blotter paper was among the drug samples and it was found to contain DOB.

#### 2009 – 2015

Energy Control in Spain received 22,062 samples and just 13 contained DOB. They were mainly sold as DOC, DOB, and LSD. Of the 13, 9 were on blotter paper.

#### 2010s

DOB is rarely reported as an adulterant in the MDMA and LSD markets.

It is occasionally used intentionally, but intentional use has always been low.

## Safety

#### LD50

Mouse (IV): 80 mg/kg (potential human equivalent of 6.49 mg/kg)

Mouse (IP): 100 to 125 mg/kg (potential human equivalent of 8.10 to 10.14 mg/kg)

Rat (IP): 50 mg/kg (potential human equivalent of 8.11 mg/kg)

Monkey (IV): 2 mg/kg (potential human equivalent of 0.65 mg/kg)

The dose in monkeys is much lower and appears to be the same in humans. It’s safe to say the potentially fatal dose in humans should be treated as closer to monkeys than mice or rats.

#### Overdose

The primary overdose concerns appear to be cardiovascular issues and seizures. Vasoconstriction is a major problem with the drug.

One study using vascular strips from dorsal metatarsal vein (dog) found that DOM and DOB activated serotonin receptors. It’s possible this could contribute to a direct impact on peripheral vascular tone.

75 mg in a young female who had built a tolerance reportedly led to ergotism-like complications that necessitated amputation. She ended up with bilateral above-the-knee amputations following diffuse peripheral vasospasm.

About 3.5 mg or higher is where the chance of overdose becomes more significant.

Among the potential overdose effects are:

- Disorientation
- Confusion
- Memory impairment (including anterograde amnesia)
- Panic
- Aggression
- Significant stimulation
- Tachycardia
- Hypertension
- Convulsive/seizure activity
- Muscle cramps
- Dissociation and depersonalization
- Coma
- Vasoconstriction

#### Risky combos (list may not be complete)

Other stimulants, other psychedelics, MAOIs, and tramadol.

  "wikipedia": `# 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,5-Dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine*

2,5-Dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine (DOB), also known as brolamfetamine (INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name), is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine, amphetamine, and DOx families. For many years, prior to the discovery of newer compounds, DOB was the most potent known phenethylamine psychedelic. It is taken orally.
The drug acts as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. Analogues of DOB include 2C-B, DOM, DOI, and Bromo-DragonFLY (DOB-DFLY), among others.
DOB was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in 1967 and was described by him and his colleagues in the scientific literature in 1971. Shulgin subsequently further described the effects of DOB in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved).

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists DOB's dose as 1 to 3 mg orally and its duration as 18 to 30 hours. In an earlier publication, he listed its dose as 2 to 3 mg for racemic DOB and 1 to 2 mg for the preferentially active (R)-DOB enantiomer. In addition, he described the duration as being extremely long, with a gradual descent and baseline being achieved after 24 to 36 hours. The onset has been described as 1 to 2 hours, the time to peak as 3 or 4 hours, and a plateau occurring from 4 to 10 hours. Its onset is said to be relatively slow.
The effects of DOB and (R)-DOB have been reported to include visual changes such as prismatic-colored rings around the moon and long-lasting "after-images" following seeing points of light, little visual distortion, an "incredible Moebius strip representation of reality at the intellectual level", rich fantasy, flashes of depersonalization, cosmic thinking, introspection, insights, intoxication, impairment, stimulation, brief lapses in attention or "little fugue states", body load, cramps, muscle tremors, and sleep disruption. At a low dose of 0.4 mg DOB, there was only enhanced visual perception, strengthening of colors, enriched emotional affect, a comfortable good feeling, and colorful and important dreams.
(R)-DOB produced moderate effects at a dose of 0.5 mg and pronounced effects at 1.0 to 1.5 mg, whereas there were no effects with 0.5 mg (S)-DOB and only threshold and very slight effects with 1.0 mg (S)-DOB. In relation to this, (R)-DOB is described as the more active enantiomer and (S)-DOB as much less active. In one report, 1 mg (R)-DOB was described as not as strong as 2 mg DOB, suggesting that it is more potent than the racemate but is not double its potency and hence that (S)-DOB also contributes to the effects of the racemate. (S)-DOB has never been tested up to fully active doses. In another source however, by Richard Glennon and colleagues, the approximate hallucinogenic dose was listed as 0.8 to 2.0 mg for racemic DOB, 0.5 mg for (R)-DOB, and 5.0 mg for (S)-DOB.

## Side effects

Side effects of DOB include body load, muscle tremors, muscle cramps, attention lapses described as "little fugue states", sleeping difficulties, and bizarre dreams.

## Overdose

Overdose of DOB has been reported to produce cardiovascular symptoms and convulsions. Excessively high doses of DOB may cause diffuse arterial spasm. The vasospasm responded readily to intra-arterial and intravenous vasodilators, such as tolazoline. A 35 mg overdose resulted in death, while a 75 mg overdose in a person with tolerance resulted in ergotism-like complications that required amputation.

## Interactions

DOB may interact synergistically with alcohol.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

DOB is a serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptor agonist. Its psychedelic effects are mediated by its agonistic properties at the 5-HT2A receptor. Due to its selectivity, DOB is often used in scientific research when studying the 5-HT2 receptor subfamily.
It is a very weak agonist of the human trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and a weak agonist of the rhesus monkey TAAR1. In contrast to the serotonin releasing agent MDMA, DOB does not produce protein kinase C (PKC) activation in the brains of rodents in vivo. The PKC activation by MDMA appears to be dependent on uptake by the serotonin transporter (SERT).
DOB has been found to reduce aggression in rats.
DOB is one of the most potent compounds in PiHKAL; while the active dose is similar to that of DOI, another psychedelic amphetamine, DOB has been shown to have a higher efficacy in triggering downstream effects mediated by serotonin 5-HT2 receptors.

## Chemistry

The full name of the chemical is 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine. DOB has a stereocenter and R-(−)-DOB is the eutomer. This is an important finding as it is suggestive that it is targeting different receptors relative to most other phenethylamines (e.g. MDMA) where the R-isomer serves as the distomer.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of DOB has been described.

### Analogues

Omission of the amphetamine related α-methyl leads to 2C-B, a compound that possesses a lower affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor and is a weaker receptor agonist. Other analogues of DOB include 4C-B, Bromo-DragonFLY, DOB-FLY, DOB-5-hemiFLY, and 25B-NBOMe, among others.

## History

DOB was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in 1967. It was first described in the scientific literature in a paper by Shulgin, Claudio Naranjo, and another colleague in 1971. The INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name of DOB, brolamfetamine, was proposed and recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1986. This was the same year that the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) was founded. DOB was registered with the WHO as a supposed "anorexic" (appetite suppressant).

## Society and culture

### Legal status

Internationally, DOB is a Schedule I substance under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances and the drug is legal only for medical, industrial or scientific purposes.

#### Canada

Listed as a Schedule 1 as it is an analogue of amphetamine.

#### Australia

DOB is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (February 2017). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.

#### Russia

Schedule I, possession of at least 10 mg is a criminal offence.

#### United Kingdom

DOB is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

#### United States

DOB is a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law in the United States. It was scheduled in 1973.
