*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/etizolam/*

Etizolam is a benzodiazepine-like drug that provides sedation, euphoria, and anxiety-reduction. It has been used medically in some regions for issues like anxiety, depression, insomnia, and panic disorder.

The substance is currently used by many people in non-medical settings, with etizolam being purchased online.

Most of the issues with the drug arise from excessive sedation, memory loss, and disinhibition. If a high strong+ dose is used or it is combined with other depressants, it could be very physically dangerous.
