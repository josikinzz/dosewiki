DESCRIPTION #
 
General Effects Notes
 The effects of 4-MeO-PCP are usually compared to [PCP](https://erowid.org/chemicals/pcp/) or [ketamine](https://erowid.org/pharms/ketamine) , but there are too few experience reports with reliably sourced material to say much with confidence. It seems to be less potent than both ketamine or PCP. Reports of negative effects increase with redosing. People are reporting mild but noticeable effects persisting into the next day. 
 
 
Addiction and Compulsive Use
 It is not yet known how addictive or likely 4-MeO-PCP is to cause compulsive use. Effects last long enough that redosing is not common, however, related substances have been associated with compulsive redosing. Because its use is so new and uncommon, no definitive statements about it can yet be made.
