## Subjective Experience

IPPH is a structural analogue of methylphenidate. It appeared on the online markets
at the start of 2015, attracting mixed reviews, and was one of five phenidates
specifically banned in the UK in April of that year.

I tested it in January 2015, and posted the following report. At the time, most other
reports seemed to compare it to EPH, which was one of the most commonly used
legal phenidates of that period. I purposely avoided this approach, largely because I
subjectively felt that EPH was a little one-dimensional.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I begin the experiment by taking 25mg orally on a reasonably empty
stomach. Given that it is fairly late in the day, I am gambling that suggestions
that there is little residue-stim are correct. [5pm]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
From the few reports posted so far, this does not seem to be a significant dose.
Note also that I have not sampled any chemicals for a week or so, although I
did drink a couple of beers last night.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The taste is not the worst, but chems are never really palatable.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
T+0:30 Thirty minutes in, there is nothing to note.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:15 Again, there is nothing particularly notable to report. I feel that I could
be slightly affected, but equally, this is so weak that it could be a placebo
effect.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
As others report of full effects within an hour this is somewhat disappointing.
I therefore redose with a further 35mg. This takes me to the 60mg maximum I
had set aside at the outset.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:15 It suddenly dawns on me: I am indeed under the influence.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
It is subtle, mild, and doesn't create the same sort of buzz associated with the
currently popular stimulants. I can now see the relevance of third party
comments regarding focus and mind-only stimulation with little physical
effect.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Perhaps this escaped me on the earlier 25mg dose, as my expectation had
been firmly set on a more all embracing and traditional experience.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
There is no euphoria, but there is a certain clarity, and gentle delivery.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:00 To finish off I decide to insufflate a couple of lines, to establish if there
is a kick via this route. It appears to be kinder on the nose than substances like
EPH and 3-FPM.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:30 There wasn't a kick, but perhaps the earlier effects are now a little
more pronounced.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I can also confirm that there is no significant dilation of the pupils, and that I
am experiencing no jaw tension.
\`\`\`
I managed to sleep a few hours later, indicating that as expected residue-stimulation
from this chemical isn't excessive. I should also note that there was no horn, but on
the other side of the coin, no significant stim-dick either.

All in all this was a fairly pleasant experience with little body load, although I suspect
that the mind-set has to be correct to get the most out of it. If you are looking for an
all-firing high, or wired excitation, you will be disappointed. It does however seem to
be well suited to a situation in which broad functionality is required; perhaps when
having to endure a somewhat boring scenario or social event.

Another question is whether it could be used as a potentiator for other substances. It
has that sort of feel, but this is probably an area for comment by someone who is
more qualified to discuss the chemistry of combinations than I am.

Would I take it again? Yes I would, but in the right setting and with the correct
expectation.

Isopropylphenidate (IPPH) is a phenidate class stimulant that appeared in the research chemical market in the 2010s. It primarily offers functional stimulation and comes with little recreational potential.

The substance is often said to be relatively good for focus and it could potentially be a good drug for those with ADHD. However, due to its research chemical status, we don’t know the drug’s long-term safety.

## Effects

#### Positives

- Stimulation
- Mood elevation
- Increased focus
- Increased motivation
- Increased talkativeness

#### Negatives

- Increased heart rate
- Increased blood pressure
- Jaw tension
- Insomnia
- Dry mouth
- Anxiety

IPPH largely lacks recreational and euphoric potential. Most people find common doses provide little more than a minor mood boost and improved task enjoyment. Even as the dose increases, it doesn’t become an especially fun stimulant. This means it’s really geared towards productive applications, like studying and working.

Some of the intranasal use reports mention a brief euphoric “rush.”

It can be good for talking, though some people prefer to work, not talk.

The substance is clear-headed with its mental effects, allowing people to remain focused and not distracted by their own thinking or other tasks. This could stop being the case with strong+ doses, which can increase task-switching and infringe upon productivity.

Because people are more content with whatever they’re working on and they may be more motivated, it’s easier to get through boring tasks.

The focus it provides typically doesn’t lead to strong “tunnel vision,” so it’s easier to break way from a task than with some other stimulants.

It’s fairly relaxed with the way it feels physically. Users typically don’t need to move around much, sweating isn’t significant, and the cardiac activity isn’t highly noticeable. Vasoconstriction could appear, though it’s not usually uncomfortable.

Jaw tension, like with other stimulants, could appear. It seems to produce less appetite suppression than some other stimulants.

IPPH can somewhat alter your psychological status. For example, it may increase the tendency to become aggravated. And it can raise or lower anxiety, depending on the person (or have no impact).

#### Compared to other stimulants

The substance is often said to be more subtle than other stimulants. It can elevate your mood to a minor degree and provide some stimulation, but it doesn’t extend much beyond that.

Many people have reported it feels as good as methylphenidate from a purely functional perspective. Sometimes it may even feel better due to a relative lack of somatic effects and “speediness,” so it’s been suggested to be a particularly good ADHD drug.

Because of this effect profile, some people have already jumped to using it daily or near-daily. This isn’t recommended since it is a research chemical and little is known about its safety.

It could be lacking in the strong pro-motivation effects seen with other stimulants, though the rise in motivation may still be adequate to help people.

As long as you use a common dose, it can offer caffeine-like levels of focus enhancement and productivity, but without the somatic jitteriness.

#### Comedown

The comedown, if it exists, is almost always mild. There are some reports of lower motivation, lower mood, a higher likelihood of agitation, insomnia, and headache. Usually the symptoms only persist for a few hours, at most.

## Chemistry & Pharmacology

#### Chemistry

IPPH is a member of the phenidate class of compounds, which are all esters of ritalinic acid and its analogs.

The most notable member of this class is methylphenidate. IPPH differs from that substance by the substitution of an isopropyl moiety in place of a methyl moiety.

#### Pharmacology

It functions as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). This means it blocks the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, effectively boosting their functional concentrations.

Compared to methylphenidate, it has significantly less impact on norepinephrine, pushing it closer to a pure dopamine reuptake inhibitor. This could potentially reduce its wakefulness effects, but it may also reduce the chance of some physical negatives like cardiovascular stimulation.

Like methylphenidate, its primary metabolite is ritalinic acid, an inactive substance. This metabolism occurs via the action of carboxylesterase 1 (CES1). IPPH seems to be a poorer substrate for CES1, which could slow down its metabolism and contribute to its lower dose range.

Papers

(Markowitz, 2013)

- Evaluated its binding using human DAT/NET/SERT in Chinese hamster ovary cells.
- Results 
- Monoamine transporter binding and cellular uptake studies 
- IPPH has significantly less NE activity than methylphenidate.
- Both IPPH and methylphenidate produce significant DAT inhibition, without notably affecting SERT.
- Values 
- At 10 uM, the % of inhibition of control uptake 
- DA uptake 
- IPPH: 96%
- Methylphenidate: 90%
- NE uptake 
- IPPH: 62%
- Methylphenidate: 117%
- 5-HT uptake 
- IPPH: 28%
- Methylphenidate: 35%
- Hydrolysis of IPPH, ethylphenidate, and methylphenidate 
- CES1 is highly expressed in human liver.
- The catalytic efficiency of CES1-mediated hydrolysis is 10-fold higher for methylphenidate than for IPPH.
- IPPH is a poor substrate for CES1. Though it’s still predominantely metabolized (hydrolyzed) by CES1, but at a markedly lower rate.
- Rat locomotor activity 
- IPPH produced robust locomotor effects vs. saline following 10 mg/kg (IP).
- Interpretation 
- IPPH exhibits substantially less binding for NET than methylphenidate.
- Suggests IPPH is mainly a dopaminergic drug, with significantly less noradrenergic activity at 10 uM. 
- This could lead to less impact on HR and BP.
- It’s a relatively poor substrate for CES1. Though it is primarily metabolized via this pathway to ritalinic acid, just like methylphenidate.
 
- - Speculation: This might be due to the bulkier isopropyl substituent.

## History

#### 1961

US patent 2012/0245201 mentions an earlier study (Portoghese and Malspeis, 1961) that suggested IPPH was more resistant to acid- and base-catalyzed hydrolysis relative to methylphenidate.

#### 2012

US patent 2012/0245201 from John Markowitz of the Department of Pharmacotherapy and Translational Research at University of Florida, Gainesville.

This highlighted its potential utility in the treatment of ADHD and fatigue-related disorders.

It covered the use of the drug as a treatment for ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults. The dose was listed as 25 – 50 mg for dl-threo-isopropylphenidate.

#### March 2015

The EU’s Early Warning System was first notified about its presence. This report came from the UK.

#### As of March 2015

The UK’s WEDINOS drug checking organization received 7 samples of IPPH. All were white powders and the route of administration was listed as “snort/sniff.”

#### April 2015

Subjected to a Temporary Class Drugs Order in the UK.

#### As of September 2017

It’s still a member of the research chemical market.

---

## Legal Status

#### US (as of September 2017)

Uncontrolled at the federal level. Always check your state laws before doing anything with the substance.

#### International

Australia: Uncontrolled at the federal level.

Canada: Schedule 3 as an analog of methylphenidate.

UK: Class B

---

## Safety

The safety of isopropylphenidate isn’t known, largely due to it being a research chemical. It’s best to use common doses, infrequently, and without combinations.

An overdose could conceivably raise the risk of seizure and the risk of cardiovascular complications.

As of September 2017 there have been no fatalities linked to IPPH discussed in the literature.

#### Risky Combinations

- Tramadol
- Other stimulants
- Psychedelics

Isopropylphenidate (also known as IPH and IPPD) is a piperidine based stimulant drug, closely related to methylphenidate, but with the methyl ester replaced by an isopropyl ester. It has similar effects to methylphenidate but with a longer duration of action, and was banned in the UK as a Temporary Class Drug from April 2015 following its unapproved sale as a designer drug.
It has been researched as potential methylphenidate replacement for ADHD and narcolepsy, because of fewer side effects.
