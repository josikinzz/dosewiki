(Mushrooms)

Psilocin is a naturally occurring tryptamine psychedelic found within approximately 190 separate species of mushroom and growing on every continent across the planet. Psychedelic mushrooms have been in use since before recorded human history with their depiction being found on cave art and famously used by the native people of Mesoamerica for religious and shamanic purposes.

There are two separate chemicals found within mushrooms in roughly equal amounts. They are both classed as substituted tryptamine alkaloids and serotonergic psychedelic drugs, but it’s important to note that only psilocin is directly active. The other substance, psilocybin, is instead a pro-drug of the pharmacologically active substance psilocin and converted directly into it within the liver. Once the molecule has been converted into psilocin, it acts as a partial agonist for several serotonergic receptors. Psilocin has a high affinity for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor in the brain where it mimics the effects of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT).

The psilocin experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe the chemical.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of Psilocin can be broken down into two components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - The body high of psilocin can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft and all-encompassing tingling sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **Sedation** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, psilocin is considered by most to be relaxing, stoning and mildly sedating. This sense of sedation is often accompanied by compulsive yawning, a runny nose and watering eyes.

**Cognitive Effects:**

The head space of psilocin is described by many as extremely relaxing, profound and stoning in its style when compared to other commonly used psychedelics such as LSD or 2C-B which tend to be energetic and stimulating. It contains a large number of psychedelic typical and unique cognitive effects.

The most prominent of these typical effects generally include:

- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Connectivity of thought**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Time distortion**
- **Outrospection 
**
- **Deja-Vu**
- **Removal of cultural filter**
- **Feelings of predeterminism**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Direct communication with the subconsious**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**
- **Feelings of interdependent opposites**
- **Delusions**
- **States of unity and interconnectedness**
- **Enhancement and suppression cycles - **This can be described as constant waves of extremely stimulated and profound thinking which are spontaneously surpassed in a cyclic fashion by waves of general thought suppression and mental intoxication. These two states seem to switch between each other in a consistent loop once every 20 - 60 minutes.

**Visual Effects:**

*Enhancements*

Psilocin presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally include:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, effects experienced are detailed below:

- **Visual drifting** (*melting, flowing, breathing and morphing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion and static in its appearance.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition**
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of 4-AcO-DMT, Ayahuasca and 2C-E than LSD. It can be comprehensively described as structured in its organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, blurred in its edges and rounded in its corners. They have a very “natural” feel to them and at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of Level 7B visual geometry over Level 7A.

*Hallucinatory States*

Psilocin and its various other forms produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. These effects generally include:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, landscapes, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.

**Auditory Effects:**

The auditory effects of psilocin are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- **Enhancements**
- **Distortions**
- **Hallucinations**

**Health Effects, Addiction Potential and Tolerance:**

The toxicity of psilocybin, psilacetin and psilocin is extremely low. In rats, the median lethal dose (LD50) of psilocybin when administered orally is 280 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg). Psilocybin comprises approximately 1% of the weight of Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms, so nearly 1.7 kilograms (3.7 lb) of dried mushrooms or 17 kilograms (37 lb) of fresh mushrooms would be required for a 60-kilogram (130 lb) person to reach the 280 mg/kg LD50 value of rats. Based on the results of animal studies, the lethal dose of psilocybin has been extrapolated to be 6 grams which is 1000 times greater than the effective dose of 6 milligrams.

There are no known long term physical effects from ingestion of mushrooms containing psilocybin and psilocin.

Keep in mind that psychedelic mushrooms are non-habit-forming and that the desire to use them can actually decrease with use. They are most often self-regulating. You also build an almost immediate tolerance to them after ingestion, preventing you from experiencing their full effects for more often than every 4-7 days (unless you increase your dose significantly). 

**Legal issues:**

- Psilocybin mushrooms are regulated or prohibited in many countries, often carrying severe legal penalties (for example, the U.S. Psychotropic Substances Act, the UK Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and Drugs Act 2005 and the Canadian Controlled Drugs and Substances Act).
- Psilocybin and psilocin are listed as Schedule I drugs under the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
- On November 29, 2008, the Netherlands announced it would ban the cultivation and use of psilocybin-containing fungi beginning December 1, 2008.
- The UK ban on fresh mushrooms (dried ones were already illegal as they were considered a psilocybin-containing preparation) was introduced in 2005.
- The New Mexico appeals court ruled on June 14, 2005, that growing psilocybin mushrooms for personal consumption could not be considered “manufacturing a controlled substance” under state law. However it still remains illegal under federal law.
- 4-ACO-DMT is unscheduled in the United States. It may be considered an analog of psilocin under the Federal Analog Act.
- 4-ACO-DMT could also be considered illegal in the UK under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. 4-ACO-DMT is an ester of psilocin (to which it metabolizes into). This means that it potentially carries the same penalty as any Class A drug.

If you want to try psilocin despite the legal issues you have multiple options. You can purchase them through a street dealer, grow them yourself using this guide here or you can pick them fresh in your local area during the correct season if you know where to look for them.
If you want to try 4-ACO-DMT despite the legal issues, you can find it for sale through the power of Google. It sold online to the masses through various research chemical vendors who I cannot legally mention the names of.

**Conclusion:**

Psilocin is one of my favourite psychedelics and is best used in silent darkness and in high doses to fully release its hallucinatory effects. Mushrooms are slightly more capable of producing bad trips in people who are inexperienced with psychedelics as they can be a little more confusing. However, they are extremely rewarding in terms of head space, allowing for extremely deep philosophical thoughts and realizations that I have not found with any other substance.

### INTENSITY

3 to 7 for most experiences.

### MATERIAL

There are dozens of species of mushrooms
which contain the psychoactive alkaloids psilocybin/psilocin in active
amounts. 99% of the psilocybin mushrooms I've seen sold on the underground
market are the variety known as Psilocybe cubensis (also called
Stropharia cubensis), and dosage levels discussed below pertain
to this variety. Some species of psilocybin mushrooms contain up to 10
times as much psilocybin by weight as cubensis, producing an equivalent
experience at a much lower dose.
### HISTORY

The use of psilocybin mushrooms can
be traced back thousands of years. In Plants of the Gods, Schultes
and Hofmann trace the use of these mushrooms to numerous locations and
Indian cultures in pre-Colombian Mexico and South America. The Indians
held the mushrooms with such reverence that the Aztecs named them Teonanacatl,
meaning "flesh of the gods" or "divine flesh." Sacred objects relating
to mushrooms, such as the mushroom stones shown above, have been found
dating back as far as 1000 B.C.
Terence McKenna suggests that hallucinogenic
mushroom use may be much older than 3000 years, with the mushrooms being
consumed and worshipped by early forms of humankind. He even suggests that
mushroom spores arriving from outer space may have been some of the earliest
forms of life and intelligence on our planet. Many scientists feel that
life could not have developed on this planet during the 200 to 400 million
year period from when Earth's crust cooled until evidence of the first
living organisms were found. The theory of "panspermia" has been suggested
to account for this. Studies conducted by astrophysicists at the University
of Leiden in Netherlands have determined that certain mushroom spores could
survive up to 45 million years in interstellar transit. (see Nature
- Aug 1, 1985).
### DOSAGE

Although some users eat just one gram
of "shrooms," dried weight, I find this produces little more than threshold
effects. Two grams should produce a mild psychedelic high, five grams should
produce an experience of similar intensity to a 250 mcg. LSD trip. (Five
grams of dried Psilocybe cubensis typically contains about 15 mg.
of psilocybin/psilocin.) At 10 to 14 grams I've had experiences which are
quite incredible. The potency of different batches of mushrooms varies,
usually within a range of +/-10%, although I've come across some strains
that were nearly twice as potent as standard. Mushrooms lose potency with
age (about 25% in six months.) They will keep much longer if stored in
an airtight container in the freezer. Fresh mushrooms should be dried at
a low temperature, around 95 degrees F, to preserve their potency.
### THE HIGH

Mushrooms produce an experience similar
to LSD but with a different signature. The mushroom high tends to be dreamy
and drifty in comparison to the penetrating brilliance and lucidity of
acid. Users report feeling more relaxed on shrooms, sometimes even drowsy,
rather than the speedy, edgy feeling common with acid. The average shroom
trip lasts five to seven hours, with the most intense and visually hallucinogenic
part of the experience taking place during the first two hours.
The content of a mushroom trip is also
a bit different than acid, and as with all psychedelics, each trip is a
unique experience. Frequently users claim that shrooms put them more in
touch with the "mystery," feeling acid to be cold and linear in comparison.
With mushrooms I've often felt that I'm in the presence of an ancient teacher,
whereas with LSD, it can feel like I'm simply traversing my own mental
pathways.
Mushroom visuals can be magnificent
on large doses, especially in a pitch black environment. Many people find
the mushroom visuals to be more "organic" than acid visuals. The mushroom
visuals tend towards rounded forms, and images congruent with nature, while
acid visuals are usually more angular, with kaleidoscopic or abstract imagery.
A large dose experience with mushrooms
can feel quite similar to N,N-DMT, (dimethyltryptamine) but with
much less intensity. The visuals tend to have the same character as DMT
visuals, and I find that I easily go into trance, which is frequent with
N,N-DMT. The similarity in experiences is not unexpected since mushrooms
actually contain long-lasting tryptamines. The chemical formula of psilocin,
the active component of the mushroom, is 4-OH-DMT. See the chapter on DMT
for more information on this fascinating substance.

Prince of Flowers. His face stares towards the heavens in a state of ecstasy,
and his body is adorned with several psychoactive plants, including the
morning glory and psilocybe mushrooms.

I also find some negative qualities in
comparing the experience of mushrooms to acid. The mushroom experience
moves a bit slower than an acid high and tends to be less intense. I find
it more difficult to break through to a full-on psychedelic state with
mushrooms. And the trip can not be guided as easily as an acid trip.
I've used LSD more often than mushrooms
because it's suitable to more diverse environments, and almost always produces
the expected results. I've felt mushrooms to be more "sacred," and have
reserved them for occasions when a more significant, mystical experience
is desired.
### COMBINATIONS

HARMALA ALKALOIDS - Harmala
combines beautifully with mushrooms to produce a very mystical experience.
When harmaline was first discovered it was named telepathine because
of its reputation for producing telepathic experiences. These telepathic
experiences are supposed to be especially likely to occur when Harmala
is combined with psilocybin. I personally haven't experienced telepathy,
although I've found the combination quite enjoyable. Following is a report
of a friend's Harmala plus mushroom expenence.
"The most beautiful and refined interlocking
patterns covered the floor, walls, and ceiling of my room. These visuals
were so astounding that I would have been more than content with them,
but the experience grew even more incredible. I began to feel as though
my room was filled with the "spirits" of musicians, artists, and visionaries
whose genius had most strongly affected my life. And I felt as though I
were amongst friends. This filled me with elation twice as strong as anything
I'd felt on ecstasy, and for a while nothing seemed impossible anywhere
in the world. Things gradually deconstructed into a slowly swirling astral
whirlpool, and beyond. It was by far one of the most amazing psychedelic
experiences I've had, and was all there simply by adding the Harmala."
Psilocybin can also be combined with
LSD, DMT, or Nitrous Oxide. See the Multiple
Combinations chapter.`,

## Subjective Experience

Truffles broadly comprise the underground hardening of a mushroom's mycelium,
and are part of the fungus itself. Hardly surprisingly, therefore, magic truffles
provide the same effects as regular magic mushrooms. When the Dutch government
banned magic mushrooms in 2008, but left truffles unaffected, the latter exploded in
popularity, particularly in Amsterdam.

My first truffle experience was planned well in advance, as a group expedition,
although it didn’t unfold exactly as anticipated or intended. Having previously tested
psilocybin mushrooms, I was fully aware of the type of headspace I was about to
engage, although perhaps not its intensity or the impact of the setting.

We procured the truffles from the Kokopelli smart shop, not far from Centraal
Station. The idea was to consume the classic museum dose, and then stroll to and
through the gallery itself, about a mile away.

Given my previous experience, the vendor suggested that I go for Dolphins Delight,
which was one of the stronger of those on offer.

As we walked towards our destination, I slowly chewed and swallowed my way
through the entire 15g, which was memorable only due to its strong earthy taste. As
we entered the museum the effects had already started to be felt.

I was becoming warmer, and the familiar psychedelic headspace was fast emerging.
It soon felt strong, and the standard visuals were manifesting, to the extent of the
classic phenomenon of breathing walls. They were not yet at full throttle, but they
were far from stable.

As occasionally experienced on certain psychedelics, we were but 10 minutes into the
museum when I desperately needed to use the toilets. It was something of a
challenge to find them, and I was grateful for the assistance of my fellow travellers in
this respect.

Having relieved myself, I felt a little better, and set about enjoying the ride. Well; that
was the intention.

As expected, colour was vivid, and the art and artefacts were significantly more
engaging than normal. Yes, cool, at least until we reached the section which
displayed portraits of the well-heeled from the Dutch Golden Era (circa 17th century).

The problem here was that they were more alive than usual, and the past era setting
was occasionally dark. I found that they looked increasingly like.... pigs. Before long I
considered them to be threatening.

We quickly moved along, but by now I was a little up and down, and unsettled. I
knew that I was tripping hard, and that I was in a public place, full of strangers. I also
knew that I had consumed far more than a museum dose.

Despite a little anxiety the rest of the visit passed relatively uneventfully, with various
levels of engagement. Had I not perturbed myself I am sure it would have qualified as
being rather exciting, but regardless, it wasn’t so terrible and it did have elements of
fun.

Outside the museum we wandered around the pleasant gardens and side streets,
which surrounded the grand old building. However, I was again becoming slightly
uncomfortable. My stomach was churning somewhat, with a hint of nausea, and the
crowds were becoming increasingly difficult to handle.

Whilst I was fully aware that I was flying high, well into +++ territory, I was feeling a
little claustrophobic as the streets seemed to become busier and busier; so much so
that we had to weave in and out of people to make progress.

Given the location, the centre of a major European city, this was hardly a surprise.
The hot weather also didn’t help, nor did the sound of the hustle and bustle.

Eventually, I sounded the distress signal: I needed to get back to the hotel to lie
down.

Achieving this was easier said than done, given that it was the best part of a mile
away, and that the most tenable route was through the main shopping district.

Despite throngs of shoppers of every shape and size, kids that reminded me of aliens,
and the almost overwhelming noise they collectively produced, we managed to get
back without incident. My relief was palpable.

Lying on the bed I closed my eyes. Wow!

The CEVs were intense; as intense as I had experienced to that point. I was seeing the
quintessential picture of colourful patterned snake-like bodies intertwining and
moving. This was compelling, but given my current mindset, was slightly disturbing
at the same time.

I should state clearly that this was by no means a traumatic experience. I knew at
every stage that I was psychoactively immersed and that it would come to an end. It
was, however, difficult, as the situation wasn’t conducive to a heavy trip and I had
allowed myself to go down a more challenging route than I should have.

Something like an hour later the peak had passed, and I was good to go again. The
headspace lingered for some hours, but I had completely recovered my composure
and I basked in the afterglow.

Overall, it was a memorable experience with some lessons learned, the main one
being that 15g of strongish truffle was far too much for this sort of agenda. I feel that
10g would have been more like it, and would have had the desired outcome.

Maybe next time.

Psilocybin Mushroom
 
Basics
 
by Erowid
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
[Psilocybin Mushroom Images](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_images.shtml)
 
There are dozens of species of psilocybin or 'magic mushrooms' belonging primarily to the genuses psilocybe, panaeolus, and copelandia (unrelated to [psychoactive amanita](https://erowid.org/../amanitas/amanitas.shtml) species). The effects of their ingestion resemble a shorter acting LSD trip, producing significant physical, visual, and perceptual changes. 
 
 Nearly all of the psilocybin containing mushrooms are small brown or tan mushrooms easily mistakable for any number of non-psychoactive, inedible, or poisonous mushrooms in the wild. This makes them somewhat difficult, and potentially hazardous, to identify. The primary distinguishable feature of most psilocybin containing mushrooms is that they bruise blue when handled. 
 
[ [Main Mushroom Vault](https://erowid.org/mushrooms.shtml) ]
 
[Dose](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_dose.shtml) #
 
Recreational doses range from 0.1-5 grams of dry mushrooms depending on the species and individual strength of the specimens. Dosages for wet mushrooms will be approximately 10 times higher (1 - 50 grams). Because different species vary in size, the number of mushrooms per gram will also vary. There is a wide range of potencies between species and within a single species from batch to batch or individual fruiting body (mushroom) to another.
 
Price #
 
\$20-\$40 per 1/8 ounce. \$100 - \$250 per ounce.
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_law.shtml) #
 
Psilocybin mushrooms are illegal in the United States because they contain psilocybin and psilocin which are specifically listed as illegal (Schedule I).
 
[Chemistry](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_chemistry.shtml) #
 
The primary effects of mushrooms come from several active alkaloids they contain; the most common are psilocybin, psilocin, and baeocystin. Psilocybin is a more stable compound than psilocin, but is broken down into psilocin after ingestion.
 
Pharmacology #
 
Pharmacology Summary Needed.
 
Production #
 
Psilocybin containing mushrooms grow wild across the United States and in many countries around the world. There are also several species which are easily cultivated with a fairly simple and inexpensive setup. Most recreationally used mushrooms are cultivated rather than picked wild.
 
[History](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_timeline.php) #
 
Psilocybe mushrooms have been used for thousands of years by Native Americans in Central and South America. The first european record of their use showed up in the 16th century writings of a Spanish priest who wrote about the Aztec's use of both mushrooms and peyote. In 1957, Wasson became the first in modern times to document and publish a description of his own experience (Life Magazine). The active ingredient of the mushrooms, psilocybin, was soon isolated and by the mid 60's mushrooms were being both studied and used recreationally. In 1968 possession of psilocybin mushrooms was made illegal in the United States.
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
The Substance:
 
Mushrooms; Magic Mushrooms; Shrooms; Mushies; Boomers; Psilocybes; Cubes (P. cubensis); Liberty Caps (P. semilanceata)
 
The Experience:
 
Shrooming; Tripping.
 
[EFFECTS](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_effects.shtml) #
 
In the beginning stages of onset, Mushrooms are likely to cause a sort of undefineable feeling similar to anticipation or anxiety. There may be a feeling of energy in the body, and the sense that things are different than usual. As the effects intensify, a wide variety of perceptual changes may occur; pupil dilation, visuals, mental stimulation, new perspectives, feelings of insight, quickly changing emotions (lots of laughter), possible paranoia and confusion. More advanced users may seek spiritual awareness or a sense of universal understanding through their use of mushrooms. Closed-eye visuals are extremely common with psilocybin mushrooms. Open-eye visuals are common for some people and are more likely at higher doses.
 
Onset #
 
Depending on how much and how recently one has eaten food, Mushrooms generally takes 30-60 minutes (though sometimes as long as 2 hrs) to take effect.
 
Duration #
 
The primary effects of magic mushrooms last for 4-6 hours when taken orally. For many people there is an additional period of time (2-6 hrs) where it is difficult to go to sleep and there is definitely a noticeable difference from everyday reality, but which is not strong enough to be considered 'tripping'.
 
Visual Effects #
 
With eyes open, at low doses and as effects begin, pupils dilate making lights and colors seem brighter. After that, colors can shift, with a melting or smearing motion of the visual field. Patterns can begin to form and surfaces that are normally unremarkable can appear to have byzantine detail. The brighter the ambient lighting, the less apparent these effects are. With eyes closed, flashes of color, lights, and patterns can become very prominent. With eyes closed, complete scenes can form, with dream like visualizations, memories re-experienced in vivid detail, etc.
 
PROBLEMS #
 
Many people experience nausea and/or vomiting during mushroom experiences, epecially with higher doses. Other possible negative effects include anxiety and unwanted or frightening thoughts and visions. Mushrooms, though perhaps to a lesser degree than LSD, can precipitate strong, temporary changes in an individual's experience of life and reality. It can be a powerful psychoactive experience, especially at higher doses, which is significantly affected by experiences, set and setting. Recent experiences, especially strong ones, can have a substantial effect on a trip. Physically or psychologically unsettling events in the days before a Mushroom trip can blossom into more serious distress and trauma while tripping. It is important to be prepared for the possibility of encountering difficult or frightening mental states. The [Psychedelic Crisis FAQ](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/faqs/psychedelic_crisis_faq.shtml) addresses some of the issues involved in dealing with a difficult trip.
 
Contraindications #
 
- Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. Taking psyilocybin containing mushrooms while on an MAOI can dramatically increase the effects of the experience. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorex or Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI. Individuals currently in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval in their everyday lives should be careful about choosing to use psychedelics such as mushrooms as they can trigger even more difficulty. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because mushrooms have been known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
Mushrooms are neither physically addicting nor likely to cause psychological dependance. Many people actually find that their desire to use mushrooms goes down for a period of time after use. As with most substances, some people will use them more frequently than they are comfortable with. There is a short period of tolerance after Mushroom use. Using Mushrooms two days in a row is likely to lead to a diminished experience the second day, though spaced 5-7 or more days apart, this effect is nearly non-existent.

DESCRIPTION #
 
Psilocybin-containing mushrooms produce unique mental states, which are greatly effected by dose and an individual's sensitivity to psilocybin. For some rare people 0.25 of a gram of *Psilocybe cubensis* (a very small amount) is enough to propel them into full visionary states, with open eye visuals, unpleasant stomach cramps or gas, and other high-dose effects. For others, the same amount would be barely (if at all) noticeable, possibly causing a slight cold feeling during the first hour and other "threshold" effects. Wise users gauge their individual reactions to all entheogens by testing their reaction by ingesting only a small dose the first time. 
 
 Some of the following effects may characterize the respective levels presented. Please note that the minimum dosage indicated for medium and high doses are extremely low and those who reach these states with less than 1.0 gram of *P. cubensis* are rare. However, you may be one of them, so be careful. 
 
 Threshold Effects: (from 0.25 grams - 0.75 grams *P. cubensis* ) 
 Slight cold feeling, mild gas or nausea, feelings of nervousness, slight pupil dilation, mild visual changes including lights seeming brighter, lights having a "starry" look, and noticing movement at the periphery of vision, giddiness, feeling more emotionally sensitive, and other light effects related to a change in neurochemistry. 
 
 Medium Effects: (0.75 grams - 2.5 grams *P. cubensis* ) 
 "Cold" feeling, gas and/or stomach discomfort, nausea, pupil dilation, open eye visual effects: lights exhibit auras, star-pattern effects, rainbowing around lighting, lights seem brighter and often "more beautiful", notice movement in periphery, sometimes increased ability to focus, sometimes reduced ability to focus, visual field "distracting", visual field "entertaining", closed eye visuals: normal closed eye "blobs" take on patterns, shapes, distinct forms, increased ability to visualize creatively, spontaneous detailed images, feelings of time dilation, feelings of "coming home again" (often more pronounced for those who have used mushrooms before), feelings of belonging and connection, increased emotional sensitivity, increased ability to focus on emotional problems or memories, chance of thoughts becoming "caught in a loop" / dwelling on a single thought or feeling (usually negative or painful), realizations about past feelings, realizations about how to live, gain a new perspective on current lifestyle and behaviors, feelings of connection with others, noticing things that are normally ignored or taken for granted, feelings of wonder, spirit, joy, sadness, despair, religious awakening, contentment and possibly latent psychological crises can come out. 
 
 High Dose Effects: (2.5 grams - 10 grams *P. cubensis* ) 
 All of the Medium Effects, usually with a significantly more uncomfortable coming up, more pronounced nausea (rarely resulting in vomiting), sometimes significant mental discomfort associated with feelings of fear and oftentimes accompanying a "What have I done to myself?" or "How far am I going?" thought, the unpleasant coming up effects usually lessen with familiarity and more knowledge about the safety and character of mushroom effects. High Dose Effects are usually characterized by the closed eye visualizations being significantly more elaborate and enfolding, religious revelation, spiritual awakening, near-death experiences, loss of self, talking to seemingly external, autonomous entities, extreme emotional responses, repressed memories coming to life, latent psychological crises can come to the surface, an increase in artistic sense, and intense feelings of wonder, connection, joy, fear. High Dose Effects can also include extreme time dilation, with experiences of wall-clock minutes taking an experientially large amount of time, watching clocks or digital counters where the seconds seem to take minutes to count off. One of the most interesting effects is the feeling of awakening for the first time ever from a previous state of sleep, the feeling of liberation from what is now seen as a life-long state of misunderstanding. Paradoxically, it is this new awareness that feels normal and natural and the previous fog is seen to have been unreal all along. The bemushroomed seeker can be convinced that, once gained, this awareness is impossible to lose, but inexplicably by the next day it is just a memory.

Psilocybin, Psilocin, and Magic Mushroom Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
 
PSILOCYBE CUBENSIS
 Psilocybe cubensis is a medium strength psilocybian mushroom consisting of approximately .63% psilocybin and .60% psilocin in dried wild mushrooms. Indoor cultivated mushrooms tend to have higher concentrations. Note that potency of mushrooms can vary greatly from one batch to the next and from one part of a single mushroom to another part (cap and stem can have different concentrations). Because of these natural variations, chopping or grinding up multiple mushrooms and homogeninizing the material can help reduce the risk of unexpectedly strong (or weak) doses of psilocybin. 
 
 The following chart shows approximate oral dosages for common (dried) Psilocybe cubensis in grams. P. cubensis and other psilocybin mushrooms can vary in potency by as much as 10x.

Psilocybin Mushrooms
 
Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Psilocybin Mushrooms**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Scheduled
- SCHEDULE: ContainsSchedule I Chemical
- CLASSIFICATION: Hallucinogen
 
Psilocybin mushrooms are not specifically named in the U.S. federal scheduling system, however their two primary active chemicals Psilocybin and Psilocin are both Schedule I in the United States. This means they are illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, or distribute (sell, trade or give) without a DEA license. Fresh and dried psilocybin mushrooms are considered containers of Psilocybin and Psilocin, making them illegal to possess as well. 
 
 Because spores contain no psilocybin or psilocin, they are legal to sell and possess (in all states except California, Georgia, and Idaho). But in most states, it is illegal to cultivate or propogate spores into mycelium since mycelium generally contains both psilocybin and psilocin. 
 
 Psilocybin and psilocin, the active chemicals in these mushrooms, are being studied for medical utility around the world including in the United Kingdom, United States, Switzerland, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, and others. The medical research may eventually result in changes to the legal status of psilocybin and/or psilocin. However the bad design of the United Nations 1970 Single Convention on Psychotropic Substances and the United States' worse Controlled Substances Act will inhibit and hamstring moving psilocybin out of the class of drugs that have near-total prohibition. 
 
 Some countries have ruled that growing psilocybe mushrooms does not qualify as 'manufacturing' a controlled substance (psilocybin). In 2005, a New Mexico state appelate court ruled that growing mushrooms did not qualify as manufacturing psilocybin under state law (see [State of New Mexico v. Pratt](http://www.conwaygreene.com/nmsu/lpext.dll/nmcases/15517/1614a?fn=document-frame.htm&f=templates&2.0) , 2005 or [http://caselaw.findlaw.com/nm-court-of-appeals/1401800.html](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/nm-court-of-appeals/1401800.html) ). In Feb 2006, the FMRC's *TEO* journal reported that the Pratt ruling was overturned and that people have been prosecuted for growing psilocybin mushrooms in New Mexico.(TEO Feb 2006). However, Erowid has not been able to substantiate FMRC's claim and to the best of our understanding, the Pratt appelate ruling stands. (last updated Jun 28, 2013)
 
U.S. STATE LAW #
 
Psilocybin mushrooms are illegal in every state in the United States except Florida. A few states and localities have decriminalized possession of psilocybin-containing mushrooms. (see below). 
 An Overview of case law for several states can be [accessed here](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_law4.shtml) . 
 
 Psilocybin Mushroom spores are legal to possess in every state except California, Georgia, and Idaho. (see [details](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_law8.shtml) ). 
 
 
California (Oakland) #
 
The SF-Bay Area city of Oakland de-prioritized / decriminalized the possession of "entheogenic plants" including psilocybin mushrooms, mescaline-containing cacti, iboga, and DMT-containing plants such as those used in ayahuasca on June 4 2019 at 23:12 (11:12pm) on a "unanimous vote" (although it appeared at least one councilperson abstained. This effort was lead by [Decriminalize Nature Oakland](https://www.decriminalizenature.org/) . The Oakland resolution did not decriminalize opiate-containing plants. Congratulations to those who worked this successful campaign! The text of the resolution included: "RESOLVED, That the Mayor and City Council hereby declare that it shall be the policy of the City of Oakland that no department, agency, board, commission, officer or employee of the city, including without limitation, Oakland Police Department personnel, shall use any city funds or resources to assist in the enforcement of laws imposing criminal penalties for the use and possession of Entheogenic Plants by adults; [... and ...] RESOLVED That the Mayor and City Council hereby declare that it shall be the policy of the City of Oakland that the investigation and arrest of adult persons for planting, cultivating, purchasing, transporting, distributing, engaging in practices with, and/or possessing Entheogenic Plants or plant compounds on the Federal Schedule 1 list shall be amongst the lowest law enforcement priority for the City of Oakland; [...]" (last updated June 4 2019)
 
California (Santa Cruz) #
 
The SF-Bay Area city of Santa Cruz City resolved "to not expend City resources in the investigation and arrest of persons twenty-one (21) years of age and older solely for the personal use, personal possession, and personal cultivation of Entheogenic Plants and Fungi listed on the Federal Schedule 1 list and that such activities should be considered among the lowest law enforcement priorities..." on Jan 28 2020. [ [Santa Cruz City Council Minutes, Jan 28 2020](http://scsire.cityofsantacruz.com/sirepub/mtgviewer.aspx?meetid=1356&doctype=SUMMARY) ]
 
Colorado (Denver) #
 
Denver Colorado passed an ordinance ( [Ordinance 301](https://ballotpedia.org/Denver,_Colorado,_Initiated_Ordinance_301,_Psilocybin_Mushroom_Initiative_(May_2019)) ) for the city that prohibits local authorities from enforcing criminal penalties for possesion of psilocybin-containing mushrooms. It is the first we know of this type of decriminalization for psilocybin mushrooms. The ordinance was passed on May 8, 2019. See [https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-magic-mushroom-denver-decriminalization-20190508-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-magic-mushroom-denver-decriminalization-20190508-story.html) .
 
Florida #
 
Florida stands out because of a decision in 1978 in [Fiske v Florida](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_law3.shtml) by the Florida Supreme Court which ruled that wild-picked psilocybin mushrooms could not be legally considered "containers" of psilocybin and thus would have to be specifically listed in Florida law by the legislature if they meant to make them illegal. Since the Florida legislature has not chosen to change the laws since then, the possession of wild Psilocybin mushrooms is presumptively not punishable under state law. This does not mean police won't arrest people for possession of even wild mushrooms, but this has been used as a successful defense against such charges.
 
New Mexico #
 
New Mexico appeals court ruled on June 14, 2005, that growing psilocybin mushrooms for personal consumption could not be considered "manufacturing a controlled substance" under state law. See [Opinion: State of New Mexico vs. David Ray Pratt](http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=nm&vol=05ca-099&invol=2) - June 14 2005
 
Oregon #
 
Oregon's citizens passed two ballot measures in 2020: Oregon 109 and Oregon 110. Oregon Measure 109 creates a legal framework to allow for licensed production, distribution, and therapeutic application of psilocybin. Oregon Measure 110 decriminalizes small amounts of all Schedule I and II substances under a new "Class E violation" (a civil violation, not a true crime), with a maximum of penalty of \$100. OR Measure 110 also reduces criminal penalties for larger quantity possession of controlled substances from felony-level to a Class A misdeamenor (not a civil violation, a criminal act). See [Ballotpedia: Oregon Measure 110 (2020)](https://ballotpedia.org/Oregon_Measure_110,_Drug_Decriminalization_and_Addiction_Treatment_Initiative_(2020)) and [Ballotpedia: Oregon Measure 109 (2020)](https://ballotpedia.org/Oregon_Measure_109,_Psilocybin_Mushroom_Services_Program_Initiative_(2020)) . Note that it is not legal to sell psilocybin mushrooms in Oregon (it is still a felony). On December 8, 2022, a store in Portland that had been openly selling psilocybin mushrooms was raided and shut down by local police. See [Portland Police Raid Shroom House Overnight](https://www.wweek.com/news/courts/2022/12/08/portland-police-raid-shroom-house-overnight/) . (thanks bcs) (last updated Dec 8 2022)
 
INTERNATIONAL LAW #
 
Psilocybin mushrooms are not specifically listed by the [United Nations International treaties](http://www.undcp.org/un_treaties_and_resolutions.html) and the laws regarding them vary quite a bit around the world. States which are party to the UN Drug Control Program are free to decide for themselves whether to control them. 
 
 See European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction [Legal Status of Hallucinogenic Mushrooms](http://eldd.emcdda.europa.eu/html.cfm/index17341EN.html) in the EU. 
 See A. Schouten's overview of the [international legal status of Psilocybin Mushrooms](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_law11.shtml) .
 
Australia #
 
Psilocine and psilocybine are illegal to possess or sell under the Criminal Code Act of 1995 (CCA). We have received a report that harvested psilocybin-containing mushrooms are considered illegal "preperations" throughout Australia, and growing psilocybin mushrooms consitutes "manufacturing illegal drugs" and carries even higher penalties. (thanks Torsten) The mushrooms themselves are subject to specific controls in some states or territories. 
 
 "Any plant of the genus Psilocybe" is restricted under the "Border controlled plant" provisions of the CCA (see section 314.5 of the [Criminal Code](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/australia/australia_law1.pdf) ). This makes Psilocbye mushrooms illegal to import and export, and illegal to possess if they have been imported. We have received an unconfirmed report that it is possible to import or export of psilocybin mushroom spore prints for purposes of microscopy, though this technically may be a violation of the CCA (thanks A Moffett). (updated Apr 2008)
 
Belgium #
 
Psilocybin/psilocin and the mushrooms themselves are reportedly controlled in Belgium. (thanks D) (last updated Feb 24 2011)
 
Brazil #
 
Although psilocybin and psilocin are controlled substance in Brazil, mushrooms are not listed, and we have some indication that they may not be considered illegal. We received a report from a Brazilian public lawyer that psilocybin-containing mushrooms cannot be considered vessels of psilocybin and psilocin under Brazilian law, and are therefore not illegal. The Brazilian constitution does not allow punishment for any act that is not specifically forbidden. In addition, there is a legal precedent for the religious use of ayahuasca tea in Brazil. The sacramental use of psilocybin mushrooms is considered to fall under the same protection. (thanks Roldan, P, FB)
 
Canada #
 
Both Psilocybin and Psilocin are schedule III in Canada. (Note: Canadian schedules are very different than U.S. schedules). See [Psychoactive-Related Laws for Canada](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/law_canada.shtml)
 
Denmark #
 
The Danish Ministry of Health declared that is would make psilocybin mushrooms illegal to possess, buy, and sell as of July 1, 2001. [http://www.stiften.dk/artikel:aid=23734](http://www.stiften.dk/artikel:aid=23734) ( [English Translation](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_law7.shtml) )
 
Finland #
 
Psilocybin mushrooms are illegal to cultivate, possess, or sell in Finland. (thanks VG)
 
France #
 
Psilocybin mushrooms are illegal to cultivate, possess, or sell in France. Legal status of spores is unknown. (thanks ms) (last updated June 17, 2010)
 
Germany #
 
Psilocybin-containing mushrooms are treated as a controlled substance in Germany. Illegal to possess, sell, grow, or distribute. See [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/btmg_1981/anlage_i_59.html](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/btmg_1981/anlage_i_59.html) . There had been some confusion for years when some retailers sold fresh mushrooms in Germany between the late 1990s and late 2000s, but the German authorities have now shut down and prosecuted sellers openly offering psilocybin containing mushrooms. (thanks dp) (last updated Jun 20 2013)
 
Hong Kong #
 
Psilocybin is a controlled substance and the Hong Kong Narcotics Bureau considers psilocybin-containing mushrooms to be controlled under Schedule I, Part I, of the Dangerous Drug Ordinance. [Magic Mushroom, a dangerous drug](http://www.info.gov.hk/police/offbeat/731/eng/bottom.htm) , July 2002.
 
India #
 
Psilocybin-containing mushrooms are illegal in India, but in some parts of the country they are ignored by authorities, places like Old Manali, Karela (Idiki), and Kodaikanal. (unconfirmed) (thanks C)
 
Indonesia #
 
Although Indonesia's drug laws are extremely harsh, the psilocybin-containing local mushrooms on Bali seem to be ignored by law enforcement. (unconfirmed) (thanks l) (last updated Aug 22, 2012)
 
Ireland #
 
Following Britain's 2005 ban of psilocybin-containing mushrooms, Ireland banned the sale and use of psilocybin mushrooms in January 2006. See [RTE.ie : 'sale and use of magic mushrooms banned'](http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/0131/mushrooms.html) (last updated Jan 31, 2006).
 
Japan #
 
According to Japanese news, psilocybin mushrooms have been outlawed specifically in Japan as of June 2002. Several visitors have written in to erowid to confirm this and have said that there have been a few busts reported. Before June 2002, psilocybin mushrooms were readily available in large cities in Japan from street vendors and specialty shops.
 
Netherlands #
 
Effective Dec 1 2008, a large number of psilocybin-containing mushrooms in several genera (Psilocybe, Panaeolus, Gymnopilus, etc.) are illegal to buy, sell or possess in the Netherlands, dried or fresh. (see [Telegraph article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/3441105/Magic-mushrooms-banned-in-Netherlands.html) , for a complete list of banned mushrooms see [Dutch schedules](http://wetten.overheid.nl/cgi-bin/deeplink/law1/title=Opiumwet) ). Psilocybin and psilocin are seperately controlled. See also [PDF of bill](http://www.minvws.nl/includes/dl/openbestand.asp?File=/images/vgp-2844534-532-bij-brief-ek-en-tk-b-_tcm19-165976.pdf) . Dried mushrooms are now considered "hard drugs" and possession of more than 0.5 grams can be prosecuted; fresh mushrooms are now considered "soft drugs" and possesion of more than 5 grams can be prosecuted : see [http://juridischdagblad.nl/content/view/7606/53/](http://juridischdagblad.nl/content/view/7606/53/) . The Dutch department of public health, grow-kits, sclerotia, and spores are not illegal, and the minister has no plans to legislate against such products in the near future: see [minvws.nl](http://www.minvws.nl/kamerstukken/vgp/2009/antwoorden-op-kamervragen-van-joldersma-over-hallucinerende-truffels-en-kweeksets.asp) . (Last updated May 6, 2009)
 
Norway #
 
Mushrooms that are dried, planted or otherwise "tampered with" and contain Psilocybin are considered Schedule I, and are illegal to buy or possess without a license. Pure Psilocybin is also Schedule I. [See Norway Law](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/countries.shtml#norway) . (thanks Y)
 
Poland #
 
Psilocybin is schedule I (I-P group) in Poland. (unconfirmed)
 
Switzerland #
 
Psilocybin-containing mushrooms are controlled. In 2006, the "Sacred Mushroom Church of Switzerland" was raided and shut down and its operator, David Schlesinger, was arrested. See [http://cannabisculture.com/articles/4788.html](http://cannabisculture.com/articles/4788.html) .

Psilocybe cubensis, or "Psilocybine" or "Psilocine"-containing plants "including all parts e.g. flower, stem, spore." are illegal to possess or sell in Thailand, as of October 1988. [See UNDCP's Excerpt of law.](http://www.undcp.org/odccp/legal_library/th/legal_library_1990-07-05_1989-36.html)
 
United Kingdom (U.K.) #
 
Psilocybin and psilocin are both illegal to possess and sell in Britain. As of July 18, 2005, fresh psilocybin mushrooms are now also controlled. See [U.K. Mushroom Law Timeline 2002+](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_law14.shtml) . The law does not appear to cover spores, because the wording added to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Class A drugs) is: "Fungus (of any kind) which contains psilocin or an ester of psilocin." And no further wording is present in that section of the law regarding seeds or spores. However, the Home Office has published a FAQ that implies spores might be controlled: "Will it be illegal to supply grow kits? The law covers production so it applies to the sale and importation of kits." [Frequently Asked Questions about Magic Mushrooms](http://drugs.homeoffice.gov.uk/drugs-laws/drug-act-2005/faq/) . 
 
 
- 2005, Jul 18: Mushroom ban in U.K. began on July, 18, 2005 when the Home Office clarified that the accidental picking of psilocybin mushrooms or having them grow inadvertently on property would not be subject to the law. Fresh mushrooms are now considered a Class A drug under this new law.
- 2005, Apr 7: The British government has passed a new Drugs Bill expanding police powers and explicitly making fresh mushrooms illegal. [Drugs Bill Receives Royal Assent](http://www.drugs.gov.uk/News/1113312987) , Drugs.gov.uk, [Text of Drugs Bill](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldbills/032/2005032.htm) .
- 2005, Feb 19: U.K. government recently went ahead with prosecuting new cases against vendors of fresh mushrooms despite the previous court ruling that prosecution under the current law would be an "abuse of process" because the laws are too vague. [The Guardian : Magic mushroom dealers face new test cases](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1418029,00.html) , Feb 19, 2005
- See [British Mushroom Law Timeline 2002-2005](https://erowid.org/mushrooms_law14.shtml)
 Dried magic mushrooms have a Class A drug status, which means that the prison sentence for possession and distribution could be similar to that of other Class A drugs such as L.S.D, Heroin, Cocaine & Crack, but even dried shrooms are not considered a police priority. It is uncommon for someone to be seriously prosecuted for simple possession, and 'accidentally dried' mushrooms have generally been overlooked.

## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: 2.5 mg Psilocybin
- Light: 2.5 - 10 mg Psilocybin
- Common: 10 - 25 mg Psilocybin
- Strong: 25 - 50 mg Psilocybin

**Exercise caution when consuming wild psilocybin mushrooms.**
 
If consuming mushrooms harvested in nature, it is important to understand the risk of mistakenly consuming a poisonous (potentially fatal) look-alike variety.
 
Please see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms#Natural_occurrence) for more information.
**Psilocybin mushrooms** (also known as **magic mushrooms** , **psychedelic mushrooms** , and **shrooms** ) are a family of [psychoactive](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychoactive) fungi that contain psilocybin, a [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. The mechanism of action is not fully known, although [binding activity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) at [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) is thought to be involved.

Psilocybin mushrooms occur on all continents and have been taxonomically classified into over 200 species, the most potent of which belong to the genus *Psilocybe* . Based on imagery found in prehistoric rock art, they are thought to have been used by various human cultures since before recorded history.

After being introduced to the Western world in the 1950s, they generated substantial public interest. Along with LSD, they were incorporated into the youth counterculture movement of the 1960s. Widespread usage of psychedelics provoked a societal backlash, and they were prohibited in 1970. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Today, they are among the most widely used psychedelic substances (partly due to the ease of personal cultivation and harvesting). As a part of the so-called "psychedelic renaissance", they are currently being investigated in the treatment of a number of ailments including [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression) , addiction, and other mental disorders.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [visual geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_geometry) , [hallucinatory states](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinatory_states) , [time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion) , [enhanced introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) , [conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking) , [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , and [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) . The intensity and duration of effects can vary greatly depending on factors such as species and batch, which can complicate standardized dosing information (see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms#Dosage_and_preparation) ). They are often described to evoke [entheogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogen) , mystical-like, or [transpersonal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transpersonal) experiences that may facilitate self-reflection and personal growth.

In distinction to psychedelics like [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , and [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , which may be described as "stimulating", "cerebral", and "bright", psilocybin mushrooms are typically described as having an "earthy", "subliminal", or "dream-like" quality. They also are reported to produce slightly more [emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement) , time distortion and ego loss than the aforementioned substances, as well as more [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , and [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) .

Unlike most highly prohibited substances, psilocybin mushrooms have low abuse potential and are neither addictive nor physiologically toxic. However, adverse psychological reactions such as severe [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) are always possible, particularly among individuals predisposed to mental disorders.

It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## History and culture

A growing body of evidence suggests that psychoactive mushrooms have been used by humans in religious ceremonies for thousands of years. In Mesoamerica, they have been consumed in ritual ceremonies for 3000 years.

For example, murals dated 9000 to 7000 BCE found in the Sahara desert in southeast Algeria depict horned beings dressed as dancers holding mushroom-like objects. 6,000-year-old pictographs discovered near the Spanish town of Villar del Humo illustrate several mushrooms that have been tentatively identified as *Psilocybe hispanica* , a hallucinogenic species native to the area.

Archaeological artifacts from Mexico have also been interpreted by some scholars as evidence for ritual and ceremonial usage of psychoactive mushrooms in the Mayan and Aztec cultures of Mesoamerica. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] In Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, the mushrooms were called teonanácatl, or "God's flesh".

Following the arrival of Spanish explorers to the New World in the 16th century, chroniclers reported the use of mushrooms by the natives for ceremonial and religious purposes. Accounts describe mushrooms being eaten in festivities for the accession of emperors and the celebration of successful business trips by merchants.

After the defeat of the Aztecs, the Spanish forbade traditional religious practices and rituals that they considered "pagan idolatry", including ceremonial mushroom use. For the next four centuries, the Indians of Mesoamerica hid their use of entheogens from the Spanish authorities. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

American banker and amateur ethnomycologist R. Gordon Wasson studied the ritual use of psychoactive mushrooms by the native population of a Mazatec village in Mexico. In 1957, Wasson described the psychedelic visions that he experienced during these rituals in "Seeking the Magic Mushroom", an article published in *Life* magazine. Later that year, they were accompanied on a follow-up expedition by French mycologist Roger Heim, who identified several of the mushrooms as Psilocybe species.

Heim cultivated the mushrooms in France, and sent samples for analysis to [Albert Hofmann](/w/index.php?title=Albert_Hofmann&action=edit&redlink=1) , a chemist employed by the Swiss pharmaceutical company Sandoz (now Novartis). Hofmann, who had in 1938 created LSD, led a research group that isolated and identified the psychoactive compounds from *Psilocybe mexicana* .

He and his colleagues later synthesized a number of compounds chemically related to the naturally occurring psilocybin, to see how structural changes would affect psychoactivity. These included [4-HO-DET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DET) and [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) . Sandoz marketed and sold pure psilocybin under the name "Indocybin" to clinicians worldwide without any reports of serious complications.

In the early 1960s, Harvard University became a testing ground for psilocybin via the efforts of Timothy Leary and his associates, Ralph Metzner and Richard Alpert, under a project known as the [Harvard Psilocybin Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Psilocybin_Project) . Leary obtained synthesized psilocybin from Hofmann through Sandoz. Some studies, such as the Concord Prison Experiment, found promising results for psilocybin's utility in clinical psychiatry.

Leary and Alpert's zealous advocacy for widespread hallucinogen use led to a well-publicized termination from Harvard. In response to concerns about the increase in unauthorized use of psychedelic substances by the general public, psychedelics like psilocybin began to receive negative press and faced increasingly restrictive laws.

In the United States, laws were passed in 1966 that prohibited the production, trade, or ingestion of hallucinogenic substances. Sandoz stopped producing LSD and psilocybin the same year. Further backlash against LSD usage swept psilocybin along with it into the Schedule I category of illicit substances in 1970. Subsequent restrictions on the use of these substances in human research made funding for such projects difficult to obtain, and scientists who worked with psychedelic drugs faced being "professionally marginalized".

In 1976 the book *Psilocybin Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide* was released, written by Terence McKenna.

In 1978 Paul Stamets released *Psilocybe Mushrooms & Their Allies* .

In the 1990s, psychedelic research gradually began to regain traction, particularly in Europe. Advances in the neurosciences and the availability of brain imaging techniques have provided a reason for using substances like psilocybin to probe the "neural underpinnings of psychotic symptom formation including ego disorders and hallucinations".

Recent studies in the United States have attracted attention from the popular press and thrust psilocybin into the vogue again.

### Common names

Psilocybin mushrooms have a number of common names. These include: **psychedelic mushrooms** , **magic mushrooms** , **shrooms** , **magic truffles** , and **boomers** .

The combination with [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) is known as **hippie-flipping** .

### Research

#### Neurogenesis

A low dose (0.1 mg/kg) of psilocybin produced a trend toward increased neurogenesis in the mouse hippocampus 2 weeks after its administration, while a high dose (1 mg/kg) significantly decreased neurogenesis. These results suggest that the effects of psilocybin on neurogenesis are dose- and time-related.

#### Psychoplastogen

Psilocybin is a psychoplastogen, which refers to a compound capable of promoting rapid and sustained neuroplasticity.

## Chemistry

Psilocybin, or 4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine ( **4-PO-DMT** ) is a prodrug that is converted into the pharmacologically active compound [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) in the body by a dephosphorylation reaction mediated by alkaline phosphatase enzymes. Both psilocybin and psilocin are organic tryptamine compounds. They are chemically related to the amino acid tryptophan, and structurally similar to the [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) .

Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicyclic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. Psilocybin is substituted at R 4 of its indole heterocycle with a phosphoryloxy (-PO) functional group. It also contains two methyl groups CH 3 - bound to the terminal amine R N . This makes psilocybin the 4-phosphoryloxy ring-substituted analog of [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) .

Psilocybin and psilocin occur in their pure forms as white crystalline powders. Both are unstable in light, particularly while in solution, although their stability at low temperatures in the dark under an inert atmosphere is very good.

## Pharmacology

Psilocybin acts as a [prodrug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Prodrug) to psilocin, meaning it is inactive until it is converted into psilocin in the body. Upon entering the body, psilocybin is dephosphorylated to psilocin in the intestinal mucosa by alkaline phosphatase and nonspecific esterase.

Psilocin's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its agonist activity on serotonin 5-HT 2A/C and 5-HT 1A receptors. While 5-HT 2A receptor agonism is considered necessary for hallucinogenic activity, the role of other receptor subtypes is much less understood.

Unlike [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , psilocin has no significant effect on [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) receptors and only affects the [noradrenergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) system at very high dosages.

Psilocybin has also been shown by fMRI imaging to have a dampening effect on certain brain regions, most notably the Default Mode Network. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Subjective effects

The headspace of psilocybin mushrooms is typically described as extremely relaxing, profound, and stoning in style compared to more stimulating [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) . They are also regarded as being less clear-headed than other commonly used [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) such as [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) , [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) and [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) . This may be due to the presence of other alkaloids like norbaeocystin.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Neurogenesis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurogenesis)**
- **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - Psilocybin mushrooms are reported to be relaxing, stoning and mildly sedating. This sense of sedation is often accompanied by [excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning) .
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of psilocybin can be described as a pleasurable, soft and all-encompassing tingling sensation or glow that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit at the peak. Once the peak of the experience or sensation is reached it can feel incredibly euphoric and tranquil or heavy and immobilizing depending on the dose and setting.
- **[Perception of bodily heaviness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_heaviness)** - This effect corresponds to the general sense of sedation and relaxation that characterizes psilocybin experiences, this manifests as a bodily heaviness that discourages movement but is typically only prominent during the first half of the experience. This particular physical effect seems to be more commonly experienced and pronounced with certain “woodlover” species of mushrooms such as [Psilocybe azurescens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybe_azurescens) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - This effect is less prominent than with that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) but is still present and unique in its character. It is repeatedly described as feeling very primitive in its nature often times with the small hairs on the user's arms or legs feeling slightly [itchy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Itchiness) or even ticklish against the skin.
- **[Changes in felt bodily form](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_bodily_form)** - This effect is often accompanied by a sense of warmth or [unity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness#Unity_between_the_self_and_specific_external_systems) and usually occurs around the peak of the experience or directly after. Users can feel as if they are physically part of or conjoined with other objects. This is usually reported as feeling comfortable in its sensations and even peaceful.
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)** - This effect can be considered as less intense when compared with LSD. Like most psychedelics, this effect is likely a result of reductions in inflammation as well as from distortions in sensory processing. This effect, while common, is not guaranteed. An increase in pain perception is also possible.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - This effect can be greatly lessened or even completely avoided if the individual has an empty stomach prior to ingestion. It is often recommended that one either refrain from eating for approximately 6 to 8 hours beforehand, or eat a light meal 3 to 4 hours before if they are feeling physically fatigued.
- **[Changes in felt gravity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_gravity)**
- **[Excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning)** - This effect seems to be uniquely pronounced among psilocybin and related tryptamines. It can occur to a lesser degree on [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and very rarely on psychedelic [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) like [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) . It typically occurs in combination with [watery eyes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Watery_eyes) .
- **[Watery eyes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Watery_eyes)**
- **[Frequent urination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frequent_urination)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Olfactory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Olfactory_hallucination)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Runny nose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Runny_nose)**
- **[Increased salivation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_salivation)**
- **[Brain zaps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brain_zaps)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - Although this effect is very rare, it can still occur for those susceptible to it. This component is however much less common and intense than it is with [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [releasing agents](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - This is a rare effect but can happen in a small population of those who are predisposed to them, particularly while in physically taxing conditions such as being dehydrated, undernourished, overheated, or fatigued. ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)** - Relative to other psychedelics, this effect may appear to be more saturated.
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)** - This effect typically occurs prominently at lower doses and becomes increasingly suppressed as one raises the dose. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, realistic, slow and smooth in motion and static in appearance.
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Colour tinting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_tinting)**
- **[Visual haze](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_haze)**

- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
 
#### Geometry
 The visual geometry produced by psilocybin mushrooms can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocetin) , [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) and [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) than [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) . 
It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, organic in feel, structured in organization, brightly lit, and multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, soft in its edges, large in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, rounded in its corners, non-immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity.
 
It has a very "organic" feel and at higher dosages is significantly more likely to result in states of [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) visual geometry over [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
Psilocybin and its various other forms produce a full range of high-level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) . These effects generally include:
 
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)**
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - This effect is very consistent in dark environments at appropriately high dosages. They can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical, or transcendental nature in their overall theme.
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - These are more common within dark environments and can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, geometry-based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)** - This effect can be described as being more prominent, consistent and profound when compared to other traditional psychedelics such as [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) or [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . This can lead to strong feelings of compassion, urgency and even completely sporadic moments of intense emotional significance that can also be periodically affected by [enhancement and suppression cycles](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Enhancement_and_suppression_cycles) .
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This effect differs from [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and other [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) in that it isn't as central to the experience, feels less forced and more natural and is experienced at a less consistent rate. The sociability enhancement in particular only occurs rarely and it appears to be more [emotional](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement) .
- **[Euthymia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euthymia)** - This effect manifests itself acutely for all classical psychedelics when one to three doses are combined with a psychotherapy treatment program. When comparing meta-analyses, psychedelic psychotherapy greatly outperforms "gold standard" treatments for several mental health problems.
- **[Language suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression)** - This effect can be described as a perceived inability or general unwillingness to talk aloud despite feeling perfectly capable of formulating coherent thoughts within one's internal narrative. It is much more common among inexperienced users.
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is consistent in its manifestation and [outrospection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Outrospection) dominant.
- **[Enhancement and suppression cycles](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Enhancement_and_suppression_cycles)** - This can be described as constant waves of extremely stimulated and profound thinking which are spontaneously surpassed in a cyclic fashion by waves of general thought suppression and mental intoxication. These two states seem to switch between each other in a consistent loop once every 20 to 60 minutes.
- **[Feelings of impending doom](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Feelings_of_impending_doom)** - This effect is usually only experienced during the [come up](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Duration#Come_up) phase but typically completely passes or subsides once the primary effects begin. It should be noted that this effect is relatively consistent and normal for psilocybin and related [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) which is why a [positive and well-informed mindset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) is key. Less regularly, this aspect can also occur during the peak but will most often be met afterward with sensations of [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria) , [catharsis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Catharsis) or [rejuvenation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Rejuvenation) .
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Autonomous voice communication](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_voice_communication)**
- **[Suggestibility enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Suggestibility_enhancement)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops)**
- **[Thought organization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_organization)**
- **[Confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion)** - This effect occurs at a higher rate than other psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . It is more commonly observed in users who are inexperienced with psilocybin, or psychedelics in general
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**

- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Mindfulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)**
- **[Simultaneous emotions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Simultaneous_emotions)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Ego replacement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_replacement)** - Although this effect is rare and more likely to occur with certain psychedelics like [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) or [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) , it can still spontaneously occur, usually with higher doses.
- **[Personality regression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personality_regression)** - Although this effect is rare it can still manifest spontaneously and is thought to depend primarily on the user's [set and setting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) .
- **[Catharsis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Catharsis)**
- **[Rejuvenation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Rejuvenation)** - While this component can occur spontaneously at any point, it typically follows a difficult phase of the experience, if not the entire experience itself. It is however almost always felt during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Duration#Offset) of a psilocybin experience and tends to slowly transition into the after effects which are generally described as positive. These positive or [mindful](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness) after effects are sometimes referred to as an "afterglow" and is both common and consistent for psilocybin and related [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) .
- **[Addiction suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Addiction_suppression)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states.
- **[Dosage independent intensity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage_independent_intensity)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] ### Transpersonal effects
 
- Anecdotally, these components are generally considered to be most consistent with the [naturally-occurring](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Naturally_occurring_sources) [entheogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogen) [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) such as [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) , [ibogaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ibogaine) and psilocybin. They are listed below as follows: 
- **[Spirituality enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spirituality_enhancement)**
- **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
### Combination effects

- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis majorly amplifies the sensory and cognitive effects of psilocybin mushrooms. This should be used with extreme caution, especially if one is not experienced with psychedelics. This interaction can also amplify the [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion) producing aspects of cannabis significantly. Those who choose to use this combination are advised to start off with only a fraction of their usual cannabis dose, and slow down the pace of their normal intake considerably.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Dissociatives can enhance the geometry, euphoria, dissociation and hallucinatory effects of psilocybin mushrooms. Dissociative-induced [holes, spaces, and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids) while under the influence of psilocybin can result in significantly more vivid visuals than dissociatives alone, along with more intense [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and increased risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - MDMA enhances the visual, physical and cognitive effects of psilocybin. The synergy between these substances is unpredictable, and it is advised to start with lower dosages than one would take for either substance individually. The toxicity of this combination is unknown, although there is some evidence that suggests this may increase the neurotoxic effects of MDMA.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - This combination is not typically recommended due to alcohol’s potential to cause [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) , [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , and [physical fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue) at higher doses. However, this combination is reasonably safe in low doses and, when used responsibly, can "take the edge off a trip" and reduce anxiety in a manner somewhat similar to benzodiazepines. With [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin#Psilocybin-containing_mushrooms) in particular it is often recommended that the user waits until the ["come down"](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Duration#Offset) phase to consume alcohol due to the sometimes nauseating effects of mushrooms, especially within the first 2 - 3 hours of the experience.
- **[Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines)** - Depending on the dosage, benzodiazepines can slightly to completely reduce the intensity of the cognitive, physical and visual effects of a psilocybin trip. They can be very efficient at largely stopping or mitigating a [bad trip](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trip) at the cost of amnesia and reduced trip intensity. Caution is advised when acquiring them for this purpose, however, due to the high abuse potential they possess.
- **[Psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics)** - When used in combination with other psychedelics, the physical, cognitive and visual effects of each substance intensify and synergize strongly with each other. The synergy between those substances is unpredictable, and for this reason, is generally not advised. If choosing to combine psychedelics, it is recommended to start with lower dosages than one would take for either substance individually.

## Dosage and preparation

The dosage of psilocybin mushrooms depends on the potency of the mushroom (the total psilocybin and psilocin content of the mushrooms), which varies significantly both between species and within the same species. However, "the most commonly used mushroom is Psilocybe cubensis, which contains 10–12 mg of psilocybin per gram of dried mushrooms".

The concentration of active psilocybin mushroom compounds varies not only from species to species, but also from mushroom to mushroom inside a given species, subspecies or variety. The same holds true even for different parts of the same mushroom.

For example, in the species *Psilocybe samuiensis* , the dried cap of the mushroom contains the most psilocybin at about 0.23%–0.90%. The mycelium contains about 0.24%–0.32%.

### Psilocybin

#### Dosage calculation

Math: Desired psilocybin from divided by the psilocybin strength of the strain. For example, if you want to consume 15 mg psilocybin (a common dose) from cubensis with 1% psilocybin content:
15 mg / 1% = 15/0.01 = 1500 mg = 1.5 g
#### Psilocybe cubensis

Psilocybe cubensis (also known as *cubes* ) is one of the most commonly used species of psilocybin mushrooms. The doses for oral consumption for dried cubensis mushrooms are generally considered to be:

- **Threshold:** *0.25 - 0.5 g*
- **Light:** *0.5 - 1 g*
- **Common:** *1 - 2.5 g*
- **Strong:** *2.5 - 5 g*
- **Heavy:** *5 g +*

## Natural occurrence

Biological genera containing psilocybin mushrooms include *Copelandia* , *Galerina* , *Gymnopilus* , *Inocybe* , *Mycena* , *Panaeolus* , *Pholiotina* , *Pluteus* , and *Psilocybe* . Over 100 species are classified in the genus *Psilocybe* .

Some common [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) and [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) containing mushroom species include:

### Risk of species confusion

As psilocybin mushrooms are capable of being harvested in nature, **there is a major risk in misidentifying the mushroom species and accidentally consuming a poisonous (possibly lethal) variety.** This risk can be avoided by educating oneself in advance on how to properly identify the correct species of mushroom and the potential look-alike mushrooms found within one's local area. Users are encouraged to learn from a mentor who is experienced in mushroom picking before doing it on their own.

## Research

### Antidepressant effects

While further research is needed to establish the utility of psilocybin and other psychedelics in treating depression, a pilot study has observed significantly decreased depression scores in terminal cancer patients six months after treatment with psilocybin.

An open-label study was carried out in 2016 in the UK to investigate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of psilocybin in treating patients with unipolar treatment-resistant depression with promising results; although the study was small and involved only twelve patients, seven of those patients met formal criteria for remission one week following psilocybin treatment and five of those were still in remission from their depression at three months.

The mechanism behind this is not known as of yet, but researchers have suggested that psilocin's deactivation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) may be relevant to its antidepressant effects, as the mPFC is known to be elevated in depression and normalized after effective treatment. mPFC hyperactivity has been associated with trait rumination.

Another possible factor to psilocybin's potential against depression may be that depressed patients with high levels of dysfunctional attitudes were found to have low levels of 5-HT( 2A ) agonism.

## Toxicity and harm potential

Numerous studies have found that psilocybin mushrooms are physiologically well-tolerated and has an extremely low toxicity relative to dose. There is no evidence for long-lasting effects on the brain or other organs and there are no documented deaths attributed to the direct effects of psilocybin mushrooms toxicity.

However, it is worth noting that while they may not be capable of causing direct bodily toxicity or death, their use can still present serious hazards.

For example, they are capable of strongly impairing the user's judgment and attention span, which may promote erratic or dangerous behaviors. In extreme cases, the user may experience powerful [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) e.g. that they are actually inside of a dream and therefore physically invincible, or that they are being "chased by demons". This may prompt them to jump off of a building or run into oncoming traffic.

Additionally, intense negative experiences and psychotic episodes (i.e. ["bad trips"](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trips) ) can cause lasting psychological trauma if not properly managed or treated afterward. This is particularly a concern in non- [supervised settings](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Trip_sitter) or when heavy doses are used.

Finally, it should be noted that evidence of psilocybin mushrooms' effectiveness as a mental health treatment only applies to the controlled procedures used in clinical settings. They are not considered the entire treatment because the current evidence suggests they must be combined with professional psychotherapy to produce lasting effects.

Without the appropriate safeguards, attempts at self-medicating with psilocybin mushrooms may actually worsen mental health issues. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

**It is strongly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) if using this substance. These include:**

- Taking the substance under the supervision of a [tripsitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tripsitter) for one's first time or while experimenting with a higher dose
- Starting off with a dose in the low-common range and monitoring for unusual reactions (e.g. [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) ) or sensitivity
- Not exceeding the listed [heavy dose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy_dose) . If heavy doses are required, a tolerance break is advised instead. Heavy doses greatly increase the risk of negative effects
- Keeping a supply of [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) (e.g. *[Seroquel](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seroquel)* ) to abort the trip in the case of overwhelming anxiety or psychosis

### Lethal dosage

The toxicity of psilocybin and psilocin is extremely low. In rats, the median lethal dose ( [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) ) of psilocybin when administered orally is 280 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg).

Psilocybin comprises approximately 1% of the weight of *Psilocybe cubensis* and so nearly 1.7 kilograms (3.7 lb) of dried mushrooms or 17 kilograms (37 lb) of fresh mushrooms would be required for a 60 kilogram (130 lb) person to reach the 280 mg/kg LD50 value of rats.

Based on the results of animal studies, the lethal dose of psilocybin has been extrapolated to be 6 grams, 1000 times greater than the effective dose of 6 milligrams. Unlike many highly prohibited substances, it is effectively impossible to physically overdose on.

### Psychosis and mental disorder risk

Psilocybin mushrooms can exacerbate symptoms (e.g. [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) , [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) ) of various mental disorders. Additionally, **they can precipitate the early onset of schizophrenia in vulnerable individuals.**

Those with a personal or family history of mental disorders, particularly psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, should not use psilocybin mushrooms without consulting a qualified medical professional.

### Dependence and abuse potential

Like other [serotonergic psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelics) , psilocybin mushrooms have low abuse and no physical dependence potential.

There are no literature reports of successful attempts to train animals to self-administer a serotonergic psychedelic, which is predictive of abuse liability, indicating that it does not have the necessary pharmacology to either initiate or maintain dependence.

Additionally, there is no human clinical evidence that psilocybin mushrooms causes addiction. Finally, there is virtually no withdrawal syndrome when chronic use of psilocybin mushrooms is stopped.

Tolerance to the effects of psilocybin builds almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption).

Psilocybin exhibits cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of psilocybin all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Hallucinogen-perception persisting disorder (HPPD)

In rare cases, psilocybin mushrooms may trigger [hallucinogen persisting perception disorder](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogen_persisting_perception_disorder) (HPPD) in some individuals. The cause is unclear; however, explanations in terms of psilocybin physically remaining in the body for months or years after consumption have been discounted by experimental evidence.

Some say HPPD is a manifestation of post-traumatic stress disorder, not related to the direct action on brain chemistry, and varies according to the susceptibility of the individual to the disorder.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Amphetamines** - Stimulants increase anxiety levels and the risk of thought loops which can lead to negative experiences
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** : Cannabis can have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with psilocybin mushrooms. While it is commonly used to intensify or prolong the mushrooms' effects, caution is highly advised as mixing these substances can significantly increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Anecdotal reports often describe the ingestion of cannabis as the triggering event for a [bad trip](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trip) or [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction (e.g. 1/4th - 1/3rd) of their typical cannabis dose and space out hits to avoid accidental over-intake.
- **Cocaine** - Stimulants increase anxiety levels and the risk of thought loops which can lead to negative experiences
- **Tramadol** - Tramadol is well known to lower seizure threshold and psychedelics also cause occasional seizures.
- **Lithium** - Lithium is commonly prescribed in the treatment of bipolar disorder; however, studies find it can significantly increase the risk of and seizures when combined to psychedelics. As a result, this combination should be strictly avoided.

## Legal status

Internationally, psilocybin (but not psilocybin mushrooms) is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.

*"The cultivation of plants from which psychotropic substances are obtained is not controlled by the Vienna Convention. . . . Neither the crown (fruit, mescal button) of the [Peyote](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peyote) cactus nor the roots of the plant [Mimosa hostilis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mimosa_hostilis) nor Psilocybe mushrooms themselves are included in Schedule 1, but only their respective principals, [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine) , and [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) ."*

## Effects
Low doses have a stimulating and strengthening effect. Medium doses have a mild hallucinogenic effect and stimulate the imagination. High doses have a strong hallucinogenic effect, very psychedelic; the environment is often perceived as dreamlike; visionary immersion in strange worlds, deep insights into oneself and a feeling of strong connection with nature.

## Dosage
Average dosages of dried* mushrooms:
Pointed cone bald: light 0.5-0.8 g, medium to strong 1.0-max. 2 g
Hawaiian: light 0.3-0.5 g, medium to strong 0.5-max. 1 g
Mexican: light 0.5-1.5 g, medium to strong 1.5-max. 5 g
*for fresh mushrooms approx. ten times this amount.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
The pupils dilate, pulse and blood pressure change, increase in body temperature (sweating), breathing difficulties and palpitations may occur. Occasionally, nausea may occur. Balance disorders, an altered sense of space-time, confusion and anxiety are also possible; panic attacks may occur in the case of stimulus overload.
The use of psilocybin can trigger latent (hidden) mental disorders.
When picking mushrooms in nature, there is a risk of confusion due to deadly doppelgangers!

## Safer Use
- Consume mushrooms only in good mental and physical condition (set).
- Do not consume mushrooms alone, but with someone you trust.
- Pay attention to the setting. A stress-free environment is important, preferably in nature. Mushrooms are not party drugs!
- Consume mushrooms only after a light meal; it is best to eat very little for 6 to 8 hours to avoid nausea and other unpleasant side effects. Chew mushrooms well!
- Use dried mushrooms if possible; wash raw mushrooms well before eating.
- In delicate moments during the trip: let yourself go, try not to fight the effect of the mushrooms.
- Avoid mixed consumption, never consume mushrooms together with alcohol or medication!
- Avoid roads and other "dangerous" places, your orientation may be disturbed.
- In case of panic attacks or horror trips: see General Information under Emergency.
- After the trip, allow yourself plenty of rest and recovery, at least the day after, to be able to process the experience.

*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/psilocin-psilocybin/*

Psilocin is a naturally occurring psychedelic that has been used for hundreds of years. It is found alongside psilocybin in a number of fungal species, particularly of the Psilocybe genus. Psilocybin is a prodrug for psilocin.

It has a very low physical harm potential, though psychological concerns do exist. Acute issues like psychosis and panic attacks have been recorded. Lasting psychological problems are rare.

  "tripsit-wiki": `# Mushrooms

*Source: https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Mushrooms*

Terms used to refer to mushrooms include: shrooms, mushies, magic mushrooms and psilocybin mushrooms.

There are dozens of species of psilocybin or 'magic mushrooms' belonging primarily to the genuses psilocybe, panaeolus, and copelandia (unrelated to psychoactive amanitaspecies). The effects of their ingestion resemble a shorter acting LSD trip, producing significant physical, visual, and perceptual changes. There are more than 180 species of mushrooms which contain the psychedelic chemicals psilocybin or psilocin. They have a long history of use in Mexico and are currently one of the most popular and commonly available natural psychedelics. Nearly all of the psilocybin containing mushrooms are small brown or tan mushrooms easily mistakable for any number of non-psychoactive, inedible, or poisonous mushrooms in the wild. This makes them somewhat difficult, and potentially hazardous, to identify. The primary distinguishable feature of most psilocybin containing mushrooms is that they bruise blue when handled.

## History

Ethnohistorical sources indicate that teonanacatl, the "divine mushroom" or "flesh of the gods" (Psilocybe mexicana and other species of the genus Psilocybe), was being ritually consumed and used in religious ceremonies in Mexico before the arrival of the Spanish. During the colonial period, the indigenous use of the mushroom was forbidden and brutally suppressed by the Spanish Inquisition. In spite of this, the mushroom cult has survived underground even into the present day. The psychoactive use of Psilocybe mexicana in Indian shamanism was rediscovered at the end of the 1930s. In the late 1950s, it was found that the Mixe Indians of Coadan, Oaxaca, also used Psilocybe mexicana for shamanic purposes. Psilocybe mexicana was the first mushroom in which Albert Hofmann discovered the LSD-like substances psilocybin and psilocin.

## Usage

### Ritual use

The literature from the colonial period contains numerous texts that provide information concerning the mushrooms, their effects, and their ritual and/or medicinal uses. 

The Florentine Codex, an early colonial chronicle by the Franciscan missionary Fra Bernardino de Sahagun, written in Aztec, reports: Nanacatl. They are called teonanacatl, "flesh of the gods." They grow in the flatlands, in grass. The head is small and round, the stem long and thin. It is bitter and scratches, it burns in the throat. It makes one foolish; it confuses one, it distresses one. It is a remedy for fever, for gout. Only two, three are eaten. It makes sad, depressed, distressed; it makes one run away, become afraid, hide. He who eats many of them sees many things that scare him and that make him happy. He runs away, hangs himself, throws himself from a cliff, screams, is afraid. It is eaten with honey. I eat mushrooms; I take mushrooms. It is said of one who is haughty, impertinent, vain that: "He has bemushroomed himself". Another Aztec text by Sahagun provides a rudimentary description of the mushroom ritual: The first thing that one ate at such meetings was a black mushroom that they called nanacatl. It has inebriating effects, produces visions, and incites to obscene acts. They already take the thing early on the morning of the festival day and drink cacao before they arise. They eat the mushrooms with honey. When they have made themselves drunk with these, they begin to become excited. Some sing, others cry, others sit in their rooms as if they were deep in sorrow. They have visions in which they see themselves die, and this hurts them bitterly. Others see scenes in which they are attacked by wild animals and believe that they are being eaten up. Some have beautiful dreams in which they believe they are very rich and possess many slaves. But others have quite embarrassing dreams: they have the feeling of being caught while committing adultery or of being wicked forgers or thieves who are now facing their punishment. They all have their visions. When the inebriation that the mushrooms produce is over, they speak of that which they have dreamed, and one tells the other about his visions.

In his Historia de las Indias de Nueva Espane, the missionary Diego Duran noted several times that mushrooms were ingested at festivals and were "drunk like wine", although they were mixed with chocolate. Today, Psilocybe mexicana is still used by shamans of the Mazatec, Mixe, Zapotec, and Cuitlatec in a manner that is quite similar to its pre-Spanish use. Among the Mixe, the most important deity is the Earth Mother Naaxwin or Na:shwin (literally, "the eye of the earth"). The earth is regarded as the source of wisdom; the Earth Mother is omniscient and can see the past, present, and future. Since the mushrooms grow from the earth, they are regarded as extremely wise and full of knowledge. The Mixe originally believed that the mushrooms were born from the bones of primordial shamans and prophets. According to a different version of that belief, which was influenced by Christianity, the mushrooms are regarded as soothsayers because they are equated with the blood of Christ. It is said that as Jesus hung on the cross, blood flowed from his heart to the ground. Numerous flowers and edible mushrooms grew from this blood. Finally, the magic mushrooms emerged and supplanted the plants that had previously turned green. For this reason they are called na:shwin mux, "mushrooms of Mother Earth". Accordingly, the messages of the mushrooms are known as the "voice of the Earth". 

Magic mushrooms are used primarily in ritual contexts by the mostly female shamans. They are eaten for divinatory purposes. They are used to recognize the causes of diseases, to predict the death and loss of family members, to locailize lost objects, to uncover thieves and magicians, and to search for answers to familial problems. The mushrooms can also help in finding hidden treasures, discovering ruins, and experiencing ritual knowledge. The mushrooms normally speak Mixe, although they occasionally speak Zapotec as well. Among the Mixe, the old preSpanish tonalamatl divination calendar is still in use. Some shamans use the mushrooms in conjunction with the calendar divination. 

Magic mushrooms can be harvested only in summer. It is said that they grow only on sacred ground. When a person encounters a mushroom, he should offer it three candles, kneel before it, and speak the following prayer: Tum'Uh. Thou who art the queen of all there is and who was placed here as the healer of all sicknesses. I say to you that I will carry you from this place to heal the sickness I have in my house, for you were named as a great being of the earth. Forgive this molestation, for I am carrying you to the place where the sick person is, so that you make clear what the suffering is that has come to pass. I respect you. You are the master of all and you reveal all to the sick. The collected mushrooms are carefully placed on the house altar or stored in the village church for three days. Incense is offered to them. They are consumed either fresh or sundried. For three days before ingesting the mushrooms, a person must remain abstinent from sex and refrain from eating poultry, pork, eggs, and vegetables. It also is forbidden to drink alcohol or to use other drugs or medicines. During this time, a person should also refrain from agricultural activities. On the morning of the fourth day, he or she takes a bath and eats a light breakfast (of only foods made from maize; cf. Zea mays). He or she fasts for the rest of the day. On the morning after the session, the person must eat a large quantity of chili peppers; he or she should abstain from meat and alcohol for the following month. The mushrooms are always eaten in pairs and also dosed in pairs: three pair for children, seven pair for women, nine pair for men. Sometimes only the caps are eaten. In each session, a person should eat mushrooms of just a single species, because mixing the species can result in unpleasant, i.e., threatening, visions. Two eggs are laid next to the mushrooms before they are eaten. At the same time, "copal" (incense; the resin of the palm Acrocomia mexicana Karw., from which palm wine is also obtained) is burned and a candle is lit. A prayer is offered to the mushrooms before they are eaten: Thou who art blessed. I am now going to swallow you so that you heal me of the illness I have. Please give me the knowledge I need, thou, who knows all of what I need and of what I have, of my problem. I ask of you the favor that you only tell me and divine what I need to know but do nothing bad to me. I do not wish an evil heart and wickedness. I only wish to know of my problems and illness and other things that you can do for me. But I ask you, please do not frighten me, do not show me evil things but only tell all. This is for the person with a pure heart. You can do many things, and I ask you to do them for me. I now ask your forgiveness for being in my stomach this night. After the mushrooms are swallowed whole with water, one should be quiet. 

It is said that the mushrooms, like all other magical plants, do not like noise and will not speak if they feel disturbed. Normally the person who has eaten the mushrooms is accompanied by one or two friends or family members. They should pay attention to the things that the "bemushroomed" person says and fumigate him or her with copal smoke if problems arise. The visions that appear are shaped by culture. First one sees snakes and jaguars. After these have disappeared, the sun and the moon appear as a boy and girl, the children of the wind and the Earth Mother. Often, the "bemushroomed" person only hears voices that give advice, provide diagnoses, or ask about the reasons for ingesting the mushrooms. In these visions, most people obtain profound insights into their state of health and learn how they may become healthy and complete.

## Dosage

This is the dose range for dry Psilocybe Cubensis. Fresh mushrooms are 9/10ths water by weight, and require 10 times the dose.
For other types of psilocybes, see [Erowid](http://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms_info4.shtml).

| Light | 1-2g |
| --- | --- |
| Common | 2-4g |
| Strong | 4g+ |

| Light | 3-7.5g |
| --- | --- |
| Common | 7.5-12.5g |
| Strong | 12.5-15g |
| Heavy | 15g+ |

### Lemon Tek

This will greatly increase intensity, but lower the duration. The comedown is abrupt, yet gentle. Do not expect enough time for introspection.

Preparation of materials:
With dried p. cubensis fruit bodies, it is advisable to grind or macerate the material into a fine powder or small particle size. The more surface area of the fruiting body distributed in a body of liquid will result in greater effect and availability of  alkaloids. 

Grind the mushrooms to a fine powder, then add them to an acidic solution (e.g. 1 tbps lemon juice, 8oz water), and drink on an empty stomach.

## Duration

| Onset | 15-60 minutes |
| --- | --- |
| Peak | 2-4 hours |
| Total | 4-8 hours |

## Harm Reduction

Mushrooms are known as being relatively safe psychedelics, with no documented causes of death from the consumption of psilocybin mushrooms. However, when picking mushrooms it is important to be sure about the species, as many wild mushrooms are poisonous and can cause death - with some poisonous strains looking similar to common psychedelic strains.

It is generally a good idea to avoid psychedelic drugs including mushrooms if you or any of your first or second-degree relatives (uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, grandparents) have a current or past history of psychotic disorders like Bipolar or schizophrenia.

Refer to [Psychedelic Harm Reduction](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Psychedelics#Harm_Reduction) for general information.

## Legal status

Psilocybin and psilocin are listed as Schedule I drugs under the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Schedule I drugs are deemed to have a high potential for abuse and are not recognized for medical use. However, psilocybin mushrooms are not covered by UN drug treaties.

Psilocybin mushrooms are regulated or prohibited in many countries, often carrying severe legal penalties (for example, the US Psychotropic Substances Act, the UK Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and Drugs Act 2005, and in Canada the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act).

## Summary
Magic truffles are the sclerotia of psilocybin mushrooms that are not technically the same as "mushrooms". They are masses of mycelium that contain the fruiting body which contains the hallucinogenic chemicals psilocybin and psilocin.
In October 2007, the prohibition of psychedelic or "magic mushrooms" was announced by the Dutch authorities. The ban on mushrooms did not outlaw the hallucinogenic species in sclerotium form, due to authorities believing it to be weaker than the mushrooms. Psilocybin truffles which once made little sales became the only legal option to produce. Today, smart shops in the Netherlands offer magic truffles as a legal alternative to the outlawed mushrooms.

## Addiction and tolerance
Physical addiction to magic truffles has never been documented. As the psychoactive constituent of magic truffles is psilocybin, the prodrug to psilocin, addiction is not possible by conventional definitions. Additionally, there is strong evidence to suggest there is little to no potential for psychological dependence on psilocybin.
Tolerance to magic truffles specifically is not well researched. However, tolerance to psilocybin is a well understood concept, with repeatedly higher doses being needed in order to achieve the same effect, due to the down regulation of 5HT2A receptors. There is also documented cross-tolerance between psilocybin and LSD, meaning that a higher dose of these substances is needed to get the same effect when a person consumes them with high frequency. Through temporary abstinence the tolerance returns to baseline.

## Species
There are five different types of truffles:

Psilocybe atlantis
Psilocybe galindoi
Psilocybe mexicana (Jalisco/Mexicana A)
Psilocybe pajaritos
Psilocybe tampanensis
