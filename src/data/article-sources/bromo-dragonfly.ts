Bromo-Dragonfly Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
 
Bromo-Dragonfly is a chemical which has very little history of human use and was used as a novel brain research chemical with rats in the mid 1990s at Purdue. When it was discovered to be active in rats, it was found to be very potent. A few years after the initial papers describing its activity in the brain, reports surfaced of human experimentation, suggesting oral activity well under 1 milligram. Some disputed these findings and said that Bromo-Dragonfly was only active under 1 mg when injected. 
 
 In May 2005, a quantity of this chemical became available in some human experimental psychoactive markets. Erowid received a smattering of reports about its use and an increasing number of questions about it. As of Jan 2009, we have still only received approximately 50 first-hand accounts of ingestion of Bromo-Dragonfly. The findings are very contradictory, with some people claiming strong oral activity at 300 micrograms (ug), while others say they got virtually no effects at 1.5 mg (1500 ug). 
 
 There may be two distinct "batches" of material: one more potent and one less. Since 2006, most reports indicate that the dosage range for available material is 800-2000 ug rather than the more potent batch of product sold as BromoDragonfly in 2005. In 2005, the more potent batch was sometimes called the "European" batch and the less potent batch the "American" batch, although this distinction is not in common use. It seems likely that these two batches were not even the same chemical, but it is impossible to know. Bromo-Dragonfly has been found in some pressed tablets, but more commonly it is found on blotter or in powder form. 
 
 There have been a growing number of reports from people saying that they got blotter that they thought was LSD, but instead it felt like something else. Generally, since there is no verification of the substance, these reports are not considered when trying to estimate dosage and effects of novel chemicals. 
 
 Please note that with only a small number of reports available, it is unwise to assume that these reports are representative of how a chemical presumed to be Bromo-Dragonfly will affect other individuals. Please see the [Research Chemical Vault](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/research_chems/research_chems.shtml) for more information about chemicals for research that are sold for human consumption.

Denmark #
 
Effective December 5, 2007, the Danish Sundhedsstyrelsen (Health Board) has banned non-research use of Bromo-Dragonfly, citing serious psychological and health risks. Minister of Health and Prohibition Jakob Axel Nielsen commented "The ban agrees with the government's commitment to react quickly and sharply against new eurphoric drugs. It is vital that we send a clear and unambiguous message that we neither can nor want to accept substances such as Bromo-Dragonfly." (see [Pressemeddelelse](http://www.im.dk/im/site.aspx?p=23&t=ForsideVisartikel&Articleid=4478) ). (translation thanks to S, PFC)

**Bromo-DragonFLY is linked to an unusually large number of hospitalizations and deaths.**
 
Due to its extremely high potency and unstudied effects, it is strongly discouraged to take this substance without using the strongest [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) such as [volumetric dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_dosing) , limiting intake to [oral ingestion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration#Oral) , and using a [trip sitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Trip_sitter) . Please see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bromo-DragonFLY#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) for more details.
**Bromo-DragonFLY** (also known as **DOB-DragonFLY** or simply **B-DFLY** or **Dragonfly** ) is a novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamines) and [benzodifuran](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodifuran) classes. It produces an array of extremely dose-sensitive [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . It was first synthesized in 1998 by Matthew Parker from [DOB-FLY](/w/index.php?title=DOB-FLY&action=edit&redlink=1) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Bromo-DragonFLY is extremely potent and produces unusually long effects which reportedly can last up to several days. It is considered to have one-third the potency of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) by weight, making it remarkably potent relative to the vast majority of psychedelics. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Due to its high potency and unpredictable dose-response, many reports indicate that the effects of this substance may end up being overly difficult to use safely for those who are not already experienced with [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) . Specifically, given that the dosage and duration of this substance have yet not been fully determined, users are advised to start at the lowest possible, intake only through the oral [routes of administration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) , and never re-dose during any time throughout the experience.

Very little is known about the pharmacology, metabolism and toxicity about Bromo-DragonFLY in humans. It briefly gained popularity among [research chemicals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemicals) circa 2010 until several deaths occurred after the substance was accidentally mislabeled and sold as [2C-B-FLY](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B-FLY) , leading to its prohibition.

Bromo-DragonFLY has never been documented as being sold on the street and has seemingly stopped production on [research chemicals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemicals) gray market. Due to its novelty and extremely short history of human usage, all information related to the use of this compound should be received with extreme caution. It is strongly recommended that one use the utmost [harm reduction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction) practices if choosing to take this substance.

## Chemistry

Bromo-DragonFLY is a substituted [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) , [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamines) and [benzofuran](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzofuran) , featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain and contains a bromine atom attached to carbon R 4 . Bromo-DragonFLY is an atypical psychedelic phenethylamine which is closely analogous to [DOB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOB) ; it is the difuran analog to DOB, where it incorporates the methoxy groups bound to R 2 and R 5 of DOB into five member furan rings fused to the central benzene ring.

Bromo-DragonFLY belongs to a group of phenethylamine derivatives referred to as the DragonFLY compounds, named for their insect-like appearance of two “wing-like” furan rings fused on the opposite sides of the central benzene ring.

It is worth noting that the R-isomer of the molecule is considerably more active than the other and as such doses must be adjusted accordingly.

## Pharmacology

The [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) effect of bromo-DragonFLY is mediated by its [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) activity at the 5-HT 2A serotonin receptor. Bromo-DragonFLY also has a high binding affinity for the 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C serotonin receptors, and is most accurately described as a non-subtype selective 5-HT 2 agonist, as it is actually twice as potent an agonist for 5-HT2C receptors as for 5-HT2A, as well as being less than 5x selective for 5-HT2A over 5-HT2B.

It is further suggested that Bromo-DragonFLY almost completely inhibits [MAO-A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) activity, which makes itself unable to metabolize. This is probably the cause for an abnormal duration of action.

However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

Compared to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , this compound presents a significantly less pronounced body high, reduced visual effects and more in-depth [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) which are comparable to [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) . Despite the visual and physical effects, it reportedly tends to maintain a level of sober thought structure. As the user usually retains acute cognitive sobriety, Bromo-DragonFLY can be considered to have diminished effects of [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and potential [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) when compared to [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) , [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , or [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) .

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- The physical effects of Bromo-DragonFLY are comparable to that of traditional [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) such as [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) and [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

Bromo-DragonFLY can be considered extremely toxic at very high dosages with several deaths and numerous hospitalizations reported on overdoses. It can also have extreme [vasoconstrictive](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) effects, which can result in severe tissue damage or even limb amputation. Due to its high potency, one can easily overdose if this substance is not measured correctly ("eyeballed") or mislabeled as another substance.

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational Bromo-DragonFLY do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because Bromo-DragonFLY is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) , such as [volumetric dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_dosing) , when using this substance to ensure the accurate administration of the intended dose.

### Notable deaths

On May 7, 2011, in the United States, two young adults died and several others were hospitalized after overdosing on Bromo-DragonFLY, which they believed was [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) .

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Bromo-DragonFLY is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of Bromo-DragonFLY is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 6 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 14 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Bromo-DragonFLY presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of Bromo-DragonFLY all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of Bromo-DragonFLY. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

### Overdose

The risk of Bromo-DragonFLY overdose is unknown at the time, suggesting that there may not be a safe dosage. Non-oral routes also seem to exhibit a higher chance of overdosing, perhaps owing to differences in bioavailability, potency and unpredictability of dosage and effects. Overdose effects of typically include bizarre, [delusional](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion) and sometimes violent behavior, [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [numbness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) . The user may not be able to communicate and can be severely agitated. At appropriately high doses, more severe side effects include [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attack) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , dangerously prolonged [elevated heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) , [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) and [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Vasoconstriction typically develops to its peak several hours into the intoxication and will need medical assistance since Bromo-DragonFLY is known to do this for an extremely long time.

The abnormally long duration of Bromo-DragonFLY poses a significant risk by staying inside the body for weeks. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

In the event of an overdose, [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) can be administered to mitigate the hyper-agitative effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] A potent vasodilator will need to be continuously administered to prevent a hypertensive emergency, necrosis, organ failure and death from the resulting hypoxia. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] As a result, emergency medical services should always be sought in the event of an overdose.

Bromo-DragonFLY, also known as 3C-Bromo-Dragonfly or DOB-Dragonfly, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine, DOx, and FLY families. It is taken orally. The drug has a delayed onset of up to 6 hours and a very long duration of up to 1 to 3 days.
Side effects of Bromo-DragonFLY include nausea and vomiting, headache, tachycardia, hypertension, anxiety, panic attacks, pupil dilation, convulsions and vasoconstriction, among others. The drug acts as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, including the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. It is also a potent monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibitor.
Bromo-DragonFLY was first described in the scientific literature by David E. Nichols and colleagues in 1998. It was encountered as a novel designer drug in 2006. The drug has been associated with an unusually high degree of toxicity and numerous hospitalizations and fatalities. It has become a controlled substance in various countries in the world.

## Use and effects

Bromo-DragonFLY was not included nor mentioned in Alexander Shulgin's 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved) as it had not yet been discovered. However, he subsequently described it in his 2011 book The Shulgin Index, Volume One: Psychedelic Phenethylamines and Related Compounds. The dose range of Bromo-DragonFLY is not precisely known, but typical doses are in the range of 100 to 1,000 μg orally. However, a death has been reported at approximately 700 μg Bromo-DragonFLY. Its onset can be delayed by up to 6 hours and its duration is in the range of 12 to 24 hours for many users, but can be up to 2 to 3 days. The drug's effects include profound hallucinations and visual distortions, sound alterations, a sense of connection or belonging with other realities, a sense of peace and well-being, emotional stimulation, and meeting with entities.

## Side effects

The side effects of Bromo-DragonFLY have been described.

## Overdose and toxicity

The toxicity of Bromo-DragonFLY appears to be fairly high for humans, with reports of at least five deaths believed to have resulted from Bromo-DragonFLY in Norway, Sweden,
Denmark,
Finland
and the United States.
Laboratory testing has confirmed that in October 2009, a batch of Bromo-DragonFLY was distributed, mislabeled as the related compound 2C-B-FLY, which is around 20 times less potent than BDF by weight. This mistake is believed to have contributed to several lethal overdoses and additional hospitalizations. The batch implicated in these deaths also contained significant synthesis impurities, which may have contributed to the toxicity.
Vasoconstrictive action resulting from severe overdose of Bromo-DragonFLY is known to have caused tissue necrosis of the extremities in at least one case. In September 2007, a 35-year-old Swedish male required amputation of the front part of his feet and several fingers on one hand after taking a massive (but unknown) overdose; reportedly, the compound acted as a long-acting efficacious vasoconstrictor, leading to necrosis and gangrene which became apparent several weeks after the overdose occurred. Treatment was of limited efficacy in this case, although tolazoline is reportedly an effective treatment where available.
Overdose-associated disturbing experiences and health problems have been described. One case in 2008 in England involved inhalation of vomit, causing nearly fatal asphyxia. Seizures have also been reported.
On October 3, 2009, a 22-year-old male from Copenhagen died after ingesting Bromo-DragonFLY. His friend described the trip saying, "It was like being dragged to hell and back again. Many times. It is the most evil [thing] I've ever tried. It lasted an eternity."
On May 7, 2011, in the United States, two young adults died after overdosing on Bromo-DragonFLY, which they thought was 2C-E, and several others were hospitalized during the same incident. Because they took a dosage appropriate for 2C-E, those who took the drug received, in some cases, 100 times the normal dose. Both deaths followed seizures, vomiting blood, and terrifying hallucinations.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Bromo-DragonFLY has very high affinity at the serotonin 5-HT2A (Ki = 0.04 nM) and 5-HT2C receptors (Ki = 0.02 nM), along with moderate affinity for the 5-HT2B receptor (Ki = 0.19 nM). It is a potent full agonist of these three receptors. Bromo-DragonFLY is also a potency monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibitor, which may contribute to its risks. The comprehensive receptor interactions of Bromo-DragonFLY have been reported.

## Chemistry

### Synthesis

The first chemical synthesis of racemic Bromo-DragonFLY was reported by David E. Nichols in 1998 and was an expansion upon earlier research into the tetrahydrobenzodifuran analogue of DOB. The 1998 synthesis of racemic Bromo-DragonFLY starts from hydroquinone, which is dialkylated with 1-bromo-2-chloroethane, brominated, and treated with n-butyllithium to yield the tetrahydrobenzodifuran ring system. After formylation of the ring system, the nitropropene derivative was obtained by condensation with nitroethane under ammonium acetate catalysis. The nitropropene derivative was then reduced with lithium aluminium hydride to yield the amine intermediate, which was protected with trifluoroacetic anhydride. Following para-bromination with elemental bromine and oxidation of the tetrahydrobenzodifuran ring system with DDQ, the trifluoroacetyl protecting group of the amine was removed to give Bromo-DragonFLY as a racemic mixture of the R and S enantiomers.
In 2001, David E. Nichols reported an enantiospecific synthesis of Bromo-DragonFLY which allowed the individual R and S enantiomers to be studied. Further research determined that (R)-(-)-Bromo-DragonFLY possessed greater binding affinity at the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors than (S)-(-)-Bromo-DragonFLY. To synthesize the more active R enantiomer, a derivative of D-alanine was reacted with 2,3,6,7-tetrahydrobenzodifuran in a Friedel–Crafts acylation, yielding an intermediate containing a β-keto moiety which was removed by treatment with triethylsilane in trifluoroacetic acid. After para-bromination and oxidation of the ring system with DDQ, the amine was deprotected yielding (R)-(-)-Bromo-DragonFLY.

## History

Bromo-DragonFLY was first synthesized by David E. Nichols and colleagues in 1998. As with the earlier and less potent dihydrofuran series of compounds nicknamed FLY, Bromo-DragonFLY was named after its superficial structural resemblance to a dragonfly.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

Internationally Bromo DragonFLY is an Unscheduled drug because is not into the Convention on Psychotropic substances of 1971 however still could be controlled for the analogue laws in some countries or for the sale of toxic substances for human consumption.

#### Australia

As of 9 September 2011, Bromo-DragonFLY was added to Schedule 2 of the Queensland Drugs Misuse Regulation 1987.
Nationally, the drug is listed under Schedule 9 (Prohibited) of the Poisons Standard. Accordingly, the drug is prohibited in all states and territories.

#### Canada

As of Oct 12, 2016, Bromo-DragonFLY is listed in Schedule III of the Canadian Controlled Drugs and Substances Act: "2C-phenethylamines and their salts, derivatives, isomers and salts of derivatives and isomers", a broad definition which corresponds to anything with a 2,5-dimethoxy­phen­ethyl­amine core, including (but not limited to) the 2C family (including e.g. βk-2C-B), the DOx chemical class, the TMA family, Aleph aka DOT, NBOMe, the 25x-NBx series, and of course, Bromo-DragonFLY itself (see this article).

#### Denmark

On December 3, 2007, the drug was banned in Denmark. The substance has been declared illegal by health minister Jakob Axel Nielsen, following recommendations from the Danish Health Ministry. It is currently classified as a dangerous narcotic and therefore its possession, manufacture, importation, supply or usage is strictly prohibited. Anyone involved in such activities can face legal action.

#### Finland

As of 12 March 2012, Bromo-DragonFLY is an illegal designer drug.

#### Norway

Bromo-DragonFLY is currently on the Norwegian narcotics list.

#### Poland

Currently, Bromo-DragonFLY is an uncontrolled substance in Poland.

#### Romania

The chemical compound has been added as an illegal substance under the Law 143/2000 on February 10, 2010.

#### Sweden

Sveriges riksdag added Bromo-Dragonfly to schedule IV ("substances, plant materials and fungi that hasn't any or without nothing medical use") as narcotics in Sweden as of Jan 3, 2008, published by Medical Products Agency in their regulation LVFS 2007:14 listed as Bromo-Dragonfly, brombensodifuranyl-isopropylamin. Bromo-DragonFLY was first classified as "health hazard" by Sveriges riksdags health ministry Statens folkhälsoinstitut under the act Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor (translated Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) as of Jul 15, 2007, in their regulation SFS 2007:600 listed as brombensodifuranylisopropylamin (Bromo-Dragonfly), making it illegal to sell, purchase, buy, retail or possess.

#### United Kingdom

Bromo-DragonFLY is widely reported by the media as being a Class A drug. However, as of 2014, it remains unclear to what extent it is covered by the UK phenylethylamine catch-all clause, with commentators noting both the structural similarities and differences to the phenylethylamine class. If the prosecution could demonstrate structural similarity in court, it would be considered a Class A substance but as a benzodifuran it is significantly different to this class. It is not explicitly named in the misuse of drugs act. It would be covered by the UK Psychoactive Substances Act 2016 but only if it is sold or traded for human consumption.

#### United States

Bromo-DragonFLY is unscheduled at federal level in the United States, but could possibly be prosecuted under the Federal Analogue Act if it is sold for human consumption due to its similarities with 2C-B and DOB. Bromo-DragonFLY is listed as a Schedule I substance in Oklahoma.
