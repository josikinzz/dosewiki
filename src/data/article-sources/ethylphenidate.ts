## Quick Reference
- **Common Nomenclature:** Ethylphenidate
- **Street & Reference Names:** EP
- **Anticipated: Onset / Duration:** 1 Hour / 6 Hours
- **Maximum Dose Experienced:** 40mg
- **Form:** Pill
- **RoA:** Oral
- **Source / Jurisdiction:** Head Shop / UK

## Subjective Experience

Ethylphenidate emerged on the markets circa 2010/2011, and became increasingly
popular over subsequent years. It was banned in the UK via a collective TCDO in
April 2015, along with a number of other phenidates.

In 2012, I had been given a complementary pack of four EPH pills in a Manchester
head shop, on the back of the purchase of several other items. However, the
commentary of the shop assistant on handing them over set an unfortunate tone:
"These are pretty good but they shrink your dick".

For months I sat on them with that comment swirling in the back of my mind. Did I
really want my dick shrinking?

Of course, he was referring to the frequently cited phenomena of stim dick: the
incapacity to obtain and sustain an erection under the influence of certain
compounds in this class. But with far less experience of the research chemical scene's
lingo at the time, it wasn't an introduction that compelled me to rush home and
immediately sample the goodies.

When I eventually did so, I found a sharp jittery unremarkable stimulant.

It was certainly functional, but at this dose (approx 40mg) it lacked even a hint of
euphoria or empathogenic edge. Nor did I find much in the way of mood lift. From
this perspective I found it to be unrewarding and quite boring.

There were better recreational stimulants around at the time, and much better
functional stimulants were soon to emerge, so this wasn't a chemical that I was ever
going to test on more than a couple of occasions.

However, there is a but.

The but is that EPH was an ingredient of a number of the blends commonly sold both
in head shops and online. This was the case with one of the iterations of GoGaine,
which also included MPA, lidocaine, and mannitol.

I refer to this particular product because I once had a bad experience with it, which
included my unfortunate introduction to the Shadow People. See the entry for MPA
for further details of this horror story.

EPH, for me, was a stimulant that never really merited the attention it received. It
certainly worked in terms of energy and stimulation, but recreationally it offered
little else, and always felt somewhat rough around the edges.

I should add that this experience and opinion does run contrary to that of many
other users and researchers. My assumption is that they dosed far more heavily than
I did, or that they used an EPH containing blend.

ADDITIONAL SAFETY NOTE
This chemical is caustic, and due to the potential for harm to the nasal septum,
TripSit recommends that it is not insufflated.

EPH was stocked by head shops in most major cities

Dose
 
by Erowid
 
DOSAGE DESCRIPTION #
 
Caution : Dose information should not be taken as recommendations. [ see below ]
 
**Ethylphenidate Dosages**
**Insufflated**
**( tentative )**
- Threshold: 2 - 5 mg
- Light: 5 - 20 mg
- Common: 20 - 50 mg
- Strong: 40 - 100 mg
- Heavy: 100+ mg
 
**Ethylphenidate Dosages**
**Oral**
**( tentative )**
- Threshold: 10 - 15 mg
- Light: 15 - 30 mg
- Common: 25 - 75 mg
- Strong: 75 - 150 mg
- Heavy: 150+ mg
 
**Ethylphenidate Dosages**
**Rectal**
**( tentative )**
- Threshold: 2 - 5 mg
- Light: 5 - 15 mg
- Common: 15 - 30 mg
- Strong: 30 - 60 mg
 
Ethylphenidate (EPH) is a stimulant, with similar effects to methylphenidate (Ritalin). At lower doses it has productivity-enhancing and attention-improving effects. At higher doses its euphoric effects increase. It can be taken nasally, orally, or rectally. 
 
 Dosages depend on the effects desired by the user. When taken for increased productivity, doses range from 5-75 mg (oral or insufflated). Dosages for euphoric recreational experiences are perhaps twice as high. For example, 40 mg ethylphenidate taken orally might be considered "strong" for someone using it in a professional work environment, while the same person might find 40 mg to be "light" if taken recreationally at a party and 80 mg or more required for a "strong" dose.
 
NOTES #
 
As of late 2016, ethylphenidate quality/purity appears to vary widely, complicating accurate dosage information. There are large variations reported between doses and corresponding effects. In online forums, people have commented extensively on what they perceive to be quality variations from batch to batch. Variations in experiences of purity or dosage can sometimes be attributed to physical tolerance, experiential familiarity, and difficult-to-track changes in bio-psychological factors. Small variations in expectation, diet, sleep cycle, and history of use can result in unexpectedly large differences in intensity and character of effects of a drug. Although unlikely, some have suggested this may be caused or exacerbated by ethylphenidate being synthesized as a racemic mixture; the proportional amounts of l-isomer and d-isomer might vary from batch to batch. 
 
 People report increasing side effects and nasal problems with higher and/or more frequent doses.
 
CAUTION & DISCLAIMER #
 
Every individual reacts differently to every chemical. 
 
 Erowid's dosage information is a summary of data gathered from users, research, and other resources. This information is intended to describe the range of dosages people report using. It should not be construed as a recommendation of any sort. Individuals can respond very differently to the same dosage. What is safe for one can be deadly for another.

Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Ethylphenidate**
- REGULATED: No
- STATUS: Not Approved ForHuman Consumption
- SCHEDULE: Un-Scheduled
 
Ethylphenidate is not specifically scheduled in the United States. However, it is likely that it would be considered a controlled substance analogue (of methylphenidate, a Schedule II substance), in which case, sales for human consumption or possession with the intent to ingest could be prosecuted under the [Federal Analogue Act](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/analog/analog.shtml) .
 
U.S. STATE LAW #
 
Utah #
 
Ethylphenidate is a controlled substance in Utah, along with its "analogs, homologs, and synthetic equivalents". See [http://le.utah.gov/code/TITLE58/htm/58_37_000402.htm](http://le.utah.gov/code/TITLE58/htm/58_37_000402.htm) . (thanks J) (last updated Mar 17, 2014)

INTERNATIONAL LAW #
 
Canada #
 
Ethylphenidate is not listed/Scheduled under Canadian law and Canada has no analog law. (thanks gl, eg) (last updated Oct 13, 2014)
 
Germany (Deutschland) #
 
6-APB, 5-APB, Buphedrone, 3,4-Dimethylmethcathinone, Ethylphenidate, 3-Fluoromethcathinone, Pentedrone, and alpha-PVP became controlled in July, 2013. See [http://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/fileadmin/dateien/Downloads/B/Betaeubungsmittelgesetz/27_BtMAEndV.pdf](http://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/fileadmin/dateien/Downloads/B/Betaeubungsmittelgesetz/27_BtMAEndV.pdf) and [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/btmg_1981/index.html](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/btmg_1981/index.html) . (thanks jl) (last updated Jul 21 2013)
 
Norway #
 
Ethylphenidate is not specifically listed as controlled in Norway. The laws in Norway are complex, and there are two main areas of law that cover psychoactive drugs. There is the "Forskrift om narkotika" (=narcotics regulation), which mostly covers chemical compounds directly, and the "Forskrift om legemiddelklassifisering" (=regulations of medication classification), covering plants and herbs. Although the narcotics regulation covers "Salts, stereo isomers, esters and ethers of substances and groups of substances listed in the narcotics regulation, assuming the substances has or are believed to have psychoactive effects.", ethylphenidate does not appear to be covered by these rules. Ethylphenidate is a clear analog of methylphenidate, but Norway's laws do not make ethylphenidate controlled because it is similar in structure to the medicine methylphenidate. (thanks pah) (last updated Sep 28 2014)
 
Sweden #
 
Ethylphenidate is in Appendix 1, illegal for most purposes, as of 2012. [http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Forordning-19921554-om-kont_sfs-1992-1554/](http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Forordning-19921554-om-kont_sfs-1992-1554/) . (thanks r) (last updated Jun 21 2013)
 
United Kingdom (U.K., Britain, England, Scotland, Wales) #
 
In April, 2015, Ethylphenidate was placed under emergency control as "Temporary Class Drugs", making it illegal to sell or manufacture without licensure. Possession is not yet illegal. See [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/circular-0152015-temporary-control-of-5-methylphenidate-based-nps/circular-0152015-temporary-control-of-5-methylphenidate-based-nps](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/circular-0152015-temporary-control-of-5-methylphenidate-based-nps/circular-0152015-temporary-control-of-5-methylphenidate-based-nps) .

**Ethylphenidate** (also known as **EPH** ) is a novel [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [phenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenidate) class that produces traditional [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Route_of_administration) .

It is a closely related analog of [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) (brand names Ritalin, Concerta). The two substances have very similar pharmacological mechanisms but discernible differences in their subjective effects with ethylphenidate often considered to be recreational.

Ethylphenidate is most commonly distributed as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) by online vendors, due to its grey-area legal status in certain countries.

## Chemistry

Ethylphenidate is a synthetic molecule of the [substituted phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_phenethylamine) and [substituted phenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_phenidate) classes. It contains a phenethylamine core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino -NH2 group through an ethyl chain. It is structurally similar to [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , featuring a substitution at R α which is incorporated into a [piperidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piperidine) ring ending at the terminal amine of the phenethylamine chain. Additionally, it contains an ethyl acetate bound to R β or its structure. Ethylphenidate is structurally differed to [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) by elongation of the carbon chain. *Ethyl-* regards the side chain of two carbon atoms, *phen-* indicates the phenyl ring, *id-* is contracted from a piperidine ring, and *-ate* indicates the acetate group containing the oxygens. Ethylphenidate is a chiral compound, presumably produced as a racemic mixture.

## Pharmacology

Ethylphenidate acts as both a [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) , meaning it effectively boosts the levels of the norepinephrine and dopamine [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) in the brain by binding to and partially blocking the transporter proteins that normally remove those monoamines from the synaptic cleft. This allows dopamine and norepinephrine to accumulate within the brain, resulting in stimulating and euphoric effects.

All available data on ethylphenidate's pharmacokinetics are drawn from studies conducted on rodents. It has been found that ethylphenidate is more selective to the dopamine transporter (DAT) than [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) , having approximately the same efficacy as the parent compound, but with significantly less activity on the norepinephrine transporter (NET). Its dopaminergic pharmacodynamic profile is nearly identical to methylphenidate and is primarily responsible for its euphoric and reinforcing effects.

The following is ethylphenidate's binding profile in the mouse, alongside methylphenidate's. Figures for both the racemic and the dextrorotary [enantiomers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Enantiomers) are given:

Ethylphenidate can be formed within the body (in the liver), when [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) and [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) are co-ingested. This is most common when large quantities of [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) and [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) are consumed at the same time, such as in non-medical use or overdose scenarios. A similar process is also known to occur when [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) and [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) are consumed together, forming [cocaethylene](/w/index.php?title=Cocaethylene&action=edit&redlink=1) . However, only a few percent of the consumed methylphenidate is converted to ethylphenidate, so a pharmacologically significant dose with measurable physiological effects would never be produced.

## Subjective effects

The general headspace of ethylphenidate is described by many as one of extreme mental stimulation, increased focus, and powerful euphoria. It contains a large number of typical [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) cognitive effects. Although negative side effects are usually mild at low to moderate dosages, they become increasingly likely to manifest themselves with higher amounts or extended usage. This particularly holds true during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of the experience.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - Ethylphenidate is usually reported to be energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is distinct but much weaker than that of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) and stronger than that of [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) and [caffeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Caffeine) . At lower to moderate doses, it encourages general productivity and at higher dosages it encourages physical activities such as dancing, socializing, running, or cleaning. The particular style of stimulation which ethylphenidate presents can be described as forced. This means that at higher dosages, it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still as jaw clenching, involuntarily bodily shakes and vibrations become present, resulting in extreme shaking of the entire body, unsteadiness of the hands, and a general lack of fine motor control.
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - Norepinephrine reuptake inhibition causes the sympathetic nervous system to constrict vessels and puts strain on the cardiovascular system with prolonged use.
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This component is most effective at low to moderate dosages as anything higher will usually impair concentration.
- **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - The euphoric rush associated with ethylphenidate use, as result of [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [reuptake inhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibition) , is very short-lived and compulsive, similarly to that of [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) .
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - This can be described as the experience of time speeding up and passing much quicker than it usually would when sober.
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)** ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
### Experience reports

There are currently anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational ethylphenidate use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because ethylphenidate has a very limited history of human usage.

Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried ethylphenidate within the community suggests that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this substance at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

It is worth noting that ethylphenidate crystals are particularly abrasive and somewhat caustic to mucous membranes. Careless use will deteriorate the chosen [routes of administration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) so it is important to practice routine maintenance such as soaking the sinus cavity with water prior to and following insufflation.

It will also irritate lung tissue if inhaled, resulting in the production of phlegm and an irritated cough.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , the chronic use of ethylphenidate can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of ethylphenidate develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). ethylphenidate presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopaminergic) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , meaning that after the consumption of ethylphenidate all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) will have a reduced effect.

### Psychosis

Abuse of compounds within the stimulant class at high dosages for prolonged periods of time can potentially result in a stimulant psychosis that may present with a variety of symptoms (e.g., [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , or [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) ). A review on treatment for amphetamine, [dextroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine) , and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) abuse-induced psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. The same review asserts that, based upon at least one trial, [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with Ethylphenidate should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Ethylphenidate may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.

- **[MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs)** - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , and some [antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressants) .
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - The neurotoxic effects of MDMA may be increased when combined with other stimulants.
- **[Cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine)** - This combination may increase strain on the heart.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylphenidate*

Ethylphenidate (EPH) is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant and a close analog of methylphenidate.
Ethylphenidate acts as a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor, meaning it effectively boosts the levels of the norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitters in the brain, by binding to, and partially blocking the transporter proteins that normally remove those monoamines from the synaptic cleft.
Ethylphenidate, being almost identical to methylphenidate in both structure and pharmacodynamics, likely also doesn't solely act as a "classical" reuptake inhibitor but primarily as an inverse agonist at the dopamine transporter (DAT), inducing dopamine transporter reversal and subsequent dopamine release from the axon terminal into the synaptic cleft in a manner similar to but distinct from amphetamines.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacokinetics

Ethylphenidate metabolizes into methylphenidate and ritalinic acid.
Tiny amounts of ethylphenidate can be formed in vivo when ethanol and methylphenidate are coingested, via hepatic transesterification.  Ethylphenidate formation appears to be more common when large quantities of methylphenidate and alcohol are consumed at the same time, such as in non-medical use or overdose scenarios.  However, the transesterification process of methylphenidate to ethylphenidate, as tested in mice liver, was dominant in the inactive (−)-enantiomer but showed a prolonged and increased maximal plasma concentration of the active (+)-enantiomer of methylphenidate. Additionally, only a small percentage of the consumed methylphenidate is converted to ethylphenidate.
This carboxylesterase-dependent transesterification process is also known to occur when cocaine and alcohol are consumed together, forming cocaethylene.

### Pharmacodynamics

All available data on ethylphenidate's pharmacodynamics are drawn from studies conducted on rodents. Ethylphenidate is more selective to the dopamine transporter (DAT) than methylphenidate, having approximately the same efficacy as the parent compound, but has significantly less activity on the norepinephrine transporter (NET). Its dopaminergic pharmacodynamic profile is nearly identical to methylphenidate, and is primarily responsible for its euphoric and reinforcing effects.
The eudysmic ratio for ethylphenidate is superior to that of methylphenidate.
The following is ethylphenidate's binding profile in the mouse, alongside methylphenidate's. Figures for both the racemic and the dextrorotary enantiomers are given:

## Legality

Ethylphenidate is a schedule II drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
Ethylphenidate is illegal in the Netherlands, as the Opium Law List I covers it, as of April 27, 2018
In the United States, effective November 21, 2024, Etheylphenidate was placed in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act.
On September 22, 2023, the DEA filed a proposed rule for placement of Ethylphenidate into Schedule I status. Public commenting opened on September 22, 2023, and closed on November 21, 2023.
Ethylphenidate was made schedule I at the state level in Alabama on March 18th, 2014.
Ethylphenidate is illegal in Sweden as of December 15, 2012.
Ethylphenidate is illegal to manufacture, distribute or import in the UK, as of 10 April 2015 it has been placed under a Temporary Class Drug Order which automatically places it in a Class-B-like category. Though ordinarily the TCDO would only last 1 year, the ACMD reported that since its invocation prevalence of MPA had significantly decreased, and that it had been challenging to collect information about the drug. As a result of this, they requested that the TCDO be extended a further year from 26 June 2016.
Ethylphenidate is illegal in Jersey under the Misuse of Drugs (Jersey) Law 1978.
Australian state and federal legislation contains provisions that mean that analogues of controlled drugs are also covered by the legislation. Ethylphenidate would be an analogue of methylphenidate under this legislation.
Ethylphenidate is controlled in Canada under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act under Schedule III as of May 5, 2017.
Ethylphenidate is illegal in Germany as of May 7, 2013.
Ethylphenidate is illegal in Austria by the "Neue Psychoaktive Substanzen Gesetz" (New Psychoactive Substances Act) NPSG since 1 January 2012
Ethylphenidate is illegal in Denmark as of February 1, 2013.
Ethylphenidate is illegal in Poland by "the Act on Counteracting Drug Addiction" since July 1, 2015.
It is illegal in Lithuania to use, buy, possess, transport, sell or import Ethylphenidate from 2015
As of October 2015, ethylphenidate is a controlled substance in China.
In Finland ethylphenidate is scheduled in government decree on substances, preparations and plants considered to be narcotic drugs.
