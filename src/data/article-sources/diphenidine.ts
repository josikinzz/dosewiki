**Diphenidine** (**1-(1,2-diphenylethyl)piperidine**) is a dissociative NMDA receptor antagonist and anesthetic drug that has been sold online as a research chemical.

The synthesis of diphenidine was first reported in 1924 and employed a nitrile displacement reaction analogous to the one that would later be used to discover phencyclidine in 1956. Shortly after the 2013 UK ban on arylcyclohexylamines, diphenidine and the related compound methoxphenidine became available on the grey market. Anecdotal reports describe high doses of diphenidine producing “*bizarre somatosensory phenomena and transient anterograde amnesia*.”

In 2014, there have been two published reports of diphenidine being sold in combination with synthetic cannabinoids in Japanese herbal incense blends. A herbal incense sold in the Shizuoka Prefecture under the name “Aladdin (sic) Spacial Edition” was found to contain diphenidine and 5-fluoro-AB-PINACA at concentrations of 289 mg/g and 55.5 mg/g, respectively. Another product called ‘‘Herbal Incense. The Super Lemon’’ containing AB-CHMINACA, 5F-AMB, and diphenidine was implicated in a fatal overdose.

Based on collaborative anecdotal evidence, diphenidine seems to have a much more rapid onset and lower half life when vaporized or smoked. When consumed this way, it is a suspected to be carcinogenic when excess heat is used. Some user reports have concluded that vaporization requires as low as 20% of what would be a common oral dose for that person.

In terms of its chemistry, diphenidine is a diarylethylamine related to methoxphenidine. It is named for its two phenyl and piperidine groups. Diphenidine’s crystalline structure is very similar to MK-801 (Dizocilpine) and shares many of the same effects. These two compounds are homeomorphs. Diphenidine is synthesized in a reaction analogous to the synthesis of PCP. The ®-enantiomer of diphenidine has a remarkable high affinity as a NMDA receptor channel blocker.

In terms of its pharmacology, diphenenidine acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist. NMDA receptors allow for electrical signals to pass between neurons in the brain and spinal column; for the signals to pass, the receptor must be open. NMDA receptor antagonists close the NMDA receptors by blocking them. This disconnection of neurons leads to loss of feeling, difficulty moving, and eventually the famous “hole”.

Although vendors of diphenidine have stated the compound acts as a dopamine-reuptake inhibitor and a serotonin reuptake inhibitor with µ-opioid affinity and typical dissociative effects, to date diphenidine has not been screened for affinity at the dopamine transporter. If this is indeed the case, however, it provides an explanation for its euphoric and often stimulating effects.

Diphenidine and related diarylethylamines have been studied in vitro as treatments for neurotoxic injury. Diphenidine may be a stronger NMDA receptor antagonist for neurogenis and neurological repair than other more common NMDA receptor antagonistic dissociatives such as ketamine, dextromethorphan, PCP analogs, Iboga and methoxetamine.

The effects listed below are based upon the [subjective effects index](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index) and personal experiences of [PsychonautWiki](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki#Contributors). The listed effects will rarely if ever occur all at once but heavier dosages will increase the chances and are more likely to induce a full range of effects.

**Physical effects:**

The subjective physical effects of diphenidine can be broken down into nine components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **[Tactile disconnection](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_disconnection)**
- **[Spontaneous tactile sensations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_tactile_sensations)** - The diphenidine body high is a sharp, pleasurable tingling sensation which is location specific to the hands, feet and head.
- **[Tactile suppression](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression)** - This partially to entirely suppresses one’s own sense of touch, creating feelings of numbness within the extremities. It is responsible for the anaesthetic properties of this substance.
- **[Physical autonomy](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_autonomy)**
- **[Motor control loss](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)** - A loss of gross and fine motor control alongside of balance and coordination is prevalent within diphenidine and becomes especially strong at higher dosages. This means that one should be sitting down before the onset (unless one is experienced) in case of falling over and injuring oneself.
- **[Euphoria](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - This results in feelings of physical euphoria which range between mild pleasure to powerful all-encompassing bliss.
- **[Decreased bodily weight](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_bodily_weight)** - This creates the sensation that the body is floating and has become entirely weightless. This effect is strangely stimulating and encourages physical activities at low to moderate dosages by making the body feel light and effortless to move.
- **[Dizziness](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)** - Although uncommon, some people report dizziness under the influence of diphenidine.
- **[Nausea](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - It’s worth noting that high dose diphenidine trips can sometimes result in nausea and vomiting at the peak of the trip. For most people, this is surprisingly not as unpleasant as they would initially expect due to the accompanying detachment from the physical senses.

**Cognitive effects:**

The general head space of diphenidine is often described as particularly euphoric and clear headed in comparison to that of DXM and Ketamine. The specific cognitive effects can be broken down into 8 separate subcomponents which are listed and described below:

- **[Consciousness disconnection](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Consciousness_disconnection)**
- **[Ego suppression, loss and death](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_suppression,_loss_and_death)**
- **[Thought deceleration](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Information processing suppression](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Information_processing_suppression)**
- **[Time distortion](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Euphoria](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Introspection](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection)**
- **[Deja-Vu](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deja-Vu)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**

**Visual effects:**

*Suppression:*

This substance does not enhance visual stimuli; instead it tends to degrade and decrease visual aptitude in a variety of ways which generally includes:

- **[Visual disconnection](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection)** - This eventually results in the diphenidine’s equivalent of the famous “K-hole” or more specifically, *[holes, space and voids](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids)* alongside of *[structures](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Structures)*.
- **[Visual acuity suppression](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)**
- **[Double vision](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)** - This component is prevalent at moderate to heavy dosages and makes reading impossible unless one closes an eye.
- **[Pattern recognition suppression](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_suppression)** - This effect generally occurs at higher dosages and makes one unable to recognize and interpret perceivable visual data.

*Distortions:*

Diphenidine exhibits a full array of dissociative distortions and alterations in visual perception which generally includes:

- **[Perspective distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_distortions)**
- **[Environmental cubism](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Environmental_cubism)**
- **[Environmental orbism](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Environmental_orbism)**
- **[Scenery slicing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**

*Geometry:*

The visual geometry found within diphenidine can be described as very dark and bland when compared to that of Ketamine or DXM and often consists of many tiny interlocking and woven lines. It does not extend beyond level 4 and can be comprehensively described through its [variations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as simplistic in complexity, algorithmic in style, synthetic in feel, unstructured in organization, dimly lit in lighting, multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, soft in edges, small in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, equal in rounded and angular corners, immersive in depth and consistent in intensity.

*Hallucinatory states:*

At high dosages, diphenidine can produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that that is less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. These effects include:

- **[Internal hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations)** (*[Autonomous entities](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)*, *[Settings, sceneries, and landscapes](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)*, *[Alterations in perspective](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alterations_in_perspective)* and *[Scenarios and plots](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)*) - In comparison to other dissociatives, this effect can occur at heavy dosages but is considerably less common than the same effect found within psychedelics and deliriants. It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as delirious in believability, fixed in style, equal in new experiences and memory replays in content, autonomous in controllability and solid in style.

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects are common in their occurrence and exhibit a range of effects which commonly includes:

- **[Enhancements](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Suppression](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_suppression)**
- **[Distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)**

**Physical health effects, potential addiction and tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational diphenidine use does not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because diphenidine is a research chemical with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried diphenidine within the psychonaut community suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

There is a very strong tolerance build up with diphenidine which results in the need to consume increasingly large doses in order to achieve the same level of effects. This should reset to baseline after 1 - 2 weeks. There may well be some addictive potential but this is still unknown.

Tolerance may be mitigated via preparing the citrate salt by mixing the chemical with citric acid or lemon juice, which will aid in absorption and increase effects.

**Legal issues:**

Diphenidine is currently a legal grey area drug worldwide and is freely available through the use of online research chemical vendors. However, this does not guarantee anyone to be immune from legal prosecution should they be found in possession of this substance as the legality is likely to vary from country to country.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, diphenidine feels almost identical to MXE with only subtle differences. It is a powerful hallucinogen and just as capable of inducing deep states of detachment which rival that of the other more commonly used dissociatives.

## Subjective Experience

Diphenidine began to appear on the markets in 2013, shortly after the UK ban on
ketamine came into effect. However, as it is much longer lasting and is usually taken
orally, it is not generally considered to be a direct replacement. The headspace
created is also reported to be notably different.

This chemical gave me my first experience of a dissociative, and this was certainly
not what I was anticipating. My expectation had been framed by the fact that the
aforementioned ketamine, which was the most well known dissociative, had been
widely reported by the media to be a horse tranquilliser. On the basis of this I naively
assumed that I would fall into a deep relaxing sedation, with significant drowsiness,
and perhaps, eventually, sleep.

I wasn’t even close.

The psychoactive effects took a significant time to materialise. Indeed, much longer
than almost any other compound I had experienced at the time. However, when they
emerged they were both immersive and distinctive.

My notes from the time were as follows:

\`\`\`
When I am sat down, focusing upon something cerebral, I can lose myself
within the topic for lengthy periods, which is usually a very rewarding and
positive experience.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
When I stand and walk around I am immediately aware of the disjointed
weirdness of the world which I now perceive. This initially invoked some fear,
but familiarity has tended to soften it.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Now that this adjustment has occurred, and I have reminded myself that this
is just a trip, and thus is a temporary phenomenon, it has become interesting
and intriguing. The feeling of general numbness adds to this aspect, in that
movement, the simple act of walking, feels more like a seamless floating
enterprise.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Overlaid on this, a feeling of general contentment has also taken hold and
anxieties have dissipated.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I can now see why dissociatives are such popular recreational drugs.
\`\`\`
The overall experiment was both intriguing and enjoyable. I found diphenidine to be
multifaceted, in that on the dose I opted for I could solicit different aspects of the
experience almost at will.

On the flip side, it should be noted that there have been some reports of tragedy with
respect to the use of this drug, which were always in the back of my mind. It also felt
less smooth than its cousin, ephenidine, which I have subsequently sampled and
explored more frequently.

Diphenidine provided a very strange ride indeed, but with edges which caused
sufficient concern to prevent me from going too deep. Whilst I was under the
influence, those edges, perhaps jittery in nature, were very mild. In fact they could, at
least to some degree, have been invoked by familiarity with those reports, and by the
negative PR which this class of drug tended to attract from the media at the time. I
suspect that had ephenidine not emerged, I would have overcome them and used it
for more comprehensive exploration.

Playing exclusively in the shallow end, this was a good introduction to the world of
dissociatives. It was one from which I certainly derived a degree of insight and
pleasure. Research, however, indicates that it should always be approached with
care, and never binged.

Diphenidine (1,2-DEP, DPD, DND) is a dissociative anesthetic that has been sold as a designer drug.
Diphenidine was first synthesized in 1924 using a Bruylants reaction similar to the one later employed in the discovery of phencyclidine in 1956. Following the 2013 UK ban on arylcyclohexylamines, diphenidine and the related compound methoxphenidine emerged on the grey market. Anecdotal reports indicate that high doses of diphenidine can produce "bizarre somatosensory phenomena and transient anterograde amnesia."

## Pharmacology

Electrophysiological studies show that diphenidine reduces the amplitude of NMDA-mediated fEPSPs to a similar extent as ketamine, although its antagonistic effect has a slower onset. The drug's two enantiomers exhibit markedly different NMDA receptor affinities, with the (S)-enantiomer being approximately 40 times more potent than the (R)-enantiomer.
Since diphenidine's emergence in 2013, vendors have claimed it acts on the dopamine transporter, but supporting data only became available in 2016. While diphenidine shows the highest affinity for the NMDA receptor, it also binds with submicromolar affinity to the σ1 receptor, σ2 receptor, and dopamine transporter.

## Research

Diphenidine and other diarylethylamines have been studied in vitro for their potential in treating neurotoxic injury. These compounds act as antagonists at the NMDA receptor. In dogs, diphenidine demonstrates greater antitussive potency than codeine phosphate.

## Illicit use

Since 2014, diphenidine has been detected in combination with other research chemicals, particularly synthetic cannabinoids and stimulants, in Japanese herbal incense blends. The first reported seizure involved a Japanese product labeled as "fragrance powder," which contained both diphenidine and benzylpiperazine A herbal incense product called "Aladdin Spacial [sic] Edition," sold in Shizuoka Prefecture, was found to contain 289 mg/g of diphenidine and 55.5 mg/g of 5F-AB-PINACA. Another product, Herbal Incense. The Super Lemon, containing AB-CHMINACA, 5F-AMB, and diphenidine, was linked to a fatal poisoning. More recently, diphenidine was implicated in a fatal case involving the simultaneous use of three substituted cathinones, three benzodiazepines, and alcohol, consumed through "bath salt" and "liquid aroma" products in Japan.
In Canada, MT-45 and its analogues—including DPD—were added to Schedule I controlled substances in 2016. Possession without proper authorization may result in a maximum penalty of seven years' imprisonment. That same year, Health Canada amended the Food and Drug Regulations to explicitly classify DPD as a restricted drug. Possession is limited to law enforcement agencies, individuals with exemption permits, or institutions with ministerial authorization.
