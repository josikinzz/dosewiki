N-Desalkylflurazepam (also known as norflurazepam) is a benzodiazepine analog and an active metabolite of several other benzodiazepine drugs including flurazepam, flutoprazepam, fludiazepam, midazolam, flutazolam, quazepam, and ethyl loflazepate.  It is long-acting, prone to accumulation, and binds unselectively to the various benzodiazepine receptor subtypes.  It has been sold as a designer drug from 2016 onward.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacokinetics

N-Desalkylflurazepam has an elimination half-life of 47–150 hours (up to 200 hours in some healthy volunteers), with an average of ~71 hours. Peak blood concentrations of N-Desalkylflurazepam is reached at 10.2 h following a single 15 mg dose of Flurazepam, typically around ~10-20.4 ng/mL.
It's plasma levels are unreliable amongst patients, and are largely influenced by liver disease, liver enzyme inducers and inhibitors, as well as old age (in men).
