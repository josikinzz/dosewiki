Possible explanation:


The effects are not so intense as to make you feel like it would be too much to do it again and again coupled with the probability that you have plenty of it lying around.


Give your supply to a friend and have him/her charge you $30 a dose and see if you still fiend for it.

It's been a little while, but let's see what I can remember of 5-MEO-MIPT:


Several attempts with this one: 16, 18, 20mg smoked and 4, 6 and *unkown* oral (*unkown* = washed out the fine powder coating the plastic bag - I thought this would be about 4mg, but must have been much more - very unpleasant experience).


Smoked hits in about 10 seconds and is immediately hallucinogenic. Very mushroom-like visuals.. curtains melting and dripping to the floor, patterning, distorted colours. I experience no body load or nausea on this, although my friend had a fair amount of nausea and "weird body feelings". Conversation flowed easily and tended heavily towards the humorous, with lots of laughter. There was a generally comfortable, relaxed feeling. Voracious hunger shortly into the trip, and eating a BBQ chicken was one of the most enjoyable things I ever remember doing on drugs. No noticable difference in the 3 dose levels - if anything the effects decreased with dose - but this would most likely be tolerance due to closeness of trials.


Oral hits in about 15 minutes. Both the 4mg and 6mg were  mild versions of the above (also - probably erred on the side of caution with dosage - I don't like my scales. Plus the possible tolerance issue). The *unkown* oral was very frightening - my first experience of body load (this was my first "RC"), very elevated heart rate, much heavier hallucinations (although - that was a good thing ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I've tasted this material at 3mg and 6mg and so far. At six mg there were no visuals but there were some tactile effects, things felt sort of tickly. I could see how it could be erotic. I wasn't impressed by the mental effects however, nothing very deep or profound at all to it. Maybe at a higher dose there would be though. Very little body load. I'd say its better than foxy, but thats not saying too much, imho.

Does anyone know the solubility of this stuff in distilled water? I read one report here that said it would not disolve at all, and one that said they had a hard time with 10mg/ml. Anyone else have any experience disolving in water?

^^^^^^^^^^^


Did you apply heat to the solution?  I can never get DPT hcl to go into a solution until I heat it up a bit.  Sometimes just raising the temperature a bit is all it takes.  I've never tried to get 5-MeO-MiPT into solution myself (I haven't even opened up the sealed vial yet) but I find it hard to believe it won't even go into alcohol.


Since this one is so potent, I don't trust my .002 mg scale to weigh out a single dose.  When I do get around to trying it, I'll prolly weigh out 50 mg or so and make a water solution out of it so I know the dosage I choose will be what I actually consume.  I'll report back if I was able to get it to disolve or not.


I wonder if adding a pinch of some citric or acsorbic acid to the water would help if heat does not?

I attempted to dissolve 30mg in 2O fluid oz water and it only partially dissolved. Adding some vitamin C (ascorbic acid) did the trick.

If heat is added to the solution to get the powder to dissolve completely, as the solution gets colder, will it come back out? In particular I'm wondering about cold storage, not just leaving a vial sitting around. Would you have to heat it up every time you wanted to use some?

Well it should be understood that higher temperature not only increases that rate a which a material dissolves but also the overall solubility for many materials. So it is possible when you cool a solution you could get precipitate.

Yeah, I thought this chem was one where, before i got my good scale, "hmm dump a 'lil on the table, and lick it.".  Well one night a while back, although I did write a report as it was happening, just not finisihed/posted, 14mg orally at once, had me searching for any benzo's and then after a benzo some alcohol to slam down, after about 20 minutes after eating the capsule.


It came on so fast, after 20 minutes I was at a +++ and going up, and since at the time I really didnt want to sit there ego-less for hours, I downed a benzo, slammed a smirnoff or whatever it was...  well I think i really didnt need to do that, because it quickly leveled off, into a high +++ for a while, and I actually had a very nice trip that night.  I "thought" I was going to go too high where any grip on reality was just going to be unavailable in another 10 minutes.  It reminded me of when i supposedly took JUST 11mg of 5-meo-dipt and after 10 minutes I had visuals, that time i just tend to think i accidently took more than 11mg (it was in a liquid and maybe a tiny speck was not dissolved or something.. dont know now that was years ago anyway).  Visuals, weren't just mild, they were outrageous - after 20 minutes! Every mg counts on this one..  I had nothing like this with slightly lower oral doses.  9mg I just got a body buzz and really, nothing fun or interesting at all.  Smoking is the way to go for me on this one.

the reason you fiend to do more is because the peak is hard and quick, over within the first hour, and then you spend the next 4+ hours comming down.


at least thats how it was for me.

I could definitely see that being the case for some, but I think there's various other reasons why people would want to redose as well... 

One other major one being that the "rolling" part of the experience on 5-MeO-MIPT isn't quite as strong as some might want - it's like taking a "teaser" dose of MDMA, so I think the reason some want to take more of this is to get the rolling feeling to be stronger. 

For me, I thought the duration was perfect, and didn't really have any desire to extend the time it lasted.  

But I could certainly see how some would want to...

I certainly felt the desire to redose with this one.  I felt the first effects in less than 20 minutes and was at peak within and hour.  After about an hour of this, I wanted to take more.  It didn't stem from a desire to make the "roll" feeling stronger, just to bring it back.  Thats not to say that the second, trippy, phase isn't enjoyable, but the first hour of the trip is where this one shines for me.  I don't think that taking a larger dose would necessarly give a stronger first phase, there is only so much of a roll feeling that this chemical has to offer.  I was personally very pleased with what it gave me, but I can see how it may just tease other people.  I was also pleasantlly surprised at the easy body load, no nausea and very little speedyness(certainly not to the point of discomfort for me).  This is definatly one I plan to explore with more in the future.

I tried this one by itself last night.  I found it to be quite pleasant and very erotic.  Reports of the two phase type trip are right on.  My partner and I gave this a right proper sex test and let me say it was very nice.  Very similar to sex on X except we had no problems with finishing the deed. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) 


Very nice body buzz in the beginning that gave way to a classic tryptamine type trip.  It was little short on the visuals but I did see normal morphing and color enhancement.  We watched Kill Bill I on it.  "Gooooooood gravy marine". LOL It was the first time we had seen that movie and wow that was crazy.  Tarantino is one sick kid.


We did feel the desire to redose as we wanted to regain that first phase.  We started out with 6mgs and both followed it up with 6mg boosters about an hour later.  The entire experience lasted around 5 hours.  We also were hit with a major case of the munchies.  Food was very interesting with this material.  We ate a full meal while on it and alot of strawberries on top of that.  Those berries were mighty tasty.


Anyways very nice stuff and this one will be part of my toolkit for a long time to come.

My first experience with 5MeOMiPT was 2 hours after taking 180mg methylone, at a concert in a small venue.  My friend and I split a 10mg capsule and neither of us felt much.  Some visual distortion and a slightly darker (but not bad) mood.  Fantasy visualizations of music and situations in my head that were very serious, a definite downshift from methylone.  I'm sure the methylone covered up a lot of the effects...


Second experience was after work the following Friday where I swallowed the empty capsule from the concert (actually it had an unknown quantity of residue stuck to the cap) on an empty stomach.  After a steady and confusing 45-minute climb I was left nauseous and nervous (odd for me) but had plans to go out and stuck with them.  As soon as we got to the pub I settled down and had a beer which helped calm things down.  Food also seemed to offset the nausea (??)  I must have had a high dose though because it became quite visual during the second hour plus.  I remember all the lights, neon beer signs and TV monitors in my peripheral vision melted into a bluish haze that hovered right next to my head.  Very lush colors and strong relaxation at about the 2-hour point.  Slightly spinning room.  Walking was a bit stiff but my mood was very loose after a while.  Intense relaxation (I’ve heard Shulgin mention this) is a good way to describe the come down.  Alcohol and mj were consumed later and insatiable horniness took over.  


I have yet to smoke it although I do enjoy smoking her cousin MiPT.

I definatly think food helps with this one.  I have eaten doses(10mg) right after eating a decent meal, and never had a problem with nausea.  Interesting that someone else noticed this as well.

I've tried it twice so far and I **LOVE** it. It's in my top 5 of everything I've tried so far.


1st time was 10mg orally (open gel cap). It was at home with my gf. I felt the onset within 15 minutes. The peak came quickly and was very stimulating (in that good way). It was *very* euphoric for me. Music sounded awesome. We basically spent the night listening to music and talking about random things. This drug is definately a two-phase trip. This first 4 hours is sort of like a 'roll'. Stimulation, euphoria, talkative feelings, happiness and contentment, etc. After that goes away, there's not really any comedown or dissappointment that the feeling went away. I didn't feel sober though. After the 'roll' went away I had some faint visuals and trippy thoughts. That lasted for another 4 hours or so. The only negative side effects were a very slight headache for both of us that would come and go. Throughout the experience the effects would come and go in waves, the feelings weren't constant.


2nd time was 14mg orally (open gel cap). My gf and I did that at a desert party/rave type event with around 50 other people there (most were rolling or  smoking weed and doing nitrous). There was two areas of music, trance/club music and drum n' bass/jungle. We spent the night in the 2nd area for almost the whole time. The bass felt AMAZING. The comeup was a bit more intense with 14mg, almost too much! I had some slight nausea for the first hour or so. This dose was overwhelmingly stimulating and euphoric for the 1st 5 hours (again, in a good way ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)). I was feeling so stimulated that I danced almost the entire time. Everyone thought my gf and I were rolling, and as I was trying to imagine what I looked like, I could imagine why. I wasn't feeling very social though, like I am on E. I was just content dancing to the music and feeling great. The desert sky was full of stars and it looked so awesome. After the 'roll' went away I started having more visuals and I felt like I was tripping on a very low dose of 4-HO-MiPT or something similar. It took around 10 hours+ for us to feel normal again from the time we took it. With this dose the feelings during the first phase of the trip were constant and didn't come and go in waves.


I think 14mg orally is the most I'd ever take again, but next time I plan on 12mg since 14mg was that 'almost too much' dose for me...


During the 'roll' part of the experience for me, this drug doesn't even really feel psychedelic.

Last time I took some of this, don't remember the dose but it wasn't too high.  I did find it erotic.. it made me quite horny.  Also music sounded awesome.


Like others have said, the first hours are more of a erotic/happy/euphoric feeling, then later on it seems to turn psychedelic.


I wish i had more of this stuff actually.. after the last experience.

I have tasted it three times.


Once quite some time ago about 3-4mg oral and went to the cinema to see Star Wars or Matrix or something and I was more than impressed - with the film, that is, and part of the reason must have been the 5meo-mipt. It was just "fresher" than it would have otherwise been. Kinda teasy, as if coming up on mushrooms - no more. Euphoric and slightly disorienting, and yet giving me the power to focus REAL close on whatever I choose...


Second time was about the same amount, roughly, maybe 5mg, at home alone, orally again. later when I met people I felt quite disconnected and a bit irritable but unsure why. When I woke up the next day I realised I had been put in a crap despressed mood and totally not realised it at the time, finding fault with everything, not tripping (or so I thought).


Last time was last week. . . 5mg plugged on top of 130mg MDMA plugged. Both me and my tripping partner had had a pizza as well as a fair amount of alcohol beforehand and then got the shits less than 15m after and so we were unsure how much was absorbed. Good time for four hours, a bit like a mild candy flip with wonderful touch perception and then things turned a bit sour for me at the T+4.00. Clearly the time to re-dose with MDMA or something but I had things to do in the morning and it was late already... unimaginative mind unable to sleep  for a few hours. Fine the next day and after, though.


Will try again in the future, likely higher, orally again, on its own. 


A friend uses 5mg of it in conjunction with methylone for a particularly erotic high.

i tested this out last night at 8mg which gave me a weak +++ experience. I didnt experience to many OEV or CEV but had a general feeling of happiness and well being. I could see this getting psychedelic at higher doses. I plan to try this out at 12mg next time.

I felt no body load at all except some tummy rumbling in the first 30min. Actually the body high was very pleasant. This leaves foxy in the dust too when it comes to all those sexy feelings.

I felt it within 30min of taking it and peaked by 1.5 hours. I was completely down by 6 hours and had no trouble sleeping with a little help from some marijuana.

It seems that the intensity of the 5-MeO-MiPT experience *doubles* with every 4mg. The dose-response curve is extremely steep.


12mg is actually the dose I plan on taking next as well. 10mg was slightly too weak for me and 14mg was almost too much. I'm hoping 12mg will be just right (for me).

Anyone insufflate this stuff? I'm having a hard time finding a sweet spot for +++ experiences with insufflated doses. I got a ++++ the first time I tried insufflating a huge dose a few years ago, but lately I've gotten ++'s from what I thought ought to have been substantial quantities insufflated.

Yeh i think 10mg would probably be a bit weak for my tastes aswell. So im hoping 12mg will do it for me. If not than i will slowly work my way up.


8mg gave me a +++ but a weak one.


I cant wait to compare this to 4 ho mipt (which i will be experimenting with next week end.)

One of my friends got a gram of this a while back and snorted the whole thing with two friends within a *week*.  That should attest to the safety of this compound...


More reports from aquaintances:

"It's very friendly, I've been at parties (including a family function, hah!) and socialized while on low doses (4mg) and it was enjoyable.  No one seemed to notice.  There are hints of visuals at this dose, and some mild trails, but nothing too much.  Thoughts get a little muddled, as if I was fairly stoned.  Plateaued at about 1 hour after ingestion, level for about 2 and a half, then a gentle decline to sleep after a total of 7 or so hours.  Light jaw clenching."


"I tried 8mg oral for the first time the other day, with a fair amount of smoked cannabis.  Around 3 hours in I blacked out while trying to stand up, but that was probably attributable to low blood sugar more than anything else.  I watched a movie, and enjoyed the trails the characters left behind.  In and out in about 8 hours.  Very easy on the mind.  I would be hard pressed to freak out."


"My girlfriend and I sampled 8mg together orally, at an afterparty, after rolling beforehand.  Cuddling and eroticism was superb.  Overall, this was extremely pleasant for both of us.  Would repeat without hesitation"

Does it not have the peripheral serotonogic action that seems to screw up the other 5-methoxy tryptamines (ie vomiting/nausea & bouts of the squirts)?  If not, I think it'll be a first


Just I never even considered it after my poor recxord with other 5-methoxytryptamines

Loperamine works great for preventing the dreaded squirts. 5-MeO-MiPT does not seem to be as bad however (Esp. compared to 5-MeO-DiPT) regarding that side-effect.


There may be some nausea soon after taking 5-MeO-MiPT (usually with higher doses), but it is controllable and goes away before the peak.


The only other common negative effects are peripheral stimulation (some might think it is annoying, other may enjoy it) and of course Jaw Clenching!


All in all 5-MeO-MiPT does not have that many negative side effects compared to some other tryptamines.

for some reason with all the 5-MeO's I have tried (DMT/MIPT/DIPT/DALT) I find that there's something quite alien, reptilian to them that I can't quite explain. Something that doesn't have the warmth and emotional resonance that 4-substituted tryptamines as well LSD and AMT (amongst others) can offer me. There's a strong energetic push that is quite root chakra based and thus  sexually stimulating. Of these, DALT is the mellowest and the one I find the most welcoming. 


Unlike with some other tryptamines where taking them is uncannily and beautifully like delving deep into myself and a sort of "coming home" and "becoming one" (and the path there emotionally quite charged) on the 5-MeO ones I feel like I am entering alien territory - somewhere where I feel more presences / entities in the nebulae around me I cannot quite see but just feel, and I am more wary than actually really feeling much.


Can anyone relate to this?

 Not at all. I sampled 5-MeO-MiPT @ 16mg and found it to be forgiving, warm, and highly empathetic.

I just sampled 5-MeO-MiPT for the first time.  I was very excited about this chemical and let me tell you...boy was I wrong.


I took 4mg (hearing it was ultra-potent).  It was ultra-boring.  Strong stimulation for about an hour and a half.  Gave way to a slightly-trippy (I knew I was tripping, but could not tell why), semi-pleasurable body high.  No nausea, but severe gastric distress (ie the shits).  The drug seemed to laugh in my face screaming, "you could be on some of the cleanest LSD you've seen in years right now, you could be on 4-HO-MiPT finding God, you could be on 2C-T-7 feeling the pulse of the universe and experiencing the greatest visuals of your life, but no, you decided to stay up all night on this boring drug".  


No insights, no empathy, no visuals, sorta comfortable body feeling and the shits.  


If I try it again (which I doubt I will) it will probably be at a much higher dosage (not recommended) in an effort to get rid of the rest of this miserable drug, and not be completely disappointed again.  


I have to say, 5-MeO-MiPT provided the most worthless psychedelic experience in all my years of tripping.  Trying DXM again would have been more worthwhile, and I can't stand that drug.

Jesus.  Well, I like it.  But I have to agree that it's not very deep, at least at doses 6mg and under.  However, I've found it quite utile, in that it leaves me relatively clear-headed, but speeds my thoughts up tremendously and improves my motivation to do monotonous tasks.  I also found it pretty good for music, and it puts me in an extremely analytical and thoughtful mood.  Also, the worst issue it has is a bit of coming-up anxiety and stimulation... but I've experienced absolutely no gastrointestinal distress or physical malaise.


It's a drug I wouldn't choose if I wanted an "experience".  But it's good for general enhancement.  At least to me.  That's too bad it didn't work out for you, though.

I dont see why its promoted as a lovey dovy sensory style drug. Why not just dose greater than 15mg and have a real trip. The visuals and sensations produced at the higher doses of this drug I found fantastic, a really strong psychedelic experience.

Remind me to take it at a larger dose sometime.  I generally have used it between 2 and 6mg, with pretty similar results with each dosage, but slightly more anxiety coming up at 6.  It's not "lovey" in the sense of MDMA at all, but it's reasonably tactile and basically enhances whatever you're doing.  Someone said in an Erowid report that it's a "dilator", and I would agree.  It speeds up the thoughts, slows time, and increases analytical thinking.  I've had my most rewarding experiences at this dosage while watching an episode of "Storm Stories", and while cleaning my apartment while listening to Shulman's "In Search of a Meaningful Moment".  At this dose, it's a sharpener, but it's not really very psychedelic.  Also, during the come-up the body energy is a little uncomfortable, but at the peak and beyond it turns pretty pleasurable.


I have noticed no gastric or physical distress whatsoever, except that which is caused by minor anxiety during the come-up.

This compound is a bit of a conundrum.  Some persons have reported it is ‘nothing special’ and others report drastic psychedelic effects… still others report it has two distinct phases/types of effects.  Most of the reports I have read on various boards are mixed with regard to the compounds overall value, yet the [survey results](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=249300) (while small) indicated consistently favorable opinions of the material.  I think the jury may still be out on this one.

For example, I get definite effects with as little as 1mg, although definitely sub-psychedelic.  I seem to experience the two phases of this drug, where for the first couple of hours it's primarily speed and tactile, and then it switches to a clear, clean, but rather generic tryptamine high.

20mg for me was a pretty psychedelic dose. Crazy color enchancement. Things spiraling off in patterns and colors. dancing men in the ground. Trees flailing about, and changing into peacocks. Houses turning into xylophones. Dragons and pictures morphing through objects. Repetitive patterns swirling and glazing about my whole vision, moving to the music I was listening too. Amazing close eye visuals. This was one of my favorite psychedelics so far. I cant wait to try it again. I would definately reccommend this to anyone. Completely astounding experience. Start low though, and build your way up, obviously. Only dose high if you are prepared to trip hard, and want to.


But then again, how can you be absolutely positive what a small amount of little white powder actually is. I was prone to think it was something else because of intense visuals. I got it from a reliable source though, who insists it was 5-meo-mipt. Maybe it was just intense because I was by myself in the wilderness.

^^ Most reports of high dosages say that it's quite psychedelic.  I think you can be reasonably sure it was really 5-MeO-MiPT.  About half the reports of high dosages I've read say it was quite visualm and the other half say it wasn't.  So it seems there is a lot of variance to this one.

Large doses of this are intense, i did 15-17mg of this the other day with a few of my buds and we were all taken off our feet. 


The body energy off of this chemical is astounding, I was able to run around and jump around a jungle gym (lol) with such precision and speed it was exhilarating. Swings were out of this world, getting off of it and walking around on normal ground was almost depressing compared to the grandness of the swing. 


Then about 3 hours in, it completely changed. All of the sudden (I was back inside) I became claustrophobic and immediately went back outside - when I got back outside the trees had become neon hued and the branches looking like snakes. Walking around various paths in and out of forests proved to be amazing and unreal, I was in a completely different world. The trees would seem to grow around me and when i'd come to lights they'd seem to turn into strobe lights and make it incredibly hard to walk, lol. 


That's just a fraction of the trip because i have to run to class, but I must say that i'm thoroughly impressed with this drug. I've also tried smoking the HCl salt a few times between 2-4mg with pleasurable results, such as a weak MeO-MiPT body high which lasted a few hours and some added energy. I'm interested in freebasing maybe 30-50mg of the HCl with 6 mol/L NaOH to smoke that, anybody have any experience with the freebase? Just figured it could be a novel experiment :D


There's some side effects at higher doses that i've noticed too such as the body high becoming too overwhelming (at one point i thought my legs were on fire), some chest pains reported throughout the group, and one time I had pretty bad gastro-intestinal discomfort but nothing moreso than what mushrooms can produce.

Man-o-Shevits I sure do get excited every time I read about 5-MeO-MiPT.  I do wish I had obtained more of this back in the day...but then I've been holding onto what I have for close to three years now, and still have yet to try it.  So I guess what I have will just have to last.


It is interesting for all you read about the snorting and smoking of things like 2C-E, 2C-I, 2C-T-7, etc...that more people try 5-MeO-MiPT orally, at least based on reports I've read.  When the most exciting effects (to my ear anyway) seem to come from smoking it.

I was wondering if anybody would mention anything about the body load with this compound. The 5-methoxytryptamines seem to have a lot of serotonogic activity when it comes to oral administration & the GI tract - I wonder what sort of affinity they have for 5HT3 receptors in the GI tract (5HT3 is effectively the 'vomit & puke' receptor that occurs in the GI tract). 5-Hydroxy AMT is listed in Tocris (catalogue of neurotransmitter agents) as a potent serotonogic agonist, which is probably why 5-methoxy AMT is such a hideous drug, but all the 5-methoxytryptamines seem to do it to some extent when taken orally

I find the body load to consist of an energy in the body, which can be a little bit unnerving while coming up but becomes quite pleasant as the drug fully reaches effect, especially during the first hours.  It really feels quite clean on my body, nothing at all like 5-MeO-DiPT in that respect.  It is good to have an outlet for the energy, and if you do, its release will be pleasant.


I generally agree with you about the 5-methoxy tryptamines being dirty feeling, and I've taken 5-MeO-DiPT, 5-MeO-MiPT, and 5-MeO-AMT.  This one seems different, pretty transparent in the body.  It doesn't seem to disrupt any of my normal functions or anything.

so i took this last sunday... i do not know why erowid says the recomended dose is 6mg... i and my friend both found that very very week. we each popped a 6mg cap and waited a hour and a half... got a good nice body high, some speedyness, but no OEV or CEV at all. we then popped another 6mg cap (so we consumed 12mg total) and 20mins later started to fly... 


amazing amazing body high

pretty cool OEV

unreal CEV

very speedy

no real bowel discomfort like i have heard 5-meo-dipt has

not too much of a mental trip like other hallucinagins...


i agree that this drug is a tryptamine roll


very very hard to sleep afterwards... we took 15mg of ambien each to do this and it was even rediculously hard after taking this (the ambien added a whole nother meaning to "tripping balls" haha)...


lasted around 6 hours total


fun drug look forward to taking again

thank you translators and diagnosticums. 


people in the future (which is still the NOW as time is an illusion) do not use writing but rather logoic metaglyphs reverbrant in the commontangled morphoemissions of the communicators.


the 5-MEOs are not overtly specific when it comes to receptor targeting, 5HT3 effects are certianly noted, as is peripheral 5HT1 agonism - thus the blood pressure fluctuations and, um, that 'gut feeling' - and mayhaps selegeline coadmin made for notably increased potency (order of magnitude). 


the perceived variability among the subjects, rodentia and otherwise, i believe comes from the above-noted lack of precision in targeting - and yes, Virginia, in addition to Santa's Claws, in heavily modified human units, there is def. sensitisation noted for serotonergics of this class.


P.S. Siberian suntan anyone? only 30 hours left to fly, thank god for first class or one would end up w/a wooden ass. back to the beluga malossol and Dom P.


if you go long enough around the world in a mechanically propelled winged device (crass, i know), you travel not only through space and may end up backwards. if that happens, just, um, turn around ;-)

If I knew where you lived, nanobrain, I'd hide in some bushes and soak you with waterballoons on a daily basis.  Then I'd set up a trust for people to continue my work after I had passed.

Emericana, most people here have not claimed a 6mg dose to be strong enough to give OEVs or CEVs.  I find 6mg to be a nice dose simply because of the speediness and body high with a psychedelic edge as it approaches the second hour, mostly in thought patterns, increasing both analytical ability and free association.  5-MeO-MiPT doesn't begin to get very classically psychedelic until 12mg or so, as you found out.  I can really only think of one Erowid report that describes a person having a powerful trip at 6mg or less.  And I think he actually redosed multiple times, too.


In my opinion, there are better tryptamines to be having powerful trips on.  5-MeO-MiPT is, to me, a nice enhancer, rather subtle and easy to function on, but fun.


Although your description of 12mg does sound appealing.  I may give it a try one of these days.

A fun thing to note, while 5-meo-mipt at 6mg didn't cause any obvious OEVs or CEVs, staring at TV static yielded some interesting effects (bizzare pattern recognition as shapes and fractal weirdness).

**smoking 5-MeO-MiPT**


A FOAF is interested in smoking his 5-MeO-MiPT (as opposed to insufflating or orally ingesting it).  He belives it is smokable in the salt form, but is not positive.  Anyone with prior experience in smoking tryptamines have any suggestions as to how to smoke it?  (On an herb, in a "freebase pipe," etc)  Thanks in advance.

That one is a mystery.  The recipe in TIHKAL end up as the salt...but of course that doesn't nessessarly mean the report in TIHKAL with it being smoked is with the salt.


While MiPT seemed to be mostly sold as the freebase (before webtryp days), 5-MeO-MiPT seems to always be sold as the salt.  According to the 'big and dandy' thread...smoking the salt works fine...but most likely to assume the base would work *better*.

I've smoked the salt plenty of times (3-5mg) and the effects were rather pronounced given the dosage, nice body high and moderate 'headspace'. Haven't really had the balls to smoke a full 15-20 though

Those of you who have smoked 5-MeO-MIPT, can you describe the state of things better?  In other words, how long till onset of effects, how long until peak effects, how long until it wears off...Is the nature really 5-MeO-DMT-like, or is it something else.  LEt's have some details folks...some of us work 9-5 jobs and can't trip very often...we have to live through your eyes.  Ahh, but there is the Rainbow Gathering next week.  I can't wait.  Will probably finally give DOC a spin.  But yeah, some details on 5-MeO-MiPT smoked.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Onset takes roughly 30 seconds after putting down the pipe.


Peaks seems to come within 10 minutes and last about 10-20. The body high and energy seems to stick around for a few hours though.


yet again i've only really done 'sub-psychedelic' doses, the most being 5mg which was bordering on psychedelic, had a bit of a rush and got anxious which has scared me off from smoking more.

The rush was a bit scary, one of those "my heart is going to explode" feelings.  It was disassociative to an extent (never smoked 5-MeO-DMT so I can't compare).  I felt lifted out of my body, other than that, the closed eye visuals were very interesting, and the open eyed visual were a bit mild (not as mild as with an oral dose though)

so, i tried this compound for the first time and i wasn't particularly impressed.  seeing as we were having a bit of a get together and i have never tried it i decided to start out on a pretty low dose: approx. 6mg orally with another 1mg bump in a little bit.  the only effect i got from it was a very speedy bodyload and some nausea.  i could tell that i might have some type of erotic/tactile bodyload had i taken more.


another annoying effect of it was that it must have given me some type of cross-tolerance for pretty much any other chemical in the universe.  okay, i'm exagerating a little on that one, but something seriously messed up my evening and we theorized later that it must have been this.  once the party dispersed, a few close friends and i decided to get the party kicked in to high gear.  i took about 3.5 hits of good liquid, another geltab of unknown quality about an hour in once i realized i wasn't getting nearly enough visuals from the dose i had taken.  i also took approx. 20mg (oral) 2ci fairly soon after, another 20mgs (oral) of 2ci later, 25 mgs (insufflated) dpt much much later, and approx. 17mgs 2ce (oral) about an hour after that.  NADA.  i was, to say that least, disappointed.  the dpt we realized immediately after taking it probably would have no effect bc of cross-tolerance but it was already too late.  trust me, i felt dumb and frustrated enough afterwards that you don't need to flame me for not realizing it.  i am just curious if someone out there who is far more skilled in chemical structures could let me know why this happened.  i figured at least the 2ce would have an effect so many hours later, but i was pretty much at a +2 - +2.5 the whole evening.


any thoughts??

If you're experienced enough to dive into that sort of a trip I don't think you get to follow the standard dose/response curves. 


For example, as an experienced user I sniffed 40mg of 2ci and smoked 10 more a couple weekends ago and barely got to a +2.  And I hadn't taken anything to give me a tolerance for a while beforehand. 


Its just set and setting variables combined with the tolerance of already being twisted.

Just tasted approximately 12mg last night.  This is one of the best RC's i've tried to date.  body high is exquisite.  I can see peoples comparison to rolling since at some points the body high is too intense and you HAVE to lay down.  visually it actually was surprising as it was pretty visual both open and close eyed

how well does the hcl store in ethanol? after a night in the freezer, my sample has partially re-crystalized.


first test 5mg oral. slow come-up (2hrs) with typical tryptamine giggles, ending in strong, euphoric body energy for another 2.5hrs. sex was slightly enhanced. no visuals or mental enhancement.

a couple weeks ago i tried 20mg of the salt orally.  it was extremely intense as far as the body load, but i came to accept and enjoy it very much.  i also had trails and snake like visuals on counter-tops and whatnot.  i actually sat and played euchre and texas holdem for an hour or 2.  extremely euphoric and erotic.  i don't think i will be doing it again soon, it was quite a body buzz and made my eye twitch for over 2 weeks on and off.  it felt a lot like 5-meo-dmt and i don't think i want to try 5-meo-dipt or 5-meo- anything because that feeling is not something i want with a trip, sometimes it got really annoying and wished it to go away, nothing serious though.  do most 5-meo tryptamines have that same type of body buzz?

Hmm... not sure exactly what type you're talking about.  I've tried 5-MeO-MiPT, 5-MeO-DiPT, 5-MeO-AMT, and 5-MeO-DMT.  While I do agree that they're all intense on the body, I found them to each feel very different.


But yeah, I'm guessing every 5-methoxy tryptamine is going to have a significant body high/load, depending on how you see that kind of thing.

i don't think it will go bad, seems pretty stable.  seems 5-meo tryptamines are stable, and 4-ho go pretty quick.  i say it definately has quite a sharp body buzz to it, even at 4mg.  20mg was insane, but not scary, almost annoying and not worth it for the awesome visuals i got.

My first try was 11mg and as someone else said on BL it felt like a good clean coke high that lasted 5 hours (after which I hallucinated my ass off for about 45 minutes). Not much in the way of visuals (until the tail end) and no mental enhancement, no freeform associations or the like. 


During this expereince was the first time I heard shpongle, and music was fucking incredible: terrible and frightening and deep and beautiful and sparkly; yet, there were really no visuals during all of this. There was a black hole or void or something that would expand and contract, swallowing everything completely: when it contracted, sensation diminished, when it expanded the euphoria went through the roof. Porn also didn't just pulsate through my dick, it made my whole mid region tingle and feel heavy with sex like awakening spring.


On 6mg I cried watching the news because i couldn't understand why humans are so goddamned maladjusted.


And as Nanobrain has mentioned, I had horrible nightmares after each experience. My emotional state felt sort of soft for about 2 or 3 days afterwards also.

There is also a completely hellish trip posted on Erowid where a dose of 25mg (I believe) put some poor soul in the hospital. 


[http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=29734](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=29734)


Someone reading this thread looking for dosage advice would be well advised to stear clear of any dose above 12mg until you're very comfortable and familiar with where this compound can take you.

I never found 5-MeO-MIPT at all more stimulating than any other tryptamine - and definitely not stimulating at all when compared to phenethylamines. It reminded me of LSD and 5-MeO-DIPT but more intense. ++++ the first time I tried it.

I should mention since I just remembered... don't take piracetam with this one.  I took 800mg of piracetam an hour before 6mg of 5-MeO-MiPT once, and instead of being psychedelic, it made me feel like I had a bad head cold, or the flu.  Not cool at all.

the lessons i have learned are definitely more shaking than anything ive ever experienced. i got a chance to see my drug abuse in a new light,see it for what it really is. ive learned that psychs arent for escaping my problems like they used to be,but to face them and either collapse under their weight or push up and live a new life. well see what happens,i do feel like ive had my brush with the insanity im so obsessed with,and i can gladly say i feel like a changed man.

I do really wish you the best with regards to seeing things you want to change about yourself.  The hard part is yet to come...that is actually making the changes and being true to the lessons you learned.  Remember that one can only 'change' after time...so I hope in a few months you check back to this thread and are able to speak of what is different now.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

i just tried this again,except this time i took it with my newly acquired lover/girlfriend/potential soulmate. started with 15 mg nasal,followed by 10 nasal an hour later. we went on several walks in the forest and spent some great time with the erotic component.this drug is just meant to be taken with someone else.

orbital_forest, you wig out hardcore more than anybody I know. And most of the time mushrooms are involved. I've noticed that mushrooms seem to contribute more to hardcore wig-outs than any other component in a 'heroic' combination.


Slow down dude...

i didnt eat any mushrooms this time man. i respect you telling me to slow down and all,since i completely value what you have to say,but understand that i just started a relationship and she wanted to trip and it was just the right time. i had a wonderful life affirming experience with no physical trouble at all. i just realized you were most likely speaking towards my last post about the incident,and know that i still have not crossed any barriers that i have set in place since then,and i know my limits a hell of alot more than i did weeks,months,years ago. 


one of the most wonderful effects i have noticed from my spiritual/intellectual AND recreational journey with entheogens is the slow destruction of my naivete and its replacement with caution and a desire to experience life with less drugs and more productive action.

As some others have stated, this is the first psychedelic that i've ever wanted to redose. 


I tried it for the first time, a couple of weeks ago. 100 mg. was dissolved in 100 ml.  of vodka. 

I took 5 ml.(5 mg.) and I noticed the first effects after ~20 min. Stimulating in a very nice way, lots of laughing but not especially psychedelic, so I redosed with 3 mg. after about 1½ hour. The extra miligrams gave the experience a slightly psychedelic twist - I was very fascinated with these 2 round lamps that constantly changed colour, and when I held them in my hands, it was like they were living beings. Food tasted wierd and dirty and objects seemed way smaller than usual when I touched them(lighters, cellphone etc).


On the come-down, I decided to redose again(completely against my personal 'code of psychedelics') with 8 mg, to see if it was possible to get deeper, but it didn't. Had some quite hilarious epiphanies and generally just a good time. I'm positive that it can be very psychedelic at higher doses but for me, 8 mg. is a great sustitute for mdma, maybe even better.

5-meo-mipt gives me a great body-high, the orgasm-like waves as many other psychedelics and puts me in a great mood filled with empathy and fun. Good stuff indeed

I gave this one a try today, my first with this chem.


I woke up and pretty much immediately ingested ~13mg.  That may seem like a stiff dose for a first try, but I seem to have a natural tolerance to *.  Anyway, ate it with a glass of water and hopped in the shower.  about 30 minutes later (after initially eating it) i started to notice that I kind of felt weird, pleasant, but not sure what.  It slowly build up a little bit more over the next 30-45 minutes, absolutely no visuals, none.  At about the 2 hour mark, I insufflated ~7 mg, after a couple minutes I got a nice intense rush in my body, still no visuals, maybe slight color enhancement.


My body felt really nice, can't really explain it (Nor do I really remember it all that well), but that's pretty much all I got out of it.  Around the 3-3.5 hour mark after eating the first dose, I was hungry and ate a sandwich.  After finishing it, I pretty much felt sober, a little 'stoned', like I had smoke a bowl or pot or something a little earlier.


All-in-all it wasn't too bad, but it wasn't anything special either.  I would like to try it again, certainly, at probably a single higher oral dose.  My sinus cavities are pretty dry right now, as I'm coming off a cold.  So that could explain why nothing significant was noticed other than a slight rush off the nasal dose.


I'll probably try around 20 or probably 25 mg oral next time.  That's a pretty big increase, but I also need 45+mg of 2C-E to achieve required results, as **one** example.

Re-dosing (even 2 hours later) is largely ineffective with this drug.


I'd suggest trying 16mg the next time on an **empty stomache**. that makes a huge difference!


20mg or 25me is too big of a jump from 13mg! the dose-response curve is VERY steep! 


snorting this drug doesn't make it any stronger by wieght and doesnt make it hit you any faster (well maybe just a bit, but it's not even worth it since it is so strong orally and requires a small dose)

^ i suggested the nasal ingestion to him,as it has really rocked my world redosing nasally,or just doing it nasally period.i love the massive knee weakening euphoric rush i get from insufflating moxy.

Well, thanks for the info, I'll keep that in mind for my next go.  


Although, I did eat it on an empty stomache, I just ended up eating a couple hours into the experience.  


And you're right about the re-dosing, at least as far as I could tell.  The insufflated dose didn't really seem to add anything, but a slight rush type feeling, but hardly noticeable.

Everyone in my circle loves this compound, and we agree on one thing: the entire 5-MeO-MiPT trip consists of coming up and coming down. There seems to be no peak or plateau. 


If one were to draw its effects on a graph (a la Erowid's charts), it would be a smooth rounded curve (perhaps skewed towards the first 2 hours) from baseline to baseline, no straight lines in any direction, and no angles.


This is in no way dissapointing, it makes the compound very unique and useful.

i've tried it 2 days in a row.

As i'm pretty sensitive and become easily anxious the first times I try a new compound, I started very low.

First time 2mg dissolved in water. 1hour later anxiety builds up, but leaves at 1h30, leaving me with a "I'm different than baseline but just can't figure how" feeling.

The day after 3mg, and +1h i redosed 2mg as I was feeling it was needed (absolutely no anxiety). At 1h30 i smoked a joint and holy fuck, as I came back inside and sat down, I was elevating from my body, like I was 20cm over myself, but it was so sudden. Followed tripping while listening to music, but the music was not particularly pleasant..

I smoke weed only on occasions (and it gives me a heavy buzz), and this time the push that it gave me was just incredible. Now I don't know if I'll want to smoke weed again on this compound, maybe I'll just dose it higher next time, as when I sat down and felt so suddenly different I had a 1sec fear, but everything went well afterwards.

i had a glimpse of what a heavy dosage of loosing yourself completely with this compound was like, very strange headspace, and I don't know if I like it or not, further experiments will tell.

on saturday i plan to consume a fair amount of good mdma pills. i will most likely end up trying a few small(5mg) bumps during the peak of my roll. ill let everyone know how this goes


edit: wasefraka most of the people that have done this compound with me mentioned the weird halfway out of body effect it has. its quite fucking badass,but mightily confusing at the higher doses (damn i was just upstairs,blink and im in the basement,blink and im in the room smoking pot,blink and i dont know where i am,i cant see past the rapidly shifting colors!)

a few details: in my experience,taking 5 meo mipt in combo with mdma is a surefire way to ruin a good time. 5 meo mipt is considered a recreational trip,but thats only in doses low enough to not headfuck you. the 5 meo mipt head space is not useful in the very least for having full blown trips,and it feels very alien and just plain wrong. long story short,dont do big doses of 5 meo mipt,dont do it in combo with anything. at least from the mouth of this wounded psychonaut. the experience had one good redeeming quality to it in that ive learned that if i dont respect my psychedelics im going to lose everything.


im not tripping until at the very least new years eve,and have started to reevaluate my love of psychedelics. if the next few experiences are awful and wrong and full of paranoia like this one was,im saying adios to tripping.

Doing psychedelics too often ruins it all, and it ruins you. spacing trips is a sure way of enjoying the experiences a lot more. I'm sure that if you wait until then it will be a good time. Even though I can't see the use of a psychedelic for a party, or only in a small dosage...

If you consider that a long break, then it perhaps is indeed time to reevaluate your relationship with psychedelics.

I just want to take the time to point out the obvious: you guys gotta be careful when trying out new combinations of lesser-known molecules. Just be careful, that's all. Always keep your guard up when trying a new combination, then after it seems to repetitively work well, then it's okay to take it for granted that it's a great combo.


Just be careful, as 5-meo-mipt is one of the more unpredictable and powerful (dose for dose) ones.

You guys mentioned it took 20+ minutes to come on, but for me I could feel something clearly within 5. I dont think its reasonable to make blanket assumptions and postulations on the nature of the psychedelic experience produced by any one compound. I found the larger doses of this compound to be absolutely awe-inspiring and fantastic with nothing at all awful or wrong.

uggh...im still integrating this experience. i cant worry my friends like that anymore,i just cant. i dont know if im cut out for the whole mind expansion thing cuz im starting to get very fucking scared for my sanity. all i know is that the experience was very powerful and completely wrong for me to do at the time,it was a bad decision,i payed for it,and hopefully my stubborn ass will learn the fucking lesson before i break my mind.

i've done 5meomipt with mdma before and can agree fully that it's a horrid combo. Worst blood pressure / fever problems i've had since DXM. Just take it easy man this won't last that long, and try not to overanalyze the experience too much.


Be careful with 5meomipt, it can easily be fun and carefree or be far far too much within a few mg.

I have high hopes for this one as the two 5-meo's I've tried so far have been GREAT and I have had absolutely no negatives from them (5-meo-DMT, 5-meo-dipt). I am hoping it will fit the niche that 5-meo-dipt could never fit into (but wanted to).


Starting dose? Probably 6mg (after a 1.5mg assay).

You should really enjoy this one. You plan sounds good, start with 1.5mg to test for alergic reactions, then try 6mg for a light first dose. If you like 6mg, you may want to make the next experiement 10-12mg. At 11mg it felt as if every cell in every muscle in my body were being fucked and sucked by god herself: I was horny, I was holy and music has NEVER sounded so good.

Yes, this one really is great.  6-8mg is my favorite level, so far at least.  I find the body high to be really great, very pleasurable and light.  Mentally, it seems to sharpen the mind, almost making me feel more sober but with that tryptamine mental fluidity.  Socially it increases my desire to communicate and skill in doing so every time.  I'm going to be submitting another trip report on it soon... but long story short, it felt like a warm, refreshing bath for my soul, which had been plagued by a minor depressive energy for the past month.  I was able to transform that energy into releases of emotion and creativity and it hasn't returned since.

I found this compound completly worthless. Tried it about 4-5 times with dosages 6, 12, 18 and 25 and all the trips could  be described as dull and uninspiring. For me it produces basic tripping with no profound, even when you get to higher doses. Just a general state of being intoxicated/stoned with minor boring psychedelia. 


One interesting thing that with the 6mg dosage I could sleep only 12 hours into the trip. Also this dosage produced some CEV before going to sleep two nights after without aid of any other chemical. I haven't experienced these effects with higher dosages.

^Although I did not find this compound to be worthless, I did experience effects for a couple of days post experiment. I had horrible nightmares the night after with every trial, the kind not filled with monsters but emotionally hideous stuff: apathetic, mean and helpless; and, felt more emotional liability for a few days post.

tried this again @ 10mg oral (redose 5 oral 3hrs in). definitely brought out the wild-side and i ended up trampling some laws ... probably worse than super-drunk behavior because it was more calculated and precise ... i did feel very clear-headed and sharp ... which made it fun, but i get a sense that it could be dangerous in public at a high dose. verging on a reckless/delerious kind of state.


my ego and sense of humor was enhanced more than anything else, and i just felt a lot of energy and a strong push to have fun. no visuals ... stimulation was more cognitive than physical. i'm going to have to agree w the coke comparison, although the goofy giggles and creativity were tryptaminish in keeping w mid dose shrooms ime. no sex this time so can't comment there.

**5-MeO-MIPT solutability in water?**


is it advisable to solute the moxy in water for measurement;

If one does have a 0,01 scale, that´s shurely not accurate enough to measure 4-7 milligramm dosages;

soluting 100 mg moxy in 100 ml water and using a syringe for ml measuremt shouldn´t that  be quite safe and accurate?

Is destilled water better than still water? How long can one keep the solution, how´s the stability? Alcohol is not advicable because of tryptamins are loosing potency when soluted in alcohol?

yes 1g/l is acurrate enough but 2g/l (or more) is preferable if you dont have 100,0ml chemistry vessel.


Distilled water is preferable but 5-meO-trypts are stable in tap water.


Know the kind of tryptamine you purchased to know about solubility : 


Freebase : soluble in acetone, chloroform, hydrocarbures, ~alcools, not in water


Salf form (HCl, tartrate, fumarate, sulfate, ... ) : soluble in water

There was a guy in the big and dandy thread who said that his 5-meo-mipt wouldn't dissolve in water until he added a little acid to the solution - I can't remember if he said citric or ascorbic, one of those.

Keep the info coming guys. This is one of the few compounds I have yet to sample, and it sounds like more of a fun drug a la 2c-t-21 and 2c-tfm, that a true psychedelic experiance like 4-ho-mipt. I have been looking for a new "just take it for fun" thing since I ran out of the 2c-t-21. How does it compare to the t-21, for those who have sampled both??

smoking 15mg of 5-meo-mipt and snorting 100mg of DPT HCl (it said freebase on the baggie but smoking 50+mgs didnt do much at all, so im pretty sure it was HCl) was fantastic!


at one point i forgot everything i knew then remembered everything i didnt know, seemingly at the same time. I was everything and nothing. Wrapped up in a "OH MY GOD" feeling for hours. which turned out to be seconds.


5-Meo-MIPT by itself is like what i'd take if i wanted to be able to talk whilst tripping, because usually i cant. It made things fun.

How **safe** is the "drop 100 mg of 5-MeO-MiPT in 100mL H20 (or vodka, or everclear), stir until dissolution, and then 10mL of the solution will contain 10mg of dissolved 5-MeO-MiPT"


I only have chem 101 background, that's why I'm asking.


On a side note, I just licked on some scale dust =)

Careful on licking the scale dust. This chemical is active in 1-2mg range (1-2mg of scale dust isn't that much).


2mg produces an experience with defined action. VERY strange visuals at about T+4 hours (small amount of marijuana was on board). Slept very solidly at T+6 hours.  Next day - usual tryptamine euphoria.


6mg is the next projected dosage level (then 12?). Good feelings about this one (all 5-meo's have been allies so far).

Experience is only with 5-MeO-DMT, 5-MeO-DiPT, and now 5-MeO-MiPT. I will not go near 5-MeO-AMT as its action does not look to be suited to my tastes (short and serotogenic!).

i think ambush is asking if there will be an even concentration in the solution, am i right? i think as long as it has completely dissolved, the answer is yes. just look out for recrystalization at low temps, and make sure to stir it well before drawing it up.

I tried this one again last night, ~16mg insufflated.  Started with 12, and did a small bump (4mg) about 45 min later.


Up until this point I had usually been disappointed with this chemical.  Perhaps it's just that when I consume psychedelics I EXPECT some visuals, where this is completely lacking.  However, I've really come to enjoy the fascinating body high, and the "visuals" that accompany it are subtle but quite nice.  


I find that marijuana is required to really get all you can out of this one, the synergy is awesome.  It also helps with the visuals a little bit.


I think I'll give this one another go some time, and I'll certainly use it to combine with other chemicals.  I have tried insufflating around 12mg on some 2C-I once, the visuals blew my mind, as well as the auditory hallucinations..  However, the body load was a little much with this combination, and if figures considering moxy is almost nothing but body high, and 2C-I has a really strong body buzz.


I'll probably go for a higher oral dose next time, maybe even try plugging it.

I would guess you wouldn't see much potentiation from plugging, but thats just my guess. This one seems to be readily assimilated into the bloodstream and across the BBB through oral dosing.

but seriously, is everyone *sure* that it readily dissolves in water at 1mg/1ml, and that it *won't* deteriorate when left in solution?


was looking for ways to measure dose after a solution was made (if it couldn't be kept that long as such).... one that would not require scraping of powder off of pyrex (because of the inevitable loss due to it being active in small amounts.

... amounts that could easily get stuck to said pyrex and tempt labrats with large tongues to overdose on residue)...  *this* is the reason for the question. it still may not be "valid" enough, but that is where one was coming from.


and this was *if* solution was unreliable long term.   if it works in water alone, then no need to bother.

Any substance will be fine long-term in solution if it is made and stored properly.  For any water-soluble substance (like this one, the salts at least), dissolving it completely in a mix of distilled water and a bit of ethanol (to prevent mold and bacterial growth) and stored in the refrigerator or freezer will let it keep for a long time.  Some of the 4-substituted tryptamines seem pretty unstable, but they would degrade even faster on a blotter or pill or anything like that.  In fact, any substance would degrade much faster exposed to the air like if it was on a blotter or in the pill.  Liquid dosing is extremely accurate as long as you make sure there is no recrystallization (which I have **never** had happen).


The very best way to store any substance is in a sealed glass vial or jar in a cold place in the darkness, as dry crystals.

Yes, completely sure.

How can you say no visuals? At 20mg orally I had the most visual and intense psychedelic experience ever, besides that from DMT. Did you really get only subtle visuals from 16mg insufflrated? Was this the HCL salt or the fumarate salt?


How does everyone else like the visuals? I found 20mg to have outstanding completely walking peacock monster yellow green pink tree visuals. Has anyone tryed an oral dose similar to this with a strong visual and psychedelic respose? or am I just senstitive to this drug perhaps.

I've only gone up to 10mg so far, with no visuals whatsoever.  Someday I'll try a high dose to see how it goes, but so far my use of this substance is not for a heavy psychedelic trip, but for a light, euphoric trip that helps me to modify my energy into something more positive and free-flowing.


For example, last time I used it, I was depressed and anxious for weeks beforehand, and I used it to release the depressive energy which was manifesting as a closed loop at my solar plexus and change it into artistic output, which destroyed the depression.

Highest dose was 11mg and I didn't experience typical OEV's; during the peak there were sparkling pixles in the air. But during the tail end, at the 5th or 6th hour, I put on a movie and the charcters on the screen would sink and the tv would rise. It was physically impossible what I was seeing happening and I felt confused and hear a phasing noise, ala DMT. 


I would be concerned taking this one any higher than say 12 or 13mg.

Trying this one at 12mg insuf. produced negligible visuals, but a really nice body high. Oral at 16mg had mild visuals and the same great body high, and also had a noticeably longer duration. When I get around to trying it again (probably a month or more) it'll be at 20mg oral. The "5-12mg" Strong dose listed at Erowid seems wrong, and Shulgin's 4-6mg rating is way off. My first attempt was at 8, and I was at maybe a +1.


Just some observations. Tryptamine cross-tolerance is a possible culprit, and I'm kind of a hardhead.

I'd be first to say that my dose recommendations would be on the low end; I am not a hardhead in the slightest. At 11mg oral I did get an incredible, repeat INCREDIBLE (absolutely incredible) body high. I was surprised at the tail end to experience the confusion stage. 


he's also referring to an old batch from back when folks claimed this compound had a two stage effect. The newwer stuff has not yet been sampled, but has been reported to be extremely pure. So if the reports of a two stage trip have gone the way of flying whales, could we assume that the old two stage trip stuff was impure? Or tainted with ho/aco mipt?


Or is the two stage trip a psychosuggestive phenomenon? ie, he read about it then proceeded to experience it.

How often do you take tryptamines, Obyron? I think cross tolerance is playing into a lot of people's responses and skewing the dosage levels.


Me personally, 2mg was enough for a borderline ++. I had visuals at about T+4 (very hard to put in words how they were for me) and generally quite shifted cognitive perspective.


I'm looking forward to 6mg - I think this will be plenty for a +++.


Shulgin's dosage levels look like a **very** good starting point. Please do not take more than 1-3mgs for your first try with this one - you might bite off more than you can chew (after my 2mg experience I am convinced this one seems to have a deep side to it that people's reports do not tend to show).

^-- Probably too often, which is why I'm taking at least a month off to let myself level back out. I'd say it's about equal amounts tolerance and hardheadedness with me, but still, I don't want to burn myself out. I'd hate to not be able to trip anymore! Besides, I think alcohol misses me.


Shulgin's dose is a good place to start for a safe first dose, but his doses are pretty well regarded as being low (which is fine, harm reduction blah blah). I'd hate for anyone to give up on an otherwise interesting chemical because they took Erowid's "strong" dose and it didn't give them strong effects. And by the way, what kind of range is 5-12mg for a chemical like this? If Shulgin says an average dose is 4-6 then your "Strong" dose is either right in the middle of average, or double the average? ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

I believe the one time I tryed this was from the old impure "two stage trip" batch. Maybe I ahd such strong visuals at 20mg because it was combined with 4-Ho-MiPT. I never noticed any defined "two stage" phenomenon though. It just hit really fast, and built up slowly over a period of serveral hours and then dropped off quickly, unlike the normal peak fast and then drop down slow, it was the opposite, with a long peak.

Well let me clarify, WEAK visuals at best.  It was nothing more than slight color distortion, enhanced "clarity".  Wood grain seemed to flow, just a little bit, nothing like even low dose mushrooms or whatever.  Psychedelic tolerance could have came into play, as I tried this one about a week before hand, roughly the same dosage (little less actually)..  However this last time was the most intense of my experiences with moxy by far.


It's finally peaked my interest a bit, and it only took 4 trials!  Lol, anyway, I do look forward to trying this one again now.  Probably 20mg or so oral, but I'll have to worry about that some other time as I'm all out.


Oops, and before I forget, it was the HCL salt.  I should also say that I've heard from a few other people, that have similar experience with mine..  They love the body high, but even at larger doses, no visuals what-so-ever.

I wasn't implying anything by stating it was the HCL..  If you read up a few posts you might notice that someone had asked if it was the fumurate or HCL..


The fumaric salt being heavier than the HCL would mean taking 20mg of the fumaric salt would be taking less of the HCL (though I'm not sure by how much).

Don't fall under the illusion that these chemicals are anywhere near widely tested. The dose margins vary tremendously according to the individual. That is why it is essential to start low and work your way up.

Hmmm. This troubles me as to the fact few people seem to have had strong visuals even at high doses. I wonder why my 20mg trip produced such strong visual and psychedelic effects. Now I am curious as to if it was actually 5-MeO-MiPT.

My guess is that they were using the alleged impure batch, which may have contained any number of substances but most likely was combined with a strong visual tryptamine in order to make people like it more.  Personally though, when I use 5-MeO-MiPT it's to have a euphoric, cleansing, clear-headed trip.  If I wanted a visual, mind-blasting trip, I'd just take a different psychedelic.


Oh, and I also get a definite erotic component to this substance.  It's a definite boost, which is odd for me because on most psychedelics sex is the very farthest thing from my mind.  I'm not sure I could even do it on most of them.  I can also perform on AMT except that it will never end for me... for some reason that stuff makes me basically numb. :D

DEA resources claim that 5-meo-dipt, 5-meo-mipt, 5-meo-amt, and 5-meo-dmt all have the same color change - "from yellow to black."


Can someone please confirm this by doing a marquis test on 5-MeO-MiPT?


I think one should ALWAYS preform the appropriate color test(s) on a new batch of chemical. This is of course not fail safe (i.e. impurities, etc). Be careful, please!

For what it's worth (not that this one needs much more in the way of testimonials) this is my favorite. It used to be 5meodipt before it was scheduled, and consequently ran out, but 5meoMIPT is better. It has all of the sexual enhancing effects of 5meoDIPT without the body load many have complained about (though for me neither has been an issue) and 5meoMIPT is much more euphoric than 5meodipt at higher doses. I also agree that anything over 15mg is too much, and recreational / socializing doses are more around 1/2 of that. The best route is oral and others are unpleasant or a waste.


The one downside of this chem is that the somatic (body) stimulation can be overwhelming and distracting from the effects of a high dose. Another currently extant research chem which provided all the benefits of 5meoMIPT without the body effects / load was 2CB -FLY. It reminded me of 5meoMIPT a great deal.

I like the somatic effects sometimes, but generally stay with the low dose on this one. There are far better true psychedelics out there that are less distracting and probably have more depth anyways (ie-4homipt and 2ce in particular out of the research chems ...).

My girlfriend and I tried this on the weekend.  Two strange reports to offer. 


I did 7 mg and had a difficult time with body load. Shortness of breath was a real problem, as if I smoked 5-MeO-DMT, but it didn't go away after 5 minutes. Very uncomfortable. Minor visuals, not unlike some aspects of 2c-e, sweeping and  feathering of objects. Nothing on the mental side of things. Overall a huge disappointment. I was glad to be mostly down in just over 2 hours.


My girlfriend took 6 mg the following day at about 4:50 PM. After one hour she felt absolutely nothing, so she boosted with 5 mg more.  Rapid onset to a very physical body high, with considerable visuals. She felt really great for a while, indicating the body sensations were very MDMA like.  She began to come down at about T+2:15.  Became severely cracked out, and puked at T+03:40. Visuals continued right up to bedtime at about 10:00. She was up most of the night, unable to sleep, feeling very cracked out.


Neither one of us feels much like trying it again, but I'm sure we will, just to see if this was a one-off situation.  We were really disappointed, seeing as everyone seems to rave about this one.

Always increase your dose slowly, obviously, but myself and one or two others I've read about didn't find anything interesting with this one until the 12-18mg range. I had no nausea on 5-MeO-MiPT, but I also ate before I took it. Unlike the Creeping Death I get in my stomach from 2C-E, Moxy seems to me like it goes better when I actually have some food in me. Just a couple of thoughts for you. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I think Moxy has some value as a potentiator, but I've only tried it that way once (low dose DPT trip).


Thanks for the reports. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

About 5-meo-mipt-hcl, as it is HCL, will that increase its solubility? What would be the best way to store it? could i put it in 80proof vodka and expect it to stay stable?

I know the 4 substituted tryptamines can be pretty unstable, but no clue personally about the fives. The best way to store this stuff, and most RCs, is as powder. Glass vials (I picked up a dozen on eBay for a couple of dollars) in a baggie in the freezer is the way to go, and for extra protection add a dessicant (like a silica gel) pack inside the bag.


Questions like this get asked often enough that PD could really use an "RC Storage Tips" sticky.

I'm interested in trying this one with Methylone.  I've read throughout this B&D that 5-MeO-MiPT doesn't play well with others, but I caught these two tidbits about a Methylone combo:

Some visual distortion and a slightly darker (but not bad) mood. Fantasy visualizations of music and situations in my head that were very serious, a definite downshift from methylone. I'm sure the methylone covered up a lot of the effects...

Seems like there *could* be a nice synergy considering the nature of these two chemicals, but that's purely speculation.  Anyone have any thoughts or experiences to share about such a combo?  Any suggestions for dosage and/or timing?  Any help would be greatly appreciated! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

On another board a few people were discussing that the 5-MeO-MiPT over-rides the M1. However, on this board it is not uncommon for drug abuse/tolerance to play a role in the subjective experiences of certain individuals.


I would imagine that if you kept the 5-MeO-MiPT dose low enough that it would be nice, but I have no idea to say.


If I combine chemicals, I want to have a purpose for doing so, viz. what am I not getting out of the chemicals separately that I think combining them is going to provide? If nothing, why combine?

I have seen a report of 1 delusional, delerious freakout from 5-meo-mipt and   2c-e I think it is. That is the only poly-drug idiosyncratic reaction with 5-meo-mipt I am aware of.

I read several times you shouldn't mix 5- with 4- chems ( i don't remember how to say that in chemists terms...)because it was potentiating both very much and could be very dangerous.

^^^^^^^^^^


What does that mean?  4-substituted PEAs or 4-substituted IEAs?  EIther way, there is no special potentiation.  Many mix mushrooms and 5-MeO-DMT or other 5-subs with 4-subs.

I've had good experiences mixing low doses of 5-MeO-MiPT and mushrooms.  I haven't tried any other combinations but several people I know say that it doesn't play well with others.  I tend to believe that, as something about it seems to prefer to be alone in the body (other than with cannabis).  On its own, it's really great... when I take it, the idea is to have a mild, euphoric, healing trip, not an intense mental journey which you would undoubtedly get from mixing.

I mixed it with DPT and had no problems. I'd go so far as to say 5-MeO-MiPT gave me the distinct impression it might be good in combination with several other things.

**Methylone and 5MeO-MIPT**


I saw this on Pubmed: 


Department of Integrative Neurophysiology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, 1-8-1 Inohana, Chuouku, Chiba 260-8670, Japan.


Although preclinical studies suggest that methylone (2-methylamino-1-[3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl]propan-1-one) and 5-MeO-MIPT (5-methoxy-N-methyl,N-isopropyl tryptamine) may have psychostimulant properties, the scientific reports about the clinical effects of these agents are scant. We describe a 27-year-old male patient with substance intoxication after a single ingestion of the mixture of methylone and 5-MeO-MIPT. Though he bought the drug as pure methylone powder via an internet order, our chemical analyses indicated that the drug was composed of about 60% methylone (120 mg) and 38% 5-MeO-MIPT (76 mg). This case report suggests that clinicians should be alert to the possibility of the emergence of methylone or 5-MeO-MIPT intoxication, and substance-related mental disorder may be complicated by combined use of other psychoactive drugs.


Point is though, the individual ended up ingesting a very large dose of 5MeO-MIPT alongside a low/medium dose of M1 and so its not necessarily pointing to an interaction, but more likely an overdose of the tryp. I dread to think where his head was at on 76mg of 5MeO-MIPT. What was a vendor playing at with that kind of trick. Doesn't make any sense to me.

Personally I find this one a lot more rewarding than 4-Ho-MiPT and far more in depth at 20mg than a 20mg dose of 4-Ho-MiPT. Everyones different, and for me, this at 20mg is the best psychedelic experience I can have.

well the shroom/moxy trip turned out just fine. 12mg of moxy with about 2.5 grams of shrooms was a great combo, I thought they filled in each others gaps quite well.

I actually found low doses of 5-MeO-MiPT to have only side-effects and not much to offer. Medium doses are very interesting. Never went too high.

2mg was enough to put me in a weird state of mind (somewhat dysphoric at times) and enough for very light fractally type visuals.


There was absolutely no body load present.


Next try is with 7mg but am worried that the soln might of degraded, its frozen and unfrozen twice now, left it outside! ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

I decided to jump right into a strong dose of this stuff for my first experience with 15mg. The visuals were nice and the auditory effects were pretty cool, but about an hour after I took it I started to have uncontrollable extreme mood swings. I went from calm to very sad to very calm to very sad to very angry to very calm again, all in about a 15 minute period. I tried everything I knew how to keep myself calm but none of it worked, so I popped a risperdal 2mg, put on some soothing music, and rode it down to baseline about 40 minutes later. The effects while the risperdal just started to kick in were pretty nice though, so I'm sure a much lower dose in the future would be pretty nice, but 15mg kicked my ass.

I profess SS that this has the best visuals ever. At 20mg I will describe to you my visuals.


Trees were ornamented with all these pink and green mouths, eyes, and dots that were constantly moving. Eventually trees started undulating and moving and ahd things like peacock feather head ornaments and weird elephant type trunks. Some houses across the bay of the lake I was on looked like faces with xylophone mouths. All the rocks on the shore were earthly orange, browns, and green with countless little moving things embedded in them, faces, shells, and were all moving. The rocks congregated into 2d dancing rock men in a sort of radial repeating pattern with distinct green rocks on them. Little drainage streams going into the lake were absolutely incredible, fluid repeating spiral patterns a lot like that one on itunes. The clouds going into the distance over the mountains were tinted green and looked like they were pouring over a waterfall. The snow was tinted blue. Panning across my vision in repeating patterns and expecially over the lake were these 2d repeating patterns of oxen heads. This one really neat tree had this face thing that just sort of popped out between the branches. Things shimmered and schintillated. And the visuals moved to the music I was listening too.

My pet salamander has possibly obtained 100 mg of this particular research chemical, 5-meo-mipt.  From what she tells me, I understand she hasn't done any drugs at all for nearly 10 years, and even then, it was LSD about five times over several months.  


What sort of dose do you recommend she start with?  She thinks possibly 3 mg... and staying in the whole day/night in her pleasant apartment with some music. (She has a 0.001 gram scale, so it would really be more like 2-4 mg with the uncertainty factor.)


She doesn't want to freak out since she's so unfamiliar with these experiences lately. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Any suggestions?

Your idea sounds very good already!  Make sure you have good music.  A trusted companion will be fun to talk to, but you'll be just fine alone as well and perhaps it would be better your first time.  I find the chemical to enhance my social skills and desire to communicate, though.  Be aware that the come-up can be unpleasant but it will dissipate around an hour in.  It isn't always unpleasant but it definitely was for me the first few times I used it.  It's very minor compared to LSD's anxiety, for comparison.  Smoking marijuana around the 1 hour point will potentiate the trip and will make the transition to the full-on state easier and more rapid.


Once you're all the way up, it'll be great.  It's a very euphoric and somewhat psychedelic chemical which doesn't really get in the way of your body or mind at all.  Enjoy! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**5-meo-mipt w/ MDMA**


What do you guys find the best way to mix these two? What time periods?

I've researched moxy at 4mg up to 22mg. Amazing how different several

of the 20mg experiences were. Some very low intensity, others some of the

most sweeping visuals. I was thinking 14mg moxy, and then an hour or two later 100mg mdma. Or would I be better to do mdma first then moxy

I dunno about hiking but... I took 5mg last weekend (and just a little cannabis and k) and rode the local bike trails for 15-20 miles, it was nice. The combo definitely increased my stamina, 5-meo-mipt by itself would probably be quite decent for hiking too.

Moxy for hiking? No,it lacks the mystical and visual altogether.I'd rather go with your original suggestion of 4-AcO-DMT;i I once hiked on Miprocin and it bordered on the cosmicical,though the setting was perfect as well.It was only on 8mg (I'm sensitive,plus was on 1500mg Aniracetam at the time,reached about a +2 so).I will always remember that hike!

If by that you mean "museum level" ++ kind of effects, then YES. My friends and I agree that the entire 5-MeO-MiPT experience seems to always be a ++ (there is never really a "peak"). 


Although it is a good idea to start with a low dose, both myself and others have noted that 5-MeO-MiPT actually feels "dirty" at low and high doses, but of course, you can't climb a ladder from the 5th step ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png).

I find Moxy to be a VERY stimulating substance, maybe perfect for something such as hiking. I also noticed that herb had a unique and quite pleasant effect when it Synergized with the 5-M-MIPT. Rather than feeling relaxed and giggly like I normally do, I felt a sudden and intense stimulation. Not only was my body up and ready to go (it was 3 am), but my mind burst with fascinating new ideas and thought patterns. I stayed up the whole night unable to fall asleep, but I didn't fall into a speedy-depression like sometimes happens with mushrooms or especially MDMA. 


Bringing a bit of Cannib and Moxy on a hiking trip sounds like a fantastic idea. I don't imagine you'll seen many visuals, but if you take enough to stimulate your thoughts then I think it could really be a strong enthogenic expirience, at least a very pleasant one.


EDIT: Does anyone think there'll be a cross tolerance with 4-Ace-Dipt a day after consuming the Moxy?

There will likely be some cross-tolerance, yes, as there is cross-tolerance between all tryptamines.

Personally I have used it a number of times for hikes and bike riding.  At the level you're suggesting it's really more of an enhancing substance rather than a classicly psychedelic chemical.  I have found that it increases my stamina a lot as well as my resistance to pain (or the lack of care for its perception at least).  I once took a spill on my bike on 6mg of 5-MeO-MiPT (unrelated to the drug, I swear!) and suddenly found myself in the air, falling headfirst onto some small sharp rocks from a high point.  But time seemed to nearly stop and I was able to very calmly and calculatingly adjust my position in the air from headfirst to thigh first, and I ended up gashing my thigh pretty bad, indeed!  We had to abort the bike ride and get me home to bandage it up because it was bleeding pretty heavily.  But throughout I remained very calm, calmer than my fiance and friends in fact, and I wasn't minding the pain (until later).  That was almost a year ago, and I still have a really nasty scar on my thigh.  It's large and colored and solid because of all the internal scar tissue.  


My point with this gory story is that I was glad I had taken the 5-MeO-MiPT because it helped me to deal with the situation in a much more positive way.  I mean, despite the accident I still look back on that day as one of my favorite summer bike rides, because somehow the entire experience had been infused with this bubbling, energetic warmth.  I find that this is somehow what moxy does.


I like using it for nature interaction or social interaction because it lubricates my mind and gets me feeling empathic to a considerable extent.  It's not overtly psychedelic nor is it dramatic, but it's a really beautiful substance.  One of my favorites, really.

A quick return to baseline or a dragged out fuzziness?


I like the chems that are quite intense but leave one quickly in a state of complete lucidity (able to go about one's work and other activities). I haven't exactly found the appropriate tryptamine for this (except DMT that one shines!).


Opinions in this regard about moxy?


Anymore reports about smoking the freebase? That sounds interesting.

Yep, I totally agree with Xorkoth's assesment (though I don't know about the pain thing). 


SS: 5-MeO-MiPT comes close to this, yes, although I personally seem to be uneasy with it. It is mild mentally speaking but there seems to be an insidious body-load lurking around, just waiting to lash out...


I find that DiPT and its Acetate ester are the best in this regard.

For me, it's a smooth return to baseline, but not too quick.  It lasts a good 6 hours, 3 or 4 at high levels.  


You and I seem fundamentally different in some ways regarding desired psychedelic experiences, however.  When I started tripping, I was just like you.  Over the past year and a half, I have at times used psychedelics very often, probably shockingly so by most of your standards.  Over this time I seem to developed a difference in my body and mind as to how I react to them.  I very rarely, if ever, get a negative body load anymore, on anything I take (I dropped several substances, like 5-MeO-AMT, 5-MeO-DiPT, and a few others because they feel nasty to my body), on anything.  I also can't recall the last time I had significant coming-up anxiety.  I of course still very much love the dramatic, mind-shattering, terrifying doses of psychedelics, but most of the times I use them anymore it's more enhancement of some sort of activity or for enhancement of writing/introspection (to help me with my writing and artistic ideas).  For that, I use substances that I feel are enhancing, mentally, physically, or both.  I like those substances to last as long as possible, because frankly, it's nothing but pleasure for me when I use them right, intellectual and/or physical.  That's the reason I was starting to use them so often, because there was nothing there to make me feel like I needed or wanted to take a break, and my personality type is moderately addictive.


These days, it's very easy to me to transfer between psychedelic mindstate and sobriety, because I don't usually feel like there's much of a difference except in extreme psychedelic states.  I mean, hell, my two favorite enhancers overall are AMT and DOC, which both last a very long time indeed.  I can interact with the world normally on both (at reasonable levels), or at least mostly normally with a bit of increased self-consciousness, but also with an impressively luibricated mind.


This is the reason I have slowed down considerably, because it was like, why was I taking them so often if it wasn't making a difference?  Marijuana went that route years and years ago.  It would be quite silly of me to put psychedelics into the same category!

Has anyone tryed 5-meo-mipt in combo with 4-aco-dmt?  I was thinking that smoking a little moxy after the 4-aco-dmt peak might be like a candy flip.  What do you think?  Any dose suggestions???

Yes I've smoked Moxy.  Usually about 5mg at a time on top of some bud.  I wouldn't really call it a trip report though.  Smoked, it almost feels like a cross between coke and mdma.  You get a stimulent rush and an mdma like body high.  It hits in a couple seconds, and rises in strength for about 5-10 min.  Then you feel like your comming off of a roll for the next couple hours.  It was in salt form,  It smokes pretty good in hcl form.  I don't see any reason to convert it to freebase.

I have some experience smoking moxy, although the most I've smoked was 15mg.


The effects immediately after smoking are unique to smoking, and after about 45 minutes the experience becomes like the tail end of the eaten experience- that is to say beautiful and easy.


As far as the smoking specific effects, they're a combination of these two descriptions:


1) Imagine you're some sort of hyper dimensional lizard, sunning itself in a warm cosmic desert.   Then a car comes along and smashes you through the cosmic road you didn't notice you were on, in slow motion, and as your face and body are pushed through the road they squeeze out on earth, as your human face and body, skin stretched tight, feeling like an odd reptile come mammal.  


2) All senses are merged or brought to the same level of awareness.  I've talked to friends I've smoked it with, and they agree.  I felt the summer's humidity on my skin as much as I heard my own thoughts as much as I saw the forest balcony view as much as I could talk.  And all I said was "obbbgguhh mannn I dooonnooo"


So definitely odd, enjoyable in an funny way, temporarily disabling, and a enormous waste of powder compared to eating.  (at least with the hcl)


Would I smoke it again?  Only if I had access to a large supply, but then yeah definitely.

Has this been with a salt or a freebase form of the compound? 


Smoking the freebase seems to be a bitch. Repeatedly for a period of approximately 15 minutes lungfulls of smoke were held in and exhaled. It was hard to get it to vaporize also. I didnt get anywhere near as strong a trip as if I was to have taken it orally.

In TIHKAL it is not specified if it was the base or salt that was smoked, but he noted the far larger dosage that was needed for smoking.  Suggested pyrolysis could even be changing the compound.

non-discript white powder.  Pretty much 99% of all alkaloids are white powders in their salt form.

Why is this one called the MDMA of tryptamines? I took two 6mg doses spaced 1 hr 30 min apart and got a low level body buzz but mostly visuals similar to a gram of cyanescens shrooms. Does the body high get better at higher levels? And at those levels would the visuals be a little to strong for an inexperienced tripper?

I always thought a-ET was the "MDMA of the tryptamines."  It substitutes for MDMA in animal studies.

there is tactile enhancement + primal/reckless kind of feeling to it so lends to sex, but that is set dependent ime. visuals were unpredictable / unrelated to amount ime (4 times, 5-12mg).

Eh, I believe in my first report on this substance I likened it to "the MDMA of tryptamines", although I got that phrase from a report already on Erowid.


I agree, this stuff is very blissful.  But you have to approach it in a different way than you would approach something like MDMA, or it can kick your ass.

5-MeO-MiPT has really helped me in several cases to break through some energy blockages in my heart/solar plexus area which were either the cause of or the result of depression and anxiety.  I've found it most useful when you need to do some energy realignment... it seems to really strengthen the proper flow of energy throughout your body.  At least it does for me.


In regards to the questions in other threads today about comparisons of this to 5-MeO-DiPT, I personally find them to be extremely different, really not very similar at all.  Among other things, 5-MeO-DiPT has a nasty body load, or even if it's not too strong to be unpleasant, it is definitely very present and edgy.  5-MeO-MiPT, on the other hand, if you get into the state properly, is amazingly transparent and light on the body, and can become very pleasurable indeed.

Why does shulgin tell about such profound effects from such low amount of material and the entire community is usually suggesting 10+mg for a +3???

I only got to take this substance once. But I definitely was noticing that there was room for energy work with it.


I'm in severe need of some energy repair (depression and anxiety as you're speaking of but moreso the anxiety)... maybe I'll have to take another excursion on it some time. Not in the near future though.


When on my dose (15mg), it was definitely quite euphoric and blissful. I could see how it could be called the MDMA of tryptamines ... but I think AMT is more MDMA-like once the first hour or two is over. The 5-MeO-MiPT never really developed into a full body and mind roll, just the body. The AMT, on the other hand, I took long before ever taking MDMA and my first roll, I remember comparing it directly with AMT.


One thing I really like about the 5-MeO-MiPT though was that it was devoid of practically any body load. Very very nice plus.

Individual variance accounts for a lot of it. As does tolerance. Shulgin had a set period of time between experiences that was followed almost to the letter. A lot of people on BL tend to be just a tad bit more frequent in their drug dosings than Shulgin or his colleagues. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Erowid states also there are people which are unusually sensitive to this material.I'm one of them,5mg of the base being a fully (enjoyable) psychedelic dose with even a short white out ala its DM cousin.Didn't think it is like the tryptamines answer to MDMA as some stated (AET is the original in this camp,MGS is right,but Moxy was simply invented much later) .The fundal absorption (judged from the extreme fast onset) could be the culprit for much more individual variance than on other compounds.

there we are

on my look for a psychedelic that keeps you in touch with general reality

while supplying you the lovelyness of the tryptamine mindset, i came to the conclusion that dosing moxy every other day is the way to go. thats what ive been doing for the past months. if there are any questions, feel free to ask.


i have one of my own aswell. is there any fool proof method to get rid of the gas? once in a while i look like a starving child with a bloated stomach, which really craps out this wonderful substance :/

What are your dosages with this chem? Have some of the subjective effects disappeared after continual use or is the profile largely the same as when you started?


Take care!

oh, for gas try some yoga postures, alternating forward bending, backbending, and twisting should rid you of any gas quickly! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

the dosages depend on the frequency re-dosing. for example:


when i dose for days straight (with sleep inbetween) i raise the initial dose by this pattern: 7.5mg, 10mg, 12,5mg, 15mg. i dont go any higher than 15mg at once. i also take a 1-2 days break after 4 days straight. in the days, i might have a booster (2,5mg) later on, if i have something decent to do and dont need to catch any sleep soon. one of moxys characteristics i figured out is that if i get a steady supply of sensual input (such as music, people talking, tv, sometimes just a person whos awake sitting next to me) its virtually impossible to fall asleep. even hours and hours after the comedown. if i bring it on, keep redosing boosters and stay in a conversation or watching interresting documentaries on google video i can be widely awake  and full of good spirits for days straight. especialy with a uplifting sativa once in a while. to me, this sounds like the right thing for people who want to cut back on their speed usage with a more healthy alternative. 


three more word on applicationroutes: 


if gently done, with indirect heat (on top of a glass plate with heat from below) from a indirect heat source (such as a hot air gun or a vaporizer) smoking isnt a waste. a more wasteful, but fantastic routine for social settings is to roll a good 10-20mg in a 80/20 (weed/tobacco) spliff. if you take deep puffs and dont exhale too fast, you are in. there might be an intense nausea out of nowhere, but it passes quickly. the last statement is valid for any smoking/vaporizing method. but nevermind, the "worst" thing that ever happend to me due smoking was sitting down for an hour, stunned and overwhelmed by euphoria and the most awesome body high. there is a hint of a strong dopamine-affecting stimulant (such as freebase or smoked methamphetamine), but im sure it is generic. otherwise there would be a hangover.


snorting, especialy in the +7mg region can yield similar effects to smoking, but is found to be very nasty by everybody who tried it. the nastyness is is quite a rat, the first couple of minutes its pretty cool. probably about the instant the effects kick in, the yuckiness starts. how very backstabbing. i dont go there too often.


eating, or sublingual application is by far the best. fast onset, better duration, good potency. i mostly just put it under my tounge and wash it down after a few minutes. way to go!


actually, for me the sparkle can go away after days straight, but it comes back just as quickly. even quicker. for example: 

when i was out all weekend having fun, i really dont feel like redosing on monday/tuesday/wensday. after that im back to the source ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) 

let me talk about the sparkle itself: this stuff makes me a genuine improved person at next to no permanent negative side effects. sweet deal, eh? tryptamines are supposed to make you have wise decissions. if you acknowledge the effects, they cant harm you. you kind of automatically do whats good for you. if it wasnt wise for me to do it that often, i wouldnt do it. simply through the nature of the mindset im nearly constantly in. i feel very secure with this special "loophole". while the 4-er series disconnect you from general reality and therefor make them unsufficient for every day use, moxy keeps you just in place. to date, i see its harm potential with regular use lower than the harm potential of regular weed use. its a flawless, yet somewhat heavy (the freaking gas) sparkling gem you look at over and over again.

^^^ Wow, thanks for the info! Thats helpful!


I'm tempted to try this one again...I wonder how it would combine after a half dose of methylone (right after the peak).


Is it a chemical that you find you can control yourself on in reasonable doses (ie doesn't put you too far out of your mind like lsd or mushrooms)?

> I think if I were to choose a psychedelic for day enhancement to use daily as a medicine, it would probably overall be 5-MeO-MiPT.  It leaves you mentally sober, almost more than sober.  Extremely functional, great mood boost, and I found, during a bike accident on it that I had, that it can really help you to deal with stressful physical danger situations.  I had been going down a steep hill, and the grass covered a large hole and I couldn't stop in time.  I flewoff the front of the bike, no helmet, no pads, nothing, headfirst at some large sharp rocks.  But it was amazing, time seemed to slow down like in the Matrix or something, and totally calmly and deliberately, I twisted by body in the air as I watched the ground come up ever-so-slowly, and by the time I landed it was on the side of my thigh in the least rocky place possible and had already prepared the exact spot for landing with the muscles there.  I got deeply gouged in the thigh and side, but I was the calmest among my friends and fiance and I.  It didn't even hurt until hours later because I was disconnected from the pain and found it an interesting sensation.

I had a similar experience after snapping my handlebars (carbon fiber, never again) on 2c-e (14mg). Before I even realized what was happening, I instinctively acted and braced with my right arm (I broke the entire left half off at the stem) and not even fall off of my bike. I had a holy fuck moment after fully realizing how bad it could have been, but I made it . I had to walk home and put new bars on, but still, the people I was with (who did not know I was not sober) could not believe I didnt eat it bad.

thats one of the main points. things cant get too funky. even with not-so-reasonable doses. if i personally used something more intense with the same frequency i would spoil my general stimulus to a point where i would most likely end up very depressed. 


i think there is a point in the career of any "serious" (not the "lets have 2 grams of mushrooms with my buddies on a lake in the summertime" type)

psychedelics user where he either can start to create his reality frame for a better or is left confused and keeps longing for new, better, faster and stronger experiences. and most likely ends up in his room, violently trying to smash himself in the void with megadoses of everything. 


moxy cuts all the slack and provides a good tradeoff between the two

I think you guys are giving this stuff a lot of credit... which I agree, its a great chemical from the one time I did it.


But lets not forget that it exhibits signs of the 5-MeO-DiPT dose/response curve and that there have been reports of hospitalization from psychosis on doses over 20mg just like 5-MeO-DiPT.


At the dose that I was given (16mg), it was definitely bordering on the side of too much stimulation but it was still pleasant because I had it under control.


I've read a few reports where people took between 15-18mg and became concerned with how fast their heart rates were.


All I'm saying is just remember... this stuff is chemically very similar to 5-MeO-DiPT and the pharmacology hints at it being a lot like 5-MeO-DiPT orally with more of a longer-lasting 5-MeO-DMT type effect when its smoked.


Needless to say, both of those two chemicals need to be done cautiously and responsibly, so I'd imagine this one isn't any different, especially given the reports that have come in.

3.5 wait ~40mins to see how it effects you then take another 3.5. I found 7mg to be one hell of a soothing rush. compairable to the body high from mushrooms.

Beisdes wherre I told you about the house being raided while @ ~1h15m into it it was blissful! 


to give a brief snapses of the effects.


I took 3.5mg originaly, deffinatly tasted liek a giant blast of DMT, I waited for about 30-40mins and only noticed alil bit anxious feeling, I noted prob from never have taken the drug befor. Then I desided to take teh second half of the 3.5 totaly 7mgs in total. waited about 20min and then felt tons of calmness rush over me in a forceful yet soothing rush of energy, this was all about 1.15hs into the experiences then I was raided, so I had to stop taking notes and talk to police.


I saw a cop walk into the rgarage adn another behind him saw me looking at him while I was stading in teh sun room with a galss of wine. I put the wine down, ran to the room I had aquired for a few days and hid all the chemicals I stupidly just had sitting out. 


for the hour-2 hours the cops had me there while they searched for soem inconsiderate little prick who was staying at this house as a fugitive (and the night befor complained to me how fucked up I got him when he STOLE some ungodly un messured dose of 2c-b from me (in which he will never now be able to pay me for as I will be calling the police if I ever see him again))


But anyways, I felt realy realy realy realy realy calm talking to the police, I got my age wrong when they asked but cleared that up with valid information such as SS and DOB. It felt ALOT like a low dose mushroom trip without any mind expantion and all body, REALY REALY REALY strong tryptamine rush/body sensation, actualy I would compair it to the after shock of a DMT blast, where your body just feels fucking fantastic! The police stoped me from commenting from ~630-745 but what I just explained was pretty much the effects, strong rushing sensations of a tryptamine body high, excelant material, I started ~521, felt effects by 6:00 but from ~7:30-8:45 I started to get a "blown out the back of the ehad" type of feeling, where I could deffinatly feel some mind metifestations could coem into oplay at a higher dose, but thatw as around the time I thought it would be safe to try alil dank on top.


Over all I love it, I am in teh process of trying to aquire more then just a sample as I could easily use this as a music enhancer for shows and eaily find use in communication on camping trips. This is grade A. material. I saw much more applications for this compound then I did on my re-investigations into 2c-e. but as Iv commented to you befor, this is more the likely do to my ability to get LSD. 


REaly good dose @7mg.


OH yeah, seeing as I had the making of a few life sentences in the hosue while it was raided and I felt just fantastic, I would say yes, it has quite the upbeat energy to it.

I find these 5-10mg doses never did anything for me, I started with 30-40mg (the street dose was 20mg/10$ of 99.9% pure 5meomipt) and found pretty intense visuals with a warm, rushy body buzz. I've done upto 100mg and the only side effect was getting incredibly fucked, and my body got warm.

100mgs sounds incredibly stupid. 7mg was VERY noticable in effects. and visuals, I dont think this one is for visuals, if you need sucha  high dose to get visuals then Id suggest find a different compound were visuals come into play at the appropriate dose.

I wonder if you got ahold of some of the 5-meo-mipt that was actually 4-aco-mipt? That would account for the higher doses you needed.


Did you test this batch with a color test (marquis)? It should give off a dark inky black reaction with marquis (that takes quite awhile - about 20 mins to fully develop).

I somehow doubt that the 5-MeO-MiPT you got on the street was really what it was claimed to be.  A standard dose of 20mg?  That's silly (not saying you're silly, but that it's a silly/stupid dose to start with).  Plus, this stuff doesn't do a whole lot for visuals.  I use it as an enhancer, and have yet to get any visuals from it.

Just a note I got quite distinct and fragile visuals on a low dose of 3mg (iirc).


It was tested as definitely being at least a 5-meo-chemical.

Why cant you people understand that these doses are normal, the average street dose was 20mg of 3-2[2-(isopropylmethylamino)ethyl]-5-methoxyindole HCL thats the sticker from the pack. Definitly had the candyish taste of a 5-meo substance WHEN SMOKED! eaten, tasted like bigfoots dick. 

The doses were personally weighed, 20mg hits from the bag purchased from an RC source who no longer exists because he got sick.

It is what it claimed to be, no one in my city who ever purchased it did less then 20mg, at that point its a very rushy, warm, body buzz with a touch of mushroom like visuals. I dont care anymore weither or fuck you guys believe me or not, I just cant comprehend how you guys can do these little 3-5mg doses and even get a buzz? I sure as fuck cant and im assured mines pure.

Also, out of the many, many people who did one of these 20mg doses (20mg 5meomipt +80mg dextrose placed in a 0 gel cap). No one got too fucked or od'd, many infact feinded for more, and did 40,60, even upto 120mg doses. Its a very safe chemical, I remember at a point I didnt even bother to weigh it, i'd just eyeball out small piles about the size of my index fingernail and munch, or throw it in my pyrex tube and vaporize it, tastes like gummy candy.

I have never once advocated uses that high samadhi, i've simply been explaining the effects of higher doses then you guys commonly report. I dont know whats so hard to understand about that, Im trying to get the point across that among drug users who arnt hardcore computer nerds (which BL i would say is only about 5 %) dont know all this Pihkal and tihkal stuff, they dont know these suggested doses, so they start finding their own, as I did. 

These people dont spend all day on the computer researching effects, they find drugs, they want to get high, so they keep trying dose after dose till they find a dose that makes them as high as they want.

Now, does this make sense to anyone?


You people need to understand that you are the severe minority. People who eat a 1/10th of a gram of 5meomipt arnt the people who sit on there computer and post on a drug forum all day arguing about if 7mg of 5meomipt is twice as intense as 5mg.  They do trial and error. They tried low doses, and they feel that much would get them fucking twacked. so thats what they choose to do.

Im doing you guys a favor by reporting what happens when you do the high end doseages of these drugs, so now you guys know if someone every accidently weights up 20mg instead of 2mg on a scale and injests it, there not going to die, they dont need to go to a hospital, they can sit back and ride out the high.

These are research chemicals, I offer you all research, weither you take it or not its your choice, dismiss it and you could make a big mistake if something comes up down the road.

i wouldnt want to go above 15 mg with this one,the higher doses are extremely unpleasant and mindfucking in a spiritually useless way(and this is coming from a guy who LOVES 5-meo-dmt smoked)....i like lower doses of this chem,around 12 mg or so,and they are plenty strong for me...this one isnt one to push imo

I somewhat agree, high doses tend to move people into god complexes......its not isolated occourences either if an unperienced person does say 60mg they're going to have one of those earth shattering im god everything is here for me trips. pretty consistantly aswell.

Ungoliath, we are people with opinions...and since Bluelight is formulated in the spirit of harm reduction, we will voice our opinion when we see someone espousing dangerous practices. You are describing a very good way to end up with an overdose.


How could you possibly think that dosing oneself over and over again with high doses of unresearched chemicals til one gets fucked up could possibly be a safe or responsible practice?


That kind of behavior will end up with an overdose that will effect massive psychological and/or physiological damage to your person, eventually. Sure you might be able to get away with it for awhile with certain chems, but it will bite you in the ass sooner or later.


Some of us have been around the block and have seen the effects of overdoses on some of these chemicals, unfortunately. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Just for the record, I've never gotten anywhere from 5-MeO-MIPT orally at less than 10-12mg. I don't think anything of it, since I'm a tryptamine hardhead. I can completely see why someone would consider a 20mg dose, as I've considered that myself. I decided against it since there's some question as to whether 5-MeO-MIPT is similarly toxic to Foxy at higher doses.


No comment on all the boner fencing though. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

Hey, I'm about to edit out a bunch of these personal attacks.  If I see anyone else posting personal attacks in this thread, I'm going to start handing out warnings.  Take it to PMs.  Or better yet, drop it.  This is a harm reduction forum for talking about psychedelics.  I would have thought our egoes were a bit less tender.


Ungoliath, speaking for myself alone, I wasn't trying to attack you at all.  I was just saying that the people I know would react badly to even 20mg of 5-MeO-MiPT the first time, or any time.  I am certainly a personal tester, not as much recently but for awhile I was using psychedelics a good 3-4 times a week for a long period of time, and I wouldn't have wanted to ever dose 20mg of 5-MeO-MiPT.  That's fine that you can, but all I/we were trying to point out is that you are not the norm.  Most people who would randomly be looking on Bluelight to research a new psychedelic wouldn't have any tolerance whatsoever, and if someone read your posts and decided on 20-30mg of 5-MeO-MiPT or something, they could end up in very serious trouble.  So we have to post responses for the purpose of **harm reduction**.


Look, I'm sure I'd be fine taking 20mg of 5-MeO-MiPT, and I'd probably really enjoy it a lot in fact.  Maybe I will sometime.  But I've tripped hundreds of times, way more than I could possibly keep count of, and I have tolerance both physical and mental, and I'm well-equipped to deal with the effects in a healthy way if things go bad.  You have those things, too... it sounds like you're very experienced with psychedelics.  But we're not the norm.  Those of us who use them so much tend to be well-learned anyway, and have our own opinion.  But people who are randomly coming into possession of an exotic tryptamine or phenethylamine they've never heard of and are looking for information won't know what to believe.

Anyone reading this, please exercise **extreme caution**. Just becauase 20mg was fine for this guy, doesn't mean you're not one of the  ["some people appear to be significantly more sensitive to 5-MeO-MIPT than others. "](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/5meo_mipt/5meo_mipt_dose.shtml)


Remember TiHKAL recommends 4-6mg, and erowid recommends 1 - 15mg+ (with 15+ being classed as a **heavy** experience, 5-12mg as strong, and 4-6mg as common). Start small and work your way up. On serperate occasions, I had 4, 6, 8mg, etc doses. ~12mg is where it got to heart beating out of my chest, scary for me.


If someone you know has had a "heavy" dose, and/or they don't look OK, please don't ever think "oh, they'll be fine, they'll pull through" - if there's any doubt at all, get them to an ER/call an ambulance - these guys are interested in saving your life, not getting you busted - it's highly unlikely the cops will get involved.

**low doses**


i tried this substance twice at around 5mg and both times noticed a strong, tryptamine-like stimulation with defenite recreational potential. 

it did not cause any insightful experience for me at this dose and so i lost interest. 

it may be more interesting when dosed higher but as i dont really enjoy the stimulant properties of the 5-methoxy substitution pattern, higher dosing is no option (especially not when its 4-substuted cousins are around). 

i recently began experimenting with low doses between 0,5 and 2 mg where 2mg are on the edge of a stimulant dose and 0,5mg produce almost zero effects. 

i found doses at around 1mg to have mood elevating and slightly antidpressant effects lasting for ~5 hours. 

any comments on this?

I found 2mg to be dysphoric but I combined it with weed which sometimes has that effect in me. Not stimulating at all, more like a depressant at that level for me. 4mg was stimulating for me.

i didnt find that this substance has direct euphoric potential at any dose. something that seems to be the case with every 5meo-tryptamine (and to a lesser extend all psychdelic tryptamines).

So do you guys think this might be a good intro into psychedelic kinda drugs. Because a few years back i had a horrible HORRIBLE salvia trip, and now i get really anxious and nervous, sometimes out of no where. But i really want to start trying psychedelics. So i was figuring if this one is kinda easy on the mind i can do it for a few months get my self use to it then move on to bigger and better things.


Any comments?

my two low doses (2 and 4mg) would not suggest it as being a good intro. Anything with a bodyload to it is not a goodintro....the 5-meo's in particular I've tried (-DiPT, -DALT, -MiPT, -DMT) are all really weird and alien to me and sometimes somewhat dysphoric.....


I would suggest a more traditional psychedelic, like LSD or mushrooms or psilocin or one of the psilocin analogues. Those have usually a lot less bodyload than some of the other RCs.

Could you explain this body load to me a little better? Because i can handle speedy things and i can handle nausea, if thats what your talking about.

Someone can explain better than me the 'body rush/pressure' of moxy, but at 4mg my arms were rushing with energy in a weird tryptamine way....not in a stimulant way...just weirdness....it felt good though, but maybe it could be nerve wracking to someone not used to weird body feelings with psychs....


higher doses people have described pressure/excessive tingling in extremities and profound shifts in mental perspective.....


What about trying DMT as an introduction to HT psychedelics? It is wonderful and full of positive energy....and you can smoke low doses of it (10-15mg) to get a feel for tripping....it leaves quickly which is a plus if it gets a little too intense for you.

Out of curiousity, why do youwant to IM this substance? Oral is plenty potent...why not just take it that way?


Research chemicals are not always (never) 100% pure. A chemist friend told me there is usually 2-3% (or more) of impurities or precursors mixed in. Taking a chemical orally gives you a better chance for your body to destroy those impurities (if they are toxic) with MAO enzymes. If you bypass first pass metabolism (in the stomach) you bypass this chance to filter the bad stuff out and may risk your health.


I would also be curious about people who have IMed this. I would guess there is not much potency gain with alternate routes of dosing (comparing it to LSD, which is also fundally absorbed). I would strongly recommend just taking RCs (and most all drugs) orally.

^^First pass metabolism refers to metabolism in the liver.  Since absorption from the stomach/intestines feeds into the hepatic portal vein, and into the liver, all orally consumed drugs are exposed to first pass.  There is also gut MAO, which might be what you are referring to.  Both decrease bioavailiability somewhat.  IM, nasal, and rectal admin by bypass this metabolism (partially or completely).


I'm with you on IM 5-meo-mipt though.  I don't recommend it.  If you do decide to try it, start with very low doses and work your way up.

Oh, OK, thanks for clearing that up. I thought first pass metabolism referred to MAO and liver (ie the whole shebang). I would have figured that MAO destruction would be included as a step in the first pass.


Anyways, I think the MAO enzymatic processes in the stomach are important especially for RCs, since there have been a few that have toxic impurities that are 'safe' to take orally since MAO handles it.

I don't necessarily want to IM it, I'm just wondering about that method because I haven't seen *any* mention of it anywhere.  So, why did I ask?  I am curious about it and I thought it might be a viable route to consider.  Your points about "filtering" and absorption (in the Quick PD ? Thread) make it sound like a bad idea.


It's not like I had a syringe full of the substance held above my thigh, ready to inject the instant someone said "It's cool - go for it!" ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) 


However, I did not find it to be particularly potent (for me) orally at 6-7mg.   I intend to take a higher dose next time (again, orally!) and reconsider from there.

I'm actually a bit puzzled by this chemical. I don't understand why so many people need so much and TIHKAL describes effects at very low doses. Maybe the people that tried it in TIHKAL were just sensitive, or maybe the 5-MeO-MiPT circulating now is somewhat weak.

Maybe Sasha was focusing on the sexual enhancing properties of this chemical when taken at low doses. No one is sexy when blasted on foxy.

My experience with 5-meo body load was very similar to a bad alcohol hangover. Nausea, headache, diahhrea, and just a general feeling of shitasticness. This occurred at a very high dose though(30mg). At sub 10mg doses I didn't experience any body load.

**Energy Awareness**


Tested this recently at 6mg.

Would describe this as very pleasant overall.

Felt as if a light breeze was running through my mind.

Had planned on taking it alone and spending the duration that way. 

The world did not see it this way and gave me 2 sober(ish) friends to hang out with for the first few hours. Normally this would really impede my work, but I did not seem to mind much.

Aside from that I had planned on quiet yoga/meditation followed by darkpsy and trance dance after my energies were flowing properly.

This substance was totally sufficient for sitting on the couch talking, or insanely intense night time dancing.

It is curious that you say this and I have considered this at length over my experimentation with 5-meo-dipt and upon my first trials with it I had what some might call a "bodyload". But after I learned the nature of the chemical it seemed that if I was able to focus this potential energy into something positive/expressive that it would manifest itself that way instead of as weird body feelings.


Recently had an experience with foxy to confirm this and the moxy seems to function in a similar fashion. That is why it is best to do some yoga/dancing (for me) in order to keep that intense energy from becoming bottled up inside of you.

During my yoga on moxy I was greatly surprised to be confronted by spiraling rainbow tunnels alongside the ORGASMIC body sensations.

It does not surprise me that the average person considers this things to be a bodyload. But I cannot emphasize enough that this is simply an unusually large amount of energy flowing through you and unless you (attempt to) control it then you will experience it in a somewhat negative fashion.


It's funny SS that you mention the tingle through your arms... during BOTH my recent foxy and moxy experience following my yoga/meditation I would turn all of my lights off and trance into some darkpsy. Upon losing my mind I would get some of the only blatant open eye visuals on either one... 

These visions manifested as energy trails coming out of my hands that would remain there for a short moment. This is consistent with what eastern mythology tells us regarding our hands and feet as emitters of our (potential) cosmic energy.

^^ Great post... I have experienced the same thing regarding the body load of 5-MeO-MiPT.  The first few times I found it unpleasant and even a bit alarming, but since thyen it has never failed to provide a beautiful body and mind feeling.  A good way to describe it would be a light breeze blowing across the mind, as you say.  The key is to make sure to direct the energy into physical or mental activities.  it seems to help you to direct yourself in a positive way that will lead to a lasting change in your energy flows.  I have cleared out depression and anxiety before by unplugging my chakras, heart and solar plexus... kicked me right out of a month-long depression that was getting really bad, partly the result of MDMA.  


5-MeO-MiPT has come to be a most useful tool for me and a wonderful experience.  I find that rather than inhibiting social skills like many psychedelics do, it distinctly improves them as well as the desire to communicate, sort of like AMT but in a more natural way.  It also leaves my body feeling pristine and the next day, provided I have slept (easy to do due to the short duration and lack of aftereffects), I will feel wonderful and fresh.


I find some parallels between AMT and 5-MeO-MiPT, not really in feel or anything but in what they're useful for.  However, consider that I developed a serious problem with abusing AMT, whereas I've never had the slightest desire to overuse 5-MeO-MiPT.  I consider it a really special chemical, but it certainly isn't much like other psychedelics... not ego-dissolving much at all.  It has taught me a lot about the flow of energy and my ability to manipulate it and heal myself through understanding of that flow.


Also, a little goes a long way.  I like to take it at 8mg and have tried up to 10.  But 3mg doses will do about the same once you've worked with it before and come to understand it, but with a more subtle aspect.

I'd like to report an enjoyable combination I tried yesterday, 5-MeO-MiPT with 2C-C.  I took either 8 or 10mg of 5-MeO-MiPT (my standard dose range, can't recall anymore which it was), along with 25mg of 2C-C, both orally at the same time.  I then proceeded to go to a beautiful outdoor place near my apartment.  The combination was not any stronger than 5-MeO-MiPT by itself (which is to say, it's very nice but non-invasive and allows for near-"normal" human interaction).  The 2C-C was subordinate to the 5-MeO-MiPT, but what it did was create a very pleasant change in the tryptamine, softening all of its edges and smoothing out the body high.  I felt very groovy and inspired for hours.  Colors were vibrant and saturated, as with 5-MeO-MiPT alone,  and there was an added element of 2C-C's softening of the vision, with subtle flowing shapes.  The experience lasted for a good 5 hours, and was very pleasant and enjoyable and light.


It wasn't anything spectacular, but I've found 5-MeO-MiPT unpleasant to mix with some things, and it most certainly was not with 2C-C.  The 2C-C seemed to solve all of the slightly edgy feelings of 5-MeO-MiPT while grounding it a bit more as well.  Whenever I decide to use 5-MeO-MiPT again, I will probably use the same fose, but use more like 40mg of 2C-C along with it.

Thanks for your posts Xorkoth. Seems we're on the same page about a lot of stuff, from what I've read of your posts.

I was wondering what the summation of your combo's with this have been altogether? I see myself taking 10mg of this with some acid an outdoor gathering this weekend... which I'm sure would go down fine, but I wouldn't mind getting some feedback. Thought I read someone saying it didn't play well with other tryptamines??      People often say things like this though so I don't usually believe until testing myself.

Funny that you ask... I was just about to post another combo I found notes on.


Overall, I have been a bit afraid to combine 5-MeO-MiPT with stuff, as nanobrain (a poster who hasn't been around much lately) claims it doesn't play well with others.  However, over time I've found this to not be so true, and lately I've been trying mixes with it.


5-MeO-MiPT + 2C-C: See above.


8mg 5-MeO-MiPT (orally) + 20mg 2C-C + 5mg 2C-E (both recally): This was an intense and interesting combination.  The 2C-E dominated the entire experience by far, but it was much stronger than I would have expected the low dose to be for me.  It seemed like the 5-MeO-MiPT provided a sense of emotion and euphoria to the 2C-E, while the 2C-C provided a very smooth and welcoming body high (as 2C-E can feel a bit weird), and the 2C-E was enhanced mentally and visually and allowed to just shine through.  The first 2 hours were very intense, strong CEVs and some of the strongest OEVs I've had in a while (although all pretty colorless).  Then after 2 hours it really plateaued nicely.  My body was entirely comfortable and pleasantly glowing.  I felt healthy, strong, and full of mirth.  There was a very surpring lack of bodyload and the result was more or less a very laid-back and introspective 2C-E trip, good for a little recreation and a little serious thought and discussion.  I remained wide awake for a long time, but felt I coulod have slept.  My heart rate was totally normal (fast during the come-up though), and I was not sweating in the slightest.  I had plenty of energy but was not hyper.  I was very mentally lucid and like 2C-E alone, I felt pretty poetically inspired, only the desire to communicate was stronger.  I would repeat this again with a higher dose of 2C-E.


Mushrooms - I tried this once and things got pretty intense.  It was a low dose of mushrooms (~1 gram), and it more or less just made the come-up much more difficult and ended up feeling mostly like mushrooms, but stronger than 1 gram would have been.  Pointless really, from my one trial.

just as a meta-comment - I take nanobrain's comments with a grain of ketamine, since he reacts really weirdly to combos and psychs in general -


he really discouraged the piracetam + DMT combo, but I find this combo wonderful


thanks for the notes, Xorkoth! You make me want to dip back into the 2CE world -

Yeah, I'm making me want to as well... perhaps tomorrow night I'll try a mix of 6-8mg of 5-MeO-MiPT, 20mg of 2C-C, and 12 or so mg of 2C-E (rectally).  Thinking about my previous experience I described above, it was decidedly dominated by 2C-E but it was the best 2C-E has ever felt physically before, by far.  The body high was light and euphoric, extremely satisfying, and mentally it was deep and lucid.

I consider none of the 5-meO's as particulraly comdoetable, and i wouldn't recommend 5-meO-MIPT. The honourable S_S has pretty much made the point about them, about 5-MeO-MIPT in particular.


A lowish dose of 5-MeO-DALT might be ok, though as a psy novice you may not even notice much at all as it is very subtle. 5-MeO-DIPT is also ok but not very insightful. It is also mandatory to dose this one low - no more than 12mg if it's your first time.

me and my gf will be splitting a 25 mg capsule this evening...its been a while since my last 5 meo mipt experience(the licking of the bag lol) and im pretty excited to have a dope ass time....im aiming for recreation tonight,if i woulda wanted introspection i woulda gone with a 4 substitued tryp....happy trails to all! this just goes to show you that a chem can treat you wonderfully or horribly,you just gotta respect it...my two bad experiences with this one came from too high of a dose,and mixing it with other psychoactive drugs

I'd like to add that I if you choose to attempt mixing 2C-E with 5-MeO-MiPT like I did, that you should be very careful and start low.  But I have to report that I found the combination excellent... 5-MeO-MiPT + 2C-E + 2C-C.  It wasn't like adding 3 drugs together, it was like a separate drug... it didn't create a state of unimaginable intensity, but a state which was about as intense as 2C-E itself but just changed.  Well, the come-up was pretty intense, but short.

I found that 10mgs is a good starting dose. Stuff seams weak to me. Barely any OEV's below 15mg.

**Stomach discomfort with 5-meo-mipt**


Hey. I've been able to get my hands on 5-meo-mipt lately, and although me and several other friends have had great experiences every time(eating various ammounts,5, 10, and 15 mg) with little to no stomach discomfort, my girlfriends stomach was heavily affected, off of just 5 mg. it made her puke, and then again in the morning. her stomach also hurt for a few days after.

Now, she really wants to try it again, but i have two questions. she didn't feel too much off of 5 mg, and wants to try more, but since her stomach reacted badly last time, do you think this would be a very bad idea?

has anybody else encountered something like this? and if so, did it happen each time, or just on one occasion?

she really wants to give it another shot, but we want to be safe, and i cant find anything on the web about stomach problems associated with 5-meo-mipt

If she got very nauseated after taking 5mg, then what do you think she will feel like with even more? She will porbably feel much sicker, most likely. She might have some sort of medical crisis, who knows.


Or she might be OK, but whose to say? Why not give her 2-3mg and then if she does not get sick give her more?


Better suggestion: find better drugs!

yeah, i only asked about taking more because she wanted to, and i was wondering if maybe it could be just a one time thing. eating 2-3 mg is what i'm thinking she should do, if any. 


what are your favorite psychedelic drugs?

It's due to activity at the 5HT3 receptor. Unless she can get ahold of something like ondansetron, taking it again at a dose larger than 5mg would be a very silly idea for her as she'll sound like she's turning inside out the puking will get so bad

I love 5-MeO-MiPT, but it's a pretty finely-tuned molecule.  I'd say there are much better ones for having fun (although I find 5-MeO-MiPT to be great fun as well).  And the 5-MeO-tryptamines really seem to bother some people, like our resident senior moderator, and apparently your girlfriend.

well 5 mg didnt make her throw up continuously. it was just once at night and once in the morning. she wants to take 5 mg again today.  i dont know how to find ondansetron, but do you guys think Dramamine would help at all?

can anyone comment on the long-term storage of moxy in a solution form?


I've searched here and other forums, but can't find a definitive answer... i've read reports of it going bad within a few days, and others that said it should be fine in a solution for a long period of time.


Anybody have any direct experiences storing 5-meo-mipt in a solution of either distilled water or other? thanks.


if one was to put it into distilled water and then freeze the solution would that slow down the breakdown long enough to keep it for several months?

this stuff was not what i expected at all!


15mg orally + 5mg nasally was completely benign on the body, wonderfully psychedelic with a bit of stimulation, & a surprising lack of headfuck no matter how stressful of a situation i was in. beautiful tryptamine visuals!


sleep was no problem on the comedown after a bong hit. can't wait to give this one another try.

7mg oraly was quite teh plessant tryptamine rush.


someone want to submit someof this stuff ofr IV experimentation? starting low 4mg or so, and then working up to maybe 10mg?


Id imagine it would be a realy euphoric rush! tryptamine euphoria feels like REAL euphoria, not like the fake opiate euphoia. or maybe combine some of this stuff with a low dose IVed opiate for some realy nice cream your pants euphoria OR OR OR!!! even better, IV moxy/cocaine, bet that would actualyw ork well together seeing as how lower dosed moxy is just wonderful tryptamine push.

please Xorkoth could you mention which chemicals youve found to be better suited for fun? 


ive been in search for a "lighter side to psychedelics fun chemical" for quite some time now that I can introduce my gf ever since she had a difficult experience on mushrooms. I thought i had for sure found what i was looking for when researching 2c-D, but sadly my only source of rc chems does not carry this interesting compound ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png), hopefully one nice day it will find me.


I then started looking into 5-meo-mipt and i believe it was one of your trip reports that planted the seed. after reading through this topic though im having my second thoughts. I also am tight on money so I really want to pick the perfect substance for my gf and not end up waisting a couple hundred bucks.

i'd have to say 5-meo-mipt on 10 mg was the "most fun" psychedelic i've ever done, while 5 mg did hardly anything to me, and 15 mg was just fucking bizarre and i forget a lot. but i would definitely say that there is a sweet spot, and for me it is 10 mg. its an amazing chemical

5-MeO-MiPT has always been one of favorites. Very potent by weight. 20mg and youll be tripping over your own face. I always find it to have very low physical side effects, at least for me. Even less nausea and bodily discomfort than 4-hydroxylated tryptamines, which, for a healthy person (who doesnt eat greasy popcorn, soda, and hamburgers all day) is next to none.

5-MeO-MIPT was a chemical that, for me, never really showed its worth until I started using it in combination with other psychedelics. 5-10mg in combination with my usual dose of, say, 4-HO-DIPT or 2C-E would really get things going. By itself it was interesting but never really profound or special.

Hi!


I took yesterday 15mg of this and smoked spice smoking blend, so after 7h high, I felt really depressed, really bad, so I was thinking was it because of spice? Because I have read that 5-meo-mipt should give you a nice afterglow, not an really bad (worst than speed) comedown. Actually I now weel pretty good, like have some kind of afterglow. So someone has smoked spice with this? I know, really bad idea, spice has many unknow alkoloids, and also is 5-meo-mipt.


I'd like to try mipt again today, maybe with 5mg. So anyone has experience doing this two days row?

Any psychedelic will produce short-term tolerance, meaning that if you do it again the next day, it will be greatly diminished in effect.  I find 5-MeO-MiPT to be very strong in this regard, that is, if you take it again the next day it will do very little.  The mental effects are virtually nothing if you use it too often.  Give it at least a week.

Ok thanks for the info.


So I'm thinking to take 15mg rectally and when come down comes I take GBL. So do someone know if gbl has some bad effects with 5-meo-mipt, im not taking it while still high only on come down, and then only about 1,5ml. I really need to know, thanks.

I seriously doubt there will be any interaction.  I've never personally tried it, but I see no reason for an interaction.  Just be careful, as it seems you will.


Let me know how the rectal dosing of 5-MeO-MiPT goes... I've never taken it that way.  It works so well orally I never bothered.

Well plugging it has same active dose as taking it orally (actually Im not quite sure about this, because I plugged 5mg while still on high, and tried it next day again, so maybe tolerance?). Only difference is that it comes up much faster and you don't suffer nausea like taking it orally. I really can't see any reason why one should take it orally when plugging is much much better option.


For me taking this orally, I will suffer nausea and will throw up in 1h, so I may lose some of it and also it comes up in 2h. But when I take this rectally it comes up about in 15min and theres no nausea or any other bad side effects.


Also, now I ask really stupid question. Can you take this with DXM? I know it could be a really bad idea, but just for information, not that I would take it with DXM (well yes, if its safe).


On weekend I'm taking this rectally 15mg and on come down about 2ml GBL, so I will keep you informed ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

bump my toxicity question, im really interested in working with 5-meo-mipt but given 5-meo-dipts confirmed(!) toxicity, Shulgin's suspected toxicity of 5-meo-dpt, and my personal skepticism regarding 5-meo-dmt's safety (call me blasphemous but nothing gives me intracranial pressure and lasting visual distortions like that little devil) even though the consensus is 5-meo-mipt feels pretty benign, im a bit wary. can someone better versed in the SAR of 5-meo-xxxs do some prudent extrapolation??

I wouldn't want to try it... the 5-MeO-tryptamines seem to be tougher on the body.  Although 5-MeO-MiPT has never felt the slightest bit rough to me, I still wouldn't try it on principle.

Okay. Well it seems a bit risky.


What do you think of taking 5-meo-mipt with other people who are on other psychedelics? Me and 2 friends are thinking of tripping some time in the near future. They will have rather large doses of 4-ho-met (30 mg) and I will either trip sit them sober or have a medium dose of 5-meo-mipt - enough to trip, but not aiming at ego shattering. Just so that I can enjoy the tripped out feeling and grasp their ideas and try to help them. Sort of like tuning in to their frequency. Something like 6 + 6 mg (with 1 hour between) or perhaps 8+6. 


Does this sound like a good or bad idea to you?

It says that 5-MeODiPT is neurotoxic with chronic consumption (unlike MDMA & methamphetamine which will be neurotoxic from the first dose) and I can't imagine a person taking it at those sort of levels, that often as is required to meet their criteria for chronic admin.


I always knew in my heart of hearts the 5-mehoxytryptamines were nasty stuff (in more than the violent bowel movement & projectile vomiting way)

5-MeO-MiPT is my favorite psychedelic drug (although there are many I have yet to experience.


My wife surprised me by becoming nauseous while on it, so it's definitely not unheard of.


On a side note:

Although I'm very much an admirer of the Shulgins' works, I'm surprised at how many people borrow his use of the word "taste" in reference to psychoactive drug consumption. Am I the only one who finds it kinda goofy/ill-fitting?

> What do you think of taking 5-meo-mipt with other people who are on other psychedelics? Me and 2 friends are thinking of tripping some time in the near future. They will have rather large doses of 4-ho-met (30 mg) and I will either trip sit them sober or have a medium dose of 5-meo-mipt - enough to trip, but not aiming at ego shattering. Just so that I can enjoy the tripped out feeling and grasp their ideas and try to help them. Sort of like tuning in to their frequency. Something like 6 + 6 mg (with 1 hour between) or perhaps 8+6.

Sounds like a good idea to me. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  As long as you're familiar with the effects (which I think you said you are, correct?)  You don't want surprises to happen when you're trip sitting.  But 5-MeO-MiPT is one that leaves me feeling very much in control... it's more of an enhancer than a reality displacer.

5-MeO-MiPT with GBL/GHB is one of the best combinations I have tried. Its so euphoric that you can't even understand it.

I've felt very much in control during 5-meo-mipt trips. But psychedelics aren't excactly known to be reliable in a psychologic context. I should mention I had a very difficult, frightening experience with 4-ho-met recently, and if they get the fear like I did, I won't feel very good being in a "different trip". But then again, I wouldn't feel good watching my friends getting haunted by demons if I was sober either.


Tough decision to make. Hehe. How nice to have this kind of problem instead of "Shit! How do I get food" though ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

does anybody have experience about snorting moxy that hasn't piped up yet?


I'm interested in trying this with a friend soon and thought snorting might make it a little more pushy in its euphoric initial stage?

Do you have any experience vaporizing 5-meo-mipt? Ive done this several times, and Ive also snorted it twice.


There are some similarities in the initial euphoric stage with both ROA's for me.. Its sort of like a euphoric, erotic and alien like sensation. I wouldn't really consider it all that pushy though. Its a very unique sensation that Ive really only experienced with 5-meo-mipt.


I prefer to stick to oral dosing fwiw.

I'm going to write trip report soon.


I can say that I felt so paranormal, so unreal, so new, so old, very hard to explain. I felt like my mind has waited for that trip. It made me understand myself better, now life feels much more interesting. It feels like when I was child and everything was new and interesting for me. The trip was magical.

yes please expand on the dosing pedaltopedal. I've taken 9mg and 14mg orally and both were pretty nice for the first few hours (like a simple euphoriant it reminded me of coke a bit albeit less dirty). Then for 2-4 hours it was trippy. Smoking cannabis on top of it made it reallllllll trippy (uncomfortably trippy).


I was thinking about snorting 6-8mg??? Does the amount needed decrease if you're snorting it?

Not nearly as much as with phenethylamines.  I used to have friends who would snort 10-20mg every hour or two for days at a time.  They were also really high on opiates and benzos though, so that probably dampened the effect.

did they say it felt like coke that way? I know that sounds really stupid, but I've had two friends now say that to me (one I gave some to they obviously got amped up on it). It seems way more pushy when they snorted it compared to when I took it orally with some friends.

I would say it's trippy all the way, but in a empathogenic way. For the first few hours, it's intense, with visuals, tactile weirdness and drifting away into strange thoughts. After like 4 hours, it gets less trippy, more "uppy" and retains empathogenic activity. Sort of like the best possible afterglow.


That's how it is for me.

^ can you say what dosage you were using? It is much less visual than foxy for instance (have you tried that chem?).


In fact the first few hours there were no visuals at all with 9mg and 14mg.

Vaporization requires more material than oral to acheive the same level of effects. I cannot say for sure exactly how much, because the I would usually load the freebase pipe with approximately 20mg and then slowly take hits until I got where I wanted to be. I was not vaporizing the freebase form. I was informed it was the hcl salt by the supplier.


With insufflation, I would always stick to my oral dose or just slightly less. So 6 to 8mg seems resonable. Snorting never seemed to be a more effective roa, just hits a few minutes quicker. 5-meo-mipt is absorbed so rapidly and efficiently on an empty stomach already...

There is definitely a defined come-up phase associated with snorting/smoking this material. Its euphoric and alien-like at the same time... it's a rather strange sensation, lol... I really never noticed anything "pushy" though, but everyone's different.


For what its worth, Ive also acheived this "rush" when I took 10mg of 5-meo-mipt diluted into 10ml of vodka orally once. I took this on a completely empty stomach. I hadnt eaten anything in almost 24hrs. It hit me suddenly 10 minutes later, and there was a definite rush that felt like the chemical had suddenly been absorbed all at once. Very strange, and it was exactly the same rush I get when I snort or vaporize the substance.

12 mg (over 1 hour), 15 mg, and 5 mg.


The first two caused effects described in my previous post. The last one at 5 mg caused tryptamine alert and some empathogenic effects.


Haven't tried 5-meo-dipt.

I have about 30mg left in alcohol/water liquid, and now I would like to smoke it. But how could I get it back to crystal form asap? Should I put the liquid to oven and let it evaporate or will this destroy 5-meo-mipt?

Wow.


I had an incredibly mutually-therapeutic experience with two friends a couple days ago, with great thanks due to 5-MeO-MiPT. A long stroll along the river bank, and unprecedentedly open and frank discussions of personal philosophy/psychology set the stage for some emotionally-powerful breakthroughs.


I'm more and more impressed by this, for the most part subtle, but also intensely alluring, chemical.

Yeah. Now I had one more great 5-meo-mipt experience. Not much in the visual department except for sharpened vision (which was cool). A bit of a rough come-up (as always) but then a smooth ride with cold limbs and shame for how good we were feeling inside. Everything felt very lucid and beautiful to me - until we entered a big shopping mall (we weren't tripping hard and could controll ourselves), had McDonalds food and went around looking at the disgusting people. The epitome of human filth ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Never any paranoia or difficulties though (save for the come-up).

Had a dissapointing experience with this one last night.


After taking 6mg at a festival this summer and loving it, thinking it had a lot of comparisons with MDMA even... I decided to take 10mg last night to try to get some energy work done.


The result was a very anxious, stimulating come up that was quickly taking me into a difficult mindspace. My body and mind were being jolted by weird shocking sensations. Visuals were present and very interesting but not overly intense.


I quickly took 2mg clonazepam because I simply felt very uncomfortable in my body. After this kicked in I chilled out a bit and watched TV. At this point the trip was more or less a waste for me.


Psychedelia lasted only about 5-6 hours. I did not notice it to get any trippier in the later stage, just the body load eased up a bit (maybe just due to the benzos).


The strange electric shock sensations lasted for about 4-5 hours. They were mostly felt in my brain. It did not feel especially healthy. I also felt some tingling in my extremities, though I didn't bother to move around and get the blood flowing as I'd become too benzo'd out to care.


I did a few small bumps of Ketamine towards the end of the trip and immediately felt much better.


For me, this is only useful in low doses. I think I'll stick to Shulgin's dose range from now on, if I ever take it again.

yeah its a weird one. don't forget its a 5-meo. It really resembles 5-meo-DMT at least in high doses 15+ mg. My friend had a pretty classic ego death experience tripping on the dancefloor she said she totally lost contact with herself and forgot who she was and was eventually reborn. This was with about 15mg (snorted). She said it was scary and she didn't want that to happen to her again (she only has experience with MDMA and 2CB).

I had a great experience with ~10mg taken (t+6h) on ~120mg (t+0h) + ~60mg (t+4h) of MDMA with a bit of alcohol in a social context (birthday party)...very nice body feelings and a sharpened psychedelic mental perception. I noticed some visuals by the end of the experience, not images but realistic blue colouration of any "junction" (e.g between squares on the tiling on the angle of objects), quite strange.


It really eased the come down of the MDMA. Actually, I didn't felt any come down. Even if I slept only three hours that night, I felt pretty energised until 1pm on the next day !


All in all, it was a really better experience than my first one at 5mg...I wonder how are 10mg on their own (maybe the MDMA have prevented any anxiety)?

posted this in the mipt thread:


my lab has been evaluating 5-meo-mipt at low doses ( 7-9 mg ) for the past few weeks.

results:

a) nice mild body stone - some stimulation, very little, if any negative body load

b) pleasant mental state

c) visual enhancement -walking my dog thru the woods during a light snowfall was very nice

d) musical enhancement was a +


test subject is a musician, singer/composer and found this compound very useful for working through writers block - makes me want to sing


surprisingly hungry - munched a lot and enjoyed food while dosing


seems to be a nice, safe ,mild substance at low doses - which I prefer- personally not looking to 'trip balls' or get 'way out there' - had enough of that in my younger years ( late 60's early 70's )


one of my favs


will increase dosage at next trial to 12-15mg

**5-meo-mipt and SNRI's**


Would I run the risk of serotonin syndrome if I smoked some 5-meo-mipt and a few hours later took a therapeutic dose of an SNRI? I think i got a mild case after I smoked 5-meo-mipt one night then the next morning took a therapeutic dose of tramadol. Had cold sweats, weakness, shivering/trembling, confusion, and upset stomach.

I don't know if anyone else knows about the pharmacological effects of both tramadol and 5-MeO-MiPT but if you don't it would probably be wisest to abstain from the combination within a certain timeframe.

If you insist on taking them within a short while I think it's prudent to test if the same thing you describe happens again when you reproduce the situation only space out small doses of tramadol every 15-20 minutes instead of taking all at once and you could limit the SNRI aspect of tramadol which in turn could limit adverse reactions.

Should you decide to try this and it doesn't produce nasty side effects you could shorten the time between taking the substances to cautiously check if these effects then turn up again.


Again: all of this can be taken into account if there's no one who can answer for you if there are solid reasons for risking something like serotonin storm. If thats the case safest is to don't use yourself as a guinnea pig again but considering harm reduction my advice would be that the above approach limits the risks.

I finally got a chance to assay this compound.  I took an 8mg dose (PO) and was amazed at the extremely rapid come-up (onset within 30min).  Some nice LSD-like visual phenomena and a general great psychedelic cognitive set for around two hours with a rather steep drop-off (like all of the N-isopropyl-tryptamines I've tried, this one seems like a fun quick-on/quick-off ride).  I wouldn't say that it was a 'deep' experience, but it was certainly still an enjoyable experience.  Just your classic, down-to-business, have a damn fun time psychedelic.


Considering how much I like 5-MeO-DMT, I would be interested in trying this one again at a higher dose, similar to my mindfuck-level 5-MeO-DMT experience (~20mg) to see how they compare.

Please let us know how the high-dose experiments go... I am very curious as I love 5-MeO-MiPT but haven't taken it above 10mg.  I hear that high doses can be a totally different experience.

IMO it's best below 10mg...  One of my friends took 24mg with no other drugs and no tolerance and said he had a downright disturbing, uncomfortable trip with a lot of weirdness and body load.

I have taken 5-meo-MIPT on 3 occasions. The first time was orally at 7mg, and the other 2 times were rectally at 8 and 9mg. The first time I took it was quite a mild experience. My boyfriend and I took it together, and spent a good amount of the trip sitting in the forest or walking outside. Not much in the way of visuals besides the enhancement of growing things, perceiving life. It was spring time and there was a lot of fresh growth and budding plants. It was quite mentally psychedelic, and a beautiful experience. 


The second time we took it was a couple days later, which was a bad call, as I spent the second half of the trip basically pissing out my ass. Brutal diarrhea. However, we had recently come out of a stressful living situation, so perhaps this was partly a psychological cleaning. Ugh.


Our third trip, which was a month or more later, was a quite strong experience. We each experienced full blown open eye visuals, which was something we hadn't anticipated due to things we had read stating the lack of visuals this compound possesses. We proceeded to make love, and found that the activity enhanced the mental psychedelic effects, as well as the visuals, and was also an especially pleasurable session.

I've taken it at 6mg and now 10mg. 


6mg was pretty threshold, slight uncomfortable energy in the comeup, talkative and slight euphoria for an hour or two, slight patterning reminiscent of mushroom type "buzzing" visuals when concentrating; sleep was no problem five hours after dosing. Overall very light.


10mg was stronger than I expected, comparable to 2 or 3g of mushrooms, but still extremely manageable. No uncomfortable comeup, no body load, occasional pronounced euphoria, mushroom-like headspace (profound thoughts, self-analyzing, etc), and open eye visuals were unavoidable (again, "buzzing" patterning on walls, but posters crumpled, tables warped, and a map on my wall viewed in low light produced an endless variety of perceived shapes). Sleep was difficult but attainable six or seven hours after dosing. Fun, enjoyable, easy, but it had a definite depth to it.

15mg is m yfavorite dose for this chemical. Anything lower just feels like a tease. I find 15mg to be full of animalistic energy and beautiful neon orange strobing visuals (quite bizarre). I don't recall many side effects other than a wealth of energy though. Nothing like the tremors / brain zaps i get from 2c-e. I really like this chemical. Smoking 5-10mg while on other psychedelics is also very very nice. All of my close friends agree on this as well.

Has anyone else found this compound quite amusing for its properties as a "time slower" even at low doses (~5 mg HCl)?


I reckon that its effects on perception of time are pretty similar to what DiPT does to sound perception. While other psychedelics exhibit sort of "light, allround psychedelic" characteristics at low doses, this seems mystically potent of causing time dilation.


Also, it's unusually pushing empathogenically.

Oooh, now I'm going to have to run some experiments on this! :D Time perception (and the plasticity thereof) is very much my main research focus, so this interests me greatly, if this substance produces a more consistent and potent (and thus more likely to be amenable to study) alteration of time perception, in most observers. *adds 5-MeO-MiPT acquisition to new year's resolution list* ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


ETA: Have you tried MiPT, Mjäll? I'm wondering whether it has a higher ceiling for the time-distortion effect you experience than the 5-MeO, as with their diisopropyl counterparts and auditory distortion.

I haven't tried MiPT.


If you are going to research how 5-MeO-MiPT affects time perception, I suggest low doses. It seems to be the first effect above threshold for me (rather than seemingly a consequence of increased flow of thoughts and visual input, as with most tryptamines).

To what extent *do* you notice time distortion on other psychedelics? I'm not sure how acutely aware I am of such things. Actually, I think I've noticed it on cannabis, but not on psychedelics. 


Just checked for reports on MiPT and the B&D thread, and there's not much, is there. And what there is sounds like what a person without an auditory cortex might say of DiPT. Cognitive effects; mild visuals at higher doses; little else. Which does make me curious as to whether MiPT (and its cousins) might be active in some aspect of perception (maybe time perception; maybe something else) that most people don't generally pay much attention to. 


Equally, maybe not: maybe it just doesn't have much perceptual activity. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) But it intrigues me nonetheless.

Interesting. Can you quantify the time dilation at all, based on your subjective experience? (e.g. how long did 5 minutes feel like?) Is this dose-dependent or just on/off?

Hmm... I can't say I've noticed it to have more time dilation properties than other tryptamines.  I do love 5-MeO-MiPT though... fantastic stuff.  It's really useful for me at doing energy work.  Several times I have used it while depressed and kicked myself right out of it.  I was able to visualize depression and anxiety as closed feedback loops of energy, in the stomach and solar plexus, and the feedback loop causes the energy to get stuck inside, which feels very uncomfortable in more than just a physical way.  With 5-MeO-MiPT I was easily able to untie those knots of energy and get everything flowing freely again.  5-MeO-MiPT makes me feel very alive and physically in my body.  It makes me want to leap around and dance and constantly move, but in a non-manic sort of way.

Usually with high doses, but even then, it doesn't happen every time  (or I'm simply not noticing it). It seems to correlate with the intensity of the mental effects... usually when I notice extreme time distortion, I am also experiencing intense thought loops, strong ego dissolution, etc.


Time distortion, for me, usually seems to be more of a factor of set/setting... whereas when I'm having a good time, time goes either at a normal pace or it appears to fly by faster (as it does in the real world) and it goes much slower (or even appears to stop) when I'm in a more negative head space. Now, that isn't to say the opposite doesn't happen from time to time, but for the most part that is how it plays out for me.


I also notice it to a greater degree and frequency with cannibus. Mixing cannibus and psychedelics is almost a sure fire way for me to initiate it.

I think the time dilation is more noticable on a shorter scale. For example, music will sound slower and more "rounded" and what people say may sound hilariously slow and stupid. 


I have no way to judge time passed, and I don't think it's very different on 5-MeO-MiPT. It mainly affects the perception of "time-dependant quality" of events, from my experience. 


It's highly dose dependant. With larger doses you also get the regular "It can't have been just an hour! It feels like I've been to the moon and back" thing.


Keep in mind all this might actually be attributable to my mindset. Particularly likely since I've basically tried psychedelics one at a time, in different stages of my life. It's something worth going into a bit more though, I think!

euphoriant at lower doses


ego-crusher at higher doses

Weird, that's exactly opposite to my reaction.  It helps me address my already-existing energy imbalances and correct them, and by the end I feel awesome.  Well, the first time I used it it made me uncomfortable and end up with stiff muscles but I didn't know how to use it then... I resisted its effects.

Oh, well that's even more interesting to me. It's the around-a-second-and-less region of time perception that intrigues me more (though it's all jolly interesting, really).

That sounds not unlike DiPT. (You've taken DiPT, yes? How do it and 5-MeO-MiPT compare, auditorily?) Can you give examples of non-auditory temporal effects with 5-MeO-MiPT?

Sure, that does make it particularly difficult to draw conclusions from your experiences; still, interest's piqued enough that I reckon I may see how I react to this one at some point. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

DiPT causes mostly a shift in pitch. I haven't tried it in very high doses, but around 30 mg it made everything sound lower (not slower). Also a bit of general psychedelia.

Ah, okay, I've not taken DiPT at such a low dose; but part of the effects at moderate doses is a perceived slowing down of voices, or rather they seem always in the process of slowing down. This could be a temporal effect, but I think it might also be explicable in terms of the pitch and timbre alterations. 


I'd be curious to know what, if any, non-auditory temporal effects you've had with 5-MeO-MiPT, but I can imagine non-auditory temporal effects might be less perceptible, since hearing is one of the more temporally precise senses.

xorkoth, I'm with you...this one opens up energy channels (like you said a while ago) and if you're ready to work WITH it then it can be an awesome trip (this is at high doses 12+ mg). If you resist its effects it turns into a tense slightly nerve wracking muscle achey trip near the end.


People that have done well with it are into yoga and working their body out...people that have done poorly with it are the opposite.


Although I shouldn't make that much of an extrapolation because I've only given it to 6 people (not big enough sample to make a conclusion).

I've plugged 8-9 mg's and it was super awesome.  It had a very mushroom-esque feel to it, but the visuals were more electric, and it is not as all over the place as mushrooms.  Very sexually interesting material.  I really want to try this out with 2C-E at some point.  I wonder how smoking some 5-meo-mipt would work out if one was to do it once the 2C-E was in full swing.

yeah I want to try that combo, I lack the 2C-C however.  I am pretty curious about combining 5-meo-mipt with several things, since it seems to be less of a "classic psychedelic" (such as mescaline lsd 2c-e psilocin) and more of an "enhancer" as some have said.  I am thinking of adding some to an LSD trip, as I think it would be good for lending some different tryptamine flavour to it.  I'm also kind of curious about potentiating with rue.  There could be a definite cause of concern with that though, since 5-meo-dmt and maoi's don't seem to be a friendly mixture.   I wonder if that would apply to other 5-meo-trypramines as well??

I don't get very aroused on this stuff...


I am really interested in smoking it since the last experience bordered on an ego loss sensation (I snorted maybe 12-14mg of it). I feel like the onset of smoking could push me into a tryptamine-like hole.


UB, insufflation is definitely possible with it...but it doesn't seem to absorb very much faster that way...a tad only. The drip is utterly disgusting...probably the worst drip I've ever tasted.

Hmm, Okay, and thanks gaian, never knew anyone noticed me. lol.


Anyhow, 5meomipt smoking, ill break it down


I usually put in a larger dose then i would if insiffulated, I dunno maybe some gets burnt up or what but I usually sniffed 10mg, but i'd do 15 for smoked.


Anyhow, I'd load it up in a test tube, and hold the lighter about an inch below the glass 


(Weird stuff, i'd stick a straw waaay down because it kinda stains the glass this offish yellowish color if you do it alot, looks kinda like nicotine stains)


Anyhow, smoke will come, it melts and liquifies, you'll take one big hit and Mmmmm (I like the taste of the smoke, it reminds me really of some synthetic flavor of candy) and instead of being ripped to another dimension like if you did a big blast of dmt, the whole world, for me, feels like im on E. weird I know, but you get the same kinda visuals you get on mdma, a very good body high, and everything becomes more bright and colorful, it usually takes 2-3 hits to finish it all but its fucking great


the onlything I can compare it to is MDMA (when your right peaking on mdma you know that sparkle life gets? the world looks like that)


I've found you never really hallucinate, but, damn its very enjoyable, its not overly intense (it has different effects from oral and sniffed I find)


But thats the reason I love smoking it, it feels so much like mdma, and tastes GOOD (not harsh like 5meodmt)


Try with one hit of maybe 10mg (Vaporizing definately burns some up or something) the effects last 1-2 hours, me and my friends call it happy crack. 


It hits you right away, and you just feel so mellow, and happy, and mashy...


It doesnt make me as horny as oral or sniffed and its great, I take a hit if im chillin with my woman and want to make it more special


EDIT


Ill add this, when i add that much in, i don't smoke it all at once, go one hit, wait 15min, if your where you want stay there (too much isnt a bad feeling, but it gets alot more intense)


Ive never experienced ego loss or pretty much any hallucinations other then ahallucinations like you get on e, where everything just looks so great and vibriant, its definately my favorite way, same with all my friends, the smoke tastes odd at first, but you'll love it by the second


it doesnt give you much energy if you dont already have some, but its great, i even subsititute smoking 5meomipt if i dont want to do e but want the same type of buzz and visuals


I know it sounds crazy, but my friends all agree, it makes you have the exact same visuals as you would peaking on pure mdma, but a different body high, its a pretty enjoyable light body high too, i get SOME euphoria (nothing compared to e)


I havnt smoked huge doses, but if you do to much (most i ever done is 30mg smoked) the body buzz can get rough


but load up 10-15, take a nice rip, hold it in ,and by the time you exhale or shortly after you'll see what i mean


with 5meodmt i dont find it enjoyable, its too intense to do all the time and the body buzz sucks, this is the exact opposite, its a light, fluffy, happy buzz. 


I smoke it every day when i have it a few times a day on weekends :D


IT MAKES YOU FIEND, THATS WHY WE CALL IT HAPPY CRACK


Ive never had an rc make me want more so much but ill say it again, when smoking, one big hit, and wait, then if you need another, do it, if you smoke it all quick, it comes on quite strong, but if you do one big one, its a gentle rush to bliss

Its a stronger buzz in a different way, when i eat it i tend to trip a bit, but smoking it gives me an all at once rush into bliss...It gives a much nicer body high and visual trip in my opinion, when I eat it, its easy for me to eat too much and not have too much fun, but smoking because it hits you immediately helps you get the perfect dose.


It feels like a slightly different buzz to me when smoking, maybe because the come up on mipt can be kinda weird feeling at times, but this just throws you into the peak and you only start to come down in an hour or two


8mg in a vaporizer will be about 2 maybe 3 hits, If you just take on hit of that it feels equal to the peak for me atleast in intensity to eating 5-6mg, sans comeup.


Its hard to describe but smoking it feels so much like mdma in visuals and body its not even funny.


Like when I eat it I have fun, but when I smoke it I get a tinge of euphoria.


Its in a completely different league then 5meo dmt or 2ci or any of the 2c's really just because I do it just for the mildly euphoric body high and the just wonderful visual effects (its not even like tripping on 5meodmt or 2ci, but if youve peaked on like 120-200mg of pure mdma, you'll get similar visual effects, and the body high feels like a weaker version of that)


Id seriously rate 5meomipt, especially smoked, as enjoyable as mdma for me, you feel good and the visuals arnt too strong


Mind you when i smoked 30mg (dumb idea) the world started to twist and twirl, but the visuals were still no where near even 8mg of 2ci or 8mg of 2ce, and not even on the same planet as an equal dose of 5meodmt)


**EDIT** I completely forgot to mention the mental effects, you know how on acid your all like "Whoa man, a catermeran is cater, a man!" and 2ci your just like "Im fucked but im thinkin clear"


With 5meomipt, It throws you into a HAPPY mindset, Its very awsome, its like an anti depressent. 


If youve been having a shitty day, and you think happy thoughts while smoking, your going to have a wicked time. Even when I was pissed off and smoked it, it still made my mood lift up and put a goofy smile on my face, but if youve already got a shit eating grin, your going to be in an almost e like mindset

Ung/G_P,

have you both smoked 5meoMIPT and 5meoDALT?

your descriptions sound similar (rush + extreme euphoria).

which did you guys prefer?

30mg!!!! That is a hefty dose. I like 8mg as a light,fluffy,"tryptamine molly",party drug type experience, and a few people that I've introduced to it at this level have enjoyed it as well. I havnet gone much north of 10mg, usually using it for this sort of (light,fluffy,recreational) purpose but on occasion it has peaked quite hard & trippy for me, tp the point it could be called "mindfuck", especially since it had no clear resolution in anything like a classic psychedelic "peak", also occasionally I have run into a good deal of body load, of the 5-meo-amt variety, although definitely not THAT pronounced. How were both aspects (tripiness/mindfuck and body load) on 30mg?

Interesting. I found it did not combine so well with 2C-B, well, very cool headspace but a good deal of GI symptoms/body load for me with this one.

Accidentally consumed 50 mg of 5-MeO-MiPT thinking it was 3-desoxy-MDA. Remember what should have been remembered - label drugs carefully to avoid unwanted things like this! This was the first time on 5-MeO-MiPT. Overall a pleasant trip, though modulated through a mind thinking it was under the influence on a sedative empathogenic. Obviously "placebo"-thinking like this can be pretty strong, since first after 7 hours of very visual and psychedelic tripping a mix-up was suspected.


Visuals were on par with the total jungle of colours and shapeshifting abilities of a larger dose of 5-MeO-DiPT. Much less of unpleasant bodyload - felt light and very nice bodily feelings overall. Saw the movie Zack and Miri Make a Porno. Suspect that this elevated apprecation of the movie, which in retrospective was not the 4.5/5 then evaluated at. Memory garbling of parts of the trip with the drug peaking. Got a nice restful sleep 10 hours after accidental ingestion. A somewhat sexually arousing drug.

ungoliath! thanks man thats good stuff!


your description sounds EXACTLY like what I get off 5-meo-DALT smoking it...the body high feels a lot like a good MDMA roll (like those shivers) and the visuals are hard to describe...everything is sorta jello-like is the best I can make out.


^ thats 5-meo-DALT


I haven't tried vaporizing 5-meo-MIPT yet that I recall...I will try it though from your words...it sounds like it can fill the role of 5-meo-DALT for me (since I'm almost out of that stuff!).


Have you ever tried 5-meo-MIPT by the IV route? I was contemplating using my last 5-meo-DALT for IV dose (12mg).

I put ~5mgs into a test tube and vaporized it under a flame. The chemical vaporized, and produced a very MDMA like experience. 


20 minutes into the experience, I took ~8mgs eyballed out, and snorted it. The effect produced a very euphoric rush, I was overwhelmed and had to lay in bed. I ended up being floored for 30 minutes. I experienced very little visuals, I do notice the distrortion in time. The drip tasted very bitter, and burned like pepper, I ended up chewing up gum to mask that sensation. 


I've took several hits of nitrous oxide while tripping on 5meo-mipt, it tends to bring out visuals, and produce very trippy effects for a few minutes, then it was back to the trip. 


I find this drug to be highly euphoric, and it greatly enhances music, I'm listening to happy hardcore, and this is awesome stuff! 


+4 hours into the trip, and I'm still feeling a euphoric body buzz. Not much visual acitvity, can I can understand why people say this is the MDMA of tryptamines. 


I'll play around with this chemical for a bit, and work around with dosages, then look for other routes of taking the drug. One of these days I'll have one of my friend give me an IV. I've always loved psychedelics more than any other class of compounds.

SWIM is on 300mg/day of bupropion.  There will likely be some 5-MeO-MIPT in the area soon.


I know that bupropion does not mix with 2C-I or 4-Aco-DIPT due to reduced seizure thresholds, but I can't find any information about 5-MeO-MIPT and a reduced seizure threshold.  Has anyone else heard anything relevant on this topic?

All psychedelics reduce the seizure threshold, including 5 meo mipt.

If you do decide to use it anyway start with a very low dose to check for any idiosynratic reactions.

Stay Safe.

start low with the IV, but please do report back on your experiences with smoking/IV it! I am planning on experimenting with this one via those routes as well, since 5-meo-DMT and 5-meo-DALT have been so good to me that way (I've only smoked the latter not IV'd yet).

I suspect it would be dangerous as well, as like karma said, all psychedelics lower the seizure threashold, and the 5-MeO-tryptamines tend to raise blood pressure and heart rate more than the others.  5-MeO-MiPT is a very gentle one, but it's still a 5-MeO-tryptamine.


Also, SWIM is not necessary or encouraged around here.  The reason is that it doesn't protect a person whatsoever.  By now everyone knows that it means you... might as well mean Someone Who Is Me.  If you're nervous and don't want to use ***I***, it would be best to say "my friend" or something inconspicuous like that.  If, by chance, the law or someone like that were to read your post, they'd know exactly what you were talking about with SWIM, but if you said "my friend" or something, it's more likely they could actually think you were talking about your friend.  And finally, law enforcement has a whole lot of better things to do than track down someone on an Internet forum asking about or talking about personal use of a drug, and SWIM can be annoying to read. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Thanks for the feedback.


I was under the impression that some pyschedelics were relatively more safe, like LSD, but "all", eh?


I'll let my friend know.

Yesterday I decided to go for IVing the 5meo-MIPT. 


It was 2mgs per ml of solution. 2ml of liquid was ran though a 0.2 micro filter, and 1ml if loaded into 1cc syringe. This chick decided to IV me, and the first IV wasn't so good. Half the shot went in and half was a miss. It formed a bump which disappeared in 15 minutes. 


Then the second IV into another vein it all went in. Within a min I was starting to feel the effects, and also the missed shot was also getting absorbed. I felt "different" and noticed a rushing feeling. This was IVing 4mgs total.  


Within 15 minutes I was completely "floored" like I was peaking on a very high dose of MDMA. I was just flat out laying on the floor in pure bliss starting at the ceiling, and experiencing extreme euphoria. It was like peaking on MDMA without the love/empathy feeling and the buzz is a bit different. I saw visuals on the ceiling of the wall but not too intense. I laid on the floor for an hour. 


After a little over an hour I decided to inject another cc, which is 2mgs for a booster shot. Once I got the register I pushed the plunger I instantly felt the rush, and starting hallucinating visuals intensely before I pulled the plunger out. I then started shaking, because the trip became very intense, and the rushing sensation was a bit overwheliming. I went to lay down on the floor then curled up into a ball for 10 minutes to ride out of the intense part of the trip out. I ended up feeling very euphoric for the next hour and a half, and enjoyed my trip. 


An hour and a half later, I decided to take a 1mg booster shot which was IVing 1/2 a cc. I felt a mild rush, but didn't really add much to the overall trip, or experience, I gave up after IVing 1/2 a cc. 


The effects wore off 4 hours later and had a very nice afterglow effect. In the morning i felt with a wonderful afterglow the sun was rising and it was the most beaurtyful thing in the world. I drove home popped a sleeping pill and slept in until the evening. 


I wished everyone else who was at the party IVed this drug instead of doing IV opiates, the feeling is so amazing. 


During the whole experience a total of 7mgs was IVed.

sick candyraver


sounds more potent than we thought


good on you for starting low and titrating up


could you describe the effects with more detail other than MDMA-like (that could mean so many different things to different people)?


What did it do to your muscles? What about your ocular (eye) muscles? Did you get nystagmus? etc etc.


Sounds like the first shot was obviously skin-popped probably went through the vein. Did she register before plunging? You really ought to learn how to IV yourself if the people that are IVing for you are missing shots.


Also, I think there's no reason to make the solution that unconcentrated. What kind of rigs are you using gauge-wise? I suggest the half CC BD ultrafine 30g needles for IVing yourself. They're totally easy to hold yourself (they're a bit smaller) and you really never need more than half a CC for tryptamines.

Hi guys, has anyone tried smoking 5-MeO-MiPT using aluminum foil with a flame below and a straw to inhale the vapors/smoke? Would those normal lighters or "blow-torch" type lighters be better suited for this?  Also, is there a considerable amount of smoke?


Please advise. Thanks!

I bet a normal lighter would work. Foil lets a lot of heat through to the material. Why don't you get a little bit and try it?


How much smoke there is depends on how much material you use. For 5-meo's you don't need a lot. I would start with like 5-10mg to get a feel for it. Then jump in with 10-15 for a possibly much stronger trip. That should be about where you stay maybe go to 20-25 if you want a real strong overwhelming rush.

Should i apply gradual heat under the foil until it starts to vaporize slowly then inhale or should i hold the flame closer while inhaling at the same time?


TIA!

its kinda tricky/hard to explain.


Each chem vaporizes at a different point.


The best way is to make a bowl (like for eating bowl) shaped device out of the foil (single layer thickness for the base) and then put the drugs in the bottom.


Then get a straw and line it up near (about an inch or two above) the drugs. Then slowly apply flame. Ideally you start inhaling pretty sharply RIGHT as it busts into vapor. Then you won't lose any that won't be sucked up by the straw. You know you're timing it right when you see a little vapor rise above the straw but then with the force of your inhale it gets dragged back down and into the straw (and in your lungs).

a clear glass bulb vaporizer is less likely to lose smoke, is more effective and isn't likely to give you any toxic fumes off of the aluminum.

In terms of a lightbulb vaporizer. Does it matter how long the vapour is left in the bulb after vaporizing the material, or should it be sucked it straight away?

Actually industrially produced glass light bulbs are one of the least safe things that you can smoke out of -- just very dirty and toxic. Conversely, aluminum vaporizes at an extremely high temperature thus is perfectly safe to smoke off of.

Personally, I would use a test tube if possible.


You won't lose material, it's easy to gauge when substances melt/vaporize, the surface area drugs can be on is relatively small, thus easy to focus flame (or heat, if you don't want to apply direct flame) on the entire sample.


I have never been lead astray with the test tube!


They are also clean (assuming you get them new, or clean them), and no toxic effects.  


Just make sure that you don't have any other residual chemicals (especially flammable laboratory/carcinogenic chemicals) in there. 


This method works well with moxy.

This method works with 5-meo-DMT, to an extent.  5-meo generally creeps away from flame, and test tubes make it a bit easier to chase.


Don't use foil, it's connected with Alzheimer's!  It is difficult to absolutely prove this, but research leans towards Alzheimer's being connected with smoking foil.


I wouldn't use a lightbulb either, but that's just my personal preference.

in order for aluminum to vaporize it must get to VERY hot temperatures...way outside the bounds of what a little ordinary lighter could ever create. You need not worry about inhaling aluminum (but maybe think about your deodorant!)

Does anyone have any experience with using 5meo-mipt everyday? What are the long term effects? 

There has been times where I would trip for 4 days in a row, then lay off of it. 


Then there's other times where I just wanna do this drug everyday for a week, because it tends to make me happy, and send me to a happy world. 


I have prepped 25 doses to IV, I usually IV about 4mgs, and just wondering if I can just use this drug everyday, just like how people smoke weed everyday....


I've made this same mistake with MDMA and you can't really use MDMA everyday....

I don't recommend using any psychedelic every day.  Some, like AMT, I have done this with and ended up in a bad place similar to MDMA abuse.  With 5-MeO-MiPT, whenever I take it too often (even two days ina row), all the times after the first just feel like a light stimulation with none of that magic.  Basically, it's useless to try to push it too far.  All psychedelics build tolerance very quickly so it's not a good idea to use them multiple days in a row, but some build tolerance more quickly than others, it seems, and 5-MeO-MiPT seems to build tolerance to itself very rapidly.


When I've overused 5-MeO-MiPT, I do not seem to get any serious negative lasting effects, just the inability to have a good trip on it.  However, I have in general way overused psychedelics, particularly in 2006-2007.  I tripped multiple times per week that whole period of time, and the result is that it's hard for me to have good trips even now when I no longer do that... even after 4.5 months off at the beginning of 2008.  It's called "loss of magic" and it can happen, and what causes it is tripping too often with too little of a break between times.


Better to save it for special occasions.  I know it's tempting to use them more often since they're so much fun and such great substances with few physical side-effects (for many anyway), but it's not good to overuse them.  Really, it's not good to use any drug every day (even weed as you mentioned), but some drugs will give you pretty much the same effects every day and continue to work.  Not so with psychedelics.  There's only so much you can take, and you don't want to reach that point.

In my experience, frequent use of 5-MeO-MIPT results in some rather obvious visual distortion for a lengthy period of time, at least a week.  After using it a few times without enough time between, it has made these visual anomalies appear even on very lowish doses.  That is all.

You cannot safely use this drug every day, CR, you should know that. You'll end up destabilizing your personality and you will physically wear your body out (I suspect 5-meo-MIPT releases monoamines as well so you'll get depletion after awhile of using which will result in fatigue, lethargy, depression, etc).


Can you moderate your usage to once a week? Even this is a lot but it will be much better for you than every day obviously.


You can pretty much permanently destroy your ability to get satisfaction/benefit from these drugs by bombarding yourself with them in a short period of time.

Yes I'll limit the use to once a week then. 


I just have to find different drugs to fill in the gaps of my other 6 days of the week. For some reason I just wanted to be high everyday. 


This one time I've binged on 5meo-mipt for 3 days in a row, by the third day the effects were barely noticable. I stoppped using it for a week.


This other time I did this drug everyday for 4 days in a row, I gave up after my 4th day, because even after I redosed with double the dose I barely felt anything. I just found another drug to get high on, then on a different day I use another drug to stay high. I just wished i can do this drug everyday, hell I wished I can roll on MDMA everyday.

**snorting 5-meo-mipt?**


first off, sorry mods to not put this in the Moxy B+D, but I wanted to make sure this got noticed, feel free to merge or whatever.


/// I was just wondering if anyone has had any luck snorting (what an ugly word, lol) this compound. Is dosage the same as as oral or less? How would you compare effects of 5-meo-mipt sniffed as oral? duration the same and everything? 


Do discuss ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

For me, snorting 5-MeO-MIPT is the preferred method of administration. You come up faster but otherwise it's the same.

Does anyone know if this drug mixes well with alcohol? I'm going to hit up a rave this weekend, pop a couple of mgs of moxy, then going along and taking many shots of vodka. 

Sometimes I drink while rolling on MDMA, and i wanna drink for the same reason as well.

bad idea, especially with hard liquor, especially with dancing.  just way too easy to over do it.  I would refrain.

^ True dat.


You sound a lil similar to me in some ways, Candy - never want to come down. My use of psyches probably spills over into *ab*use more than I'd like to think sometimes, but am gradually realising that it really is pointless. "The magic" really does fade and the most profound and beautiful states can end up being just a light pick-me-up. Is rather pointless and somewhat wasteful.


I'm a bit of a hypocrite on that one sometimes, mind ![:o](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f631.png)

At the risk of becoming monotonous, true dat too :D


Think a lot of it is something that you have to discover for yourself, but if it helps - even to serve as a less than ideal example of how reasonable use can drift into unreasonable use sometimes... Absusive use of psyches may be less obvious than the equivalent use of - for example, opiates, weed or alcohol - but it certainly happens. I would presume that psyche abuse would be just as unhealthy.

Yeah... psych abuse feels so right that it's hard to detect for a while.  At least that was the case with me.  Abusing "hard drugs" tends to feel good for the high itself, but you're well aware of the negativity it brings to you.  It's hard to feel like going for days on meth is harmless, for example.  But you can trip quite a lot and once you're used to it, it will feel nothing but good.  Until at some point it catches up to you.  I trip almost every weekend now.  I feel comfortable with that rate of usage... I take responsible dosages and practice responsible actions on them.  I categorically stay away from tripping during the week now (unless I'm on vacation or something and an opportunity comes up of course).  But I used to trip a lot more often in 2006-2007, and although I brought away from good from it (hell, during that period of time I first became aware of the universal love), ultimately it was destructive to me and it was certainly akin to beating my head against a wall repeatedly.

**How to smoke 5-meo-mipt?**


Hello, I've come across a reliable source for very good quality 5-meo-mipt, and I would like to try smoking it, as i've read that this route of administration is possible. Any tips? can anyone tell me how best to do this? should i use a meth/vapouriser pipe? must i convert it to freebase, or is the hcl salt smokable as well>? any help is greatly appreciated, thanks in advance.

its smokeable as it is.

Seriously, though if you arent used to it,

Just put a tiny little pinch on some weed in a bowl, you dont regularly smoke out of

and just take a huge ass haul, for your first time.


the "oh god" effect it quite profound and happens at very minimal doses especially if you arent used to it.


I just started experimenting with it myself, and 10mg smoked on a small bowl of marijuana in one toke was terrifyingly strong.


I've tried it 4 other times sense. 

between 7 - 12 

2 of those times with a lightbulb.

The lightbulb makes it a HELL of alot stronger...

^ he (or she) has got the right idea. Sprinkle it on top of some marijuana and toke slowly (don't just torch it, slowly advance the heat of the lighter toward the drug). Breathe in deep and hold in like 5-10 seconds. Big tokes. Two should take you out of here.

Why would you WANT to smoke it? Oral and sublingual work just fine. If you aren't satisfied with the intensity, increase the dose. The come-up is just as intense from oral, for me, as it is from smoked.


20mg sublingual can have you out of body for hours.

This is exactly what i do. For smoking 5-meo-mipt.


Step One: Weigh 15mg on a scale.


Step Two: Seperate it into 3x5 mg piles.


Step Three: Put Half a bowl of Cannibis into a Pipe.


Not a Step:*i smoke out of an elephant pipe, lol*


Step Four : then put 5mg of 5-meo-mipt onto the fresh weed. 


Step Five: Take a HUGE Toke and Hold it for 30 seconds


Step 5.5/6: Hold it, and while holding it, put the next 5mg pile onto the weedy ashes.


Exhale if you want to?


Step Seven: Smoke the next toke just as big and heartily as you did the first one, and HOLD IT


if you need more, which i really doubt you will, then go ahead and put that extra 5mg onto the bowl, but anything after that gets pretty visual!

smoking it really does change the trip around too. Same goes for IV.


IVing 5-meo's is my preferred route of administration now. Quick and clean. Bright sharp euphoria. The dose is ridiculously small compared to oral though. like 1/10th even.

By all accounts I've heard, smoked 5-MeO-MiPT makes the intensity and duration more like DMT... basically a different effect entirely.

The duration maybe, but not the intensity. It's just as intense sublingually/orally if you increase the dose appropriately.

I dunno, i've found this stuff to be every bit as powerful and spiritual as a solid blast of 5-meo-dmt.


With the main difference being that 15mg smoked, for me, lasts at least 3 - 4 hours.

with a euphoric afterglow that lasts all day, and sometimes i'll even wake up the next day, with the same afterglow.


The Rush and Euphoria of 5-meo-dmt, are all there.

But there is a much more livid, alive, and less frightening emotional state attached to it.


it does appear to be a bit of a beligerent substance though, 

lol, it makes me kind of run my mouth...lol

i've found this stuff to be alot better than mdma with fewer side effects.


Mdma: Sweating, Twitching eyes, One eye on the verge of closing. Inability to shutup.

Inability to "think for yourself" i find that mdma is extremely pushy in that regard.


5-meo-mipt. Sweaty Palms, Normal Eyes, Undialated pupils even when hallucinating. 

Deeping of the thoughts, but at least those thoughts are your thoughts.

its like this, 


If MDMA is going to give me a "revelation" i find that the revelations occur one after, another, after another, almost endlessly. You don't have the time to "stop and pause" and reflect back on it. 


5-meo-mipt: it terms of revelations, just seems to be like coating the pistons of my mind, in gold. I haven't found very many negatives or dark places about  this substance.

Wow, just wow


I never tried a synthetic tryptamine before last night, but I'm unsure if it was 5-MeO-DiPT or

5-MeO-MiPT. It was sold through some people as the former but the guy that gave it to me

knows the character/properties of it and really believed this to be the latter.


The dose I took was 4 mg per oral (dissolved in 20% alcohol soln) while already under in-

fluence of ketamine, then around T=0:45 - T=1:00 another 4 mg.

The body load was just amazingly comfortable! It compensated for ketamines vague effects on proprioception and left me totally relaxed and lush. The key description for the whole night came to me as "AMAZING"!!!

I think it does has a reptilian feel to it, combining it with nitrous weed and ketamine I had extraordinary trips about being some alien biomachine - understandably I was baffled. At some points I was a bit overwhelmed but at least the first part I felt quite lucid - a perfect mix of tripping hard and still having enough contact with reality to not freak the hell out.

There is something about the tryptamine feel I like intensely, it has an energy vibration but it's not like a typical body-based stimulation. I thought PEAs were the shit but I feel tryptamines have the potency to give you more spiritually and wild trips that require pretty hefty doses of 2C that usually go with a certain body load and stimulation.


Tryptamines FTW!!!!

All in all the effects certainly lasted for 6 hours,  personally I guess it's the 5-MeO-MiPT but unless I get it tested I can't know for sure... I want to though so I can restock eventually :D

Don't think they have the reference sample for it in the labs unfortunately, so that may be impossible to find out.

oddly, i still havn't consumed 5-meo-mipt orally.

I've only smoked all different levels.


It is incredibly comfortable. There isn't a rush, just a "quickening and deepening" of the thoughts. You aren't sweating or spastic, ala MDMA

Can't wait to feel so elated again. If mushrooms are earthy fairytale gnome-ish entities then 5-MeO-MiPT feels like a giddy alien, actually I feel like that myself. Saw visualisations of my alien physiological makeup and evolution! And it gives an afterglow not a hangover in the least. Fantastic!

were you listening to any music at the time.


I've found that there are really only hallucinations to 5-meo-mipt if there is music on.


I've had some pretty intense psychedelic experience when i smoked 5-meo-mipt with dipt.


I burned them both out of the same lightbulb, and i was instantly hit with an intense rush of very organic looking hallucinations. Everywhere, and all around me, and it lasted about 1 hour.


I believe my, lightbulb vaporization technique made some sort of drugged out moxy foxy combo. even though the Dipt was straight freebase. I think that magical like 5-meo group did the trick in uniting the two into one brilliantly beautiful mental display.

Yes! I was playing IDM music and it really guided the trip. Normally I very much prefer to have music but it might have been more significant this time. Mind you, the pure R-ketamine I consumed probably launched this trip forward as well...


I will not be vaporizing or smoking this stuff, perhaps I'll try some DMT while on it but that is "all" :D


Got more auditive effects as well than I'm used to with PEAs, it was a roaring echo of persistent PC fan sounds facilitated by ketamine and nitrous but there was a little something extra: like a frame-delay of what I was hearing, I found it 50% interesting and 50% annoying.


The tracks that truly stand out in this trip were:

Phylum Sinter - The Pendulum Swings ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Secede - Vega Libre


the latter truly made me feel like I was on an alien boat-safari cruising down the Amazon ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

that sounds closer to foxy than moxy.

Moxy doesn't have the roaring echos that Dipt does.

Lucky man you are!!

Moxy has a strong sound synesthesia.

with almost none of the sound distortion.

Well yeah but ketamine and nitrous do have the roaring echoes so I'm still as unsure as I ever was. Besides, 8 mg of 5-MeO-DiPT should not be *that* potent right? I mean I believe I'm pretty sensitive to tryptamines when I look at mushroom and DMT response....


Odd shit right here, but indeed I do feel lucky :D

12.5mg of 5-MeO-DIPT orally for me was every bit as intense as 150ug or 200ug of LSD, plus it caused a full blown trip-long panic attack.

No man, don't underestimate the potency of 5-meo tryptamines.

basically 5-meo-mipt is active at 1mg. 

You will feel a lightening of all the senses.


same thing with 5-meo-dipt. 


the drastic difference is, 

DIPT

And MIPT


Respectively without the little 5-methoxy group 

require doses of almost 100mg or more, 

Anywhere between 80+

required for a ++ 


the 5-meo group i've noticed has a tendancy to make whatever they are attached to at least 5x as potent. Generally they arent anywhere near as visual.


Prime example that being 5-meo-dmt. It's almost completely devoid of color and visuals. 


I honestly think you did 5-meo-dipt. Did sounds and peoples voices have more "bass" to them. 


Its not a bad thing at all if you did foxy over moxy, i just wish, i could get my hands on some lolol.


Smoking 5-meo-mipt is actually incredibly fantastic, like there is an very unique quality to it which very few other drugs have.


It honestly possesses the dissassociative power of ketamine, with the euphoria and thought expansiveness of mdma, with Mild LSDesque visuals.

and the closed eye visuals are something to write home about.


like i said above


15mg split into 5mg piles Smoked 5 mg in one puff at a time, for 3 times and held each time, is incredibly epic, it's way more "personal" than 5-meo-dmt or DPT with alot less terror, and almost no zero body tremor.

5-MeO-DMT is not devoid of visuals for me. I've never "broken through" on N,N-DMT, but I find that 15mg to 30mg of 5-MeO-DMT is far more visual than 30mg of DMT.


After the 'flash', the out of body experience that is the 5-MeO-DMT peak, I come down to sometimes up to 60 minutes of an LSD-like trip where I rebuild my ego through conversations with those around me who explain to me the story of myself as a human on earth.

Maybe so but even 15 mg of 5-MeO-DMT is a LOT, often people can barely handle 10 while 50 mg of N,N-DMT is seen as a breakthrough dose. Personally I'm completely fucked up at like 35.


Heard and seen much about 5-MeO-DMT that indeed supports the idea that it has more warping effects than more typical visual effects. If you get severe spatial distortion you can consider it a visual because angles seem skewed, but that is different thing than effects that are primarily based on what you are seeing with your eyes. Don't know if I'm being clear here...


On the other hand, some people seem to get very intense visuals with 5-MeO-DMT so it's not all that invariable. But **generally** speaking N,N-DMT seems a bit more visual, and everything Ive read about 5-MeO analogs says they are focussed more on the body and less on the visuals. Plus they are more potent. I would agree so.

I've had 5-MeO-DMT trips that were completely devoid of visuals, while on others there were lots of beautiful colourful swirling spiralling fractals, with both eyes open and closed. Those were with low doses, too; I've never really broken through on it (except for maybe the first time I did it when I had no recollection of about a minute or two of the experience). The more visual trips were usually accompanied by cannabis though, so that might have something to do with it.

Does anyone think that Joe Rogan and Douge Stanhope smoked 5-meo-dmt? It sounded like they took only one hit then where sent into space. I never got that off one hit of DMT from a chem pipe.

I never smoke out of a chem pipe but out of a bong 1 hit can destroy me. 35-40mg's all taken in one hit basically and I can't take another hit, I know I'm definitely a lightweight when it comes to N,N-DMT but I've seen this happen to others also. I'm pretty sure these guys would know the difference between 5-MeO-DMT and N,N-DMT as the dosages are so different. 35-40mg's of 5-MeO would be a... well it would be something I know that much.![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I'm convinced you can get your ass handed to you with both compounds in only one hit, given the right vaping technique.


Tried my 5-MeO-?iPT again, which I suspect to be foxy but as said before I'm very uncertain

4 mg then at T+0:45 another 2 mg not too long before I had to throw up. When that was over another 2 mg was ingested and the experience settled in nicely.


It wasn't as intense as before but I'm having a hard time pointing out how hard I'm tripping! The visuals are very atypical and not so prominent that it indicates my level of tripping. There also is a wacked out derealization-type feel and like last time I feel like a creature on this stuff. I've heard some say 5-MeO's have a reptilian feel - well I can relate to the animalistic aspect to this comment. It's not like how alcohol can make you a monkey, which is more like foolishness by default - but a realisation of the fact that man is a freaky wild animal posing to be anything else. Aside some nitrous oxide a deeper understanding of metaphysical conceptual interrelations was facilitated. How clear the futility is, to try and transport insight from one world to another especially when experience extends beyond language. Pure patterns, more extraordinary than anything, but an infinite times more complex than can be carried over into the next - contemplative - moment.


Immodium (2mg) was also taken on forehand with some fibers but my digestion was still a bit rumbly. But ketamine was also (like last time) part of the mix so that accounts for something.


Can't figure out how I feel about the body feeling either! At first I'm relieved it's not fundamentally sympathicomimetic like phenethylamines boosting your total system, it IS stimulating to my energy drive but much more like Kundalini energy - as seems to be the legacy of tryptamine-compounds... 

Makes me feel supple in my joints which is most welcome but there is also a lethargic side to it exacerbated by my own chronic physical drainage. It seems as though this stuff is quite safe and somewhere in the future I would venture a bit higher in the dosage range ... when there is an inviting occasion/ set & setting.

You Sir have been doing foxy!


Moxy, is alot like foxy, only its devoid of visuals.


Moxy in terms of kundalini energy, is alot "stronger" the mental rush, is ridiculous

Instead of visuals something that i will note is a disassociation.

Something along the lines of ketamine.


There are very light purple hues and green hues to most things that don't normally have those hues but none of the visuals you are speaking of!


Great Scott man, you are lucky!

5-MeO-MIPT is anything but devoid of visuals!!! I've had a ++++ that was as visual as you can get on a tryptamine.


5-MeO-DIPT is equal to or less visual than 5-MeO-MIPT imo.


I've only tried both of these chemicals orally, and 5-MeO-MIPT snorted which I find identical to oral ingestion.

Even Shulgin said 5-meo-mipt was relatively devoid of visuals.

How much are you fucking injesting.


At any given time i never smoke more than 15.

Everything looks *cartoonish* i have a tremendous MDMA like rush, and a Disassociation fondly remembered from my days as a k-hole Spelunker.


I don't know where you get this, 

Look at erowid, there are reports upon reports, of people trying to use Foxy as a Love drug and being turned off by the visuals. The Visuals are Very Potent on Foxy.


Coolio, no offence, but whatever it seems that i say, you have to say i'm wrong,

and this has been going on it almost every single discussion i've had.

Why don't you accept the fact that everyone effects everyone differently.


I've done moxy, a handful of times now, and never had anything "out of this world"

I call it a mood enhancer above all else, with a mild psychedelic twinge and Brief Disassociation.


I've never snorted 5-meo-mipt.

I've only smoked it. Oral ingestion seems out of the question to me.

I just don't like nausea. 

I wouldn't smoke// or do more  than 15 in any given night.

I've taken 5-MeO-MIPT orally and snorted at unknown dosages. Starting at 8mg, but eyeballing up to 25mg and 30mg. One time I may have snorted more than 30mg as I ended up out of body experiencing a singularity for 6 hours. Never nausea or side effects from any dose.

If you'd maybe tried clicking on that little button that says "Search this thread" and typed in "smoke" when you were looking around you would have found [these 33 posts](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/search.php?searchid=4063695) that mention smoking it.

This drug would be too much to handle.

if for the first time i smoked it, i smoked all 15mg at once.

spacing it out, 5x5x5 makes it feel much smoother and more relaxed for your first time doing it.


I wrote a trip report, in trip reports, about what happened when i smoked 15mgs all at once, at two in the morning outside by myself, and i'm telling you, i had "entity" contact it was a ++++.


I've only smoked this stuff about 6 times now.

because not everyone wants to be tripping for that long.

5-meo-mipt smoked decreases the duration by around at least 30%

but provides a Deeper experience.

had some orally 9-11mg (it was a bitch to weigh.. gonna look into liquid measurement for the next time)

and it was intense for me and my gf

the tactile enhancement i was reading about was no where near what i was expecting

it was crazy


one thing i noted that was came strong with the trip in the beginning was the shaking.. there was a lot of shaking.. would smoking it cause a different effect? like less shaking? or it would not matter?

it was not non-visual as well.. saw lots of visuals from 30mins into the trip up to +7 hours

sound enhanced 

nitrous during the trip was freakin fun as well! love it![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

I should be sampling this some time soon, I am looking forward to experience this as it comes so highly recommended by Mr. Psychonautical here. I'm intrigued by the mention of this material bearing a similarity to 5-MeO-DMT and CZ-74 (4-HO-DET) as described in the TIHKAL entry. I've tried both of these compounds at modest doses, save for having not ever taken a real asskicking rip of 5-MeO-DMT. But I'm hoping this compound could shed some light on the chemical doors both of these chemicals show you since I am hesitant to explore either 4-HO-DET or 5-MeO-DMT at higher doses since there is so much body tremor and general anxiety.

As it turns out, 5-MeO-MiPT (oral) is still by far my favorite drug, and I have taken quite a few different ones.

IMO anything above 12mg is pretty high.

Yeah, I also agree >12mg orally is a high dose for the average person.


It's worth mentioning two things however:


1. Medium and low oral doses are great and some people prefer those (3-10mg)

2. I've known some people to freak out and / or get strong visuals on doses <12mg. People who've never tried it before should start at around 3-4mg.

Allright. I find both lower and higher doses good. Lower dose for a slight empathetic push, ++ á la Shulgin. Higher dose for introspection of an unusually emotional and self-reflective kind. Nice visuals and synesthesia to top it off.

seriously i dont think we are doing the same chemical anymore.

When you smoke it there is this extreme elation followed the the ability to process lifes problems in a very easily condensed fashion. 


Its not stimulatory as much as it is kundalini energy and the rebalancing of mind and body.


I notice that there is a strong ketamine type feeling to it, especially in relation to music.


Everytime i do some Ketamine and listen to some music i have extreme disorientation and extreme sound synesthesia


i always smoke 15 spaced out into 5 piles one at a time.


usually after that second 5mg toke, I am feeling sound as if it were an object pressing or riding against my skin. 


When you smoke it rapidly all at once, it is alot more like breaking through on DMT

But when its spaced out perfectly it seems to really enhance just the general complexity of things and gives you new way to look at and understand everything, within the limits of your own perceptions and not exceeding some kind of unearthly bounds.


5-meo-mipt for me was like someone literally turned up the contrast on reality and made me apperciate life a hell of alot more than i used to.

I have never had any anxiety or paranoia or even, any kind of extreme emotional outburst.


And its not that i am "prone" to 


its really a quite complicated little substance, but its incredibly relaxing and intriguing if you find the best doseage// ROA

About smoking this compound...


Many people are suggesting lightbulbs and/or test tubes... what about those pipes sold to smoke meth out of... (straight-shooters, glass dicks, valentines day roses, etc.) They seem optimal for something like this.... Are those things common in states other than Texas? Or is this a regional thing?

Yes, that is approximatly that.

On my side, the threshold for moxy to became very visual is 10 mg. Above that, visual is fairytale.

So does anyone have any real experience dissolving 5-meo-mipt into a solution? I've done some searching, but have only gotten vague bits about it being difficult. I have a gempro 250, but getting such small doses measured out sucks, and the stuff  sticks to everything, even the shiny side of aluminum foil. grr. What would fellow BLers recommend?

I always put my Western Union Card, onto my scale.

then reset the digital read out.


then i have this tiny little spoon, which i use to tap out the desired quantity onto the western union card. 


Then usually i divide the pile, and seperate some off until i have attained the desired amount.


The best part about using a plastic card, is you can use another plastic card, like a social insurance card to scrape it off or move it into a different position.

you can't tell that for sure, people are different, and some just require larger dosages.


koreyssette, is your tryptamine tolerance generally high?

you're right. we all do react differently.

perhaps his batch is just as good as any other.


my post should just be taken as a warning for anyone who wants to try this chem.

15mg would be a pretty high dose for most.

Tastes more like putrid rotten corpses and less like generic chemical-bitter, imo :D


Had 33 mg 4-HO-MET and then 25 mg 5-MeO-MiPT at T+6. The latter experience flowed seamlessly from the first with a slightly new angle. More powerful than expected but tolerance was definitely present.

I'd just like to point out that there seems to be some confusion regarding dosage and ROA for this substance. BL's have reported a steep and non-linear dose-response curve, with drastic differences between the subjective effects experienced between low doses and high doses. I'll be trying this one in a few weeks and just read the thread again to refresh my memory on what people have had to say about 5-MeO-MiPT. Some people report no visuals, and some say it is very visual at higher doses. Looking at Erowid's "tentative" dosage chart, I'm wondering if anyone can confirm that much more drug is required when smoking vs. oral admin? Erowid lists a strong oral dose as 5-12mg, where as a strong smoked dose is 15-20mg. I'll certainly use the oral ROA for my first time, but does anyone have experience with achieving medium to strong visuals using both routes? If so, I'd be interested in hearing what dose was required for both ROA to produce decent visuals?


Another question I have is about using a medium dose of 5-MeO-MiPT to offset the more lethargic effects of 4-Aco-DMT. I love the deep and powerful experience from IM 4-Aco-DMT, but would like the energy to go exploring the forest etc. Anyone have any advice or experience with this combo? What kind of dosing schedule would you recommend? I was thinking maybe I'd take 5-7mg moxy about an hour before injecting 30mg of 4-Aco-DMT IM? I have a fair bit experience with 4-Aco-DMT and combining it with 2-CB, n,n DMT, 2-CE, and alcohol.  Many in this thread have said they feel Moxy is a powerful enhancer or booster.  Would Moxy's effects compliment the 4-Aco-DMT?

Tried this out earlier today (15mg oral), wasn't overly impressed. It seems kind of.. odd, I guess. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

^ It certainly is an odd one, different from any other psychedelic I've tried for sure. I can't quite place my finger on what it is, but it seems as though there is a constant weirdy undertow to most of the experience, except it lightens up into a more shroomy state towards the end. 


As many others have said, definitely a two-phase trip. However, I don't 'roll' during the first phase, just an odd sense of humour, a hilarity which fits in with that 'shifted' head-space I find my self in. Like everything is just slightly different in someway, but giggles come easy. 


During the plateau, it seems very calm, but still weird - I can only describe it as slightly alien, perhaps like that alien feel sometimes encountered on mushrooms. Pastel colours, washy and fluffy, picking out glows from distant neon lights.


The later second phase is more traditionally psychedelic in a less alien sense, but still with a tinge of weirdness lurking. Lovely aurora-type glows, auras around tree silloughettes etc. Definitely one to experience outdoors, but also indoor lighting and colours can catalyze a wonderfully shroomy colourspace. As always, listening to Lateralus by Tool is fantastic (when sober let alone on psychedelics). 


A dark horse of the psychedelics, giving small glimpses of things at a time. I'll have to experiment more for sure to see if there is more to Moxy than I have yet discovered.

Favorite album, **ever** ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


I'll be trying 5-MeO-MiPT out soon. Does it have a nice stimulation? Or more lethargic?


I'm also wondering has anyone tried smoking 5-MeO-MiPT while on a psychedelic like acid or 2C-x?


A lot of people smoke DMT, 5-MeO-DMT and do nitrous on psychedelics. I'm wondering if smoking 5-MeO-MiPT is equally useful for such applications.

I've smoked some 4 mg of 5-MeO-MiPT on the tail of an acid trip. The chemical smell was a little more unpleasant than usual, and promoted a pleasant lying in bed looking at the breasts of my friend which proceeded to position themselves as a great network of hexagons. Hypnotic and nice mind trip. After 10-15 minutes I had to go take a piss, and in the bathroom a visual white-out of the sort familiar from 5-MeO-DMT was closely nudged. 


It felt like it revived the acid trip, but also pushed it aside. Pleasant, neutral, with mood lift, but not lasting very long. More like 5-MeO-DiPT in most respects, but with more pleasant body buzz.


Can't say much more, it was pleasant and lasted for 20 minutes and then the tail of the LSD peak dominated again.

Anyone else try smoking 5-MeO-MiPT while on a more classic psychedelic? I'm wondering if people do it in the same vain as people smoking DMT, 5-MeO-DMT and doing nitrous on more classic psychedelics. 


And does 5-MeO-MiPT give you a good enough energy to be out partying or out in the wilderness, or is it more of a lethargic high?

I used a higher dose because of cross tolerance between tryptamines. 


I would say 18 mg would have produced roughly the same effects (though with a more rough and real come-up plateau dynamic) if taken sober.


I plan on taking some 10-12 mg on new years eve. 5-MeO-MiPT is a peculiar little friend.

Love_Sex_Desire; My original post was probably a tad misleading. Since I posted that, I have really ramped up the dose because I felt that there definitely was more to be discovered from this amazing chemical.


Yes, indeed, I would say to you it is a fantastic drug to take in a good-vibed social setting. My first trials with it were with the Erowid recommended doses, and those of others reported on Bluelight. However, I have never seen a report on Bluelight that comes close to describing the incredible power of Moxy.


Before I start - people have been saying it's like a roll. It's nothing like a roll. This is complete cosmic positivity permeating your entire space.


The other night I took on average ~100mg, spaced out over a period of about 3 hours. The 10-15mg doses just weren't cutting it. I find that many people really underball the doses of new psychedelics, but I really like to push the envelope, to see where these things really kick into gear. ****So anyhow I decided to spend my time tripping in a very nice family-oriented bar on the top road from where I live. Visuals came on fast, after dosing the first 20-30mg in a cap, as my friends and I were walking to the bar. The jewels from from the car headlights were spectacular, prisms of unseen spectrums just everywhere.


In the bar, it got ridiculous. We sat down and ordered our drinks, and people's clothes, the carpet, all the colours were so starkly contrasted in a beautiful array of colours I have never seen on any psychedelic before. You could almost breathe in the colours, they were that erotic.![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Feeling the need to re-dose, I had pre-loaded a capsule to bring with us, and we each had another ~20mg (60mg capsule divided by 3) straight off the table. Sounds, colours, peoples faces at the bar, it was just an absolute burst of positivity manifesting in synaesthetic senses that simply could not get better. In all my tripping years, I have never been so lucid, able to hold converstion with complete strangers whilst having a complete orgy of the senses.


We went back to mine to get more (since one of my friends was complaining he wasn't 'feeling it' as much as me and and the other), and there I put ~50-60mg into capsules. Did them and went back to the bar, and thereupon it got just psychedelic like I've never know before.


You need no preconceptions, just let it do what it does, and keep into that frequency.


It wasn't as if there was a mess of visuals in front of my face I had to see through in order to make sense of what was going on, nor was it disorienting in any sense of the word. On the contrary, everything was as clear as a bell, clearer than you could possibly imagine, and it only took a stimulatory walk around the bar with all it's fancy colours, garlands, smells, people talking, to set off a complete smorgasbord of absolute sensory 'multigasm'. I'm sorry, that is the only way I can describe it. Everyone still looked the same, but God could not have imparted more positivity into Creation if he tried. Absolute abundant glowing positivity. Tingling scalp, and frontal cortex of the brain just by processing all things in Creation. Like just a constant escalating explosion of love, colour, synaesthesia. This is how the universe looks, this is how light really shines. :D


Eating breaded mushrooms was something else, never before experienced. Lemon Meringue pie we all scoffed like ravenous dogs, hungry for sensory input. Sacred geometry would permeate from my friends into the space around and light up the room into a place of perfection. *You will really get the munch-on with this one*. It is so loungy and receptive, you can just sit there and let it happen, there is absolutely no head-fuck whatsoever; this is the kind of stuff you could sell at psychedelic bars (if they were legal) and just be with your friends and share your senses about with everyone. 


Spologies if I sould like a lunatic, but after reading so many half-assed reports here, and only experiencing a mild ++ at best with low doses, this really is the stuff when you dive in deep. 


Happy times, and of course have a wicked new year!

Ive smoked 5 meo mipt while on mdma/2cb/2ci.

The dose was ~6-8mg. 

It was nowhere near as intense or beautiful as DMT or 5 meo DMT can be, though im sure you can change that by adjusting the dose. Also it lasted longer; around 1.5 hours.


As for your second question, in lower doses 6-12mg it is a good drug to party on. Above 12mg is where it becomes a bit more of a serious psychedelic. 

IME it can be very strange and alien feeling at 12mg+. Also the bodyload increases with higher doses.

The only time ive ever been nauseas or puked from 5 meo mipt was from a 12mg trip.

^^ I know to take some of Shulgin's suggestions with a grain of salt, but 100 mg is 20 times Shulgin's recommended dose! Nausea at 12 mg, imagine over 8 times that! Crazy.

100 mg is crazy, yeah. take heed.


However; I accidentally dosed 80 mg due mislabelled bags (stupid as ever - thought i was going to test a low dose 3-desoxy-MDA) and got a surprise trip, for sure a strong one, but not unpleasant at all and not much in the negative bodyload department. Some parts are lost to me - watched a movie with an ex and can't say i remember much more than laughing extremely much. 


A very high dose 5-meo-dipt would not have been as forgiving.


Anyhow, I think I prefer the light psychedelic cheering up effect of lower oral dosage or more entactogenic smoking of a couple of milligrams.

To be fair, I didn't experience any noticable nausea with this 100mg escapade - I certainly didn't puke, nor did I get any diahorea or colic. The only bodyload effect I had was leg-pains, lasting the whole trip. Yet the trip was so positive, the pain was almost just as positive as everything else. It's really hard to describle. Just natural as it comes.


Also, I must add that I get leg-pains from most tryptamines anyway, including psilocin and LSD.


I just wanted to show that this is more than simply an entactogenic drug with a few sparkles - it truely is full-on psychedelic if you're prepared to take a proper dose.

dear folks, just coming down from my 2nd IM'd 5-meo-mipt trip with 20mg: a very intensive trip with awesome CEV's, on the edge to ego-dissulution and a strong but nice bodyload. imo the best ROA. i ask myself what will happen on much higher dosages IM'd? i guess a psychedelic breakthrough could be possible, but will it be physical safe to IM clearly above 20mg?

Aquired some 100 mg, eager to experiment more again with my newly reinforced bipolar nihilistic/harmonic, just plain imbalanced mindset.


Trurl: I would think IM is safer than oral administration.


I'd like to read some comparisons between oral and IM administration, even though I will probably never IM or IV a drug.

@Mjäll: sorry, i can not do a real comparison because the dosages are to different. i never took more as 12mg oral, mostly 8mg because i hate the bad side effects over 10mg, but i will describe 20 mg i.m.: strong cev's, strong but nice tremor, as far as i observed no heartracing, no sweeting, light synaesthesia and the beginning of ego-dissolution (felt like the light-version of an old 5-meo-dmt experience (insufflated)). very irritating where acousting effects like a sizzling noise on the last trip from peak till late afterglow. needless to say i lied down the first 2-3 hours instead of moving around like on 8mg oral. sadly the 20mg-trip overruns in time (7.30PM - 3AM) and the next day i was to tired to go to work, haha.

This compound, like a lot of RCs, varies wildly according to how many mgs one needs.  To add, it's perhaps "extreme" when it comes to how different ROAs need different doses.  So with both of these facts said, if one has never used -MiPT before (and don't let a known tolerance for 5-MeO-DiPT or similar tryptamines [easier to find drugs, perhaps] influence your first dose), START LOW.  This is a physical one, and if one goes too high, it can get uncomfortable.  


In my experience, oral generally requires the smallest dose.  Then rectal. Than insufflation, followed by smoking (or so I hear - never done it).  


Snorting, I'll go with  3-5mg lines every 15 minutes for an hour or so.  I like to stagger, drugs, though.  And one should stagger if it's a first time.  If you know your oral threshold, I'd say that 1.3x to 1.5x your regular oral dose is deal.  Again, get second opinions, though!


Snorted -MiPT is must tripper, IMO, than other ROAs.  If that's what you want, then it's a great one.  I prefer oral or rectal, though, as it's more sensual and kind of an MDMA/MDA middleground.

In case anyone wonders, the reason I always eyeballed it is that I really didn't care about 'overdosing' - I was looking for experiences on par with extreme high dose mushrooms, or DMT or DPT.


I think sometime later this year I'll try accurately measured, staggered doses of 3mg every 15 minutes!

Coolio, do you agree with RedLeader in that snorted requires higher dosage? Discount the body factor if you wish, I am interested in mental effects mostly.

Since I've only tried it insufflated and sublingually, and never weighed it out, I have no idea. I just know from reading that I don't want to wait for it to come on orally; and I am slightly averse to vaporizing tryptamines but I'll try that someday.

This is interesting, would snorting give you a slightly different trip? For example less of a body-load and more of a mental high?


I have also been told that there is a barrier of discomfort with this chemical and once you break through this barrier it is a different trip, more visual with a very enjoyable body high and not even the slightest discomfort, aside from a bit of a cloudy head.

I wouldn't bother snorting it. Oral dosages tend to come on within about ten minutes on an empty stomach. I have insufflated it, and it didn't come on any faster than oral.

for the most part (excluding the JWH series which need more studies) research chemicals are non-toxic. that is, they don't contain heavy metals or carcinogens. they are quickly (besides the dragonflies) excreted by the body.


the real source of side-effects is their intended action on receptor systems of the body. 5HT2b agonism causes heart concerns, while 5HT2a agonism can cause a trip and 5HT2c agonism increases nausea. different chemicals are more selective than others, and every body is different.

For god sakes don't eyeball it!!! I had some liquid doses of this substance, each liquid dose had 5mgs... I took two and after the come-up it felt like it was missing something although the body load was tremendous, I took two more and it completely destroyed me, felt so hard on my body, my legs were having bad muscle cramps and I kept thinking I stabbed my foot. (I was at a party with a lot of people) I could not believe the world of difference it was by doubling that dose, I was thinking "twice as strong as this experience would be amazing" but I was very very wrong. It went from very enjoyable to forcing myself to socialize with a body that feels like it's a pulsing ball of energy about to explode like a supernova. 


The visuals were very cool at 20mgs, started off like a very light speedy mushrooms (hard to notice as your concerned about the orgasm waves of energy that are electrifying you) and leads into more of a colorful psychedelic instead of a comedown. I thought I took another drug on top of the four doses. Point being, I didn't achieve anything but a kick in the ass by dosing higher on this drug, and it was much much much more potent than expected.

I don't have extensive experience with this compound, but I do remember getting insanely awesomely good effects with about 8-9 mgs plugged.  It was super rushy and psychedelic, extremely good erotic enhancement, quite visual, made music sound really cool, little body load for me.  Other times orally i feel like it was more of a stimulated "bonk on the head" experience with light visuals.  I don't know if this was just an underdose, or if orally is just not the best method of taking this substance.  It sure is a nice one though when you get it right !


My partner however has experienced diarrhea from plugging this one, which doesn't suprise me, since 5-meo-xxt seem to have a higher incidence of that side effect, and you are squirting it into your lower digestive tract, so, users beware !  I have had stimulation issues with it when taken orally, and just find it hard to adjust to the headspace.  I also didn't note to much of anything going on upstairs that was on any interest, just a heavy stoned feeling, not entirely pleasant.  Plugging is defeintely how I will enjoy this material again when I try it next, which I have no idea when that will be (so many drugs so little time!).


What does everyones 5-meo-mipt look like ?  Mine is a beigey-pinkish-off whiteish, and very granulated powder.  Like not even powder, it's super fine granules that can be crushed, and when I weigh it, they roll around all over the place, which can be tricky.

Hmm....first go at it, took maybe 6mg (scale was being funky, maybe it was more)


Obvious tripping but nothing crazy. Pattern forming rainbow tint to everything. Some tracers...no head rush, though...


This is odd. I can't explain how I'm feeling. It's very subtle. There's a lot of flashing, too. 


No body load.

Yeah I felt anxious, indifferent..not much of a head feeling either. Just slight visuals and weird thoughts, a little giggity. 


Temperatures didn't matter either. I was outside in 90F with 100% humidity and wasn't affected.


Odd chemical.

So, I recently got a good amount of 5 meo mipt, but after reading more into it I'm kind of worried about how stimulating it is. I recently had a horrible experience with DOX sold as lsd (Took way too many tabs). It made my blood pressure rocket sky high and my heart felt like it was beating out of my chest. I'm kind of wanting to stay away from strong stimulants for a while. how much faster does 5 meo mipt make your heart beat? also, does it increase your blood pressure at all? if it is mostly mental stimulation I can handle that, but I think that a crazy fast heart rate would cause me to get too much anxiety.

Moxy has a very clean, mostly mental stimulation that shouldn't give you many physical troubles. That is if you can keep your cool, since it CAN cause tremors at high doses-But I find it's like DPT in that way where you can almost "switch" them off by not thinking about them... So unless your "LSD" was actually 5-MeO-AMT than I wouldn't worry. 5-MeO-MiPT is a nice tryptamine that seems very unlike an amphetamine stimulation-type experience, in fact I think of it as rather the opposite. Love the mental clarity of a nice Moxy high ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Second experience with it...found my sweet spot, I think. 5mg was perfect for me, and now I find myself redosing which I never do.... unless it's methylone.

Had that nice content feeling at 5mg, then I redosed another 5mg at +2:30 into my trip. Seeing very intense CEVs, tons of pattern forming and glowing, some tracers. No walls bending though, fortunately.


Music sounds nice...on the stuff right now. Ahhh.


edit: ^ wow I don't remember posting that previous post. ee gads, this stuff is pretty nice. Recommended.

So I finally tried it ( 5 mg + 3mg 1hr later). I like it. Felt much different from what I thought it would. It felt kind of like herb in a way. A strange "stoned"/disassociated  type feeling. No visuals at all except my vision getting slightly more defined and things looking a little dreamy/rounded like on mushrooms. I  didn't get any negative body effects really. I wouldn't even call this stimulating. It was very relaxing to me.  Spent most of the trip on the couch eating and watching Arrested Revelopment, with some herb added in about t + 1:30. Definently will be repeating. At a higher dose even.

Yep, it wasn't very stimulating for me either. Even after the redose. Though, I still needed something to go to sleep.


Pretty cool stuff though.

I really enjoy 5-MeO-MiPT.  I find there is a strong energy that runs through it, but it's not a hyper type of energy at all.  It's light and kind of electric, very warm and buzzing.  It opens up communication and empathy channels very nicely and provides what can be a pretty strong euphoria.  All while being extremely light, nearly transparent on the body.  If you don't channel the energy though, it can become uncomfortable/anxiety.  So it's not a good one for sitting around the house... I'd definitely want to be doing something, preferrably outside, and certainly with someone to talk to if you're inside.


I find it most useful for working with personal energetic issues.  Once I was in a bad state for a few months, from overuse of AMT and others (extreme abuse really).  I was constantly anxious.  I took 6mg of 5-MeO-MiPT and I was suddenly aware of how the energy flow was moving through my chakras and getting stuck in my polar plexus and emanating out from there, unable to go further, and that this is what was causing the anxiety.  The MiPT dissipated the blockage and my energy started flowing correctly and I was overjoyed with happiness, shrieking out and capering around and genuine happy and comfortable for the first time in months.  Afterwards I remained much more aware of my energy flow and it has allowed me to be in better control of that and deal with energy blockages.

This is nice stuff - I took 4mg of it shortly before going to a local dance party event (they blocked a major road, and had music and a DJ and such, and lots of people from various parts of the city were there - was acually a pretty cool event, and would have been sober as well), redosed with 2mg at 1 hour when we went back to get some glow sticks. 


As others have reported, it really seems to be a two-phase experience - first energy, sociability, and euphoria, then taking on more psychedelic character... I got very little in the way of visual effects; color enhancement, maybe slight trailing, but nothing beyond that, but i was very definitely in a trippy mindset, yet where most psychedelics put my mind in far off thoughts, this seemed to keep me more grounded, and I got no anxiety whatsoever walking through town and buying some candy (less than I would even just stoned), which is not normal at all. 


Some mild nausea as it transitioned to the psychedelic phase, but that was after i got back from dancing for an hour without any pause, and my stomache wasn't happy before i took it.


Very impressed with this stuff.

So, after trying this substance orally a number of times and throughly enjoying it every time I've decided to try the smoking route. I plan on loading 5mg into my pipe at a time and repeating until I'm at a level I feel comfortable at. I've read through this thread a number of times, but have a few questions still. Is it any more stimulating when smoked? I mean physically, like a heart rate increase. Also how long is the peak? I've read 30 mins to 2 hours throughout the thread, which is a pretty big difference. 


The only tryptamine I've smoked is 5-meo-dalt, which was interesting at first but way too stimuulating for many repeat experiences. It made my heart beat faster and pound harder than any amount of stimulants I've ever taken, sometimes making me feel faint. Is there any simularity between the two, if anyone has tried both? I'm hoping it has less effects on the heart.


I've gone up to 12mg orally, and handled it fine. The best thing to do while on it I've found so far is standing in front of an A/C or fan while peaking. Incredible tactile feelings with this stuff, moreso than any of my MDMA experiences. My dad tried 20mg, and was blown away. Said he felt almost too good in the euphoria department. I've also found that this chemical makes me extremely hungry, much more than herb. I can pretty much constantly eat through the experience, and have a number of times. My dad also gets the same insatiable hunger.


All in all I love this chemical. Easy on the mind and body, at least orally.

Shulgin trips with his son in Pihkal at one point.


Ahem, rather, the fictional character Shura Borodin trips with his fictional son Theo.


What a name for a Chemists Son.  If he had a daughter, I bet her name would have been Ethyl.

Haha. My dad and I trip together a lot. First tim I ever tripped on anything was with him. He's done shrooms, lsd, mdma, salvia, 2ci, 5 meo dalt, 4 aco dmt, dox(sold as acid, he enjoyed it, I didnt), and 5 meo mipt with me. He's tripped a lot in his time, lsd in the 70s and all that hippie stuff haha. Its pretty cool I think. Its good to have someone around who's "been there and done that", and he is always extremely level headed no matter the dose (was good when I took 5 blotters of DOX sold as acid - I kinda flipped, he kept his cool throughout it all helping me calm down). His favorite so far has been 2ci, although he likes moxy a good bit.

Damn, I'm jealous...wish I had a dad like that! Funny with the dox being sold as lsd...happened to me when I bought some, though I was suspicious, so I had my friend try it. He tripped for a few days. Not cool! 


Moxy is the only psychedelic that I ever wanted to redose on.

My short contribution :


5 mg oral on saturday evening.

Fast acting, nice but light, followed by whisky-coke in disco, 10 mg 4acoDIPT, whisky-coke, bed. 

Nice evening but could take more.


Next saturday evening :


10 mg oral, a big smile at H+30mn that ended 6 hours later.

Some heat and hand sweat but light and not other body trouble.

No visuals, no stimulation, no food aversion.

Very euphoric, was singing and dancing all the night.

The usual 4acoDIPT and alcool adds, and that was a very nice evening.

Just comme back home, lie on my bed and slept right away (thanks to the whisky).


Something very strange : 

I'm a heavy smoker (30 cig / day).

The day after this evening with 5meoMIPT, i just thought i have smoked realy to much, and thought i have to stop it.

Until this morning, never took another cigarette. 

I didnt thought about that when i was on 5meoMIPT, but i just did it in the morning, i dont know why.


I used to began my saturdays evening with a light dose of 2CE, and then alcool and 4acoDIPT for the rest of the night, you know, but if my third test is as positive as this one, i will gladely throw away that 2CE to the 5meoMIPT, at same dosage (10mg is enough).

It is nice and long acting, but fare more euphoric than 2CE.

I agree. This chemical is pretty euphoric. Puts you in a good mood no matter what. I have a smile plastered on my face from about about 20 minutes onward. 


Lately I've noticed I also get pretty cool closed eye visuals on it. With my eyes closed my vision is completely filled with one giant moving, morphing psychedelic pattern, although it seems like it's behind an opaque black screen. Mostly during the first two hours though. This is at about 10mg. I also get faint tracers. Surprised me because at first I didn't expect visuals from reading reports, and didn't really look for them.


Could anyone who smoked it let me know if it increases your heart rate substantially? I've been wanting to try it, but if it lasts 30 minutes to 2 hours and increases my heart rate like 5 meo dalt does then I feel I might not be able to enjoy it, and would pretty much just want to stay away from it.

My girlfriend recently tried this substance and she had horrible GI problems. Really bad gas, I could see her stomach rise with gas in a matter of seconds after she burped. It was pretty painful for her. She did enjoy the effects of the drug otherwise. I was wondering if the drug was taken nasally if it would reduce the GI problems since the drug never comes in contant with the stomach/intestines. Anyone know if this would work? shes really wanting to try it again, but I don't think it's a good idea after the pain she was in last time. 


On a kind of related note, She also got horrible GI problems with 4 ACO DMT, which is odd since I've read both it and Moxy tend to have least GI problems out of the RC tryptamines - most commonly no GI problems at all. With 4 ACO DMT it wasn't so much gas as it was a very upset stomach though.

Had the opportunity to try 5-meo-mipt a few weeks ago.


Dose: somewhere between 25-35mg(scale was flaky, but I suspect the latter half of the spectrum.)snorted up the nose. - I will comment on one thing; not much pain when snorted, but the drip is very caustic, and the powder seems to goo up and stick to the back of your throat for a long time, very unpleaseant to say the least.


Effects: Onset after 15-20min. Strong bodyhigh. Feels very good, I notice tremors, but closing my eyes and relaxing my body I seem to be able to channel what feels like a strong current of energy flowing through me, I dont notice the tremors anymore. I seem to loose track of time after this initial stage. I spend some time drifting in and out of consciousness, with my eyes closed.  


The mental landscape can get quite hectic, sometimes going where it seems insanity and mania presides. Latching onto normal trains of thought is at times difficult.


Visually impressive compound. Staring at a bookcase infront of me, it forms wave like and morphing patterns. I notice the same thing hax4 describes a giant moving multicoloured opaque pattern that occupies my entire field of vision. It dances, stops, breaks apart, starts moving, sometimes in a picture in picture sort of fashion, it is very fluid and reminds me a bit of the latter half of an lsd trip visually. At one point I am standing outside on my friends patio staring at the neighbouring apartment complexes as they wave and morph around.


Other: No noticeable GI discomfort noted.

Also, my friend tried about 10mg IV. I will elaborate more on that, but I dont have time now.

Did 10mgs of this on Wednesday, turned out excellent. I love this one. I also did some nitrous later on in the night and it was a very good idea.


I sat around my apartment, keeping myself occupied while playing music. I also went for a drive towards the end of my trip (I wasn't driving) and walked home from a friend's house at sunrise, it was very pleasant.


Turned off all of my lights besides a plasma lamp, some glowsticks, and a candle. I noticed faded orange and green blobs dancing against the flickering candle light casted on the wall.

Ok. So I ended up testing just the Moxy and that was, suprisingly, _quite_ enough by itself. I don't know what it was when I sampled the first time and didn't get much effect; But, this time it was totally different.


12 mg Moxy @ about 7pm as me and a friend entered a massive edm party. Lasted until 2am and made dancing absolutely fantastic! Couldn't get down to everything but I found my room/style and lost myself countless times. Dubstep was absolutely wonderful in this state. Vibration and wobble physically personified itself through my body. There was a slight trippyness to the experience with light visuals (trails, breathing)


The beginning of the experience wasn't quite as pleasant as the music was quite overbearing and I had to escape from it multiple times. The bass was so intense I could feel it traveling through my body and jacking my heart rate. One room I wandered into was so hot I ran into the invisible heat bubble surrounding the area and my whole body kind of froze and stuck to the edge in mid-walk. My stomach was also a bit uneasy as I had eaten salmon sushi just prior and kept burping the nasty fishy aftertaste which is not so great the second time around. Next time I will fast prior to which I think will work out better and I'm going to reduce the dose a bit too as 12mg was just a bit too much.


I felt wonderful and was absolutely positive in disposition. I didn't go out of my way to interact with others as one would on mdma because I was happy just being. At the same time I wasn't anti-social and greeted all with nothing but love and happiness despite their disposition.


Overall a great experience and alternative to mdma.

Mentally, it seems to sharpen the mind, almost making me feel more sober but with that tryptamine mental fluidity.  Socially it increases my desire to communicate and skill in doing so every time.  I'm going to be submitting another trip report on it soon... but long story short, it felt like a warm, refreshing bath for my soul, which had been plagued by a minor depressive energy for the past month.  I was able to transform that energy into releases of emotion and creativity and it hasn't returned since.

My experience of 5-MeO MiPT is similar to Xorkoth's except that perhaps I find the potency a little higher. The different stages are really clear with quite a bit of body energy, sometimes a little hard to get out, at the start with the stimulation being replaced with a little more chill factor and less body load if I'm feeling any as the trip progresses.

Interestingly a friend and I recently tired 4mg with 10mg 4 AcO DiPT which by and large took away the often felt clear head space somewhat.  Again stages, with the first being a surprisingly incapacitated feeling leaving me unable to operate an electric whisk without looking like i'd recently had a stroke accompanied by an overwhelming desire to lie down and express how fucked I was. Potentation? I recon so. This however was followed by wonderful feeling of fun and amusement expressed perfectly as we watched this...

It might also be worth noting that on another occasion a v low dose of 1.5mg taken at the tail end of a series of 100mg 4MMC dosages, probably totalling 200 and 400mg, respectively... we had no feeling of a comedown and certainly less meph induced speech impediment... and I thought it was untreatable!

**Questions about 5-MeO-MiPT**


Hello follow BLers,


I have a great opportunity: to try out 5-MeO-MiPT tomorrow.


From my express research, I gathered some information. It has been called the tryptamine's response to MDMA. It can be very erotic. It enhances tactile sensations greatly and free-association thinking (dreamy fantasy headspace). It seems to be very subtle on the visual side; most reports I've read are either very mildly visual, or not visual at all. Also, there seems to be an agreement between a lot of users that the experience has two faces, the first one being euphoric and tactile mostly and a second phase (second wind) which is trippier, and more reminiscent of 5-MeO-DMT (which I have never tried).


Here are my questions:


1. I'm kind of confused in terms of the dosage/effects response curve, where should I aim my shot? more along 6-7 mg or 12-14 mg (oral, not smoked)?

I am quite experienced with a couple of tryptamines (LSD, Psilocin) and am very familiar with MDMA. I've also experimented a few times with 2C-B, which I enjoy a lot.


2. I am planning on smoking some decent cannabis and also cracking some whippits perhaps (Nitrous), should I be worried about any possible negative reactions? I will also have some K handy... is that pushing it?


3. How would this play out with some MDMA?

(MDMA being kind of like it's phen reflection, from what I've read)


Thanks a lot homeys!


Keep On!

Should actually go OK with MDMA.


I love this stuff.  Your description is spot on.  A tactile erotic sort of swimmingly psychedelic first 3-4 hours... then a very delicate but cosmic psychedelic second wind SOME of the time... when it happens it is REAL sweet feeling... Feels like I have an ACTUAL THIRD EYE that opens up during this part, more so than on any other substance, like there's actually some sort of slightly tickly sensation in the middle of my forehead, just barely back behind the skin and skull on the surface of  my brain... pineal gland orgasms perhaps?  I've felt almost psychic during this part... senses seemed HIGHLY HIGHLY enhanced...


I remember quite vividly... this is a very true story I promise:  Sitting on the porch one late spring morning at 4am during this second wind phase of 5-meo-mipt, smoking a post-orgasmic cigarette... the night Albert Hoffman died actually I think... I could actually HEAR individual petals from the magnolia tree blooms on the tree 25 ft away as they hit the ground... I heard miscellaneous industrial sounds at several loading docks miles away... the harmonious swell and ebb of a train horn's chordal tones off in the distance... then the mingled joyous cacophony of happy voices at a party wafted in on the wind from god knows where... and to top it all off with a few sparkly silver fairy dust glints -  someone's wind chimes lazily swaying and tinkling in the distance somewhere... the heady & sweet intoxicating perfume of jasmine flowers from nearby bushes was like heaven itself and the soft feel of a slow breeze hitting my bare chest and closed eyelids I cant even begin to describe...


I could somehow feel the combined vibrations of all the minds on the planet wafting into space, like that jasmine flower scent wafting up away from the planet, being blown out into the galaxy as the solar wind gently blew the combined miasma, as the Aurora danced gently about both poles... what a magical evening, courtesy of 5-Meo-Mipt.


I had no music on, but it felt almost exactly like this sublime, divine sound (or, play the sample of track 2 "The Secret Place" from Brian Eno's record Apollo): [http://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/med...ype=track&ASIN=B000THG7PG&DownloadLocation=CD](https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/media/sample.m3u/ref=dm_mu_dp_trk2_smpl?ie=UTF8&catalogItemType=track&ASIN=B000THG7PG&DownloadLocation=CD)


This was at a "Heavy" dose level by the way... which I built up to over a period of months by numerous experiment stgarting at LOW... someone new to the compound ought start with a light dose... some's "Light" could turn out to be your "heavy"... you have NO way to predict it.


I think all the combos you have lined up should play fine with it, but again it should be expressed that you need to gain a full experience, from first alert to final landing on this on its own to properly asses how it is going to affect you... it lasts a long time and can go thru shifts in effect throughout... you dont know your response till you let probably a few separate experiences with it ON ITS OWN to play all the way through.


To me its always been a rather special substance actually.  Very malleable and amenable and good natured and friendly... I felt it "wanted" me to have a good time on it.  It should he said though that others dislike it intensely, so do beware.

Under no circumstances should you take more than 6-7mg of this for your first time. The dosage for this drug varies a lot from person to person and the dose response curve is very steep. You do realize that 12-14mg is 2x the maximum dose listed in TiHKAL right?

I feel the need to say all this because its posts like the one above that made me take 12-14mg for my first dose. It was the most intense fucked up experience I’ve ever had with me blacking out several times. I’m sure 18mg will send me to the ER – this drug is also a potent vasoconstrictor.

This drug is active even at 1-3mg for me and feels more manic than euphoric. There is sensory and sexual enhancement but you will still have a psychedelic headspace. At doses around 7mg, I feel like I’m a completely different person (similar to 5-MeO-DMT). Along with 5-MeO-DMT and salvia, this is the most intense psychedelic I've used.

I recommend you be a responsible user and take only ~7mg of 5-MeO-MiPT (no combos). If its too less you can always take more the next time.

I have to agree that AS ALWAYS when using ANY substance new to you, it is imperative to start at the lower end of the dose range.  EVERYBODY REACTS DIFFERENTLY to these hitherto unknown synthetic molecules.  In fact I'm going to remove my mention of my exact dose above.

Very steep dose-response curve, as with all 5-MeO's.


My understanding is that this is possibly the only 5-MeO-tryptamine that's really special; it's very pleasant and entactogenic around 5-10 mg and quickly becomes unpleasant even a little above that level. The steep dose/response curve is probably why it hasn't caught on, which is a shame from what I've heard about how fun it can be.


Most reports on erowid that talk about how horrible it is are at dosages of 12 mg or higher. Conversely, almost all of the positive reports are at dosages of less than 10 mg.


I assume there's a potential for gastric disturbances with this one. Consider smoking some weed.

I will definitely go with 6-7 mgs, thanks for the heads-up. Yes, I know these RCs can be very intense and sometimes unpredictable. I also know about the Tihkal entry and dosages, but from personal experience, I've found that Tihkal dosages are rather on the low safe side and I absolutely HATE being halfway on a psychedelic.


I will play it safe, but I cannot guarantee that the nitrous will not find its way to my lungs ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Thanks guys.


Oh yeah... and I like visuals. If I am left with a visual "thirst" at the end of my 5-MeO-MiPT experience, would 2C-B on the comedown be a BAD idea?...

High dose 5-meo-mipt is very visual. Once you get past 20mg it really starts to get interesting. Ymmv.

Absolutely stay low to start.  But I think some of the above is casting a personal preference a little too definitively as a nearly-certain absolute law.  You will find plenty of non-horrible experience reports in doses from 12-16 mg.  I dont think theres sufficient evidence to proclaim that some super-majority will all be assured of totally hideous experiences at that level.  That's just not true according to many experiences Ive heard.


But DO start low.  You never know what sort of responder you are till you try it.

^Yeah you're right. Edited my above post. For me 5-meo-mipt is an excellent psychedelic at higher doses, but I know the peripheral effects can get really bad for some people.

NO WAY!!!

Do not combine 5-meo-mipt with any kind of serotonine releaser (MDMA, Methylone).

There have been thoughts about serotonine syndrome with this combo.


One of the reports:

sup, did you even read the text?  That does NOT APPLY WHATSOEVER to a PROPERLY DOSED combination!  Read more than the headline, please.... I hate inappropriate cautions!


*We describe a 27-year-old male patient with substance intoxication after a single ingestion of the mixture of methylone and 5-MeO-MIPT. Though he bought the drug as pure methylone powder via an internet order, our chemical analyses indicated that the drug was composed of about 60% methylone (120 mg) and 38% **5-MeO-MIPT (76 mg)**. This case report suggests that clinicians should be alert to the possibility of the emergence of methylone or 5-MeO-MIPT intoxication, and substance-related mental disorder may be complicated by combined use of other psychoactive drugs.​*

The person THOUGHT they were doing a 186mg dose of pure methylone and ended up doing 120mg M1 plus 76mg (!!!) 5-MeO-MIPT.


OF COURSE THEY ENDED UP IN THE ER!  76 mg is, all would agree a MASSIVE OVERDOSE of 5-MeO-MIPT.  The stupid "researchers" (HA!) should have been flogged or at least docked some course credits or pay... they certainly ought to have know that is WAAAY outside normal dosing guidelines, and that this ONE SINGLE incident in NO way by any stretch of the imagination proves whatever the hell kind of squishy useless "general conclusion" they are trying to make.  These are merely a couple medical hacks attempting to cash in on anti-drug hysteria and increase their "Publication Count" on their fucking inflated asshole resumes.

That case report actually has some pretty surprising data. I find it unlikely that the guy actually ingested 76mg of 5-meo-mipt. He would certainly have died or at least have had much worse symptoms than mentioned in the report. The chromatograms they supply agrees with their 60% methylone 38% 5-meo-mipt hypothesis but it is possible that the powder was not mixed homogenously. So, the patient could have had a much lower amount of 5-meo-mipt. Regardless, the supplier needs to be shot in the face.


"Thirty minutes later, he started to feel nausea and sick in the stomach, and visited one of his friends for help. In his friend's room, he shouted with agitation. He fell down on the floor, and he kicked around in a prone position aimlessly. He kept crying out that he felt very lonely, all is vanity, and added that he took a recreational drug “methylone” bought via internet. Soon an ambulance arrived, and medical technicians could not carry him because of his psychomotor excitement."

"His temperature was 37.8 °C, pulse 150 bpm, and blood pressure 144/81 mm Hg."

"One and half hours after risperidone treatment, his symptoms disappeared and he could communicate coherently."

"Two weeks after recovery from acute intoxication, he did not exhibit any residual symptoms including a depressive mood or euphoria. He, however, had no recollection of his experience during acute intoxication."


The pulse and blood pressure readings are way below what I'd expect at that dose. At 12-14mg, my BP, HR was 155/110, 130. The temperature increase is not that dramatic so serotonin syndrome is unlikely. Toxicity was probably more from the 5-meo-mipt.


Anyway 5-meo-mipt and methylone I think is a bad idea physiologically speaking because of the strong adrenergic effects of both drugs.


Visitor Q - 2cb on the comedown probably won’t do much due rapid receptor downregulation but should be safe.

I must say I had a magickal day and that 5-MeO-MiPT now holds a warm little spot in my heart.

I started with a 6-7mg dose and contrary to some reports, the come-up was quite comfortable (but yes, a little case of tryptamine shakes) and slow. No visuals but a definite ++ was set in place.


I took another 6-7mg 5 hours later and in the evening indulged in some MDMA.

The Nitrous and Ketamine was out of this world but very intense... not for everyone.

Time disappeared, or so it seemed.


My friend O and I spent the whole day listening to tons of eclectic music. The soundscapes were unfathomable. I must agree that it must also be a GREAT sex drug. More so than MDMA for me I think.


The 2C-B on the comedown was very nice. Added some much appreciated visuals and a comfortable afterglow.


Overall 5-MeO-MiPT was for me a very smooth and pleasant ride. I understand now why it has been called the MDMA of tryptamines.


And yes, I took some vitamins, ate a little, took some 5-HTP and slept like a baby afterwards.

i do not like this tryptamine orally.

it digests into something that cranks my heart rate out the yin yang.


Now smoked even then 5-7mg smoked on a wee bowl of marijuana is perfect

You do not need much of this compound in my opinion...

I've done 70 mg of 5-MeO-MiPT (thanks to careless labelling - thought I was going for a test drive of 70 mg 3-desoxy-MDA) and had a surprisingly friendly, if powerful, trip. It seems, for me personally at least, that moxy has a very accepting and large dosage window. However, I would not recommend such dosages to anyone. It was not a threatening or alarming experience, even once I realized the mistake. After this, the ride was easy to float along with or even control - mostly felt like the dosage was overkill. Like perhaps going 20 mg overboard a moderate 2C-B trip than 4 times a chemical not much explored and possibly dangerous at that kind of dosage. I surely would not like to know what that kind of dosage is when augmented with another powerful serotonin-releaser....


One of the unique aspects of 5-meo-mipt seem to be it adaptability and acceptance regarding dosage - from 2 mg up to 20 mg it is very useful for different things in the different "dosage zones". Not at all like other tryptamines, were a minor dosing would mostly get one queasy and feel "neither here nor there".

The same duration goes for me and two friends, so I guess some generalization can be made at least. 


It is a highly pleasant and euphoric feeling with the psychedelic dimensions of both bodily tactility and the mind working in tandem, without the powerful and sometimes scary "rush" associated with 5-meo-dmt. The ramp up is slower, so it is easier to connect the amount smoked to the level one wants to achieve. 


Usually have smoked 4-10 mg during a session, with tolerance making me upping the level. Note that some saturation is felt. For me at least, this prevents doing more than 2-5 redosings. Anyway, the experience is very rewarding in a way which leaves me content and OK with leaving my psychedelic state.

I know most people don't seem to get this to the degree I had but it did have the 5-MeO-DMT like rush for me, it was pretty hard to deal with the energetic release even though I have experience with such things and focussed on it. It took meditation and some dancing and letting it out and even then I was not really comfortable with it.

The other effects people mention were so minor for me they stayed in the shadow of what I just described. And that was around 7-8 mg. Doses about 10 times as high therefore scare me if I imagine them, even if they are physically safe... as you might understand.

I don't know exactly what that was about, some day or another I need to do some new experiments with it perhaps. Needless to say I am amazed at it's popularity looking at the effect profile I got.


Regarding 5-MeO's: 5-MeO-DiPT did not give me this energy effect, it was quite comfortable and interesting overall although it was not entirely spotless on the body.

I consider the energy / rush effect a property I associate with 5-MeO's, combining many reports and my experiences with 5-MeO-MiPT and 5-MeO-DMT and comparing. Perhaps I shouldn't generalize like that, perhaps I should. It may be a powerful tapping into kundalini but it's a little too much quantitatively without feeling it well enough qualitatively for my taste. I worry that one might do some damage by misdirecting this energy as well actually.

Stanislav Grof wrote about such things in 'Spiritual Emergency' and I am reminded by what I read there.


Anyway I don't want to condemn 5-MeO-MiPT and to each their own anyway. It just may not be for me, or there may be other factors at play not taken into consideration. Like I said let me try it again someday before I start making up my mind more.

I did 8mg(90kg) on Friday and the stimulation was something I've never experienced before. I didn't leave my flat, but for about 5hrs it lasted I walked maybe 20km. I simply could not stop, if I tried to lie down I had to stand up within few seconds and walk again. I have quite alot of experience with methamphetamine and some with amphetamine and that stimulation was something much more pushy and of a really different type. In fact it didn't let me to feel anything else and there were almost no OEV and CEV. Mentaly almost nothing as well. After few hours I added 100mg of M1, but it did almost nothing to improve the overall feeling. Then I drank one bottle of wine which helped a bit, although I wouldn't call the state pleasant. Whole story was ended by stilnox after 6 hours.

I don't see why I should try it again, but I will give it a try sometimes at about 4mg to see the difference. I can't even think about any higher dose, the stimulation was really overwhelming. So carefully with the dosage if you have >98% material.

The 'almost no visuals' and the presence of this stimulation clearly depict this 5-MeO energy quality doesn't it?

Like I said: for me it was not noticable in 5-MeO-DiPT but that it may not be there in every 5-MeO-x-T experience is to me less significant in the similarities in experiences where it IS present.


Right?

I dont understand adding the M1.  First of all at only 100mg all you're gonna get from M1 is *MORE* stimulation... the "Euphoric Pulse" effects usually don't start till somewhat higher doses, even for stronger-than-typical-responders to M1.


And your ultra-stim response to the 5-meo-mipt makes me figure you must have been scammed and someone who had only stims wanted to get rid of it so claimed they had exotic tryptamines, and so you ended up doing 9mg of adderall or some other amphet.  9mg of Moxy was never that stimmy for me or for most... in fact I slowly ended up going higher in dose with only mild stimulation.


NO ONE JUMP ALL OVER ME!  I'm just saying that's MY experience is all... I know some people do have very different reactions.


Well if it was real Moxy, just goes to show how everyone's metabolism operates on a unique set of biases and so anyone can have an oddly intense (or weak) response to anything... always best to start at 1/2 the "standard recommended dose."


Try and find someone who has done Moxy before, and give them 9mg of what you have and see if THEY think it's real 5-meo-mipt or some counterfeit, or if they react the way you did.

Sure we all have our subjective experiences. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I don't understand the M1 addition either by the way...


but the stimulation from 5-MeO-MiPT, I buy that and it's not like a stimulant in my experience. It's much more of a psychedelic body load, a *visceral* energy.

I was not reminded by any amphetamine or other phenethylamine, but later experiences with 5-MeO-DMT had a very similar quality.

Something else that was similar was not only this relative absence of visuals but the visual effects that were there were of flowing energies. On 5-MeO-DMT this was seen and all the more clear with added S-ketamine. The more usual distortions, patterns, colors and morphing were replaced by this more direct feel. It was like it was more universal, preceeding everything else.


Also: I have read about descriptions that were quite like this. Uncolored flowing energies.

Last time I did 170mg of M1 and it was simply too much (into AMT+2c-d) for what I was looking for. I am not very experienced with M1 (had it only 3 times), so finding it's usage still. 100mg was too litle so next time I will go with 130-140mg. 


As far as the source is being concerned, I doubt it will be the case, it is one of the most legit and they are not selling any "speed" stuff (except 5-meo-mipt ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png))


As I've written, I do have quite a lot of experience with meth and amphetamine and this was something absolutely different.

had a recent interesting experiment with ~9mg of moxy. i think i like this chemical at lower doses tough (~6mg), as it seems to be a bit overwhelming to me at anything this high. i am quite sensitive to it though


like other have said before, i dont think this compound is to be treasured for its visuals, as it lacks in that department and they appear at higher doses and towards the second half of the trip, however, it has an inherent sexyness to it. on methylone i feel sexy because i feel confident, on this one i feel sexy because i feel like i am moving in sync with my animal side. hard to describe. but still, for me anything above 6mg is not a party drug

One of the craziest nights of my life involved a high dose of this compound.


Was 4 years ago or so when I was in college.


I do not remember the exact dose of it but it was around 30mg or so? It was also mostly snorted. The reason I believe it was around 30 mg is because I had a bunch of 6mg capsules weighed out on a real good mg scale and I believe I did 5 of them... maybe even 6 so it could have been 35mg.


Had a party at my apartment. Huge college kegger. Was shithoused.


Went up in a room with a girl and snorted adderall together (I know disgusting right)... I dont remember how many mg of adderall but prob around 35-40mg snorted.


Halfway through the adderall session I remembered I had some of this stuff. Was so drunk and spun out that me and this chick started cutting the lines of adderall with 5-meo-mipt...


We also passed it between our mouths by kissing and stuff.


Blacked out for a few hours... came too at Dennys with a group of people. Dont know how I got there ( I did not drive). Was looking at my food and it was going everywhere. I was hallucinating hardcore.


Woke up the next morning in my neighbors house (didnt even make it home lol)....


Had no idea where I was or how I got there but was tripping fucking hardcore. Insane OEV's my mind was flying high.


I did not want to be tripping since it was the next morining still and I believed I had consumed the dose hours on end ago... didnt really remember...


Went to my roomate who had some percocets... took 3 or them (15mg oxycodone)... and then the trip ended once the opiates kicked in. 


I am planning in the near future to write some addition TR about this compound. I have consumed it ~20 times between 2006-2008 and used it fairly heavily in winter 2007.


Have combined it with some substances including absinthe, adderall, ambien (FUCKING INSANE) and prob a few more that I cannot think of right now.

So, the word sexadelic comes to mind when I read this statement. That is pretty much exactly what I like about moxie to be honest. Everything is a tool and for certain things I like to bring out the sexiness. Go tiger.

Moxy is really sexy. The first time I had a major trip on this stuff i couldn't believe it. My horniness just kept growing and growing, everyone and everything just looked so damn fine I just wanted to bathe in the cosmic orgy around me. Tastes, sounds, colours, they all set off cascades of a type of pleasure I'd never felt before, not like that. That was on a high dose as well actually. But it's weird; on a low dose it was a completely different experience. Still psychedelic, but a much more serious tone. Which could have been down to the setting of course (out in nature) but it felt quite different, a bit more shroomified than anything.

Going by the recommended dosages on Bluelight it was far too high actually. I took 15mg at T+00:00 and went to a bar, and at about T+02:00 took another 20mg capsule, followed by another two 20mg capsules about T+02:45. Another friend took the same doses minus one capsule at T+02:45, and yet another friend took the same regimen minus the T+02:45 dose. We all had solid trips, but the dosage differences were evident between us from how we were describing our trips to each other. Although I wouldn't tell anyone to take this much, it was far and away my best experience with moxy.


Now this is strange, because I tripped moderately from just 10mg of the same batch, on a previous and completely different occasion. And many other people I shared this with found 10mg to be just lovely, many saying that it was the best thing ever and such. I hadn't tripped in a long while when I had my high-dose trip, and the only other drugs I had in my system was the daily diazepam I was taking at the time (which my friends were not).

Good point. The 10mg trip was the first from the batch, and the 75mg trip was the last. Everything in between seemed fine without any noticeable loss, but there was a couple of months of sobriety before the 75mg trip. I suppose it could have oxidized, and if it was I should really be keeping my current batch in the freezer.

75mg. whoa that is crazy. Well, perhaps my aim is in fact a little low with this one. I am wondering now . . . hmm. 


So, on that dose you were able to function or were you somewhere else functioning differently (in your head) or whatever. Could you see *this* subjective as it may be reality?

I doubt your batch would have degraded that much in just a few months?

Short term tolerance? According to your statement you waited two hours until you redosed the first time. Ime, redosing like this with tryptamines is usually fairly inefficient, and will not do much, except maybe extend the duration somewhat. Also set and setting comes into play.

Yeah the staggered dosing could be an issue with moxy. I certainly wouldn't want to tell anyone to jump in at that amount, as my experience could have been an anomaly. I would like to try it again at that dose sometime and see how it goes, especially since I'm tripping infrequently now.


RatTailRiot, I was still on planet earth for that experience. At no point during it did I feel that I would lose control of my faculties or that I was heading for a classic 'ego-death', though I wouldn't rule the possibility out on even higher doses still. As a comparison, a similar dose of DPT takes me completely else-where.

Alright, that helps a little bit. Moxie can be tricky in general with the dose curve but I could see myself getting over the weirdness that higher doses tend to feel like. We'll see. I would never want to jump from 14 to 75. That would just be too much of a gap there.

I found 30-35mg to provide a fairly strong trip. Make sure you can handle the bodyload that comes with it though.

I found it to have very mild OEV's. I ate doses of about 12-15mg a few times in a night, I kept dosing up cause I puked and didn't think I would have absorbed the last dose so I ate more.

First taste of 5-meo-mipt today, at 6mg. I was hoping for something short and less than a full trip, but enjoyable. What I got, at first, was one hour of sitting on the toilet with liquid pouring out of my ass. Just saying. (Mostly empty stomach before taking it. Maybe that's part of the problem.)


After that it was a nice high, and particularly nice when I smoked some weed. I was able to do some productive writing. Nice. Too bad about the initial discomfort or else I'd consider trying it again...

Years ago Xorkoth provided details of a combination of 5-MeO-MiPT and 2C-C.  Does anyone have exerience with combining 5-MeO-MiPT and 2C-D at roughly the same doses as Xorkoth's report?

> 			I'd like to report an enjoyable combination I tried yesterday, 5-MeO-MiPT with 2C-C.  I took either 8 or 10mg of 5-MeO-MiPT (my standard dose range, can't recall anymore which it was), along with 25mg of 2C-C, both orally at the same time.  I then proceeded to go to a beautiful outdoor place near my apartment.  The combination was not any stronger than 5-MeO-MiPT by itself (which is to say, it's very nice but non-invasive and allows for near-"normal" human interaction).  The 2C-C was subordinate to the 5-MeO-MiPT, but what it did was create a very pleasant change in the tryptamine, softening all of its edges and smoothing out the body high.  I felt very groovy and inspired for hours.  Colors were vibrant and saturated, as with 5-MeO-MiPT alone,  and there was an added element of 2C-C's softening of the vision, with subtle flowing shapes.  The experience lasted for a good 5 hours, and was very pleasant and enjoyable and light.

> It wasn't anything spectacular, but I've found 5-MeO-MiPT unpleasant to mix with some things, and it most certainly was not with 2C-C.  The 2C-C seemed to solve all of the slightly edgy feelings of 5-MeO-MiPT while grounding it a bit more as well.  Whenever I decide to use 5-MeO-MiPT again, I will probably use the same fose, but use more like 40mg of 2C-C along with it.

The notion of combining 5-MeO-MiPT with another substance will have to be reconsidered later.  The power of 8mg was significant - slight (but not ignorable) OEVs, brilliant pulsing CEVs, erotic drive, racing heart, anxiety, some confusion and inability to focus, some jittery clumsiness during the onset, no euphoria.  Altogether not the most pleasant mix of effects - heart rate was too high to comfortably bring 2C-D into the picture.  Quite a bit stronger than previous experiences at 5mg, which I've found fun, but generally underwhelming.  


For those who have tried 5-MeO-MiPT at 8mg as well as higher doses, what were your observations on the changes in effects as you stepped up the dose, say into the 10-12mg range?  Some posts here suggest that anxiety may be less present in that range.

I've used this one orally several times, but my two best trips on this compound were at ~~7-9 mgs rectally administered.


For me, it was very erotic, minimal body load, very altered field of vision but minimal CEV's, although CEV's were still present, mostly in the form of trails.  I found 5-meo-mipt to have a good mix of trippy cerebral effects alongside some very nice tactile effects.


My girlfriend whom I tried both of these rectal 5-meo-mipt trips with agreed with me on the first trip we attempted; good psychedelic sexy time all around.  On the second trip, my girlfriend suffered some pretty intense gastro intestinal distress, which included moderate stomach aches and cramping, and several rounds of moderate diarrhea-ass-pissing.  After she got over that, pretty much nothing more good came of the trip for her.  I spent that whole trip on the bed ignoring whatever good effects I was getting because I felt sooooo bad for her having a bad time.


Lesson =  5-meo-mipt might make you piss out your ass, so take all neccessary precautions with this one.  I do recall some experiments with this compound, where I took it orally at doses under 10 mgs and I found the muscle tension to be quite overbearing.  I don't seem to have muscle tension issues when taking it rectally though.

I found that if I aim for a psychedelic experience, I should take the whole dose at once. Or at least, take large enough first dose. 

12 mg produced nice psychedelic effects, but 5 mg followed by 10 mg at T+1:15-1:30, not.


Also, does anybody notice this "sweet", "sugar" feeling in the head after higher doses?

I'd like to hear peoples' best guesses at a maximum "safe" dosage(low risk of physical harm).  I realize I can cause myself severe physical harm by tripping too hard and losing awareness, but I would certainly have a trip sitter if I decide to push it to that level, hopefully mitigating that risk.


Also, as far as starting low goes, how long after ingestion(most likely oral) does it become wasteful to redose?  I'm not trying to just jump in at 20mg, end up being one of the sensitive people, and freak the fuck out. However, I would also like to move past the lower levels as I experience them if they're not particularly to my liking.  Is there a glass ceiling to booster doses or is it fairly easy to adjust the trip to your purposes?


I have read the posts involving redosing and high doses, but they seem to be as varied as the lower dose reports.  On a final note, I realize there is a severe shortage of official information in this regard and am prepared to take any and all advice at my own risk.

I think it is around 15 mg. As you can see, some people report 30-35 mg as OK, and others get severe side-effects: check [recent Survived Abortion's report](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=568381)

I found that redosing after 1 hour is wasteful. It insesifies and prolonges trip, but without really changing the nature of experience. In other words, for me 12 mg > 5 + 10 mg after 1:15.

I like it ALOT better than Foxy, which I found to be just sort of weirdish (though I can see how the body buzz foxy gives led to it being given that name, remember that it was among the first generation of "designer drugs," and that perhaps we've got more/better choices nowadays).


I had good luck with 5-Meo-Mipt doses in the range of 18-22mg (though 9-12 is certainly feelable,  for me a bit more was preferable), never felt anything bad, though it seemed like that was "enough" and my body really would not want me to go beyond that range.  Initial body buzz, often erotic, with some shimmery visual effects, turning more deeply psychedelic at 3-5 hours in.  Nice.  ***Multifaceted.***


By the way the 5MEO aspect means its pretty stable when vaped/smoked, and tiny little bumps of 2-5mg can be put atop ash or some herb and used for some very quick effective but modest trippy rushes... not as profound as a full oral dose and much shorter acting, but useful in their own right.  (Psychedelic crack?  Well doesn't really have the intense rushing euphoria for it to be called that I don't think, and some people just dont care for the unique feeling, though most probably do)

I took 12mg and another 3mg bump a couple hours in and had one of the most intense trips of my life... more visually intense than my 60mg 2c-e trip. also the first time I lost my shit in awhile, had a bit of a panic attack midway through... I think i was too overwhelmed by the visual aspect because the first 3 or so hours were almost completely nonvisual. out of nowhere i'm experiencing crazy OEVs with very vivid synesthesia (something i almost never get from drugs like LSD and 2c-e which are known to cause it) and my CEVs were absolutely INSANE. 


this chem was very interesting and unlike many other psychedelics i've tried... for the most part i really enjoyed it and have to say that it has quite a bit of potential.

are the erotic effects lost at higher, fully psychedelic doses? because I didn't experience much tactile enhancement.. but i might just not get that effect from the teh moxy ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

I don't know about you guys...


I've had LSD on blotter for years and this 5-meo-mipt is fucking horrible, there is nothing funny or mood enlightening about that tryptamine. It felt more artificial than anything I've ever had (and I snorted some powdered pcp before) and the body stimulation coupled with the ego loss at ~9.5mg was a bit too much considering what I expected. It didn't have the wavy, watery feeling of lsd (which to me is it's only bodyload), I felt like I had to move but then my heart rate went to about 140 during the come up and first hour then time started dilate just as I was thinking "Oh well, at least this is a short one". 


So I tried to reach for my benzos to get the Fear out, which I only felt on about 7-8 hits of 'cid, but no dice, even if it wasn't visual in the least, my mind was confused my pounding heart rate distracted me in my search for my bottle of valiums, getting in a spiral of confusion and fear. So I actually went to the ER to get some (I imagined they would only think I was in benzo withdrawal, which worked), was given 2mg of ativan then walked out of the hospital (very short ordeal, can't believe it, I was out after 1h15). Then later the stimulation went away and it became more like what I like from psychs, just like a lot of people in this thread noticed. But I was so tired and insulted by this compound, that I can only say one thing right now :


As a very seasoned psych user, in my opinion, 5-meo-mipt is fucking horrible. Never having a 5-meo-something ever again.

**Follow-up**


Hrm, this isn't good. Dosed saturday night at midnight, so let's say it was sunday.


The day after I was alright, but yesterday I started feeling some dizziness mixed with panic attacks and feeling like I'm losing control....I never had any such feelings from my 200+ lsd doses (over a 9 year span). I have intermittent headaches and pain in the neck and ears. Had horrible thoughts of doing stupid crap. But the worst of all symptoms is definitely A GODDAMN DIZZINESS THAT WON'T GO AWAY, even when sitting!


Getting out of the shower earlier was more like getting out of a boat. Strangely I can walk without problems. I just have this feeling of being disconnected and subjective dizziness. This isn't good at all....I hope this goes away in the next few days. I'm already ill enough from other things as it is.

^Don't worry - I promise you'll be fine. I believe that the diziness is serotonin related. I remember on my last high-dose trip with this substance I was phasing in and out of the liminal threshold of consiousness for a few hours toward the end of the trip. I remember thinking there was a reminiscence of brain zaps, but different. I think it felt more like being on the verge of serotonin syndrome. This leads me to believe that it may somewhat release serotonin in to the synapses at high doses.


You may feel out of sorts for a few days after the trip, since it seems the mild serotonin effects last for quite a while beyond the trip. You will gradually notice those effects diminishing til you don't notice them anymore. 


The headaches you can somewhat control, by meditation. These substances are actually useful for preventing certain types of headaches, but you can feel the vascular action from high dose moxy trips lingering well after the trip is over. 5-MeO-MiPT is quite like 5-MeO-DMT in the head feeling it gives you. It's like there's something furious going on inside there. Using meditation you can actually make something positive of these effects.

Wierd.  My body must just be prediaposed to tryptamines.  Taking this around in range 15-20mg was smooth and lovely, zero issues or complaints.

Oh I can handle the tryptamine that's in shrooms alright <_<


Today I seem to have come back to normality, which is awesome, the dizziness and dissociation and bad thoughts are gone, although, my heart rate sometimes goes to over 100 again for no discernible reasons.


My position on 5-meo-mipt stands. Although I'd try simple MiPT if possible.

I'm planning on using 5-Meo-Mipt during the day on saturday and later I will go out clubbing. Is it safe to use amphetamine later in the evening or are there any bad interactions?


The 5-Meo-Mipt will be dosed at around 1 pm and I will go clubbing at 11 pm.

I know it will be over, but since it is a research chemical I wanted to know if there could be any dangerous interactions with residual amounts of 5-meo-mipt still in my system.


Is there e.g. any risk of serotonine syndrome if I end up taking MDxx later? And does 5-meo-mipt deplete neurotransmitters or does it bind straight to the receptors?

I don't know the exact way 5-MeO-MIPT acts on the Monoamines but be warned. I'm into the RC thing for 5 years now and tried a lot of combinations (some blissful some weird) but the most frightening experience in my life was a combination of 7mg 5-MeO-MIPT and 100mg bk-MDMA. I suffered from cancer - I know what fear is, but this combination is so stupid and left me with trauma like symptoms for 3 weeks now. Including some mild HPPD. I knew about the risk of this combination so a friend and I took the low dosed bk-MDMA 7 hours after the 5-MeO-MIPT. As long as the bk-MDMA acted there were no complications but 10 hours after the 5-MeO-MIPT ingestion there started something really wrong in our bodies. It was definately a serotonin syndrome. I called a medical service for help but was able to get the situation under control with controlled breathing and a sober person next to me. My heart was racing and sometimes seemed to stop beating. I had an extremely dry mouth a weird headache, very high body temperature, cramps all over my body I have never experienced before and weird pain in my breast. My respiration seemed to by dissociated from my unconscious so I had to breath by myself. I also began to have strong visuals. The "attacks" came in waves. In one moment I was nearly sober and suddenly my heart began to beat faster and faster. It was beating so fast that I nearly blacked out (probably because of overstimulation). The tricky thing about this was the fact that these symptoms first developed after all the effects had weared of. I felt so safe during the experience that I considered redosing.... I'm alive because I didn't.


The ungood fealing in my breast lasted for 5 days. I was mildly tripping the following 2 weeks. And some traumatic feelings still come up at least once a day. I was unable to sleep the first days after the experience propably due to the trauma. My friend wasn't affected so much.... he didn't know as much about the possible consequences as I did so he had more trust that everything was going to be alright.

It seems that everything is in order again. The by now mild HPPD symptoms still decrease. I stay abstinent to give my brain some chance for regeneration.


Please excuse my english but I wanted to share this and don't have much time for correction.

I don't mean to trivialize your experience but I doubt that 100mg methylone and 7mg 5-meo-mipt caused a dangerous situation or serotonin system... always be cautious though.

I did appr. 30 mgs of this compound on saturday. I'm a 240lbs male and it felt i could go higher.


Brightly colored CEV's, no real mindfuck or euphoria for that matter. When i layed down on my bed and sunk deeper into the CEV's there were brainzaps.


I found that uncomfortable, but opening my eyes and moving around prevented further zaps.


Bodyload was manageable, altough i did go for a walk early into the trip and that wasn't a good idea, tbh. 


There's some restlesness but no boundless energy.


Slightly elevated heartrate, and most of the trip was over in 4 hours.


Mipt is interesting, not very social but it is erotic though. 


Visually better than 4-HO-MET, but 4-HO has less of a bodyload and more of a mindfuck.

Yes, i did 4-HO three weeks prior to 5-ACO and, for me at least, 4-HO does not have the same level of visuals.

Got 5-MeO-MiPT today. I've never tried it, the closest would be 5-MeO-DiPT which I used tens of times years ago. I'm not usually a fan of 5-MeO's, but hopefully I'll have a nice trip. Going to try it on saturday. I haven't yet decided if I will take it orally or vaporize it. Still a bit unsure about the dose, but I think 10 mg will be good for a starter if taken orally. My last psychedelic trip was so intense that I think I'll just keep it at the lower edge this time and try to enjoy the trip without searching for much introspectiveness.

Dont vape.  It can be done this way but its a very short term trip that lacks the drugs full proper effects.  10mg swallowed should be about perfect.  Body buzz and moderate psychedelic vibe and mild visual effects etc from 30min - 3hrs.  THEN PAY ATTENTION and WATCH/FEEL for the unique "Second Wind" effect... rise of a whole other feeling... supremely deeply but somehow gently full blown psychedelic effects,  highly euphoric cosmic emotional state, strong OEV and CEV visions, a tickling or tingling in middle of forehead (Pineal gland stimulation?), feeling of bliss, telepathy, opening of the 3rd Eye, sensations that you are connected to all life on the planet at once, and a feeling of a cool perfumed breeze blowing through your head.  SWEET!   At least that what it does to me, rather consistently.

^Yeah, vapourizing is just a bit of a novelty it seems. Oral dosing produces a full-range trip, very valuable. I wouldn't want to undercut the full trip that oral dosing gives. 10mg should be a good dose to start out with.

I doubt 10mg will give many people strong CEVs and OEVs consistently. Those only come out at higher doses for me and others. 


I wouldn't be so quick to write off smoking though, although I haven't tried it myself. There is probably some value in it, I've read that it is easier to reach transcendent/ego-loss type states with smoking the drug. If you have plenty of moxy, it might be worth a go. But it is wasteful, yeah.

^ yea I agree, for best effects, balance between bodyload and trip effects, I do just about 20mg maybe 16-18.  But for a first try 10 is appropriate.

Actually you can get off smoking, not too wastefull though I think... only kinda short term though, vaping little 5mg bumps atop some ash in a pipe till you feel as high as you are wanting.  A pleasant novelty but if you are impatient for SOME kind of "buzz" that does work.  But not the best use for this rather unique and magical substance.

Agreed; my doses are usually quite a bit higher than that, but my pilot dose was 10mg and it wasn't too overwhelming. At that dose it didn't, as you say, elicit prominient sensory or sensual effects, but it was easily enough to get a good feel for the space. I wouldn't want to push someone in too deep on their very initial try either, since many people report sub 10mg doses to be just their thing, and because I have myself discovered a bodyload with this chemical at the higher doses (30mg and up). This bodyload seems to be inconsistent, in that it doesn't always appear, even at higher doses.

I know live reports aren't allowed here and it's not my intention to write on either. But I took 12 mg and this must be the most horrible body load i've ever experienced. I've vomited 4 times already and feel like just vomiting more. There are visuals, yes, but the nausea is too extreme to enjoy anything. I have a hard time imagining this is a suitable compund for me.

These psychoactives are so strange... I dont get any nausea off this... just a bit of bodyload that is at times kinda dizzy and at times kinda enjoyable actually.  Everyone's body reacts differently I guess.  Well too bad this one is so hard on your stomach... oh well... Next!

There is a bodyload with this. I don't get nausea with it but there is quite a 5-meo-dmt -ish bodyload that accompanies it, along with some alarming vasoconstriction at higher doses. The best thing to do is to encourage yourself to purge and you will feel wonderful. Putting yourself in to a calming setting can make all the difference, and really turn any negative sensations in to positive ones that you can relax with. I get nausea on LSA seeds sometimes, and purging is a really refreshing thing.

I didn't get a real bodyload from 5-15 mg doses of 5-MeO-MiPT. Some muscle tension similar to 5-MeO-DMT, yes, but not bodyload. 5-MeO-MiPT is nice and mellow for me, although it showes real psychedelic properties when going higher - to 10+ mg doses. 


And physical side effects from 5-MeO-MiPT aren't comparable to those of 5-MeO-DiPT.

I IV'd 5 mg of this substance about 4 hours ago, almost back to baseline by now, but figured I'd report my findings since I haven't seen too much info about injecting this particular compound. Nothing too profound to be noted at this dosage, but there was a definite tactile enhancement with classical tryptamine visuals (eg. shimmering, waving.) Music sounds quite enhanced, and I have a general sense of calm and well being throughout the experience (not to mention waves of extreme euphoria). Will definitely be experimenting with this route at higher dosages in the future.

So I reached 47 without ever having to take a trip to the Hospital on a drug related emergency. Broke the duck yesterday. All kinds of stupid carelessness behind it. Mostly, I suspect, the rookie error of taking as much as you took last time after a gap, forgetting about tolerance. Cocktailing smoked MDPV with 5-MEO-MIPT for a pleasant evening of what the Profanisaurus calls Stingwanking. (Referring to his tantric marathon shags rafher than any pain. As you like though.)


Measured 12mg of the Moxy and insufflated and just poured Peeevee into the vaporiser and took till I stopped. One can always reheat and given my unfortunate fondness for this stuff my tokerance is high, Still, a dopaminergen and serotoninergen to take the edge off the paranoia is a familiar combo and the eventual outcome surprised me. I think redosing while fucked was to blame. T'was ever thus. Eyeballed a generous 20mg of Mipt cos the Sartorius scale is so heavy and on my bedroom floorboards it acts a little like a seismograph. (Too late to use another room.) Given the dense nature of the material it could have been 30 plus.


Split into two piles but certainly didn't wait near long enough between them to see how strongly each would hit. ("Stupid arsehole and mindless drug hoover", I hear the sensible amongst you cry. I concur.) Felt fantastic and topping it with a pipe of Peevee the very stuff of heaven. Very jittery on the motor control skills though. Would take me an age to figure out how to get the mouse to move the cursor across the screen without traversing an area on the desk of the same size. Had to really think to lift the damned thing up and move it back without moving the icon. Sounds ludicrous but in the light of what followed only a minor hassle.


Lay sleepless and sweaty in the dark from four till eight expecting to have a crappy tired day and an early bed as ever when I break the school night rule. In my defence I had a very quiet weekend at the 'rents and got in to postal joy. Foregone conclusion really. Tried to rise at eight. By now expected light residual effects and to feel shitty. Not so and so much worse. You know the bad days when you overcooked it and you feel like a robot or retard jmposter has taken your place. Kurt Vonnegut calls that guy Phillboyd Studge. Well I felt that to the nth degree. Not only that, (and this is the real reason for posting, so someone else this dumb knows it ended ok,) I had what I can only describe as cognitive and coordinational deficits. Could not manage to work out spatial stuff. An  example, on the way to hospital one sleeve of the denim jacket was inside out and the topological manoevering required to fix it was completely impossible.


More examples and a swift exit as it's well over 56 hours since I slept. Driving was not only baffling but terrifying. (yes, yes I knowe, no lectures please, I didn't realise how bad it was until attempting such a complex multi coordinational task. In hindsight, the fact it took 10 minutes to work out how the belt worked on my trousers should have been a clue.) . So poor was my ability to judge relative position/motiom/time that every corner was hugely oversteered leaving me winding from side to side along the road after even slight bends. Eventually, whist trying desperately to get home without crashing or dying, I hit the curb hard enough to blow out the front tyre. Changing the wheel was not fun. And it was raining. Instant Karma I guess. Luckily no Karma police followed.


The other odd symptom was freezing up and not being able to get going again. Changing gear was a nightmare for that and I thought that a taxi driver was going to slap me for not managing to find reverse. Improvised some swearing arouind the gearbox being on the way out. Don't think he believed me as speech all day was a machine gun rapid uninflected monotone. (Even more than usual some might claim) Of course the freezing led to thoughts of Parkinsonism. Either a minor stroke or Parkinsons. Nice choice. ("Bad news. You have Cancer and Alzheimers." "Oh well at least I don't have Cancer".)


Pretty scared by now. An exchange of texts persuaded me to go to ER. Given the symptoms it was the right choice but left to my indolent cowardly devices I would have tried to sleep it off first. Arrived at Hospital around 9 that night genuinely presuming all drugs would have gone in the preceding 15 hours and thus I had fucked my brain. Got processed fairly swiftly so it seems initially so did the docs. All the scrunch your face up and the follow my finger stuff for Neuro diagnosis. Walk in a straight line, what's the date etc. Gradually the waiting got longer and I sensed a shift in attitude from some nurses who began giving me the skunk eye as a worthless self inflicted substance abuser. 


By around 2:30 A.M I was beginning to feel more like myself although still pretty shaky. The doctor began taking a load more bloods and stuck me on a Saline drip. I think this was as much punitive as curative as I would have happily gone home after consuming a liter of Dioralyte or similar and to the same dual purpose, rehydration and urine sample. Cranked it to max, unkinked the line, kept my hand as low as possible and prayed for extra gravity to speed it up. THey added a second and put me in with the roarers and the pukers friom that night's gutter sweeping. Although I must say by this stage they had been transformed into the snorers and the farters (and mumblers). Of course sleep was impossible and I was very tired by now. They wanted me to stay till rounds the next day but foolishly overestimating my familiarity with night buses I signed out against medical advice. Still the hour-and-a half-walk was probably fair punishment.


Anyway on the positive side I now have a brand new section in my permanent medical history as a problem drug user. Hope I don't need painkillers anytime soon. 


Harm reduction endnote- If this has happened to you it may go away on its own and I thought the odd symptoms and duration worth leaving a record to reduce fear in  anyone going through it. I still recommend a hospital visit though. It may actually be a transient ischaemic thing or precusor to a stroke or aneurism. You get two of most organs but only one brain and if you are on bluelight chances are you punish it enough already. (Well you could get a brain transplant I suppose but I doubt the prospect of that solution pleases)

Has anyone ever tried a combination of 5-MeO-MIPT and GHB? I've used 5-MeO-MIPT as a sex enhancer and have had fantastic results with it. I've heard that GHB is also a phenomenal sex enhancer but have never tried it. Anyone ever tried putting the two together?

I've taken this 3 times at 7.5 mg, 8 mg, and 10 mg. I took the 10 mg at an outdoor My Morning Jacket show and was floored. Literally, I was so overwhelmed that I was on the ground lying on my back. At times I didn't know I was at a concert as I was so far into my head obsessing about the fact that I was leaving for college in two weeks and I thought I was going to break up with my girl friend.

**5 meo-mipt**


Hello all.  I have been lurking for a while, but this is my first post so I would like to start off by saying this seems to be a great community.  I appreciate the cohesion, and willingness to assist those in need of assistance.  Without places like this, I am sure there would be many that would make decisions they regret.


Introductions aside, here is my question.


Someone I know has recently acquired 5 MEO-MIPT, and it has a brown tint to it.  Looks very much like brown sugar I guess.  This is the first time any of us has seen this substance, but all of the pictures that I have been able to find on the net for 5 MEO-MIPT look white, or slightly off-white in color.  So for anyone who has experience with "moxy" what color should it be, and are there test kite available on the net that would identify the substance.  Any, and all feedback will be greatly appreciated.

Hello and welcome to Bluelight / PD ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Check this thread:

[http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/...esults-for-stim-empathogen-2C-X-RC-s-amp-more](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/512598-Marquis-Mecke-Mandellin-results-for-stim-empathogen-2C-X-RC-s-amp-more)


There are different test kits/reagents that show certain colors for 5-MeO-MiPT but the color result is not conclusive whatsoever.

Unfortunately only real analysis is.


We do not allow ID threads so I must tell you right away that we cannot go deep into the matter of finding out what it is you have or in other words, if you in fact have 5-MeO-MiPT. The only thing I can say is that a brown color like that says little to qualify it and also little to disqualify it. I understand your concern but it would be wise to also be concerned and therefore careful, if it were just a white color.


You could sample it but at your own responsibility or peril, if you are worried about it (and really this is good practice in general) start off with no more than 1/10th of what normal dose for the drug you would take. Or even 1/100th. The less you take and slower you increase the safer it is. This is called titrating.


Now in the future I'd like to ask you to use the Psychedelic Index (link in my signature), the search engine - especially the advanced engine and the Beginner's FAQ. I recommend you start with the FAQ because it is written exactly to point you in the right directions and let you use the forum like you are supposed to.

Since you are a newcomer I will leave the thread open for you to respond, but as for continuing to discuss your 5-MeO-MiPT matter please find our Big & Dandy 5-MeO-MiPT Thread and copy both our posts there.


Oh, 5-MeO-MiPT should be white yes. But an overwhelming majority of such drugs are supposed to be white if they are pure. Still that doesn't mean you should not be alarmed if some compound comes green or purple to you.

5-MeO-DALT is structurally similar and that one is sometimes a bit similar to brown sugar. So I'm afraid this does not solve your question, it might make it more complicated.


be safe + take care


Sol.

POINT 1


I once got some of this and it was a little brownish, I asked vender and was told it is "oxidation" which this chem seems prone to, not to worry, effects will be the same as pure white batch I got previously, which was in fact the case.


POINT 2


With all due respect, the search tool on site here SUCKS.  Please get someone to reprogram it.  Expressions with AND and/or OR (hehe I love saying that!) as well as literal strings in quotes just seem to confuse it horribly.  And at a site with SOOOO much content the ability to accurately use such search methods is ESSENTIAL and it is ridiculous and pathetic that BL has gone so many damn years with such a horrible search tool, just totally inexcusable.... please forward this to your manager or whoever Solipsis, darling.  Anyway, just USE GOOGLE!  Start the search box with site:bluelight.ru then use whatever combination of AND (must be in caps), OR (also needs to be capitalized), minus sign (exclude following term), and quotes (exact literal string match including spaces) to zero in precisely on what you are trying to find.  1000% more useful than the native search results.


OK OK sorry for the bitch session, I am done now ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Thanks for the response Solipsis, and for the link to the analysis thread.  You are correct, in the case of tryptamines it seems the reagents give the same results for most of them.  I apologize for posting an ID type of thread, I should have read the rules before posting.  I am an old school cat with the utmost respect for psychedelics, and their wonderful effects, so I have read all about titrating doses of RC's.  This is actually the very first RC i will be trying other than the RC's within the cannabinoid spectrum.  Once I begin my experimentation (waiting on my tanita 1210n) it should be easy enough to identify the substance due to the dosage, effects, and dosage response curve differences between the tryptamines.  I am really hoping the substance is 5 MeO-MIPT as opposed to the DALT.  From all of the reports I have read the MIPT seems so versatile where as the DALT seems kinda blah, and one sided.  


Mr. Hoover 

Thank you for your response, and I could not agree with you more in regards to the search function.  Oh, and props on the search tips using Google.  Very good info.![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I didn't mean to imply that I think it is either 5-MeO-MiPT or 5-MeO-DALT, although I have trouble remembering if phenethylamines ever show up appearing a bit like brown sugar. I have a product sold as 5-MeO-DALT to an acquaintance, that has been reported by erowid to contain quite different compounds (I believe cathinones) considering the source, and it has a lightbrown sugary crystal like texture. For your information, I have done absolutely nothing with it and might never... except maybe have it tested at the lab out of curiosity.

As far as I am aware cathinones are sometimes attempted to (re)crystallize but in the far majority of cases are in powder form. If in crystal form like methylone or mephedrone for example, I hear that sparkly small crystals have been available, but this sounds much different from the rough brownish sugary stuff I have. Which reminds me more of the similar appearing 5-MeO-DMT that I have.


Now I don't mean to limit your scope like I said, it is inappropriate for me to give you the idea that you can analyse what you have by looking at it. The point is that you might very well have an entirely different and unexpected compound in a wholly different class and who knows of it's potency.


I guess I thought it is more convenient to expect 5-MeO-MiPT and risk having something like 5-MeO-DALT (or of course completely different things) than the other way around in a certain way. The approach should be the same and should take into account that it might be a very potent material like DOX...


Hopefully the info is of assistance but of course keep as careful as you already were ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Let me just tell you my impression of a few compounds in light of your expectactions about the two 5-MeO's we mention: 5-MeO-MiPT itself was to me closer to 5-MeO-DMT than 5-MeO-DiPT, it felt like a power surge to be honest. But I was not really able to put it to much use... This sort of bodyload type energy effect can be marvelous if you can manipulate it by dancing, meditating, doing tantric yoga or perhaps other things such as t'ai chi but it can also be an unintended load to bear. I believe that it has potential, yes - that even untrained people can feel the energy flow as something ecstatic, but I expect not without full effort.

5-MeO-DiPT feels like the energy is more bound, I remember two trips with it - spaced apart about a week - at least one of them with ketamine. The ketamine took away most of the body troubles and/or synergized to make it bearable. The body sensations felt very reptilian, I recommend a dissociative to smoothen it out like that and create a whole new combination that produced a pretty alien experience.

Actually this is the first time I am connecting this memory to my experience with 5-MeO-DMT combined with ketamine...  the result of that was also stellar, which again leads me to my 5-MeO-tryptamine + dissociative endorsement. Apparently a part of the somatic energetic effects are muffled by a dissociative but it also helps to guide the energy flow.


Yes when it comes to 5-MeO tryptamines I think dissociative regimens/supplementing could be very interesting to investigate!


This thread will probably be merged with the 5-MeO-MiPT thread...


dvs1 do you foresee a purpose of this thread beyond this point?

Again, many thanks for the responses. I will definitely have to remember the 5 MeO tryp/dissociative combo idea. I am rather fond of k myself, its been years since my last experience.  This could be a good reason to seek it out once again.  I do not see any further purpose for this thread, so go ahead and merge if you would like.  Last note, I rather enjoy this forum.  Think I may stick around a while.


Moderator edit: and merged they are!

Has anyone else noticed that the trip setting makes a huge difference with this chemical? I've done 13mgs at an apartment with a few friends and had a fairly straight up psychedelic experience with it (some visuals, some of the classic psychedelic head-space for lack of a better term, mood lift). I've also done 17mgs at a bar/club and had nothing approaching that. It was far more just mood lift and stimulant effect with some tactile enhancement. Anyone else notice drastic differences with different settings?

^I had a somewhat similar experience, I dosed 12mg and wasnt feeling a whole lot for the first hour and a half/two hours, then we decided to hit a restrauant, as soon as I got to the table and sat down started looking around, everything felt very dreamy and I had some shimmery visual stuff happening it was like throwing a switch.

**Moxy - quick question**


Hi bluelight.


First of all, sorry, this question may have been answered once, maybe even twice and maybe I just suck at using the search engine so sorry in advance.


To the question, will moxy (5-meo-mipt) cause pupil dilation? If yes, how much? 2c-b alike (minor-moderate) or shrooms alike (massive)? And at what doses?


Thanks in advance.

It does cause pupil dilation, I'm not quite sure at what doses it gets noticeable at, but in my experience pupil dilation doesn't always correlate with dosage - I've had very low dose/threshold dose experiences from psychedelics where I had pupil dilation, and high doses where I didn't. Strange.

I've used it a couple times at parties and mostly enjoyed it. They were mostly smallish though (15-20 people). At around 10mg it's great; lots of energy, a bit of openess, great increase in tactile sensations. I've tried it at around 15mg and it was a bit difficult to concentrate on individual conversations because it felt I was being overwhelmed by sensory input, so I would keep the dose pretty low.

^yeeeeuh. even 5 mg is pretty ideal for party-type settings.


altho, yes, there is pupil dilation (for me) even at that level. i suspect i may be a little more susceptible to the peripheral side-effects of this one tho.

If you can insufflate 5-meo-mipt (HCl) does that mean you can plug it or take it sublingual as well?

**therapeutic moxy?**


I hear a lot about how moxy's a good social and sensory experience, but not a ton about its therapeutic effects. I'm planning on doing moxy alone in my house tomorrow. Is that a dumb idea? Could there be positive aspects to doing it alone? Therapeutic effects? Should I meditate? I'll probably be listening to music.

For me at least, it's fairly stimulating and I can't really just sit still on it, so meditating with it wouldn't work for me. I can see how doing it alone might be OK but I'd have to be listening to music or doing something at least somewhat active for me to enjoy it.

well just because something is usually used one way, doesnt mean it cant have other uses... just think of mdma, that gets people raving all the time, but is known to have therapeutic values...


5-meo-mipt is known to be able to provide deep experiences especially in the later half of the trip. i lends itself quite nicely to ruminations on the past, thoughts of the future and things of this matter, but i find low doses to be best (but then again, im always loving a low dose of anything). do what you feel right, in the end, these drugs are only keys to doors in our own mind, they do not create the rooms that come to light. use them, not the other way around, and you will have your effects.

for me, a low dose, some chill oldies music, a warm blanket, and i was reminiscing my childhood while embracing the happy moments of vacations gone by. a real battery charger.


about ROAs... given that the doses are this small and it is so well absorbed orally, i ask again, why bother with anything else? that being said, im pretty sure i heard of people sniffing it and plugging it. sublingual not so much as the taste gets most people...

You can redose on this and it is very effective, but be aware that it can be very taxing on the mind. 5-MeO-MiPT seems to me to have some serotonin releasing or reuptake inhibiting properties, which make it get quite spaced out after heavy redosing.

^I have fair experience with 5-MeO-MiPT. It's a great psychedelic in it's own unique way, and I love it. But I once experienced a long plateau of intense dizzy headedness where I felt utterly knackered in body and mind many hours after redosing heavily from a profound trip. There was also profound vasoconstriction, which was actually my main concern. Don't get me wrong, the experience was overall great and very worth it, but I would not want to put myself through that exhaustion again without knowing how to actually deal with it properly, because it got really crazy at times.


Please note that I was on SNRI medication at the time so that could definitely have made the difference between a normal redose and a taxing one.

well 120mg of m1 and 76mg of 5-MeO-MiPT is a lot, that amount alone of 5-Meo-MIPT is dangerous. I wondered if 5mg of moxy + 150mg of m1 would be a good idea.

Yea 76mg Moxy is very probably fatal, if theres an erowid report of some total retard doing that they are lucky to be alive.


Your proposal is more appropriate, 5mg is noticeable but mild, combining with the m1 will probably amplify it, But I would wait till the moxy is totally "on" about an hour in, then add the m1.

I would not say that 76mg is "very probably fatal," however it would be totally inadvisable to dose so high. I'm surprised they didn't mention how high the dose is on erowid given that they usually put bold yellow reminders in TRs when someone doses excessively or suspiciously.

it would very probably be a waste of your materials lol. 5-meo-mipt gets me too wired, i usually can't sleep for 12+ hours after the effects have worn off. I'd never seen much point in going over 30mg, i've had some great psychedelic moments on such doses but overstimulation ruined them so i don't know why anyone would want to put themselves through that sort of hell on a very high dose. 5-meo-mipt never hit that therapeutic spot for me either, i'm not even sure what the hell it does and i've used it quite a bit. 5-meo-dalt and mipt seem very similar to me in that weird, but mild experience they both give. In high doses, it's just more weird and still mild but with shitty side effects.

I've had some VERY intensely psychedelic effects from 5-meo-mipt at the 20mg dose range. I wouldn't call it worthless - but there is a side effect ratio when you go into such ranges.

20 mg was highest I ever took moxy and for me too this was a very strong warm physical tryptamine buzz with psychedelic sensorium effects (tracers, enhanced colors, afterimages, extreme hearing sensitization), that changed to a highly emotional empathogenic floaty mental/emotional vibe with strong CEVs and epic inner thought-journeys during a "second wind" from hrs 4-7... rather nice intense multifaceted experience.  But the body buzz in the early phase for me at least seemed at about the limit I would be comfortable with and makes the idea of nearly 4X that amount seem highly tense, and likely dangerous if one were to add that much M1.  I would think amounts below 20mg (5-15mg) might nicely synergize with M1 but would require timing/dosage experiments to perfect I'd bet.

Yeah, the body buzz can get seriously intense. It is very pleasurable, but sometimes it can seem like it's going in to overload, it's seriously hardcore. That said, it is such a lovely chem I believe it is worth it, because the psychedelic effects can be truely magical if you are in the right setting. The combination of psychedelia with that level of empathogenesis is unique, it's like a flip in one chemical.


I would be very careful of combining 5-MeO-MiPT with methylone though. I can't remember where, but I have seen a fair few reports of rough experiences combining moxy + MDMA or M1. I think if you are going to do so, you should test the waters first by starting off with a low dose of moxy - <10mg, more like 5mg or less.

I just want to agree with those saying be careful with high (20mg+) doses of 5-MeO-MIPT. The highest I have ever gone was 17mg and it was very intense, certainly not something I would want to do all the time. And I worked my way up to that slowly. I've never felt the need or desire to combine it with anything but I know I've read accounts of people combining moxy with MDMA and M1 and their experiences seem to range from weird, too intense, and just plain not an enjoyable time, so please exercise caution if you're going to try to mix this.

I dosed m1 on the tail end of 20mg moxy trip (at about t +7 hours), well after the psychedelic effects had worn off and I still projectile puked. Be weary that stimulants will exacerbate moxy's bodyload.

Yes, 5-MeO-MiPT is quite different to those two compounds. It's quite difficult to explain the differences, but you will know as soon as you try it. Moxy feels somewhat "rolly", but not in the same sense as aMT. It's more like a very euphoric and sexually oriented high, which grdually turns more psychedelic as the experience goes on. The psychedelia is markedly different than with the 2Cs, again, in a difficult to explain way. Unless someone else can do a better job at describing it than me. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**tips for a smooth sexual experience**


I had a nice series of run ins with this lovely substance about 5 years ago but didn't have a girlfriend at that time and my doses were eyeballed so who knows really how much I was taking. I did experience the tactile oriented and full blow psychedelic extents of the chemical though. I assume the lowest dose I took was around 1 to 3mg and the highest somewhere around 20 to 25. I was wonder based on your experience what dose you found most effective for the enjoyment of sex? I've been given the chance to give it a go with measured doses and a girlfriend now. Any other advice is appreciated.

I've heard mixing stimulants with 5-MeO-MiPT can result in a very negative reaction. I think someone reported it earlier in the thread.

The dose of 5-MeO-MiPT used in that case study is **extremely** high -- don't try to repeat it!


> Mr. A, a 27-year-old Japanese businessman, had no previous psychiatric or medical illness. He also had no known family history of mental disorders. He had never used recreational drugs including methamphetamine, MDMA, or organic solvents. However, from his teens, he had felt sleep irregularities, and primary insomnia became worse in his mid-20s. Then, he started taking a traditional anti-histamine sleeping OTC (over-the-counter) drug, diphenhydramine hydrochloride 50 mg/day at night for approximately 1 year without professional consultation. Recently, he thought of taking a drug for his sleep disturbance. Though he did not know methylone in detail, he believed it could help feel him free from insomnia. Then, he bought the drug 1 g as pure methylone powder via an internet-order.
> 
> 
> 
> He took approximately 200 mg of the drug powder p.o. Thirty minutes later, he started to feel nausea and sick in the stomach, and visited one of his friends for help. In his friend's room, he shouted with agitation. He fell down on the floor, and he kicked around in a prone position aimlessly. He kept crying out that he felt very lonely, all is vanity, and added that he took a recreational drug “methylone” bought via internet. Soon an ambulance arrived, and medical technicians could not carry him because of his psychomotor excitement. The policemen were contacted and they helped him to move to our hospital.
> 
> 
> 
> At the emergency room of our hospital, he opened his eyes and stared around incoherently and silent in confusion, but exhibited sudden and brief psychomotor excitement and shouted for no reason. His temperature was 37.8 °C, pulse 150 bpm, and blood pressure 144/81 mm Hg. He showed dilated pupils and sweating. After a gastrolavage and urine sample through a balloon catheter, Triage® Drug of Abuse Panel plus TCA (Biosite Diagnostics, San Diego, CA) rapid drug screening device was used to examine the contents of his stomach and urine. The assay systems showed no immunoreactivity to phencyclidine, benzodiazepines, cocaine metabolite, amphetamine and methamphetamine, marijuana metabolite, opiates, barbiturates, and tricyclic antidepressants in his urinary and gastric fluid sample. Following his confession to his friend, he was temporarily diagnosed as having substance intoxication with an unknown powder. He still exhibited symptoms of substance-induced psychomotor excitement, although more than 3.5 h from drug inducement. We had him take 4 mg of a risperidone oral solution. His psychomotor excitement became gradually sedative. One and half hours after risperidone treatment, his symptoms disappeared and he could communicate coherently. He wanted to know what he did after he took the drug. He was observed and given supportive care until noon the following day, then discharged without any known sequel. Two weeks after recovery from acute intoxication, he did not exhibit any residual symptoms including a depressive mood or euphoria. He, however, had no recollection of his experience during acute intoxication.

A more appropriate dose of 5-MeO-MiPT would be 6 mg, not 76 mg. The good news is that Mr. A survived.

I also reported negative side effects earlier in this thread from the combination of methylone and 5-meo-mipt. My dose was 10mg oral + 10mg insufflated of moxy and 250mg M1. Even though the M1 was taken at the very tail end of the moxy (after the main psychedelic effects had worn off and only residual effects remained) I experienced brutal nausea and projectile vomited - not a fun time. Given the already somewhat extreme physical side effects of moxy and stimulants' tendency to exacerbate such effects, I would avoid the combination. After the nausea wore off, it was quite nice, but it wasn't nice enough to repeat the experience.

hmm seems as though you took a large amoutn of methylone - never the less thats crazy and i would NOT sniff any RC LOLOL sorry for projectile vomiting that soudns HORRIBLE - 


never the less i would imagine its a lower combination however ill take this all into considering even tho i had read the post about the dumb ass kid buying stuff from a source he thought was 100% m1 or whatever it said and it just makes no sense that he wouldnt have tested it with a kit prior if he didnt trust the source.

250mg is by no means an unreasonable nor uncommon dose of methylone - I'd suggest reading more experience reports. 


As for the sniffing, tryptamines are generally a little easier on the body when insufflated than phenethylamines. In my case, I experienced no serious bodyload problems from the 5-meo-mipt alone, just with the addition of the methylone. Proceed with caution, I have no doubt that if the dose is low enough it might be fun. I'd start out with no higher than 10mg moxy + 150mg M1.

I would go with around 8-10mg. That should give you the tactile sensations without getting super visual on you.

Armaros, yes stick at 10mg or less if you only want the stimulation with no psychedelia. But I've found that the eroticism is there at higher doses too, and more powerfully. But high doses may tend towards a small and retracted member. And definitely vasoconstriction. I've not had sex on it, with or without a partner. However, it enhances your sensual desire and libido in ways I haven't felt whilst tripping on other psychedelics.


In terms of performnce, I have achieved a large erection on this stuff, but I have also seen it shrivel up my penis to an impossibly small size. I'm not sure what the factors were involved between the two - in the former case I was out with friends and I had been drinking a fair few gin and tonics whilst tripping (possibly allowing vasodilation?). That was a very high dose, too high. In the latter case I was sitting on the toilet mid trip and I noticed how shrivelled it was. On that trip I had severe vasoconstriction in my legs later on in the trip, which is probably a factor as to why. Both times were doses greater than 10mg, although I can't remember the exact doses since they were a fair while back. So I suppose if you are keeping the dose low to avoid the psychedelic aspects, then the chances for "speed dick" are probably quite reduced.

^I only have experience with oral and insufflation, but I didn't find a difference between the two qualitatively. Granted, I have only insufflated it once, at 10mg, so it may be that I just haven't explored other ROAs properly yet. When I first started experimenting with this compound, oral dosing seemed to kick in pretty quick. I would be feeling effects before the firt hour. But my last experience with it took at least an hour to start feeling effects from an oral dose.

there is obviously no reason to think the two things are related but hopefully my anecdote will encourage you to start small and use volumetric measurement.

Thank for the reply and the heads up! Will definitely start with a small dose. Could you be more specific about the negative cardiovascular side-effects? Increasing heart rate, chest pain etc? Just so I know what to observe more carefully..

We think we took about 80mg in capsule each this weekend after miscalcuated the zeroes on mg scale. Why do we think this you might as. After 20 mins after ingested I was seeing a great show around me and then whilst wifey was vomiting I passed out for 8 hours. It took another 4 after that to get me aware of my surroundings and back to normal. My wife had given me about 5 aitivan. My first pyschedelic turned out to be an overdose that sent me on a trip of note. Answers, questions and ideas please.

it was pretty mild thankfully. a tightness in the chest and limbs and elevated heart rate. overall just a weird feeling of unease akin to what i experienced on a very high (90 mg) dose of 5-meo-dalt. 


afaik the big things to watch out are heart rate and numbness or tingling at the extremities.

80mg? Bloody hell! No wonder you passed out. Please elaborate on the mental and physical effects. What was the body load like at that dose, and do you have any lingering side effects? I had vasocontriction last a few days after a large dose. 


I am curious about how far the psychedelic effects took you either side of your black out. I'm also interested if your wife passed out too, and if not what she experienced at the peak. 


How could you miscalculate between 8mg and 80mg? That's a pretty staggering error, especially when it comes to a substance as potent as this one. Please be more mindful of your measuring technique in the future. I'm glad you both made it out safely.

Most people find that vaporizing 5-MeO-MIPT takes a larger dose than just orally taking it. 20mg vaped is probably about 10mg ingested.

Survived Abortion,  the scale read 0.18 including the gel cap. It seems we misread the scale and miscalculated our dose not having tried any other RC's and not having had experience with hallucinogens besides LSD some years ago. The gelcap and 8mg should have read 0.001(8) and not 0.018. The scale now obviosuly not being fine enough and the gelcap being 100mg and not 10mg as we thought. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

In fact, besides my trip from HELL  - out of coke, dope, and whatever other stuff they put in MDMA until 2 years ago, this stuff has had the least after-effects physically out of all. 

This weekend is probably the best weekend I will have for months to give it another try. There is some 5-meo-dipt to sample as well, but I will leave that alone if I can take the Moxy and not put myself imto a comatose state again. The point being that I want to enjoy the Moxy - MDMA was the only fun I ever really had (age 35-38) and obviously at age 40 I am meant to be over it and am.

If I was you I would wait longer. Taking the giant dose you did, that would be the safe way to proceed. There might be some tolerance issues as well. I would definitely err on the side of caution here.

I had the wonderful experiance of 5-MeO-Mipt Yesterday and would like to share it.


Just this week my long time friend came to visit from California and yesterday was our day to kick it before he goes back.   So we hung out drinkin a couple beers for an hour or so when the friendly neighbor hood mail man knocked on my door for my mail.  And of course I totally for got what was comming !  So we decided to to dose at about 3:30pm.


T 0:00 - I took out my mg scales and dosed out 14mg.  Divided it into 3 equal piles and shaved off a tad on each pile for safe trials.    Over all I would say each person got 3-4mg.  We just licked it up and down it with a swig of beer.  


Taste -  The taste was bitter as in any RC, and also the chem did have the risidual tate linger for a while.  I suggest capsule or parachute if your not the type of person who giggles at takes of chems like me.  My 2 friends hated the taste and kept complaining.  I told em to man up.


T: 0:15 -  We definatly felt something.  After the dose we promted to go outside to my yard and play with my daughter and flew a kite and shoot my compound bow at an old gatoraid cooler.  We all had wonderful grins on our face we could not control and started to have a nice tryptamine buzz in the back of our head.  


T: 0:30 - At this point there was no denying that something was diffrent.  Our mood was elevated, our smiles were from ear to ear.  I myself did start to knowtice some mustle tension in my jaw from smiling to much.  We played outside more, ran around and had wonderful conversations of what we have been doing for the last 2 years since we have all gotten together.  At this point one of my friends ended up getting the kite stuck in a tree about 25-30 feet up.  So we began to brain storm on how to get it out.


T: 0:45 - At this point we all jumped into my truck and drove down my property (60 acers) to my shed and grabbed a pole saw.   We backed the truck up to the tree, climbed ontop the cab and sawed the mofo down.  But with our luck as the limb fell down the kite got stuck into another limb and we had great laughs about how hard this is to mentaly think that a kite is screwing us over.  So we take the snips on the pole saw to snip the final and small limb.  My friend yanked the cord on the pole saw so hard it snaped the cord and yet again another histerical laugh about how the world wants the kite to fly free without a human controlling it was enduced.


T 1:20 -  Well its been a bit, we are hit our peaks and have platued off hanging outside on a beautiful day.  We took a walk around in the woods. Smoked some herb. And well had great conversations.


T:2:30 - At about this point the two friends had to go due to prior plans.  We all said our kudos and they headed out.


At about this time me and my wife and kid stayed outside for little longer and played.  Then back inside for some puzzles and Fun.   


T 4:00 - Somewhere +/- the 4 hour mark I was knowticing that I was slowly becomming sober.  But as I kept smoking some herb here and there, the visuals became more knowticeable.  Nothing spectacular from what i hear of higher doses of this compound but colors, slight movement and great CEV's.  It was cool.  COmedown had my muscles a tad tense but nothing bad.  This was the end of the trip for the knowticable small effects were around for about 1-2 more hours.


Overview -   Overall for the first dose it was wonderful.  I knowticed a slight bodyload but nothing real bad.  Great euphoria, Great comversaion maker.  Im definatly going to be trying more of this.  I got plently = )  Food was wonderful and not hard to eat.  I felt that at some points my motor skills went haywire and didnt know what they wanted to do.  But this could have been the alky.  I was sippin on a few beers the whole trip.  Totaling to about 5 or so.  But slowly about 1 beer an hour.


Other methods/Doses - I will be trying Oral 6,8,10,12 throughout the weeks.  I will also be trying the freebaseing route but not sure when and how much yet.  


Ill keep ya posted.

Do you have personal experience with this? That doesn't sound right to me at all. Most tryptamines are far more potent vapourized than taken enterally. In any case, since it is not anywhere near as widely known as 5-MeO-DMT I would start at a significantly lower dose than you would take orally. Say a 1/3 of your oral dose. Give it time to kick in. You can always vapourize more, but you can never take less if you took too much. 


In all honesty it's probably not worth it. Most people get a very satisfactory experience using it orally.

> Within 15-20 minute I was getting huge visuals with the brick pattern on my stoep giving the matinee performance. Touch seemed electrostatic and synaesthesia was also instant as well. My partner sensing that the trip was too big a deal for us locked us in the main suite of the house where I promptly passed out. She immediately started to vomit which I think helped with her dose, but as for me I had a few hours of a very scary and seemingly unconscious trip - everything slowed down and cartoon-ized and I was completely unaware of her or anything else in the room. My wife reports that my hands and legs were clawing and it looked as if I was having a fit with huge body spasms etc. When I came to after 8 hours I spent another 4 hours semi-conscious and hallucinating that I was at work. Also giving out orders etc. The trip had deluded me into believing I had accomplished all that was needed in life and that I was in for a lot of money. Hence me wanting my accountant on the phone etc. all at 2am. I had no clue what time it was. My wife gave me a few *Ativan* tabs - I thought it was because I was grumpy - did not tie it in to the trip until I woke up after a 7 hour sleep again. It was then that I remembered the first 5 minutes of tripping and the dreamtime and semi-conscious episode.

> 
> 
> Those first few minutes of the Moxy starting to work were great, but it very quickly got out of control. If it was not for the standby *Ativan*,  I think I would have been more traumatised even more. I am now considering trying again this weekend - 7 days later - and this time taking a very much divided dose. What do you think? Too soon?  No other stuff in my life now anyway as MDMA was too exhausting in the end. I don't have any lasting or visible side-effects now from this trip besides the emotional shock . Remarkably I was physically fine the next day, save for some *tinitinitus* which has gradually decreased in volume to almost nothing today.

Thank you for answering my questions in such an expansive and detailed form. This is a good reminder of why it is important to have a good measuring technique. It's always important to re-weigh doses, and double-check your figures if you are weighing with additional items such as capsules.


You might want to wait a bit more than a week beofre you redose. Of course it's up to you, but I think after such an intense experience, you should give your body a chance to recuperate, and for your mind to integrate the experience.

Tried this probably ~8 times back in the day. When you have a baggy around, it's hard not to dose. Why not?


Very strange drug. It is decently euphoric/speedy, but at the same time redosing can cause it to become INCREDIBLY psychedelic. The most similar experience I had was likely on foxy methoxy (5-MEO-Dipt), though I would argue moxy is more psychedelic. The euphoria can be comparable to something like methylone at times, but overall it is much more of an introspective, psychodelic than you'll ever get with any pure empathogen. 


The body load can be pretty terrible or not existant. I took it once when I was VERY drunk and was unconscious for quite some time, tripping my balls of and had a shitty hangover. I've also taken 5mg sober and been around friends and really not been much above baseline.


Overall, a fun drug that I'd do if I had laying around, but never something I'd seek out as it lacks in both euphoric/speedy sense and the psychedelic sense compared to others. Certainly worth experimenting with though if you're looking to try (almost) everything like I was.

I don't personally but I was with some friends that tried vaping it. They told me it wasn't as potent vaped as if they had taken it orally. They could be mistaken of course, but that's what they described to me. I think on Erowid they've listed that it doesn't seem to be as potent when smoked also.

I've been on a break from E due to abuse and a traumatic experience, so I started searching RC's that offered the traits i was looking for. 


I settled on 5-meo-mipt. Initially, I wasn't able to find a vendor for it, so I tried 5-meo-DALT instead. Recently, I did acquire the MIPT variety, so I can compare the effects of both. (I included information on the dalt variety as I've observed many people confuse one for the other)


*5-meo-DALT is weird. Orally, it is a surface level trip, mostly auditory hallucinations/distortions, CEVs, a mild body buzz and crazy munchies. Smoked, its speedy with a much stronger body buzz, with an erotic edge to it. No hangover from either method, but tolerance builds. After much experimentation, I rate it 3.5/10*


**5-meo-MIPT** is definitely what I was after. Orally, its a deeper than dalt trip, but still shallow/fun, music sounds incredible, some mild oev/cev, emotional openness (less than mdma), and a very sensual body buzz. I would very much liken it to mdma in most respects, absent the stimulation. I consider this a positive personally, as caffeine is usually enough for me as far as stimulants go. My experience was about 12mgs, and lasted about 5 hours. There was no hangover noted, except for restlessness. I'd be very comfortable in a social environment on this substance in this manner.


Smoking/vaping requires more of the compound than oral ingestion. Ingesting this way is a much deeper, introspective trip, with emotional lability and tremors added to much of the same effects as oral, just intensified and lengthened (6-7 hours). I can see the comparisons to DMT when smoked, although the rushes and visuals are nothing on that level, the introspection is. I was after some introspection but I wasn't quite prepared to face myself quite like I did. This was a little unexpected twist, but it wasn't unnerving by any means, and the whole experience was positive. I smoked about 25mgs and the entire experience lasted 7 hours, with the first 4 being very intense compared to the last 3. No hangover this method either. 


Overall, I really liked the 5-meo-mipt, maybe even better than mdma due to lack of hangover. I could socialize/recreationally use when taken orally, definitely. Overall I rate it 7.5/10.

oops sorry for shortening the chem names, but yes I was referring to 5meo-mipt and 5meo-dalt. I included both chems because they have been confused before, and I just wrote the same post essentially so I copy pasted. Sorry for the confusion, I will edit my post for clarity

**Moxy Two**


My second trip after last weekend's terrible trip was better in most ways. I had moved towards integrating my experience well enough and a cool 7 days later with the aid of a couple of ativan and half a glass of wine. - I embarked on my 2nd outing. 6mgs and another 6mg dose at plus 1 hour set me up for an enjoyable time. Auditory hallucinations and a couple of mind loops as well as time loss. The roll is not comparable to MDMA which is far superior. TV and music were far too hectic and emotionally demanding of me being oversensitive to each expression, mood etc. Soft porn played fast forward a killer.

Overall the stuff is a miserable comparison to E and the sex felt half baked on the inside  and over-baked on the outside.


Maybe a 18mg go will make things more fun. But I am not holding out much hope right now.

Weird. I've researched 5-MeO-MIPT at least 20 times and I've never had results like these. I guess it just goes to show that all people react differently to chemicals and you have to be prepared for that.

You cannot expect it to replicate MDMA, or even trying to compare them. Many people have compared the empathogenic effects to MDMA, but that doesn't mean that all the people who report this are attempting to replicate a roll on MDMA. It is simply that the empathogenic aspect reminds people of that. One substance cannot substitute for another, and it should really be taken on it's own merits.


In all honesty I don't think you gave it anywhere near enough time between trips to get a decent result the second time, considering your first dose (only a week prior to the second) was 80mg. You definitely need longer between such heavy trips in order to experience maximum intensity. It is probably a serotonin releaser, which means you need to wait 3 to 4 weeks until you can get the maximum empathogenic effects. But more importantly, I think of this substance far more as a psychedelic then a roll; in fact I never even take it with rolling in mind.


If you approach it with the intention of experiencing what it has to offer, (rather than trying to replicate another experience), you may be more pleasantly suprised. Or it may just not be the compound you are looking for. If that is the case, and if you are trying to experience something a lot more empathogenic (other than MDMA), I would be more inclined to suggest the APB compounds or any of the numerous empathogenic cathinones/amphetamines. aMT is also very empathogenic, although I still think of it as a powerful trip rather than a roll. But it's euphoria blows MDMA out of the water in my experience.

Exactly. A lot of people say that 5-MeO-MIPT is the MDMA of tryptamines and while there are some similarities (increased sensations, some euphoria, stimulation, etc.) I've never thought of it as a substitute for MDMA. If anyone is going into a trip looking for that they will probably be disappointed. Moxy is a unique chemical unto itself and should be treated as such.

My 3rd dose last night 11mg. This time took 45 mins to come up and ka-ching. I was in the tryptamine palace with cascades, explosions and oe and ce visuals in moola loads. Erotic stimulation and imagery not some you can just drum up. This was profound streams of bliss. A trip of all tryps. Not taking away the usual chops and changes, waves and moments of the delics BUT this was Ecstasy blinged up - MDMA with sergeant-major stripes and the parade brings more to the party then E ever could. Now the control thing is what freaks a control freak like me. 

Would another dose 24 hours later put me back on course to more unscrabbling of 40 years of fucked-upness or another non phen RC be a good key to plan for?? That is the question I must find my own answers to - any pilgrims along the way with maps are welcome.

I agree _ from last nights experience the key is to approach it with what It has to offer you - and when it offers you what you want be prepared to take a ride bigger or different to what you expected from something that does something else. Read below.

If you HAVE to dose tonight, since you did a tryptamine last night you'll probably have more luck with a phenethylamine tonight. Still gonna be a lot of tolerance though...it'd be better if you could at least wait a couple more days.

very nice one though tried it with 5, 7, 11 mgs 

did it once 3 days in a row second day there was no tolerance and had more or less the same effects so tried my luck a 3rd day but then nothing more than some stimulation and mild euforia happend

The highest I have gone is 17mg. It's intense...far more so than 12mgs and noticeably more so than even 15mgs. All the effects I get from my usual dose of 12mgs are magnified: visuals, energy, increased sense of touch, muscle tightness, the need to move around, etc. I'll try it again at that dose again but it's certainly not something I'd want to do often. I think the highest I would every realistically try would be 20mg but even at that I think the negative effects might outweigh the positives. If you're going to try high doses of this, be very careful and be prepared for the possibility of unpleasantness.

this one sounds interesting. i know this may be a dumb question, but is the stimulation/trippyness anything compared to a strong dose of mxe ? either way id like to check this one out, at maybe 5 mg and work my way up 2mg at a time until i find the sweet spot.

It's nothing at all like MXE. MXE makes me feel quite numb and gives me a bit of an almost drunk feeling. 5-MeO-MIPT vastly increases feelings/physical sensations and is quite stimulating.

I tended to swallow it in a Rizzla followed by a swig of tea. Mine dissolved easily and was effective plugged. Rapid but smooth onset with latter method. Ditto 5MeO-DIPT which I also had as fumarate. 

I would suggest not trying to vapourise  any of the fumarate materials. They are probably best used by most methods other than smoking (vapourising). Doses for those materials are not materially large, so taste/burn etc are less of an issue I suppose, were you to insuflate (snort).

Well I'm sure he'll be tripping by now. But yeah, orally works fantastically and doesn't take too long to come up on either. It works so well orally that I don't ever feel the need to use a different ROA.

in response to the OP, yes. most people seem to use it orally or via insufflation. I've read a few reports of smoked dosages, but that ROA seems to require larger doses than oral or nasal administration. Not sure as to why. Check the Big & Dandy 5-MeO-MiPT thread here or the vault over at Erowid.org for more info.  Gonna go ahead & merge this with the B&D here as it has been effectively answered.

What kind of stims? I've read that it's not such a good idea to combine with MDMA - some people have reported bad reactions. I would extrapolate this to include compounds such as 4-FA, methylone, and some of the other empathogenic cathinones.


But I would imagine that a normal dopaminergic stim such as amphetamine wouldn't pose too much of a problem. Please don't hold me to this. It's just that I can't see any pharmacological reason why they would be contraindicated. The only thing I can imagine happening from amphetamine is exessive stimulation and body effects, since 5-MeO-MiPT already seems quite intense physically. And of course don't forget about 5-MeO-MiPTs vasoconstriction. It would probably be best to avoid the sketchier stims such as MDPV, and definitely cocaine since it is a vasoconstrictor.


As always, if you are going to combine these, start with a small dose of stimulant to test the waters, and a reduced dose of Moxy.

Yeah, it was M1 I was gonna combo with, so was pretty apprehensive.  I wonder though if the MAOI effect is irreversible, ie. if I could start doing stims after the MIPT has worn off.

a big concern with a 5-MeO-MIPT + stimulant combo would probably be increased body temperature (hyperthermia).  make sure to stay cool and hydrated if you do it, please.

I don't think 5-MeO-MiPT is an MAOI (other than it's very small competitive monoamine oxidase inhibition, which all tryptamines share). There's an inkling that it may be a mild serotonin releaser, which doesn't explain much since other SRAs can be used in combo. I admit, I'm not really sure why it is bad in combo with empathogenic stimulants, but it does seem to be the case going by other's reports.

I recently tried a combo of 13mgs of 5-MeO-MIPT and 50mgs of MDMA. It was intense to put it lightly. There was a period of about 30 minutes or so where I felt totally lost in a cacophony of sound and light. I could handle it but just barely. I didn't notice any adverse after effects from it except for a total inability to sleep for about 16 hours or so. It was just not going to happen. It didn't seem to increase to muscle tension that I usually associate with MIPT but the increase in overall energy was rather extreme. If I ever try this again I will definitely be lowering the doses.

I think it's just because 5-meo tryptamines are generally weird/harsh on the body. I took m1 on the tail end of a moxy trip and it didn't feel dangerous, just incredibly uncomfortable with exaggerated vomiting.

The transition from a methoxetamine-induced state of consciousness to a low-dose of 5-meo-mipt(5mg) was really odd and uncomfortable for both myself and my gf. 

Setting could have played a part, but we were both having sexy time and decided to take the 5-meo-mipt on the afterglow(shortly after peak) of methoxetamine. Around 20 minutes after orally consuming the 5-meo-mipt, the predominant "whosh whosh whosh" fan noises in the background came to an abrupt hault and the room became silent. 


We both became pretty anxious/depressed. This was not anything like what we experienced a week prior on our first 5-meo-mipt trip which was double the amount(10mg).


Could the 4-FA that we tried the day before have had an impact on this experience? Lack of serotonin, tolerance, etc.


We were also already up and moving during our first experience on 5-meo-mipt which could have played a part in how much we enjoyed it. We were already on methoxetamine during our first trip as well so I don't believe the methoxetamine had anything to do with our disappointing second trip. 


It did not feel good to lay down to us. Would being up and about on the comeup possibly fix this for future trips. I'm obviously going to do this next time, I just wanted to point out the weirdness that was experienced while going from the disassociated state to another.

Whenever I research 5-MeO-MIPT, I always make it a point to try to move around. It can be just walking a bit or dancing or swimming (highly recommend swimming on it). It seems to really help me with any problems I might have with the comeup and prevent any kind of muscle tension/soreness that can come from moxy.

In recent weeks, I have found that a low dosage mix of moxy (below 5 milligrams) and a functional stimulant (10-20 mg d-amp or 20-40 mg methylphenidate) puts me exactly where I want to be.


On its own, in moderate doses, moxy provides me with a pleasant tryptamine buzz, an exceptional tactile enhancement and wild flights of imagination (akin to what a medium dose of mushrooms or a strong cannabis high could offer) and at the same time leaves me significantly clear-headed. That is, compared to other psychedelics, so it still has some body load, confusion and laziness which renders it less functional than one might request. 


And this, of course, is where the addition of a functional stimulant (preferrably amphetamine) comes into play. With this modest tweak, all the positives of moxy remain while the negatives are flushed away. A kind of heightened awareness is produced, which retains both the sharpened focus of the stimulants and the immense "here and now" aspect of moxy. Naturally, the first 2-3 hours are slightly more moxy-dominated, with the rest being increasingly functional.


Regarding combinations with higher doses of either substance, it is probably unwise, at least for reaching the aforementioned balance of effects. The physical discomfort of moxy would likely be intensified and other potentially serious side effects might emerge. Higher doses of moxy also tend to be less friendly in terms of emotional stability IME.


Anyway, as I mentioned initially, the described state of mind is something I personally find highly desirable, and particularly so for spending time alone (reading books, playing guitar, etc). For example, cannabis grants milder but similar psychedelia, but even layered atop some central stimulation, it's still kind of hazy. So judging by the ratio of psychedelic effects to function impairment, this combo is a strong contender! But if one wishes primarily to savour moxy's aphrodisiac qualities, the addition of a stimulant is probably redundant. And I can see how many consider mixing in MDMA and the like for weekend settings, but personally I'd pass on those combos.

So my friends and I tried a 5mg dose each a few nights ago and experienced a weird uneasiness, almost on the verge on nausea but not quite.  Does anyone else experience this?  I'm thinking it might have to do with us just sitting around watching tv and having all that anxious energy and/or the dose wasn't too strong so we were stuck in that awkward spot of not fully tripping.

^^alright, I just wanted to check since I didn't come across too many reports where the person felt uncomfortable/nauseous.  We will try again at higher doses and in a better situation.  Even as it was, it wasn't unenjoyable though.

Nausea seems to be fairly prevalent with my friends at least (probably more than half experience it at least some of the time). It seems to help if they get up and move around and the feeling tends to go away in about 30 minutes or so.

I have had 2 different experiences with this compound. Version 1 of the compound is very mellow, euphoric, sensual, and easy on the body. No nausea, just an amazing experience from start to finish. This version is light and fluffy in appearance


Version 2 seems like a different substance entirely. Same psychedelic head space, but speedy in feeling, punctuated by heavy nausea and anxiety. This version appears more salt like. Basically not even enjoyable. 


My partner and I have tried these versions independently as well as combined, and both reported the same issues. 


Are there different synths for this? Or different forms that cause it to react differently?

In my experience just about all music sounds good on it. It's better if it's something danceable because it is quite stimulating so it's nice to be able to work that energy out. Also, go swimming on it. You will not be disappointed. Be prepared for some initial nausea (doesn't always happen but is fairly common) but know that it will go away eventually.

I've never heard of anyone doing this combo, but if you do, keep in mind that the MIPT is going to wear off before the 2c-p does.

I mixed it with M1 and the result was projectile vomiting. Moxy kinda has a weird body load to it, and I think mixing it with stimulants only exacerbates that. If you do plan to do an M1/stimulant combo, I'd suggest dosing low on both to begin with.

5-MeO-MiPT and other 5-MeO tryptamines tend to raise blood pressure a lot (more so than other psychedelics), so mixing that with random stimulants is probably a bad idea.

I would advise against this. The one time I mixed it with something was not really a pleasant experience. 5-MeO-MIPT is already somewhat close to an MDMA feel IMO. I mean, of course it's not the same but you do get an increased sensation of touch and some more emotional openness. It's really best to just experience MIPT by itself and enjoy it for what it is.

Thanks for the responses guys. I love 5-MeO-Mipt for what it is, but the thought of some 4-FA with some Moxy mixed in makes me drool a bit. I'll most likely just stick with the 5-MeO-Mipt, but I would still love to hear any experiences mixing 5-MeO-Mipt with stimulants. The only thing I ever mixed it with was with some 2ce which was very nice.

Yes, it becomes profoundly visual with open eyes at higher doses - wonderfully so - but you also have to endure a much greater body-load. I have had moments where the body-load on 5-MeO-MiPT has scared me.

Same here. I've done 17mgs and there were a few times during that trip where I was a bit worried. The stimulation and body load can get to be very difficult to handle. I feel terrible for anyone that has jumped into 5-MeO-MIPT at that level.

I put the powder in a stainless steel tablespoon measure, heated the bottom, and sucked the vapor through a hollowed out pen casing. 

two 2 mg. sessions yielded threshold effects...a not entirely pleasant stoning in the head and nothing else. heart rate went to 95 BPM, but other than that, no physical effects noted. packed a 5 mg. bowl and proceeded to inhale the whole thing in 4 sloppy hits. (it's hard vaporizing on a spoon!)


within 1 minute, it was completely washing over me. very, very DMT-like in it's insistence. to be honest, i was not expecting such a heavy tryptamine swarm of thought. though not entirely unpleasant or forceful, i remember thinking, "oh man, i don't like tryptamines very much! i should just ditch this whole batch, i can't wait for this to be over...."


it was never truly overwhelming, it's just that i'm not used to things coming on in a minute!!!! (been awhile since my smoked DMT days...)

after a minute, i thought, "the only thing i need to do to enjoy this is accept the tremor of energy in my spine." so i layed down flat, released to the flow, and was blissfully swept away for a full hour with eyes closed, hardly coming out at all. it peaked for about 45 minutes, though the "rush" thankfully subsided after about 15 minutes. other than a somewhat speedy heart beat, strange (but mild) twitching sensations, and strong energy tremor, the 5-meo-mipt was entirely pleasant. 

very very little body load at that dosage compared to most pure chemicals. and relatively no mind-fuck compared to it's more powerful siblings. 


the after glow lasted another 2 hours after the peak, and was very very enjoyable. super blissed-out MDMA type euphoria, my body just felt GREAT! it's cool that you can climb the dose so slowly with smoking it, there is little to no tolerance, so you can get where you want to go fairly accurately.

i think next time i'll try a tiny dose oral just to experience a smoother, more drawn out come up.

honestly, i don't think the peak would have overwhelming in the slightest bit had that 60 seconds been drawn out 60 minutes! =)


but still, seems very worthwhile to be able to trip hard in one minute if you'd like. especially since it lasts for 3 hours, rather than 10-30 minutes for DMT and 5-meo-dmt.


after the initial fear, i must admit that i'm quite taken by how amazing the tryptamine mind-set is. it's undoubtably far, far deeper than most phens could ever take you.....it's just a little less friendly, in my experience, and makes it harder to navigate, for me, because of that. i remember thinking in the trance, "i didn't know it was possible for my brain to work this way!" i also remember feeling like the energy was showing me how to leave my body...was sort of hinting at an out-of-body experience, though, the dose being relatively low, i wasn't able to fully follow through. but truly, the "blueprints to the starship" really do lie somewhere in the tryptamines!

My personal experience is to use 5-meo-mipt in the end of whatever you have been doing, it's like a sealer for the night. I can't really think of any compunds I have been using that a MIPT in the end doesn't make it perfect. Starting a night with MIPT I do not find very interesting as it kinda makes you quite mellow.


Another one, if MIPT is the only way to go - a 5mg oral dose together with psy trance music or electro house dancing while the MIPT kicks in and you will have your own MDMA in my opinion - this compund makes you able to chose to be mellow or energized.

tried an my first oral dose last night.  4 mgs. split up over an hour.  

okay THERE is the MDMA-style, moaning-and-groaning goodness!


oral vs. smoked is a completely different beast, in my opinion.  smoked is much more disorientating, drugging, and "far out," for me.  very DMT-like.  never tried 5-meo-dmt, but i can imagine now.  it's not visionary, like N-N DMT, just like a mental void of thought/consciousness.

oral was smooth as butter, no anxiety, no body load.  my heart-rate was actually only 70 BPM as i was peaking.  even the most benign molecules make my heart go up to at least 80-85 BPM.  my resting heart rate is normally 60-65.


could definitely feel the distinct phases of it.  coming up was definitely a "tryptamine roll," as has been said.  and once the rush subsided, what was left was an entirely pleasant and surprisingly deep state of introspection and contemplation that was very reminiscent of the after-effects of medium/high dose mushrooms.  it's like that phase in a mushrooms trip when the peak has ended and that "overly intense" feeling subsides, and you're left with that beautifully positive, trippy glow, in which you still have access to deep insight and light visuals, without feeling like you're on the "front lines" still.  


i appreciated the low dose, as the speedy effects were minimal.  i was, mentally, at a high plus 2, or a low plus 3. i could imagine higher doses being unpleasantly stimulating, and will personally never be going over 6 mgs. or so.  in my experience, there's little to be gained from pushing a molecule outside of it's "comfort zone," where the enhanced mental effects don't justify the physical toll.  


after about 1 1/2 or 2 hours of the "trippy" phase, it went back to it's MDMA-style phase and gave an amazing afterglow.  fell asleep easily only 4-5 hours after dosing.   definitely had a tryptamine feel, but honestly, the afterglow was almost deceivingly phen-like.  it's definitely trippy, but my god, it is **groovy**, like phen-groovy for sure.  in fact, the only molecule i've ever encountered that is THAT groovy and THAT trippy at the same time is mescaline.  


for me, anyway: MDMA is just straight groovy.  MDA is 90% groovy, 10% trippy.  mescaline is like 70% trippy, 30% groovy.  5-meo-mipt was very reminiscent of cactus on the come-down, for me.  


staggering the dose made it much smoother, i think.  don't underestimate the energy-push this guy can bring.  

find it where it's good and don't push your limits too far!  it doesn't seem like one to forgive, when it comes to irrational dosage presumptions!

Tolerance related post here.

Took 20mg of the 5 meo mipt Saturday with my brother, I had a great time, my brother said he felt more buzzed off it last time when we took 15mg, but he was getting drunk off his ass with rum and beer also, he drank away his trip and wiped his bike a few times and hurt his arm too, I made a point to keep beer consumption low and had 5-6 beers with him and drank lots of sports drinks and water.


Sunday night, all alone tonight, what to do, wanted to test the tactile ability of this stuff, went on the net to see if I can trip 2 days in a row, couldn't find much.

So to hell with it, I will find out my self, took 15mg, then 40 min later took 5 more.

I got pretty buzzed, then watched porn, (I had to do this) I completely wore out my dick.

Awesome!


So, I got buzzed pretty good the next day, although the body load felt ever so slightly greater and the buzz felt not completely up to par with the amount taken, but then again I was furiously massaging my snake and got hot and worn out.


I did prove to myself that tolerance does not happen that quickly.

Greetings! It's my first post but sadly instead of contribution I have some questions. I'm going to buy some moxy, but the vendor has only freebase (white powder). I read earlier that moxy in this form is rarely available, is it cause for suspicion? Will it be weaker than salt? Can I snort/bomb/plug it (I don't want to smoke it)?

Thanks for answer. I would drop/plug it first to make myself familiar with the substance. Also I think plugging will be preferable to oral roa, in order to avoid body load/nausea. I'll try vaping it later (since onset is very fast with this roa, i don't want to feel overwhelmed by the experience - have tried 5-meo-dipt though). Vaporizing such a small amount of chemical can be cumbersome outdoors, what do you think about making a herbal blend out of it (thinking it over it's actually good that I have it as freebase), just dissolving moxy in acetone and spreading it on some herbs? Would 100mg per gram yield a potent mixture (i'm talking about pronounced effects from taking one good hit)? And just in case, this is for personal use, i'm not going to sell it, i just have this questions because i lack in experience here.

I've always thought about laying this on some bud but am afraid of it not being evenly distributed.  Also, the freebase will degrade faster than the HCl so you should keep it properly stored if you're planning on holding onto it for a while. I'm not sure how fast that is considering that the 5-meo-substituted tryptamines are more stable than the 4-subbed tryptamines, iirc.

Has anybody tried combining this with 25i-NBOMe? I imagine this combo can either be a train wreck or absolutely orgasmic. Please share your experience if you have. Did it feel unhealthy? Was the stimulation overpowering?

I tried vaping moxy off foil. The taste is unpleasant, but manageable. Nice, relaxed state, definite tryptamine buzz. But came to stupid idea of mixing it with 2c-p... overdid it. Bad trip. Crash. Not recommended!

Phase one:


8 milligram of 5-MeO-MiPT fumarate, a beige powder, slightly clumpy, easily dissolved into 5 milliliter of warm Vodka which was mixed into a fruit smoothie.  Being the cautious man that I am, I drank 60% of it and waited about 90 minutes to finish it since this is a new compound to me.  First alerts in 20 minutes, low +++ in 90.  I had no nausea and only a minor amount of GI rumbling later in the experience, but I have a cast-iron constitution.  No jaw clenching, no muscle tension and no amphetamine effect in contrast to the 2C-I I tested a few weeks ago.  The body buzz is noticeable and pleasant.


The 2C-I was a stim in addition to a psychedelic, making me want to get up and do things.  The 5-MeO effect is more sedative by comparison, and more stoning.  More coach-lock.  I tried dancing and felt light-headed and my sense of balance was off.  Shades of alcohol-like intoxication.  I finally got up and got a musical instrument going and glad I did.  Over several hours of exploration I wandered in musical directions outside of the well-worn paths.  I felt creative.  But my musical timing was off, hitting notes before and after the beat, a little like being drunk.


Some posts early in this thread talked about "dark" experiences, I didn't see any of that.  Shrooms can really poke the anxiety button for me and on higher doses sometimes dark and scary thoughts can emerge.  But I got none of that on this compound.  The experience was entirely pleasant.  No anorexia, food was delicious.  No confusion or mindfuck.  But no cosmic conscienceness become one with the universe or anything.  Without going into detail, the erotic was effective, enhanced by the thoroughly pleasant body buzz, borderline spectacular.   


Phase two:     


At around 5 hours as the plateau just started to declined I eyeballed about 10 milligram into the bong on top of some cannabis.  Kids, don't do this at home.  Don't eyeball, use a scale. The smoke has a plastic kind of taste, not awful, that reminds me a little of 5-MeO-DMT.  Upon release in 10 seconds you get an extremely nice body rush and a wave of psychedelia as you go to the next level.  That felt so good I had to do it again.  I thought of that word "fiendy" from the first post in this thread, because I went back several more times, loading an eye-balled amount of 5-MeO-sexfiend into the bong and blasting off higher and higher.  The physical pleasure from the erotic while doing this can be substantial.  Enough said.

My moxy has been stored as a powder at room temperature in baggies (double bagged). It is still as potent as the day I got it. My room gets pretty damn hot in the summer too, it's like a furnace in here.


I will put some in to solution for ease of storage and dosing, and just to generally keep things tidy and consistent, but anything stored as a powder will still be fine. Just keep it away from obvious moisture and heat sources, and it will be fine.


I can't help you on the 10-panel drug screen, but I very much doubt it will show up as anything.

I usually keep mine in a fridge in a plastic container, in zipped baggies and have never noticed any problems with it. I've recently had some in a closet at room temperature for a couple weeks and am hoping it hasn't hurt it. I'm pretty sure it'll be fine like this at least for a couple months.

I want to warn anyone who plans on trying this chemical to proceed with extreme caution and don't even think about measuring without a mg scale. The difference between 10mg and 20mg and god forbid 30mg is HUGE. Huge as in a possible trip to the hospital due to the possibility of a stroke or a heart attack due to the extreme vasoconstriction that occurs. 


Hospitalization was almost required after foolishly redosing another 10-15mg after a delayed onset from an original 10mg. Experienced first obvious +4...without pleasure at all. Lips turned blue and was on the verge of having a heart attack. All that could be done was let go and ride it out, scared shitless. 1 pupil obviously larger than other didn't help. Had extreme anxiety and felt like breathing was about to come to a hault. Was not a pleasant experience and quite frankly 5-meo-mipt will never be touched again lol. Watching wife paint while slow, new age music being played in the background only added grief to dieing much to early in life. Nobody at risk for stroke or heart attack needs to exceed 10mg of this stuff. This was 99% 5-meo-mipt hcl from an extremely reputable vendor a few short months ago. 


Be CAREFUL with this stuff. I cannot stress this enough.

maan i cant imagine the come up of 30mgs 

recently i tried 20mg and even though the trip was pretty mellow and not so diffrent than 17mg the come up was too intense 

17mg is my upper limit but is just as good at 10-15

The comeup was very confusing. About 10 minutes after redosing(50 minutes after first 10mg) it started to come on strong. It was a very confusing time which can only be defined as a period of extreme derealization. Everything started losing meaning and I didn't know how to emotionally react to anything. Eyes went blurry, 1 pupil obviously larger than other which freaked me out and from then on I convinced myself that I OD'd. No shit sherlock lol but I felt empending doom. Before laying down due to the extreme vasoconstriction, all that could be spoken were single words like "confused" or "benzo now". Benzos were sadly nowhere around...


Never again lol I'm MORE than happy with mescaline extracts if I want to indulge in a psychedelic. Be carefull my fellow psychonauts.

I couldn't agree more. For anyone, no matter how experienced they are with psychedelics, I HIGHLY recommend no one try more than 10mg their first time. The dose-response curve on this is very steep. There's a definite difference between even 10mg and 12mg, and 15mg is substantially different from 10mg. This is absolutely not one to take lightly and for sure not one to ever try to eyeball. When you get the right dose, this is my favorite chemical, but you do need to be careful with it.

Just wan't to add that combining pure a-PVP ahead of 5-meo-mipt wil give you a lucid state.

I've done a couple more smoked 5-MeO-MiPTs binges since my last post in this thread and have some new information to share.  


Smoking this compound you can really burn through your supply.  If you do 10mg oral doses a half gram would be 50 5 hour trips.  But smoked I can easily burn through 100 mg in a couple of hours.  After awhile caution goes out the window and I'm just dumping the stuff into the pipe.  Smoked 5-MeO-MiPT is great for an evening where you just want to get high while watching a movie because 1-2 hours is about the duration of the experience when smoked.  While smoking I did feel some pressure on the chest.  I'm healthy but a person with a compromised cardio-vascular system may want to tread cautiously.


Finally, last night I tried combining smoked 5-MeO-MiPT with smoked 5-MeO-DMT with sexual activity.  Sweet mother of pearl, you can get really out there and sexual functioning works just fine while you do it.  I was watching a porno and it was almost Picasso-like cubism.  Usually when you get that high maintaining an erection becomes difficult or impossible.  Not with these compounds.

Though I've researched this many times I have never taken it on back to back days. I'm going to be going camping soon and will most likely be using this at some point during the trip. Does anyone have experience using this on back to back days? Is it like other chems where you need to double your dose to get back to where you were the first time?


Edit: Nevermind, went back and according to at least one person I should be able to redose with not too much of a problem.

I can have orgasm after orgasm on 5-MeO-MIPT, and they're not just any orgasms, but "OMG, all is perfect in the world and time has stopped this is Nirvana" orgasms. And even better, it takes only about 2 minutes to get another erection after them.
