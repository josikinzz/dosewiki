## Subjective Experience

It should be noted at the outset that passiflora is an MAOI*, meaning that you should
thoroughly research prior to its use with any other compound or botanical. Better
still do not use it in the chronological proximity of any other drug use. Abstain for at
least a few days before and after unless you really know what you are doing.

Passiflora is one of the most commonly used botanicals in this class, and is often sold
as an aid to combat insomnia, including by major retail chains.

I have only used it a couple of times, primarily because I found it to be a little rough.
It did seem to help induce sleep, but the sleep cycles were somewhat distinct, and I
tended to consciously awake between them.

Did I dream? Yes, but due to the abruptness of the cycles, these were not particularly
satisfying episodes. However, it could well be that knowledge of the above matters
was a contributory factor to in the framing of this experience.
