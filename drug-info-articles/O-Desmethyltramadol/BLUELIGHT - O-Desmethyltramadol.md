Well I have the opportunity to try out this chemical.  I know it's what Tramadol metabolizes into and it's suppose to be responsible for the opiod effects.

I don't know much about this drug, if you enjoy tramadol I am sure it could be good but lots of people don't care for it. I imagine it would be a lot like tramadol but with lower doses needed for effects and less SNRI effects, possibly none.


If you have 80mg OC tolerance you probably wont get a whole heap out of this drug, assuming its not much stronger than tramadol and there is still the seizure risk.

Yea I used to enjoy tramadol before I got into OC.  So yea I suppose it's not worth it with the seizure risk due to the tolerance now.

Any info on dosing? I'v got no opiate tolerance and this one seems very interesting to me.

I took some of the Krypton Kratom which was found by several sources to contain this tramadol metabolite. As a user of hydrocodone and morphine, I actually found it to give a buzz alot different from tramadol. Not strong by any means, but it keeps w/d's at bay for awhile and gave me a semi-body buzz. Not sure of the exact dose but I took 2 caps.

The weird part was it didn't feel like tramadol. Trams give me an excited energy for around 4 hours and makes me feel happy in a geeky kind of way. O-Desmethyltramadol, or what was supposed to beO-Desmethyltramadol(no way to know 100percent ) felt more chill like a low dose hydrocodone mixed with some weird darvocet type feelings. Not great, but acceptable when your desperate.

Damn, you lucky bastard. Tramadol is one of my favorite drugs, and I would give my left nut to try O-desmethyltramadol. I would give my right nut for a perpetual prescription for Nucynta (talpentadol). Haven't tried it yet but god willing I shall.

From what I have compiled after searching the internet, if you have any opiate tolerance, this is not worth the money.  As stated already, it is similar to Tramadol which already has the general idea of not being worth it.  Also because of that, it still, as also previously stated, has the risk for seizures.  I know of one person on another forum I post on with big opiate experience who had a tramadol seizure himself, so it does happen, and it is scary.  


I assume that since a certain site put this substance up for sale recently, around the time of this thread being created, there will be a huge wave of questions asking about this.  Also, RC sites offering an Opioid-like product is NEW and FUCKING EXCITING!  They just need to offer better shit now and then I will be happy.  As an IV opiate user, this was exciting at first, but then disappointing once I actually did my research and realized what it actually was.


For someone with no opiate tolerance/very little, this might be worth it.  Assuming you were doing 100mg doses of this (I got that number from somewhere else on BL, not sure if it is legit or not) you would get ~10 doses per gram. *snip*

wouldn't this be active at lower doses than 100 mgs for someone without opiate tolerance?! Doses of tramadol can be as low as 50 mgs or less so a starting dose of this should be much lower I guess

^ Um no, it is not "part" of tramadol.


The pharmacological profile of Tramadol is far more complex than that of plain o-desmethyl. 


Tramadol itself has a strong affinity for SERT but weak affinity for NET and opioid receptors. Both O-desmethyl isomers have a negligible (none?) affinity for SERT and a high affinity for Mu and, in the case of M1 (forgot which isomer this one is), a high affinity for NET.


What this means is that when you take tramadol, you experience 3 distinct and very synergistic effects. When you take o-Desmethyl, you experience one less of these, and thus the synergy is very different.


For all intents and purposes, they are two completely different drugs. 


p.s. Why on earth is this in BDD?? It should be in ADD!!

I think it's probably in BDD as it's recently been "unleashed" on the wider RC market so a fair few folks who maybe wouldn't normally visit ADD will probably be trying it in the near future, Jammy.


I'm actually quite interested in this one myself as I have a certain fondness for tramadol and a wider fondness for opioids in general. I must admit I enjoy the slightly stimulating flavour that tramadol provides but am tempted by this stuff. Even if only for novelty value.

This is spot on, Jamshyd.  I have not tried O-desmethyltramadol on its own.  I use tramadol for antidepressant effects, as my depression has a significant component of body aches.  SSRIs affect my mood adversely and I cannot tolerate the side effects of any I have tried.


The synergy appears to balance my mood.  I could abuse it, but why?  Between benzodiazepine therapy and tramadol, my depression and panic disorder are approaching remission.  


I am abstinent from other opiates and have been for years.  I will note, though, that if I forget to take my dose of tramadol, I am prone to nausea.  We don't know if that's my nerves or me getting "dopesick".  I have halved my dose as of this week, remain stable, no w/d.  I would like to be free of it but will not be hesitant to reinstitute my sensible dose if my symptoms return.


Tramadol is a wonderful drug for atypical depression.  I see no real point in abusing variants or metabolites of it, particularly among people with an existing opiate tolerance.

It is *similar* to tramadol. Yes.


It is *chemically-related* to tramadol, yes.


It IS tramadol? No.


It is PART OF tramadol? No.

EDIT: Wait, if you are actually asking me, rather than giving a rhetorical question, then my answer would be: I don't know, since I haven't tried it (yet). But since tramadol itself is so unique and incomparable to any other opiate I tried, and seems to have different effects of different people, this class of "mutant-opioids" seems to be incomparable to other, more traditional opioids.

posa: I found tramadol has almost miraculous affects on stopping any kind of desire to drink alcohol. Just writing this brings me to tears because for those of us who can use it for this purpose, the tramadol itself presents a big addiction problem as well. Please be careful. I would never want to see you suffer what I did ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png).

Tramadol addiction is definitely no fucking joke. The depression I feel without it, the loss of motivation, etc.


Jamshyd - And it's weird that you say that about it stopping the desire to drink, and although I'm not an alcoholic, I am a Xanax addict and it (tramadol) helps keep me away from that shit.

I'm not really into opiates so I don't think I'll get hooked. The most I've had is about 400 mgs codeine a day some years ago. I just want something to land after a trip so I will only take it ocasionally.

For those saying 'OMG I LOVE TRAMADOL' regarding this, it is certainly nothing like it in terms of effects. 


Feels much more like a stronger opiate, lasts a decent amount of time, too. I've nodded on it, and I've also spend hours on it being ridiculously stimulated, rambling to people on MSN. For some reason, it did feel somewhat more 'dirty' than most other strong opiates. 


I guess I enjoyed it. For some reason I find it hard to say. But I do not find it hard to say that the effects are not anything like Tramadol. 


Does anyone say that Methamphetamine feels simillar to MDMA? No. But there are chemical  simillarities. Certainly doesn't mean the effects will be comparable. 


I'd really hate people getting into this simply because they like Tramadol and think that, because the name of this chem is simillar, it will be simillar. 


This is *not* simply a stronger version of Tramadol.

In all honesty, I couldn't tell you the dose. The first times I'd tried it was with that Krypton Kratom stuff. Who knows how much they put in there? 


After that with the 'pure' powder, I was rather silly and eyeballed it. Not something I normally do. 


Sorry about not being too clear on this.

I'd rather not estimate how much I had taken, incase I mention a much higher figure and someone takes it as advice. 


If anybody knows how much is in the Kryptom Kratom though, I've probably taken a bit over a gram of that overall on some occasions, to good effect. Tastes foul though, and who knows exactly how much I would have taken with that gram of plant material there?


I'm certain though, considering the effects, it'd likely be rather addictive. I doubt anybody would be surprised if it is.

That's what's wrong with selling products without being specific about what's in them. People could have ODed. Luckily there'll be little quantities of the stuff in the krypton product.

Yes they do. I did, there are certainly some crazy similarities between the two. The 'rolling' feeling, the racing thougts, the feelings of empathy...


Not trying to start shit, it's just that, this is the reason that people are going to be like "I think tramadol is fun, I wanna try this other tramadol stuff, too." Seems to me that's how alot of people think.

im a curious cat and this ones got my attention.


i wont go out buying any just yet, knowing that i have problems with opiate addiction.

But if some happens to cross my path i wont decline.


Im interested to see what the people think of it once more rerports start rolling in.


Do we know anything about this drug?

Dose?

Duration?

most importantly, is it as likely to cause seaizures as tramadol?

ahem...you do realize that this is the principle metabolite of tramadol? it is majorly responsible for the opioid activity of tramadol - the SSRI and SNRI effects are nuances - this is the heart of tramadol euphoria. anyone who has taken tramadol has effectively taken o-desmethyltramadol - so yes they are similar, very similar.

This is the one I'd like answered.

I guess starting very low (10-20 mgs) would be the best as we have no idea.

In provoking seizures.


Ki for human mu opioid receptors (nM)


Tramadol (racemate): 17,000

Tramadol (+): 15,700

Tramadol (-): 28 800

O-Desmethyltramadol (racemate): 3190

O-Desmethyltramadol (+): 153

O-Desmethyltramadol (-): 9680

Morphine: 7.1


Less is more, as these are the required concentrations to displace a known substrate.

And, with this inclusion of this substance in their catalogue, I would wager mucho that this place will not be around much longer.

less potent in it's seizure inducing potential, meaning you're less likely to get a seizure with this stuff than you are with regular tramadol.

thanks for the info

so those numbers have nothing to do with potency?

wouldn't it be logical to think its between tramadol and morphine in potency (closer to the potency of tramadol)

My guess is, probably, but as it seems to be a strong opioid I'd proceed carefully.  That it is a NET substrate also concerns me, as it may give the illusion of wakefulness similar to combinations like speedballs while you proceed perilously towards dosages that may suppress the respiratory system enough to kill you.

I'm a low dose person and don't really re-dose (except for mephedrone which I have decided to stop using). I just want an idea of the potency but I guess starting at 10 mgs would be safe enough right?!

^Fuck no, I know nothing about this drug but 10mg is WAY too high to start titration of an unknown substance. Seriously, if you go around taking drugs you know nothing about at doses like that you will fuck yourself up bigtime. What if you did that with fentanyl, or LSD, or DOx, or benzos? You would be fucked in the head or in the cold hard ground. If you're making an educated guess then I apologise for this reaction, but if you think that 10mg is a safe starting dose with anything then you need education as a matter of urgency.

Just writing this brings me to tears because for those of us who can use it for this purpose, the tramadol itself presents a big addiction problem as well. Please be careful.

Very much noted, and with thanks for your kindness.  I have started halving the 50 mg pills, of which I have a reasonable supply for a slow taper, and I notice absolutely no w/d still.  I think I picked the right time and am doing it the right way.  I do not want to be a slave to psych meds forever, and now that my depression has largely alleviated (simply due to life improvements) I see no need to keep going with it as an antidepressant.  I can certainly see taking it for occasional knee aches (old injury, mildly arthritic) or menstrual cramps (mainly) but that's on an as-need basis.


I'm interested as hell in Tianeptine as both an anxiolytic and antidepressant, but that is another thread entirely.


I would not elect to try any opiate analogues at this point, after someone I cared for deeply died as a result of a fentanyl analogue.  I believe the lab, not the human body, is the place to attempt to titrate safe doses.

Work it up.  Start with 1mg and double your dose until you find activity, maybe trialling it every other day.

I remember Haribo1 talking about this a couple years ago. I believe he mentioned dosage in the thread. I can't seem to find it, yet.

> The M1 metabolite (o-desmethyl) is the active drug. Tramadol is a cut-down codeine analog so it's only really active when that ether is removed. I had the chance to sample the M1 metabolite and it's a LOT stronger. Snorting gives a similar hit to morphine (but more speedy). You may ask how? Well, a LONG time ago Grunthenthal asked for volenteers to test this group of pain-killers out. I signed up and they very stupidly left vials of solution unlocked. I pocketed some vials of the M1. I took it home, dried it & snorted it. 30mg gives a great hit!

Woot! First one to try it!

Well, yes they were tiny lines.

I have one of those cheap ebay scales thats enough accurate to measure 20mg and above.

(looks like this, different brand

[http://img.diytrade.com/cdimg/792795/8395574/0/1237799142/digital_diamond_scales.jpg](http://img.diytrade.com/cdimg/792795/8395574/0/1237799142/digital_diamond_scales.jpg))

I just weighted 20mg and its enough for two decent lines, bigger than the ones I did.

I`m smoking jwh-018 too which seems to amplify the effect. Its not super euforic but my eyes want to be like this ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)

I don't mean to be pedantic here, but M1 is a common abbreviation for methylone, using it to refer to 0-desmethyltramadol as well could cause (potentially dangerous) confusion.

i just took 50mg with absolutely no opioid tolerance (now or ever) even so the effects are VERY mild and im assuming something closer to 100mg will be required for effect.

well its supposedly has little to no SSRI effects and I would guess if you took something like a low dose of clonidine with it that it would cancel out the NRI effects, in theory there wouldn't be a ceiling like with tramadol. I could be wrong but I bet you can take a lot more of this stuff than regular tramadol and it is more potent as well. I believe it is 4-8x stronger than tramadol so if 400mg of tramadol is what you need to feel anything from it then yeah 100mg of M1 would be 4x stronger and sounds like a decent dose to start with if you are opiate tolerant.

From the PD forum but also relevant here so am reposting as there's so few reports on the stuff used alone let alone in combo. Must admit I'm getting more tempted by the minute although seems kinda pricey for the (higher) doses quoted so far - novelty value only, I suspect. Waiting on more reports so fly, my lil guinea pigs, fly :D

I think I picked the right time and am doing it the right way.  I do not want to be a slave to psych meds forever, and now that my depression has largely alleviated (simply due to life improvements) I see no need to keep going with it as an antidepressant.  I can certainly see taking it for occasional knee aches (old injury, mildly arthritic) or menstrual cramps (mainly) but that's on an as-need basis.

I am very happy to see that you're able to taper down without trouble.


As you may remember from my posting while in Thailand, I failed all attempts at tapering, especially that there one can obtain a 100-pill box for the equivalent of $5. Quitting cold turkey for tramadol was in many ways WORSE for me than doing the same with Heroin, probably largely due to the SNRI withdrawal. Your taper should present you with little or no trouble if you keep it up.


As for fentanyl analogues, I totally agree. If you check the BL shrine, you'll find a thread for "staypuft" who was a friend of mine. He died of a fentanyl-analogue sold as an RC.

I don't know how it compares to morphine (I have only tried codeine and dihidrcodeine) but this is a a very clear headed and mild opioid. I have had 55 mgs and I'd say this isn't much more potent than codeine.

From the few reports I've seen it would appear to be more similar in potency to DHC than codeine but have yet to sample. Sounds like pretty weak stuff, to be honest.

I ended up having another 15 mgs thus making my total dose 70 mgs.

Yeah, the potency might be around that of DHC. The main difference is that DHC tended to knock me out (send me to bed, or maybe it was just because I did take it in order to get some relief from a pain I had at the time) while O-dmTramadol is much more clear headed and active, at least for me.

^ Yup. DHC (like codeine and also tramadol) seems to have a whole range of effects and effective doses between individuals. Have known of some people who are KO'd on 60mg of codeine and others who can eat DHC all day long and not feel a thing. DHC is technically the stronger of the two but many report subjectively feeling it's the other way round.

Do you know if the same is true of dihydromorphine and dihydroheroin Shambles? They seem like a weird family, apparently dihydroheroin is less potent that dihydromorphine.

To be honest, I've never even heard of either of them, Yerg. Do they go by other names at all?

Sham, dihydromorphine is Paramorfan I think, and dihydroheroin is diacetyldihydromorphine properly. Never encountered either, just aware of them.

Final review on my 70 mgs try.

The first hours were very clear headed and mild. Later, as I reached 70 mgs I noded on and off for some time before finally going to bed. 70 mgs was enough for me (no opioid tolerance).

no offense but I think one of the reasons people are finding it so "mild" is because they aren't taking nearly enough. I mean how can you compare it to codeine when you aren't even taking 100mg. would you expect 50-75mg of codeine to do much at all? really I mean I'm not trying to encourage people to take massive doses but if you are already opioid tolerant 100-200mg is probably more in the range of what you would want to take. when I get to try it I plan on starting with 100mg. as you can read above, someone who had no opioid tolerance got good effects from 75mg. so if 75mg is a good dose for non-tolerant people a higher dose would be required for people with a tolerance.

Not such a big surprise that its active around the same range as Tramadol.Animal data suggested about 2-4x the potency of Tramadol.Its thought to cross the BBB a bit more difficult.

My guess is that this stuff is probably a lot more potent any other route than oral because the liver is probably good at conjugating the phenol or n-demethylation to N,O-didesmethyl-tramadol.

Snorting is apparently not such a hot idea according to one who's tried it - mentioned [here](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showpost.php?p=7673008&postcount=21). That's only one report, of course.

If you want to try something different, you could try taking some sublingually (crush them up and put them under your tongue). **I've tried snorting O-desmethyltramadol powder before which is the strong M1 metabolite of tramadol. Snorting it burned quited a bit and I ended up with a sinus infection as a result of snorting it just a couple times. **

**I tried it**


Good news everyone !


I tried it !


I did 30mg rectally. I did this dose because I read about it being 3 time the potency of tramadol. I also read that 20-40% of the tramadol is converted to  O-Desmethyltramadol. I use to be addicted to tramadol and this is not like it at all. The opiate part of tramadol addiction is not the bad part it is the ssri one....  


Anyway I dissolved 30mg of it and shove it up ma ass after. And I like this opiate I am itchy as hell and I love it. 


See you tomorrow

O-Desmethyltramadol is not tramadol. Pretty sure tramadol works plugged anyway. May not be the best way of using it but it will work. Oral just works better.

People also say plugging codeine is useless. It isn't though. Given the number or people who do plug tram I would assume it must also work even if it is far less effective. Can't really see how it wouldn't work at all - it'll still be absorbed into the bloodstream and metabolised, surely? Wouldn't bother myself cos there's no reason to use any other methods for tram as it works perfectly orally. This stuff seems to be anything but oral for effectiveness (although nasal sounds like it may be a bad idea too). Wonder about IV... not that I'm suggesting anybody should but must admit it intrigues me...

I know the drugs are different, but I just assumed they would be processed by the body in a similar way, but I guess that is a stupid assumption because of the "o-desmethyl" part, right?

Great thread! Just found this substance *snip* and have been looking for info ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


When I try it I will be taking it orally, the only thing I'm worried about is if this is particularly bad for the liver? (Because of the double-dose needed when taking orally)


Has anyone tried with a small dose of clonazepam or diazepam (to lower the seizure-risk.)?

^I don't think the seizure risk is such that one would want to prepare by stacking a benzo on top of an opiate. That's a dangerous combination, better to take benzo to cancel a seizure, in the unlikely event that one occurs.


Also wouldn't worry about liver toxicity, I've never heard of any problems with tramadol which doesn't suggest any cause for concern with O-desmethyl_

You should try to plug it. 


To do this you would use a small oral syringe (the one without needle). Put half of your oral dose in it. Be careful to wet the inside of the dispenser to avoid throwing precious powders aways. And use milk and a little air bubble and shake to dissolve the substance. Then put 1cm of the syringe in your rectum, dont worry it wont make you gay, and inject the liquid.


Your *high* will be **better** and you will take **less**.


And I second **spacefacethebassace** **Benzo on top of an opiate. That's a dangerous combination**

Its about an hour later, and the effect is definitely noticeable but not super strong. I think i may either take more or take some phenazepam instead (my first time with the substance as well). Perhaps its not such a great idea, but if its anything like lorazepam (as its structure suggests) it should be relatively mild....


The o-desmethyltramadol has typical opioid properties, itching, pupil constriction, dizziness and some analgesia. Its not terribly euphoric or sedating, and it lacks the tweakiness of tramadol. I think i will dose higher, or perhaps try rectal administration. For the price this stuff is kind of expensive; it would be a better deal in bulk than by the gram...

Phenazepam ain't that good imo, and very easy to go overboard. No one here willing to try IV? Come on guys, goats did it! Meh, I guess I'll be the test rat next week.

Well, I killed the whole package tongiht all 100mg. 


The effects were not a strong as i expected (no pinned pupils, excessive itchiness).


I took the first couple hundred mgs with some effect, then snorted about 50mg.


The rest i took dissolved in water (yes, its water soluble) and administered rectallly. The second time I added about 3mg of phenazepam to 100mg of rectal o-dsmt. 


I nodded out shorter after that, but woke up shortly after feeling relatively nornal and refreshed. This does not seem to last long. 


Mabye i'll try more, or perhaos I will mix some with bateriostatic water and a micron it through into a sterial vial, at a concentration of maybe 10g per ML and try to take it IV (with BnOH  as a preservatiive). I have had tramadol ampules and they were great....


What i notice from tramadol and its analogics is a sort of "chold feeling" not the warm feeling you'd get from something like morphine or hydromorphine. Whoe knowns,maybe its muuhc better IVed....

O-desmethyltramadol does not act as an SSRI. it should not be anywhere near as likely to cause seizures as tramadol does.

I thought Tramadol gives seizures because it acts as GABA Agonist at higher doses?

At the start of this thread I stated the same ^^^. It's good if you're desperate, but not the great, easy to get RC opiate most of the people reading and replying to this thread imagine it to be.

It seems rather enticing to me.  I tend to like the stimulating end of opioids but am nigh immune to tramadol (200 mg is a threshold, with zero acquired tolerance).  This leads me to believe that I metabolize tramadol into its o-desmethyl derivative rather poorly.

OK, I scanned the thread and didn't see this, sorry if it's a repeat.

I imagine that since this is a metabolite of an opioid it would trigger a drug test, correct?  If so, I assume it would be out of your blood sooner.

Nobody drug tests for tramadol or O-desmethyltramadol. They aren't even controlled substances most places.


Drug tests do not and cannot test if a drug is in a certain "class" of drugs, like an "opioid". It can only detect specific, predetermined molecules and any molecules which trigger a false positive despite the design of the test.


With a NIDA 5 test you get tested just for codeine metabolite I think, which covers heroin and morphine as well. Some tests, although rare, in addition will test for buprenorphine, methadone, and hydrocodone (which covers oxycodone).

There is one lab in the USA that *does *test for Tramadol, there may be more I don't know about.


The question of course is do employers ask for Tramadol testing or not, and I would say most probably don't; it's possible that some health care employers would, to try to screen out prescription drug (ab)users who might prove troublesome with regard to workplace legal liabilities.

Yeah by 'nobody' I meant no employers or government agencies routinely check for it. They may send it to that one lab you mention if they suspect that the person being tested is specifically addicted to tramadol, but no generic drug screen panel is going to include tramadol.

My TR.

Preamble: Still slightly hung over from a mephedrone ride yesterday midday (160mg total, first time use, and I DID manage to stop before the bag ran out!) followed up by 6mg bromazepam (the best benzo I've ever tried) and 12g poppy tea to ease the comedown.


Opiate tolerance is moderate (80mg OC give me a nice rush but no nod, and I consume pod tea daily) and I am most likely dependent. No pod tea consumed since last night.


Received 1g from well known RC suplier. 

Day 1, I took a small swipe of dust and put it under the tongue. No reaction.

Day 2. 10mg under the tongue. No reaction.

Day 3. 

11:05:  100mg dissolved in 3ml water and plugged.

11:14:  Slight but noticeable deviation from baseline noted; a very mild sense of being at ease.

11:16:  That feeling of fullness in my stomach that I associate with opiates is present

11:16:  Lower back pain from defenerative facet joints is easing up. Placebo? 

11:21:  I am definitely relaxed, in a good mood, and getting the munchies. However, none of the normal opiate warmth is present.

11:23:  Analgesia is present, comparable to 200mg Celebrex (I skipped my morning celebrex dose to better evaluate the analgesia.

11:30:  Effects are no longer increasing in strength. Pleasant semi-opiated sense. About 3/10 in intensity with H being 10, PT at best being 8, OC being 7. Like codeine without the warmth.

11:35  No itching, moderate meiosis. 


Will update later, off to play some L4D2 for now. So far, I'd say it's a pleasant and enjoyable experience, though mild.  Will likely be very useful for w/d but not much else. If it doesn't get any stronger I will add some Soma in and see how much that enhances it. It's not particularly euphoric. I'd say plain leaf kratom (when I don't have an opiate tolerance) provides more euphoria.


This does have potential, but like I said more for w/d aid or in a combination with something else.

I'd kind of been expecting to see many more trip reports by now, as people begin to receive delivery. Where are they?


11:49:  I do feel really nice; my mood, while not euphoric, has been pleasantly lifted and at the same time I am experiencing a mild anxiolytic effect.  It's definitely enjoyable and stronger than I had anticipated. If it weren't so expensive I'd probably order a few more grams to have around. I suspect it'd mix very nicely with a psychedelic. As it is, I will not reorder this one, but I am glad to have experienced it. I will update once more when the effects diminish for an idea of duration.


3:23:  Still just as strong. It is long lasting for sure. My back pain is creeping back though. I did re-dose about two hours ago, plugged another 80mg along with 10mg of mephedrone to increase the euphoria. Definitely nodding, very relaxed, but still none of the characteristic warmth.

5:46pm:  Still feel it, having a few nods. Better than I was anticipating for sure, but still not quite the real thing. Great analgesia, though. Will save it for when I need to withdraw, it'll be an easy thing to taper down.


Edit: Any mods can combine this with the last post? Didn't mean to make a new post, meant to edit it.

Does it seem odd to anyone else that o-desmethyl does not seem to be anywhere near  as potent as it appears on paper.  Most references seem to indicate that o-desmeth should be many many times more potent then tram on a mg to mg basis.  Some reports even suggest it could be up to 10 times more potent a mu agonist then tramadol.  But from reports Ive seen, most people dont seen to get any real effects until the 100mg mark, and even then they are just baseline (any many of the reports are from ppl with little to no opioid tolerance).  I know of one member here who consumed an entire gram in one night and while he certainly felt decent effects, it was  nowhere near as potent as one would expect.  It could guess that in reality, o-desmethyl is likely only about 2 or 2.5 times stronger then tramadol itself.


Any theories as to why the actual increase in potency is nowhere near the presumed theoretical increase?-DG

not that I am aware of. however if it is reasonably pure and cut with

Well it seems one of the suppliers of this is no longer going to be carrying it.  I was very tempted to order it when it was first available but I am glad I waited it out.  For the price of 1g of this stuff, I think anyone with a opiate tolerance would just be better of getting 30 poppy pods.  


I am curious as to why the vendor is discontinuing it after it only being available for 2 weeks.

The vendor posted on a private forum that their lab was getting cold feet about producing more of it, and also the vendor was getting emails from old customers begging them to stop selling it, so it was decided to drop it. Seems like a wise decision.

As an opioid, it's too high profile a drug, I'd guess. No vendor needs that kind of attention.

Because opioids bring unwanted attention to the vendor who is really careful about legislation and stuff.

**Careful** with the dose guys!!! 30mg gave me more than enough effects! Onset at 15min, peaking between 2h and 3h, with a clear maximum at 2.5h, off at 3h, not out at 4h, sleep at 5h good but not quickly achieved. Its comparable with 150mg Tramadol, but there's more of an opiate effect which usually takes even higher doses of Tramadol.


I'm not an opiate user (only had M once in 1985 after an explosion accident with surgery), but I love my occasional Tramadol though hadn't it for maybe 2 months. I advise strongly against taking 100mg of O-Desmethyltramadol as a first dose for a non-tolerant user!


And DON'T snort it, it looks like theres an excess hydrochloride acid present. HPLC is 95.3%, MS is okay. NMR appears also ok, but I have to look closer, will post it later, gotta go to an appointment. But you can PM me your email to get the spectras (can't post pdf's here!?).

Thanks for the info! 95% pure then?! I'd say pure enough.

I'm not opiate tolerant either and found 70 mgs a little too much: It made me nod which had never happened to me with codeine or DHC and I had a headache the next day and some weird half awake dreams before finally falling asleep. 35 mgs was a my next try and it was ok. No nodding, no headache the next day no weird dreams. My sweet spot might be around 40-50 mgs.

I've got a gram of this on the way, i'll post reports once i've tested it. 


I'm assuming that you can't chase (smoke) it?


Are there any other easily availiable opiate analogues, i.e. ones you can get online?

first post on bluelight.


got a gram of this stuff about a week ago, been experimenting with it.

taken it several times, in varying doses from 10 mg to 50 mg, oral, plugged, and insufflated.


40 mg insufflated gives a nice, mellow buzz that lasts a few hours.  not as euphoric as something like OC but definitely better than codeine, IMO. noticeable mood lift and great anxiolytic effects.  itching like crazy as well.


also tried some with mephedrone the other day, 40 mg of each plugged.  it was my first time doing mephedrone and i have to say it was one of the most euphoric comeups i have ever had.   the meph probably had a lot to do with that, but even so, it was a good combination.  proceeded to go on a 2+ gram binge with some friends after that.  that shit is impossible to stop doing once you get the rush.  


off topic, but anyway, id say 0-desmethyltramadol is a good investment for those without access to other opiates, or who just want a mild downer when the need arises.

since o-desmethyltramadol is one of the active metabolites of tramadol i would think smoking it would work, if you can snort and plug it

If nobody's posted it yet I think the lowest dose made is 25mg which is about the threshold dose for most people.  Maybe an opiate naive person could feel 12.5.  So I guess a threshold dose of O-Desmethyl could be around 10mg give or take 5?

I took mine p.o. on an empty stomach.


As for the hcl, I could smell it weakly, after some time, after I placed the compound in a small glass bottle. Above the solid,on the glasswall, I noticed a few drops of a watery liquid (temperatur change due to transportation in the cold). Conclusion is that some hcl excess is present, respectively a hydrate form of Desmethyltramadol crystallised, or, aqueus hcl was used to make the hcl salt. Or, it was precipitated.Or its somewhat hygroscopic (store it dry!!)


There are a few small solvent peaks in the NMR pointing to difficulties to crystallize the salt. Not unexpected, given the presence of all those polar groups. 


While its probably not that much hcl,smelling on the compound though produces a slight sting in the nose. Not good to snort or plug if you ask me (or ask Yopo!?), but no problem to drink.


Hey, what was that great line from the Sisters of Mercy? With only a slight change it becomes "Acid on the ass so she walks on the ceiling" lol...

I started with 10-15 mgs and felt it weakly.

Threshold may be lower for more sensitive people.

I'd say for not opioid tolerant or sensitive people:

1-10 mgs threshold.

10-30 mgs low dose

30-60 average dose

60-onwards hard dose

You can smoke this stuff? I smoked virtually a half a gram off foil last night, and it works. The taste isnt terrible either. The powder melts then turns into a resin which smokes very nicely. If you hold the smoke of a big hit in for 40 seconds you start feeling it. The rest of the gram i took orally, and got pretty fucked up (nodding hard, stumbling around). No muscle spasms or anything like tramadol.....


Still, i'd say its only a decent opioid.....

If it takes a half gram smoked to get effects then that's horribly inefficient.

Has anyone else tried to smoke/vape?

I've been on methadone for about 8 years, after 12 years of IV use of heroin in one of the few place and times where police seizures were frequently testing in the low to mid 90's for purity. Although abstaining from all hard drugs, I moved about two years ago and been having to attend a clinic which only allows two weeks supply per visit where I was used to a month, and then phased me down once per week for giving a urine of 17 mg/dL of creatinine although I passed the retest and was prescribed to drink large amounts of water for kidney stones which were shredding my kidneys at the time. Having lowered my dosage from 80mg to 40, I was curious about whether O-desmethyltramadol as a moderate strength opioid could be similar in price while removing some of the bureaucracy of a methadone clinic, giving me some freedom to use cannabis and not have to drive an hour once per week to the clinic and risk missing days from snow, car trouble, etc. On my previous clinic these were not concerns because they didn't test for THC metabolites and within walking distance of my last residence was a clinic which gave 4 weeks of take home doses.


My first experiments were with low doses to be sure of allergies or the possibility of some antagonist activity to methadone which a few anecdotal reports of standard tramadol have described. I had no problems, and worked my way up to two 150mg insufflated doses per day which more than substituted for all but ten milligrams of my daily 40mg dose, but ran out before I got to a point where I felt comfortable with trying it to fully replace my daily methadone, but I think 300mg per day probably will. At this rate it costs roughly the same as my daily dose. The seizure issue concerns me still, but from my experience and the higher dose experiences posted, the seizure risk appears to be greatly lessened if not eliminated. 


The opioid effects of this compound appear to take about 3 hours to really feel fully, giving me the impression it's strength comes mostly from it's potency as an agonist and long in vivo half life but seems to have poor bioavailability. I also must say with my current methadone dosage, which I've levelled at for about a year leaves my feeling withdrawals in the morning after waking, and the two 150mg doses of this compound eliminated these problems. The product I had obtained smelled as if it had trace amounts of acetone, but could be another solvent as I'm not familiar with anything that isn't one of the standard consumer grade solvents like acetone, petroleum ether, ethanol, isopropanal etc. After leaving to air out over 3 days, the acetone smell,  burning in the nose and throat upon the drain had dissipated by approximately 90%, and highly recommend doing this if you notice the same.


I cannot speak too much about the subjective effects as I was only looking to see how much it would cost me to hold away withdrawals. I can say that the dosages put me at about what I consider to be the ceiling of most of the available poppy pods, with one exception who grows very thick tasmanian pods which are fairly expensive but the only pods that actually got me noticeably intoxicated. The effect seems more euphoric and less sleepy than methadone which is low euphoria and very tiring to those with a marked tolerance. It wasn't as euphoric as heroin,  top tier high quality poppies or morphine but moreso than even most above average poppy pods.


I hope someone can find this info useful, I'm planning to trial it further with a new sample soon.

I haven't heard any mention about it running out. Must be only some/most sources?

Well, 7 hours later and it wasn't too intense. Didn't get any sleep because of the stimulating effects, just sorta that enhanced dream/zone out state, but so far I'm still feeling good. Just IM'ed another 25mg, and have 25mg more I'll do in the next hour or so.


I think that even without any short-term tolerance, I could IM 50mg of this stuff and be safe. It would probably be pretty strong, but manageable, especially to another with strong opiate use under their belt.

I got a chemical taste in my mouth after plugging it.

Aren't you concerned about abscesses when you IM it? I'd think if you're going to go with a needle, you should go IV instead of IM since this stuff definitely isn't sterile nor, most likely, is your water or prep surface.

The complications from IV are much more serious than they are with IM. I'm not really concerned about abscesses. I'm taking the necessary precautions, and will go get medical help with the first sign of anything going wrong.


Even IM it seems to take 30 minutes or more to fully come on. It also lasts for quite a while. I can understand how people end up finishing a gram or so in a night. It is still pretty mild, and so the urge to redose and redose and redose can be pretty strong.


I also wonder if it's not a full agonist? The first time I took it after taking 15mg hydrocodone and it seemed to almost weaken the high at first, and then leveled out. Plus it seems like it hits a ceiling on euphoria.

Yeah, to me this seems to me a mild and RELATIVELY safe, in terms of overdose potential, but with a very long half life. Which imo has the makings of a very good maintenance drug. After returning to my daily methadone dosage, my mild morning withdrawal symptoms had been for the most part eliminated for about 3 days after my last use of the compound in question, possibly giving some insight into the extended in vivo half life of this compound. It also didn't appear to have a substantial effect on my tolerance or intensity of physical addiction, something which normally results quite rapidly after a temporary increase in methadone dosage. A quality compound in these respects. As a recreational opioid it is difficult to surpass the benchmark morphine and diamorphine, and I don't see this capable of hitting on that benchmark, although there are surely some opioids which probably could come closer in terms of the "sweet spot" in potency and receptor affinities to morphine and would be less close to being considered a controlled substance analog then say, ethcathinone.


Also, I'm planning on contacting the supplier to see if the rumors are correct concerning no longer stocking the compound or other opioids in general.

Bill, it's interesting you say something about stocking the compound. If we're thinking of the same supplier, I know for a fact that there was an announcement stating they will no longer sell it shortly after it first started selling. However, when I look back at the old news, it seems they took the announcement of retiring the chemical, off of their website. 


Perhaps this is a sign that they will continue stocking O-Desmethyltramadol. As I said, I know I saw the announcement previously, and others have as well, so they must have deliberately taken it out of their announcements. I don't know why they would do that unless they planned on keeping it around.

Looks like it is going away. My source says its the last batch, and you're only allowed to get 1g.


However, it seems really stimulating to me. Shares that property with tramadol. The only thing is that it seems to be a really, really good analgesic. I've had back pain that for the past week has been really intense, and it has been completely gone these past few days, even when I haven't been "high" on M1. 


I think this would make an excellent painkiller, because it seems to have low euphoria with a ceiling dose, and the analgesia lasts much longer than the euphoria and opiate-like effects. I really wish the companies would keep making this, as I doubt it would end up getting much publicity. Too weak to be picked up by mainstream people, which are the ones who would make it illegal and do stupid stuff with it

Got a 1g sample of this metabolite recently, can't say I'm terribly impressed.  A lot of Kratom in effects, just a bit more agonistic binding on the μ-opoid receptors with much longer half-life. I would rather have spent the amount I spent on this for Kratom instead, IMO. Interesting to get a legal pharm/RC opoid into the market, but this one is nothing special... this is no oxycontin, but has its place as a legit pharmaceutucal I think. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) O-Desmethyltramadol is generally the same deal as tramadol but 4-5x more potent. And it seems to be more selective in a sertonergic sense. 


85mg was the dosage involved in the experiment.

Quick question

Might someone who is on bupe be able to get some effects from this substance, or would it be totally blocked by bupe.

THe reason I ask is because I know tramadol is often prescribed to patients on bupe maintenance because its one of the few analgesics that would have an effect on someone who is on bupe (but I think this may be due to the non-opioid aspects of tramadol).


Anyway, I was just curious if anyone has experience with this, or can lend any opinions as to whether taking o-desmethyl on top of bupe might actually provide an effect, or if it would likely be completely blocked just liked other opioids.  THanks-DG

It works IV aswell, and most certainly gives good rushes. 50mg was a fairly low dose for a person who has taken oxycodone and buprenorphine (please notice that I do not have opiate tolerance at the moment). Suggested IV dose would be 50mg - 100mg for most users.


The best way to take it is IMHO rectally, works so much better than orally. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Ok, I've tried it now via two different methods - smoking (chasing) and sublingually (under the tongue).


Smoking - I used the 'chasing the dragon' method. I put 20mg on the foil and got around 8 large inhales from it. Once the lighter is applied it turns into a golden resin and then into smoke very quickly, no immediate 'rush' was felt although a pleasant sense of wellbeing came over me once I'd finished it all. 


After I'd smoked this I decided I wanted to take it further...


Sublingual - I used a small spoon to place 60mg straight under my tongue, I held my tongue down and closed my mouth and it didn't take long for it all to dissolve, now an increased sense of wellbeing has overcame me.


It's not a bad high at all although it is noticeably different to Tramadol, more sedating and relaxed, also stronger. The taste from both smoking and sublingual use was rather unpleasant (as to be expected really). 


Now my palms and feet are a bit sweaty and I'm feeling very slightly nauseas but no worse than Tramadol and still nicely high %) No itching noticed yet.


Considering the price I would rather take Tramadol although as always it's nice to try something new...now what to do with the rest of it?

Stronger than both codeine and dihidrcodeine now that I've had enough experience with the three of them.

Now I've done 300g in total, all sublingual apart from the first 20mg, the taste gets nice after a little while.


I am extremely happy with this chemical, it brings strong euphoria, talkativeness,  motivation and a very relaxed, 'not a care in the world' feeling. I got the itches but they weren't unpleasant, my pupils were tiny.


I've also had 20mg Diazepam (Valium), 500mcg Phenazepam, 50mg Promethazine (Phenergen), 3 x Tramadol 100mg SR, 4 x Tramadol 50mg IR (I don't recommend this as I know that mixing CNS depressants is a dangerous thing to do, although I do have experience in this area and I have a medium benzo tolerance and a very small tolerance to prometh and tramadol/opiates.)


What upsets me now is that the place I got it from have stopped selling it and I can't find it anywhere else ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Only a naturally high tolerance, I rarely use any opiates.


Later on in the evening I smoked some weed and it potentiated it even more, I felt really euphoric and it lasted the whole evening.


All in all I would say O-Desmethyltramadol is stronger than both Codeine and DHC, possibly even stronger than oral Morphine (which has a low oral BA). It's quite addictive though and very itchy (as be expected ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

So how much you should snort this to get nice high? I've tested this oral and plugged. Definitely plugging is the best method so far, as it needs only half of the dose that oral needs. Like 50mg plugges works as strong as 100mg oral, it lasts little shorter tho'. But what about snorthing or sublingual then? 


It appears that it isn't good idea to snort this, so I try sublingual method. Im trying to find most efficient way to use it, as taking it orally need pretty huge amount, and the only vendor that sold this is now outstocked and wont sell anymore of this nice goodie.

I had 30 mgs yesterday and after a few hours I was getting sleepy so I had 100 mgs mephedrone to wake up. Later I had another 20 mgs and went to sleep. Today I woke up feeling ok which is interesting as I usually get a headache the next day when I have O-desmethyltramadol from 40 t0 70 mgs.

Does that mean that the combination of benzos and O-desmethyltramadol is discussed in this thread or does it mean O-desmethyltramadol is a benzo? It isn't a benzo as far as I know. It's an opioid.

Yeah I noticed that earlier and PM'd one of the OD mods.


O-Desmethyltramadol is an opiate and definitely not a benzo so it's got to be a mistake.

I don't think it's been said in this thread, but does anyone know about o-desmethyl's seizure potential? I think there have been some musings that it doesn't have any seizure potential, or at least not as great as tramadol has. I also know that there are several people here who have killed 1g + in a day, and myself have probably used upwards of 250mg IM in a day.


So does anyone have any more info on this, or any anecdotal reports of seizure-like symptoms? I'm trying to figure out how safe this one is in excess. FWIW, I think this compound is very, very safe, as I have combined a large IM dose with lots of alcohol (dumb, i know), and several other people have combined large doses of o-desmethyl with large doses of other CNS depressants. So it looks like even combining with other drugs it appears to be pretty safe.

If you go through the thread from the start, there's a fair bit of info on the seizure risk. It's been summarised that O-Des is quite safe with a much lower seizure potential than Tramadol.


I've been using some more of this and I've come to the conclusion that a sublingual dose of between 50-100mg provides quite a nice, long lasting, relaxing high for someone with a low tolerance. It smokes quite nicely but I think I prefer sublingual over all.

100mg dose proves to be quite nice with a shot of hard alcohol or a little benzos. 100mg taken on its own would probably disappoint most hardheaded opiod users. Quite a worthwhile fine, though I doubt it'll be around much longer due to pharma patents.

I have to say I've become very fond of O-desmethyltramadol. It's sad it's not available anymore. It's perfect to land after a mephedrone binge...

O-Desmethyltramadol has 200 times the μ-affinity of tramadol.


Its not 4 or so times stronger as one other poster has stated.

The fact that it has that affinity does not mean it is 200 times stronger. I haven't tried tramadol but I have tried codeine and dihidrcodeine and I'd say DHC is about 50% more potent than codeine and O-desmethyltramadol 50% stronger than DHC. It's difficult to put it into numbers though. And each person is affected differently by each drug.

It is not, as tramadol is supposed to be as strong as codeine. At least with oral administration, I don't use any other way.

ok but i meant the M1 metabolite O-desmethyltramadol ...


is that only 4 times as strong as tramadol  ? this is what surprises me - as it has such a higher affinity

I was thinking of combining this with methylone, would that make a good combo?

Anyone have any experience with this combo?

Im down to my last 70mg of the stuff so was thinking of plugging it with 150mg methylone tomoz.

Unforunately, this product, in its pure form, is virtually nowhere to be found online anymore. I have seen some places on B2B trading sites like alibaba, who offer the product (one guy was in Cameroon, Africa), but they almost surely scams. 


The one legit supplier who was selling it stopped. I asked him why and this is what he said (pm me if you want this off):


> I can tell you in all honesty, our lab no longer produces that product. Yes, it's true we received a lot of customer pressure to get out of the opioid business, but at the same time our Chinese lab also received pressure from the local authorities that they should cease production of the stuff. My lab is very sensitive about such issues and wants to stay on good terms with the authorities so it doesn't take much to get them to stop.

> 
> I've heard that it's available elsewhere, but I really can't confirm that. There are certainly a hell of a lot of scam-looking traders on alibaba and elsewhere, but it's also hard sometimes to weed out the fake suppliers from the legit ones. So in short, I really can't help you. Sorry.

Its all for the better though, that stuff was very addictive, very easy to go through grams of it at a time. When IV'ed  (filtered to .45 micron) the quality was very high, especially when at a concentration of 200mg/ml.

I don't know man. Ask the experts about the matter. I'm only talking from personal experience. I don't know the theory.

BTW both methylone and mephedrone + O-desmethyltramadol work ok for me.
