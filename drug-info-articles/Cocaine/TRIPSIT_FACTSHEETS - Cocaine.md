# Cocaine
*Source: TripSit Factsheets (tripsit.me)*

## Summary

A highly popular, short-acting CNS stimulant that works by blocking the reuptake of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. It is known to increase euphoria, confidence, sex-drive, focus, body temperature, and heart rate. Cocaine can cause severe vasoconstriction and is known to be cardiotoxic and have a high potential for compulsive redosing and addiction.

- **Strong:** 100-150mg

*Note: Rapid onset. Depending on purity, dosage will vary*

## Duration
- **Duration:** 1-1.5 hours
- **After Effects:** 1-4 hours

## Effects
- Elevated mood
- Increase in irritability
- hyper-inflated ego
- euphoria
- stimulation
- raised heartrate
- numbing effects depending on ROA
- nausea (particularly at high doses)

## Interactions

### ⛔ Dangerous
- **amt**
- **maois**: This combination is poorly explored
- **opioids**: Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing for a higher dose of opiates than normal. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the individual and cause respiratory arrest.
- **tramadol**: Tramadol and stimulants both increase the risk of seizures.

### ⚠️ Unsafe
- **2c-t-x**: Cocaine and 2c-t-x both provide considerable stimulation. When combined they can result in severe vasoconstriction, tachycardia, hypertension, and in extreme cases heart failure.
- **5-meo-xxt**: The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants increase the chance of unpleasant thought loops. The combination is generally unnecessary because of the stimulating effects of psychedelics. 
- **alcohol**: Cocaine can decrease some of the intoxicating effects of alcohol, causing some people to drink more than they otherwise would, which leads to greater behavioral and physical health risks. There is also some debate about cocaethylene, a metabolite produced when combining alcohol and cocaine, with some researchers positing that it is more cardiotoxic than cocaine on its own. Use moderation when combining these substances.
- **dextromethorphan**: Both substances raise heart rate, in extreme cases, panic attacks caused by these drugs have led to more serious heart issues
- **dox**: The combined stimulating effects of the two can lead to an uncomfortable body-load, while the focusing effects of cocaine can easily lead to thought loops. Coming down from cocaine while the DOx is still active can be quite anxiogenic
- **nbomes**: Cocaine and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation. When combined they can result in severe vasoconstriction, tachycardia, hypertension, and in extreme cases heart failure.
- **pcp**: This combination can easily lead to hypermanic states
- **pregabalin**: There is a significant risk of seizures from this combination. Stimulants increase respiration rate, allowing for a higher dose of sedatives than normal. If cocaine wears off first, recreational dosages of pregabalin may overcome the individual and cause respiratory arrest. Both substances at recreational dosages strain the heart and may lead to further dangerous heart complications. The combination has a greater risk of methemoglobinemia when higher dosages are combined.

### ⚡ Caution
- **2c-x**: The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants increase the chance of unpleasant thought loops. The combination is generally unnecessary because of the stimulating effects of psychedelics. Combination of the stimulating effects may be uncomfortable.
- **amphetamines**: This combination of stimulants will increase strain on the heart. It is not generally worth it as cocaine has a mild blocking effect on dopamine releasers like amphetamine
- **caffeine**: Both stimulants, risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and in extreme cases heart failure.
- **cannabis**: Stimulants increase anxiety levels and the risk of thought loops which can lead to negative experiences
- **diphenhydramine**: Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing for a higher dose of sedatives than normal. If cocaine wears off first, recreational dosages of DPH may overcome the individual and cause respiratory arrest. Both substances at recreational dosages strain the heart and may lead to further dangerous heart complications. When taken together, both substances can potentially be more reinforcing and have greater risk of methemoglobinemia when higher dosages of DPH are combined with cocaine.
- **dmt**: Stimulants increase anxiety levels and the risk of thought loops which can lead to negative experiences
- **ghb/gbl**: Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing for a higher dose of sedatives than normal. If the stimulant wears off first the opiate may overcome the individual and cause respiratory arrest. Likewise the ghb/gbl can wear off and leave a dangerous concentration of cocaine behind
- **ketamine**: No unexpected interactions, though likely to increase blood pressure but not an issue with sensible doses. Moving around on high doses of this combination may be ill advised due to risk of physical injury.
- **lsd**: Stimulants increase anxiety levels and the risk of thought loops which can lead to negative experiences
- **mdma**: Cocaine blocks some of the desirable effects of MDMA while increasing the risk of heart attack.
- **mescaline**: The focus and anxiety caused by stimulants is magnified by psychedelics and results in an increased risk of thought loops
- **mushrooms**: Stimulants increase anxiety levels and the risk of thought loops which can lead to negative experiences
- **mxe**: Stimulants taken with MXE can lead to hypermanic states much more easily, especially if sleep is avoided.

### ↓ Low Risk & Decrease
- **benzodiazepines**
- **lithium**: Lithium may inhibit some of the recreational effects of cocaine.

### ✓ Low Risk & Synergy
- **nitrous**

### ✓ Low Risk & No Synergy
- **ssris**: May reduce each others' effectiveness. Cocaine can reduce mental stability and therefore exacerbate conditions which SSRIs are used to treat.
