DPT Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
 
DPT is a synthetic tryptamine most similar in nature to DMT. It is weakly active orally, and active inhaled, insufflated, and IM. It is most often found in powder form. The charts below shows general dosages guidelines for DPT in milligrams (mg) with 4 different delivery routes...oral, insufflated (snorted), IM (intra-muscular), and inhaled (smoked/vaporized freebase oil). Even more than other tryptamines, DPT seems to have a wide range of effects at any particular dose, depending on the individual. This is reflected somewhat in the following ranges of dosages.
