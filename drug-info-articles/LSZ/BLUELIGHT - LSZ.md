Pubmed: 


Lysergamides of isomeric 2,4-dimethylazetidines map the binding orientation of the diethylamide moiety in the potent hallucinogenic agent N,N-diethyllysergamide (LSD).

Nichols DE, Frescas S, Marona-Lewicka D, Kurrasch-Orbaugh DM.


Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy and Pharmacal Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA. [[email protected]](https://www.bluelight.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4622342227302306362e27342b27253f6836333422332368232233)


Lysergic acid amides were prepared from (R,R)-(-)-, (S,S)-(+)-, and cis-2,4-dimethyl azetidine. The dimethylazetidine moiety is considered here to be a rigid analogue of diethylamine, and thus, the target compounds are all conformationally constrained analogues of the potent hallucinogenic agent, N,N-diethyllysergamide, LSD-25. Pharmacological evaluation showed that (S,S)-(+)-2,4-dimethylazetidine gave a lysergamide with the highest LSD-like behavioral activity in the rat two lever drug discrimination model that was slightly more potent than LSD itself. This same diastereomer also had the highest affinity and functional potency at the rat serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor, the presumed target for hallucinogenic agents, and a receptor affinity profile in a panel of screens that was most similar to that of LSD itself. Both cis- and the (R,R)-trans-dimethylazetidines gave lysergamides that were less potent in all relevant assays. The finding that the S,S-dimethylazetidine gave a lysergamide with pharmacology most similar to LSD indicates that the N,N-diethyl groups of LSD optimally bind when they are oriented in a conformation distinct from that observed in the solid state by X-ray crystallography. The incorporation of isomeric dialkylazetidines into other biologically active molecules may be a useful strategy to model the active conformations of dialkylamines and dialkylamides.

More potent than LSD, are you kidding me? :D


But as I understand it 5-HT2 agonism is not a guarantee for psychedelic effects though many substances apparently have it as their absolute basis. Could someone explain to me how that is possible and how probable or certain it is that this dimethylazetidide is centrally active??

Also am I safe to assume that this compound is even more difficult to make than regular LSD aside from the fact that it has a much much shorter history?

More potent than LSD, which as I recall is 25 to 35 ug for thresh hold effects.   Of course this source (wikipedia) says this was confirmed from tests on rats. 


If this was ever distributed for human consumption it would definately need to be cut with some kinda medium.  Could you imagine dealing with something this potent in pure form?


Again I say everything here is speculation as no human tests have been recorded.


I'm suprised with the lack of info on this chem, no one have any info?

I have a miniscule amount (roughly 200 mcg, I think) that I've been waiting to try for a while now...next spring perhaps. Anecdotally, it is not more potent than LSD in human assays, but it is subjectively different. I wish I knew the duration.  


One compound I would love to see become available is d-Lysergic acid morpholide (LSM). It's only 1/3 the potency of LSD, but it is similar in effects, and according to F&B, only lasts 6-8 hours. The compound would be legal, and would not involve LSD as an intermediate in the synthesis like ALD-52, AL-LAD, etc. 


Speaking of which, I have tried 6-allyl-6-nor-lysergic acid diethylamide tartrate (AL-LAD) at 200 mcg, and generally found it to be less inspiring than its parent molecule. Of course, set and setting are confounding factors that are impossible to really control. Also, I've had so much variation between my LSD trips that it's difficult to directly compare the two based on a single experience. The length was the most obvious difference (steady decline from 4-6 hours, mostly down by 8 hours, sleep easy at 10 hours with 0.25 mg alprazolam). I have never slept on LSD before 14 hours. Visually, it was quite spectacular, but it seemed to lack, to some extent, the sense of open space and the tactile quality that I often get with LSD. The other big difference is that I could not for the life of me get much in the way of an erection. Erotic was there, erection was not. Vasoconstriction? I don't recall cold extremities. I also felt somewhat scattered throughout the experience, despite being cognitively intact. I was able to converse without problem, but I never quite settled in and felt at home with the compound. Overall, it was fun and there were lots of laughs, but I still prefer LSD. That said, keep in mind that I'm comparing it to my best LSD trips (there have been a couple mediocre ones as well).

bump i want to see that as well. oh and dmt isnt really tripping to me in the classical sense, since its over so quickly. it doesnt put any strain on the body like other psychedelics. i cna barely do any of em anymore, since my whole body will be aching for days and i often feel like my soul has been sucked dry for the following two days or so. dmt never does that sorta thing, its actually extremely refreshing. feels as if it restores lots of body functions that have lost their balance, like my appetite feel a lot more healthy. less paroxysmal, clear tendency towards appetite for whole food, fruit and stuff vs candy and meat usually developes right after i come off. also, dmt almost puts me to sleep. if i spent a few weeks sleeping too little without noticing due to (hypo)mania i often slide right off into sleep before opening my eyes after a dmt trip. seen this happen to two other people as well. now most long lasting psychedelics would just have me wired for hours. dmt calms me better than anything else, just a natural fleeting sense of serenity, how we should probably all be feeling most of the time.


id try this one though or some other obscure acid analogue. just send all the obscure psychedelics my way and ill selflessly make myself available as your lab hamster! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I honestly have no idea what you're talking about. After many years of taking more psychedelics than I can keep track of, I have never ever felt like my "soul has been sucked dry" afterwards (except after one traumatic trip, but that was because I'd put myself through hell). On the contrary, many of my trips have left me with an afterglow, a sense of refreshment or rejuvenation. And I'm talking about non-DMT compounds.


Just because Rick Strassman made the wild claim that DMT is the "spirit molecule", doesn't mean that it is. And it's insane to think that it's the only psychedelic which can catalyze positive changes in you. Psychedelics are psychedelics. Any other fanciful notions we attach to them are just in our minds.

I used to get afterglows, but these days I'm just depressed after coming off. Might very well be due to the fact that the few instances in which I've still used long lasting psychedelics have either been unintentional doses (don't ask), or have happened towards the tail end of my episode of massive psychedelics abuse. I've had times when I tripped daily for weeks. Skeletal muscle hypertension got increasingly worse throughout those years and these days my body jsut feels violated as soon as effects begin to faded. I tried all kinds of stretching exercises, free-flowing yoga type stuff etc. Tried to work it out on a fucntional level somehow, but never had much success and like I said, it just got worse and worse up to a point where I can't take the stuff anymore without feeling brutally violated for days. Same goes for the psychological level, though I suspect this would be different if I was actually opening myself for change when I trip. I'd still love to have a full-blown "change-inducing" experience every now and then, but it's not gonna happen before I'm in that mindspace where the time is right for change. Otherwise, depreshing crushes me as soon as I come off. The afterglow used to last weeks at first, especially after my first acid trips, but also during my mushroom honeymoon phase it'd still be very desirable and lasting several days. Eventually this came to an end and only mescaline managed to bring back such an afterglow a couple of times.


Now your overall tone seems very offensive if I may say so. You are making assumptions that seem to be emit solely from your own mind's expectations.

A I've never read any books or papers by Strassman. Not a single one.

B I've never said other psychedelic cannot induce change. Though ultimately I don't think any drug induces real change in itself. DMT doesn't and neither does any other psychedelic. We are the ones that bring change into our lives.


That being said, DMT still holds a very special position amongst psychedelics. Not only to me in a sentimental fashion, which surely is the case, but also because of it's occurence in nature, and it's most remarkable pharmacologic profile (which really shouldn't be debated in this thread I guess, but the fact that all evidence seems to suggest it's the most important endogenous ligand for the sigma-1 receptor alone should be noteworthy). Oh right and a growing religious community utilizes it and has received permission in numerous nations to do so. I don't see why DMT should be looked at in the same way as other psychedelics IF that was what you were trying to suggest. Each substance deserves some attention in itself and should never be assumed to have an identitcal activity pharmacologic profile as another of course, but in the case of DMT... I don't even look at my occasional DMT use as problematic opposed to all other recreational/performance enhancing drugs I use or abuse. For me personally, it just takes a very special place, because it makes me feel refreshed and healthy on every level imaginable and other psychedelics don't. Simple as that, was all I was saying. I don't make that statement by choice, it's not forced, but it's describing exactly what I've experienced over and over and over again.

The notion of "reality" vs. "just in our minds" also just exists in our minds. I don't see how anything we perceive is not in itself wondrous and fanciful. I also don't see any reason to subtract from a fanciful phenomenom's subjectively perceived magic, aside from satisfying people like you who oviously don't enjoy other people believing in the little magic that life in modern western society leaves to them. I'd much rather have you calling me a whackjob instead of admitting that all the things I've experienced on said drug are meaningless. "just in my mind" yeah ofc they are, what isn't just in our minds?! Is it that important that only things are deemed valid, that can be perceived by other people in the same fashion as we perceive them, things that can be measured, reproduced and dissected? Or can we just accept that our experience might considerably differ from the next person's experience and there will sometimes not be a common grounds uniting all these experiences in scientific agreement. Why is everyone not accepting that considered "insane" (yes, I'm freely quoting you, here)? What's the gain in that?

i hadn't heard of it until just now.


[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_2,4-dimethylazetidide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_2,4-dimethylazetidide)


"It was developed as a rigid analogue of LSD with the diethylamide group constrained into an azetidine ring in order to map the binding site at the 5-HT2A receptor."


that's kind of what they ("a team at Purdue University led by David E. Nichols.") did with mda to make mdai "a non-neurotoxic and highly selective serotonin releasing agent (SSRA)"

cr00k I've had the same experience as you. At some point last year all afterglow was replaced with depression and physical malaise.


I learned my lesson and I limit the psychedelia to once every couple of months now, with an occasional exception here or there. Things are much much better now, but I still can't get back to the honeymoon phase. A lot of former favorites are hard on my body and my mind now.

@JBrandon

Yeah and it seems we aren't the only ones either. I cannot put my finger on who it was exactly, but I'm quite certain I've talked to at least one person before who experienced this type of qualitative degradation of his psychedelic experiences in terms of increased side effects after a long period of heavy use. Other people seem to be fine even after decades of heavy use. In my case, it might very well be due to me being bipolar, but there really is no telling what the exact reasons are as of now.

Exactly. But the very notion of everything we consider real to fit into this pattern of being repeatable and measurable is nothing more than a belief in itself. A belief dictates it's believers what is to be considered "knowledge" and what isn't, I guess you could say belief is located upstream relative to knowledge. Without belief, there is no knowledge. If you deny science is based on a set of beliefs, then you obviously don't know the first thing about scientific theory. I'm not naive to science, neither do I not believe in it (just trust me on that one). I merely allow myself to extend my reality past what science allows me to consider part of it by extending my set of beliefs. And that extension happens through whichever personal experience does not fit into said concept, but nonetheless has a very profound meaning to me personally. Call me delusional or crazy or insane, and while you're at it, call the other 5 billion religious people on earth crazy. And enjoy your very limited version of reality, that reality which is layed out before every living person (with an internet connection lol) like an open book. I just don't see the gain in that, except being able to high-five the next scientist you meet for being sane and well educated.

**The Small & Handy LSZ Thread**


So I see next to no information on here about these two substances, but I know for a fact that both are making the rounds in some corners of the internet. I have personally tried AL-LAD... and while I have not sent any to a lab to be tested, I have strong reasons to believe it is what it is being sold as. It is very similar to lsd in many aspects: it has very little perceivable flavor, (which rules out most options) it is active in small enough doses to fit on lsd-sized blotter, and it's effects are VERY similar to, but seemingly different from, lsd. I suppose it IS possible that it is just lsd being sold as al-lad both for novelty purposes and so it can more openly be sold online, but I don't believe this to be the case. The duration is shorter and the comedown is more gradual, and the actual high seems more euphoric and seems like it causes less mental obstruction. The vendor I received it from is including some LSZ with my next order and I am very interested in trying that to see if that is any different from the al-lad, which would mostly rule out the idea that it is all LSD. Does anyone else have opinions on this? Has anyone tried this stuff as well and have any feedback on the subject? This topic is now open for discussion.

I am slightly hesitant about these novel ergoloid research compounds being introduced lately. They have opened a floodgate of demand, which means there is a large incentive to offer such products for chemical vendors. And on occasion these chemical vendors are not the most honest individuals, so I wouldn't put it past some to misrepresent LSD as LSZ or AL-LAD. I just want to throw it out there, since the legality of these compounds is what makes them desirable, and it would be unfortunate for someone to face legal issues for purchasing something they thought was completely legal.

I hope this isn't occurring, and look forward to some independent analysis done by 3rd party labs to verify these compounds. Until then, I hope you all stay safe!

I have doubts that a vendor would willingly try to pass off an illegal substance as a legal one.. its just not worth it for them, nor does it really make any sense. If anything theyre the ones who are going to be in the legal clusterfuck

I was simply stating this so individuals on the consumer end may protect themselves. It actually makes plenty of sense for an individual to take a cheaper, illegal product and sell it as something that is more expensive and legal. This makes financial and business sense as not only are they generating greater profits, they are able to market their product to a broader customer base. We have seen this before many times with the regulation of compounds coming about, and those compounds promptly being distributed as their legal 'replacements'.


Edit: I've said it before and I'll say it again, vendors are already long known to misrepresent illegal products as legal products in an effort to gain/maintain sales. This has been seen when mephedrone, methylone, MDPV and numerous cannabinoids were made illegal yet still sold as other compounds that are legal, so arguments of vendors being unwilling to assume such risk are not viable. Yes the market for LSD is larger than that of novel ergoloids, but that does not mean they are equally profitable. Lastly, this is not an issue of being disappointed by the subjective effects one experiences from the product they receive, this is an issue of assuming huge legal consequences unknowingly by an unscrupulous vendor.

The market for real LSD is way bigger than the market for some rare ergoloids sold to online drug enthusiasts. Deception may occur, but its more likely with much lower value substances like 25i, it doesn't make much sense to use LSD.

^ Exactly.


The risk factor is what does not make any sense at all. For me, personally, buying these 'rare' compounds online is magnitudes of order cheaper than acquiring LSD or shrooms or mdma and so on and so forth in real life. The differences are actually absurd.. why spend $10 on a tab of LSD when I can spend a couple *cents* on a hit of 25i, and on the flipside, why not sell something like that as one of these rare ergoloids that no one really knows anything about. No one with a real business sense in this grey market dealing in already suspicious compounds would try to pass off a truly illegal one as a legal one. Not only would users notice, but law enforcement certainly would. I think its a bit naive to think that law enforcement agencies around the world arent already keeping tabs on such vendors.. if we can find them so can they. The end consumer should always be aware of dupes and scams, but imo I think the last thing anyone need worry about is actually getting LSD instead of something like LSZ or AL-LAD.. and yeah you may be a bit upset to find out you didnt get to try a rare compound, but how upset would you really be? you still got acid. And that begs the question, how do you even tell the difference at all if the compounds are supposedly so similar, no tests exist and both come on a blotter? ignorance is bliss.

I too am skeptical of these ergoloid analogues that have been appearing lately. If I'm not mistaken, to produce either lsz or al-lad, one would need to produce LSD first (someone correct me if I'm wrong, maybe there's a way around it), but either way these vendors would need to be getting there hands on some very highly controlled precursors. 


I don't completely doubt that they are being produced (hell, I would love to try them both) but it just seems a little fishy to me.

Not necessarily I think. There seems to be a way around it if the AL part of AL-LAD is put on there at a very early stage. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) Depending on the type of reactions along the way it may be necessary to use a protective group because allyl is somewhat reactive in certain situations. That is about as far as I'm willing to go regarding synth discussion.


But you are absolutely right IMO: if a lab gets caught with the precursors I don't know if they would be able to justify themselves saying that they are busy doing a custom non LSD synth.


It's probably not the vendors themselves that would be doing that, I don't think. If they are sourcing it clandestinely or making it themselves they would obviously not be able to justify their general practices.


I still haven't checked if I would be able to get a qualitative analysis and I haven't even bought AL-LAD yet and I might be too late now.

Legitimate AL-LAD is most definitely available at this moment, and the very same lab (well, the only genuine one I know of) is currently at work producing LSZ. Both of these compounds can be produced without synthesizing LSD itself at any point, though from what I understand this is actually not an issue for the lab in question.


I do agree, however, that there are a large number of individuals who are only taking advantage of the recent availability and resulting demand for novel lysergamides, and that one should exercise caution when dealing with potential sellers of these ergoloids in particular. I don't want to break rules with supply talk but there is very good reason to be extremely wary of anyone claiming to offer these compounds as research chemicals.

Someone apporoached me with "LSZ" powder, and at first I didn't even believe them, but then they also offered AL-LAD blots for sale, standard strength, and I was just like "Damn even if one or the other turns up fake it would still be terribly interesting to try atleast one!", will most likely purchase a bit of both, allergy test, then do a real amount/re[prt back!

if I were to aquire any of these LSD analogs, I would definitely get some Ehrlich reagent to check if it actually is an indole compound.

I've nipped out some uninformative posts and some vendor discussion. Please remember our rules when talking in here.


It seems that real LSZ is indeed about to hit the market so please try to stay on topic as this thread is likely to become a useful resource.

They are methyls like normal non-wedge lines, only they show 3 dimensionally which way they are pointing, namely at an angle towards you or away from you. It is not flat, such connections are tetrahedric. 
**NSFW**: 


![Tetrahedric_lattice_height.svg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fa%2Faa%2FTetrahedric_lattice_height.svg&hash=5453174f6c0447d1e73f78f19e6fee70)


Often they don't show 3-dimensionality because there is a mix available of isomers, but here the azetidine site has two stereocenters that matter a lot considering the structure of the "antlers" at that position (the azetidine ring is like the two ethyls from LSD bound together, or constrained as it is called) decide how well the molecule binds.


There is an optimal way for those methyl "sticks" to point, and that particular isomer is called (*S,S*)-(+) as mentioned before in this thread. It is what I meant with "the more active enantiomere", and it is the entire purpose of why this compound was designed.

I'm not familiar with that scam but you're right, people should be cautious, there's nothing much to go on in the way of proof so far, no. So perhaps we should say there is the prospect of this being on the UK RC scene, subject to confirmation.

From an HR perspective one should exercise caution either way. AFAICT there is no in-vivo data for this compound if it is real, not even TIKHAL, and if it's not what it's supposed to be then caution also.

Don't forget we don't really allow availability or vendor discussion in PD guys.


I'm going to step in here and say that the LSZ is exactly as legit as the AL-LAD currently circulating but ask that you confine cryptic discussions about vendors to more suitable platforms such as [www.safeorscam.com](http://www.safeorscam.com).


No doubt there will be resellers so it's hard to tell who's talking about who here and that could lead dangerous misinformation where someone believes a fraudster to be legitimate.

don't know if someone else answered this but even with good agonism and binding if the compound affects other proteins such as phospholipases, the response from 5-ht binding cannot result in a psychedelic effect if the downstream event after 5-ht binding suchas phospholipase activity is hindered in some way by the drug or by something else going on when that drug is added

Thanks, I know - I learned a lot since that post which is from a while back. 


Theoretically:


> Pharmacological evaluation showed that (S,S)-(+)-2,4-dimethylazetidine gave a lysergamide with the highest LSD-like behavioral activity in the rat two lever drug discrimination model that was slightly more potent than LSD itself. This same diastereomer also had the highest affinity and functional potency at the rat serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, the presumed target for hallucinogenic agents, and a receptor affinity profile in a panel of screens that was most similar to that of LSD itself

[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm020153s](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm020153s)


However I was told that in practice (regarding use in humans) this (S,S)-(+)-2,4-dimethylazetidide is slightly less potent than LSD although it causes a more severe or pronounced body load. The inconsistency with results in rats may come from difference in downstream signal transduction effects between humans and rats or because "the body load the rats got" affected their reaction in the tests despite the actual "psychedelic" effects. I have no idea how these things are interpreted and if other psychedelics with pronounced body loads tested in rats also result in such discrepancies.

Very interesting, Solipsis. This might very well be the same reason that Nichols reports AL-LAD to be 10% more potent than LSD, when it actually turns out the be not as strong as old Lucy.

I guess this should be American pronounced huh? L S Zee?


If this turns out to have a greater bodyload than LSD I can't see myself using it. If on the other hand it turns out to be weight for weight, stronger than LSD, I can see the hardheads turning to it after Al-Lad fails to impact them hard enough.

I somehow have a feeling that LSD will never be beat in the *combination* of potency, lack of side effects/bodyload, liniency in dose/response, spiritual power etc.


There's something totally magical about how it came into existence, it really is the first ever synthetic psychedelic (research) chemical, and it still is number one imo.

I tried to christian 2c-e & MDMA Happy Flipping, but it turns out this combo is called Sparkle Flipping, a very apt term. So I coin Happy Flipping for the Al-Lad/MDMA combo. I planned to attempt to pioneer this awsome sounding combo but I'm off stims for the forseeable future, & besides, I wouldn't be the first anyway, a short report of this combo, a back-to-back job, appears in TIHKAL.

Fellow (suspected) Bluelighter posted up a trip report:


[http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=100740](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=100740)


And LC/MS Data for the LSZ we're all talking about ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


[http://imgur.com/VzUrhka,p4kVMvS,lJ0bqkJ#0](http://imgur.com/VzUrhka,p4kVMvS,lJ0bqkJ#0)


I cannot find any other LC/MS data on LSZ to compare to, I also noticed the dates are from late May.  


Hopefully I may partake in this legendary experience.  Reviews are checking out well.  


These LSD analogues are rather interesting, I've been interested by the lysergamides for a few months now.  I truly wasn't expecting to see this beauty come around any time soon.  ALD-52 was the last good analogue I've seen, and it has been a little while.

Basically it's a lot like LSD but has a slightly increased nauseating effect and lower potency and duration.

Yeah I rarely get it and when I do it's mild. Really I'm scraping the barrel for differences because it was rather similar except for duration.

Seems like it was more discomfort than nausea, right? Great report man! 


I have alot of trouble with come-ups, especially on phens, but I hardly ever have a problem eating whilst tripping, so I always get a gippy tum & I always eat & that always eases the problem. Simples!

Only if by that you mean that it was mild. It would definitely have been called nausea if it was stronger. It wasn't an ache or pain but... well, nausea ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

hmmmm okay... shame though, I must admit amongst the gamut of side effects I suffered during my LSD days, nausea wasn't often one of them. It was normally general discomfort, muscular pain, leg cramp, stomach pain, shoulder pain, neck tension etc etc


For me, nausea predominates the side effects of phens, & light body load seems common for me with trypts. Neither seem partiularly apparent with these new Lysergides. I have been in a pretty good frame of mind recently so perhaps that has played a part in my side-effects free recent trips on LSz & Al-lad.


Have you tried both Trans? Do you agree that, tab for tab, LSz appears to bring a slower, deeper, longer journey than Al-Lad?

Some of the headaches I used to get on LSD were terrible - like your head was splitting in two. Never had that with the giggle-ergloids like Al-lad so far.

both Al-lad and LSZ carry a similar body load to lsd for me.  It wasn't noticeable at 150mcg but bodyload increased at 300mcg al-lad and 225mcg lsz. Still feeling rough 48 hours after taking the 225mcg lsz... felt nauseous, exhausted and suffered terrible headache all day today, two days after ingesting.  Something to bear in mind...:/

Are you saying Al-Lad is less troublesome then LSZ? 

I like the idea of a shorter LSD like experience.. 

if so, this Should go over well at concerts, raves or gathering imho etc....

I trust you haven't picked up something purported to be Al or Lsz that isn't...


How's your headspace Mona, nothing troubling you, no obvious psychological reason for physical manifestation? If not I guess you are simply sensitive to these, maybe keep the doses at 150ug. How do these side effects compare to any others you might have experienced with other psychedelic drugs?

This is possible, but I think it's much more likely that it feels "toxic" (bad) to him.  Mushrooms get you high by poisoning you according to the average person, and it's well known they are not toxic in the least.

Hmm. I tried 450 micrograms of this wonderful, weird substance and wrote a lengthy detailed attempt at making sense of its effects. The forum crapped out as i was posting it though so it's gone. Auto-save had not saved it. :/


But i'm not too concerned because the prevailing theme of the post was the sheer ineffability of the substance. Extremely difficult, or impossible to explain with words. It was deep to the point that words were gibberish in my mind and even the term "spiritual" lost all meaning. Deep in a very literal sense. Maybe not spiritually deep on this first attempt but... It felt like the mind was unshackled and free from subjective opinion. In fact, the internal "voice" that would normally describe the things you observe to yourself was simply not there. 


Yet at the same time it had a very mild body load, and i was able to perform normal (and non-normal) things just fine, while at a similar dose of acid i would usually be confined to the couch. Not so this time and my activities ranged from playing guitar and lying on the floor because i felt like it. In a very, very weird way it felt like the first trip i've ever had: Not in a way that it mirrored a previous occasion but rather that all the previous occassions were moot and that it was the *new* first trip.


This is going to sound harsh to those who hold the opinion that only LSD could be LSD-like but... It felt like LSD with all the druggy effects taken out. And while LSD for me is often a tool to gain greater concentration upon important philosophical questions, things i would think sober as well... Not so here. It felt like a seed was implanted in my mind and grew to encompass it whole. It was a weird mix of being able to perfectly function, and at the same time hold the dual state of being in DMT land or something. Without hindrance from either upon each other. 


I tried to look for negatives, but there really weren't any... I did sweat a lot but it didn't bother me at the time. It was the cleanest, least drug-like substance i've ever tried. Even compared to caffeine. And to give some perspective: I have a lot of experience of LSD itself and the last time was merely a week ago at around 700 micrograms. This thing doesn't strictly *beat* LSD... But it is its own "LSD" in a way. I don't like making predictions about the future because of too many variables: But this thing will be big. Just wait and see.


/E: Sorry about the lack of detail. That would be contrary to the experience itself when there weren't any specific details: It felt weird and all-encompassing. I'll need to make further tests with smaller doses, and maybe with other people to give a point of reference.

Very interesting @Darkstorn. I'm really looking forward to try this one. How long did your trip last approximately? Have you taken 450mcg's at once or with staggered dosing?

I'd say it doesn't last quite as long as LSD; But the come up is longer and smoother, and the miniscule body load makes gauging the coming down even more difficult. 


And i did them all at once; I wouldn't recommend this simply because it doesn't give you any idea how well just one blotter would work. Plus there's a chance it's dangerous even if unlikely; It at least *should* be equally safe compared to LSD.

Because AL-LAD was available 'publicly' first. Up until extremely recently the only way to get LSZ was within a private closed circle. not in the circle, no lsz for you.

Did anyone get a bit of bodyload on LSZ, relative to LSD or AL-LAD? I tried it once at 150mcg, and have mixed feelings about the experience. I found the effects to be rather subdued, compared to LSD or AL-LAD, although tolerance probably played a part in that.


What I definitely did not like, though, was the muscle stiffness, and tingling in extremities, as well as a general sense of feeling "off", physically. I have probably experienced worse on some of my LSD trips, but it was enough to make me glad that I did not take more that day.


I would like to dose it higher, but the physical discomfort I experienced makes me think twice about that.

I did 150mcg and found it be a bit weak for my taste. 

It took a long time to start, I could feel something pretty quick but it didn't stop increasing until 2h45min to 3 hour mark. It came slowly and then peaked pretty fast and slowly started to fade, but it was all slow and bit hard to keep track of.

I often felt that everything was slow and I was impatient which might have been because I was somewhere in the middle of full blow tripping and just being weird. The only body load was a bit of stale neck that might have been anything to sweating a lot.


It was a bit weird because I was very clear headed and at the same time tripping. 

I think it has potential for higher doses and might be fun.


But this was only one experince and who knows.


EDIT

I was tripping but it just wasn't enough for me and that might be why I felt impatient. When you know that you are almost there but it just won't get you all the way.

If someone took 'liquid acid' on sunday and then took 150ug of this on the following saturday while only using mdma on the friday immediatly before LSZ; should they still trip a little?

I haven't the chance to try it but I gave some tabs to some friends and while the 2 guys kind of tripped, it was minimal and the girls didn't at all.

MDMA itself will cause some tolerance to psychedelics, and LSD might still have some lingering tolerance after 6 days too. Add the fact that 150ug is not a super strong dose and I think this could explain your lack of results.

That's interestingly exactly the same as i felt when i tried 150mcg's of AL-LAD. I think those two, LSZ and AL-LAD, need higher dosage, otherwise you're caught in this horrible 'in-between'-realm, which is absolutely disgusting ![:X](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/mad.gif)

Could be right. All I got from 150 mcg AL-LAD was tremors and very little in the way of visuals, none worth mentioning really. I would almost think it was an NBOME blotter that absorbed through my mouth when I was chewing on the blotter for a while but I didn't get nauseous like on NBOMEs. Two or Three blotters might have given a better visuals to tremors ratio.

This one is next on my list, wonder how it compares to AL-LAD. Will write a small comparison afterwards (wont be that soon... tolerance + delivery time ... )


And next maybe even AL-LAD and LSZ.

i dont think so really... i think this in between is precisely an effect of the substance (al lad). a kind of disassociation between your conciousness and tripping brain. i was obviously tripping with full on visuals but at the same time oberving myself trip. weird but interesting at the same time

Not sure if this has been posted yet

At our request, DDL tried a couple of techniques on the recent blotter we've gotten to try to use the field reagent tests with the blotter. The results were inconclusive and it's not obvious how well the reagent tests can work with either paper blotter or with doses probably under half a milligram.

I never liked taking LSD after MDMA... I noticed I did not trip very well. Even if I waited a day or two, I always thought it was because the MDMA used up my serotonin.

I don't know why this has so much less attention than AL-LAD, I've tried both and I found LSZ to be stronger and longer-lasting with just as minimal side effects, if not less.

There were a couple reports on Erowid that said it gave them body load, so that probably put some people off and they tried the AL-LAD instead. From what I've read LSZ should be considerably better than AL-LAD with fewer side effects and more antianxiety effects. I actually didn't like AL-LAD at all. Caused a lot of tremors and general agitation where I never felt comfortable and couldn't sit still or concentrate on anything. From the 5-HT receptor affinities I've seen, LSZ should be better than LSD itself due to much higher 5-HT1a agonism, which is anxiolytic. It's 5-HT2a agonism is considerably weaker than LSD so it should have less adrenergic type side effects. It's 5-HT2c agonism is only slightly less than LSD and that one has been linked to LSD's psychedelic effects, since lisuride is very similar structurally to LSD and has similar 5-HT2a agonism but no 5-HT2c agonism and has no psychedelic effects. So from the figures I've seen LSZ should be a much improved version of LSD.

Three trips so far on verified LSZ. It's been absolutely suburb every time. It took a little exploration to really be sure of this, but I am now convinced that when compared to LSD, the Z is the superior drug in nearly every way. Trip report for the last experience (525ug + 4-HO-MET at T+4h) currently in progress. I'll finish it up and post it when I have a little more time later this week. I will note that the only negative effect I have noticed so far is that it has left me feeling a little drained following the higher-dose experiments. Not "strung out" like some psychedelics feel on the come-down; just more tired than usual the following day.

those after effects, which I have not noticed on either of these two, yet, pale in comparison to the truly miserable, dreadful hangovers I've suffered from LSD in the past.


I feel both of these new compounds outstrip LSD in almost all area's! Cool huh?

That's exactly what I thought, LSZ is probably the best psych ever created. Mine is slow arriving but I tracked it and it's in-country and cleared Customs, just has to be delivered locally. From the 5-HT affinities it should be near perfect. LSD did induce considerable anxiety in me and gave me tremors. Bad trips were rather frequent. LSZ should reduce both of those bad points. Leave it to David Nichols to create the world's most perfect psychedelic. Hoffman didn't even think of the rigid analogue. What Hoffman started Nichols completed. It won't get anywhere near the publicity that LSD did though. I'm really looking forward to this one. I just hope it doesn't turn out to be pretty much the same as AL-LAD, which is worse than LSD in my book. I haven't seen the affinities on that one yet but I think it must have higher 5-HT2a and similar or lower 5-HT1a than LSD.

I felt it slower coming, deeper & longer than Al-Lad. In some cases this opinion is backed by others. I basically thought Al was the light, social one, & LSz a bit deeper & more introspective. Like the difference between 4-ho-dmt & 4-ho-met. Subtle differences in my limited experience.


Either way, it was a fine single run on LSz for me, compared to almost, probably all of my LSD experiences, which were admittedly, nearly 20 years ago.

My order of 10 came. Not going to try it right away though. I want to wait for my JWH-250 order to come in so I'll have something to take the edge off and put me to sleep afterwards. 


This stuff is great for international shipping, because there's nothing bulky in the envelope and even if they scan it with something there's not even a staple in it so it just looks like a letter. Canada Customs don't even open it. I don't know about other countries, probably the same. I ordered 100 more even before I try it because I know it's either going to run out or get banned pretty soon. Even if it turns out not to be perfect there's nothing else worth getting for psychs anyway. LSZ is the best thing out there, other than perhaps LSD itself, so it's either that or nothing for me, even if there are some tremors. I'll just stick to one blot and it should be tolerable. I figure 100 will last me a good 5-10 years because I probably won't use it more than once a month. Psychs are too draining for frequent use anyway in my opinion.

I doubt the price will drop much anyway, since lysergic acid is rather costly and only certain licensed labs can work with it.

Okay - YES! From just the one whirl around with LSz, that is exactly my impression. Not the other way round...

Okay, so here's the deal with LSZ. Took one blot. No tremors whatsoever, in fact it's the only psych I ever used that didn't cause tremors, including LSD itself. The only bodyload was a gnawing feeling in my belly for the first 3-4 hours, like being hungry all the time. Nothing serious but enough to put an underlying uncomfortable tinge on the first few hours. Next time I'll probably try some ginger-based Gravol capsules sold for car sickness. I know the antihistamine type will do nothing but I haven't tried the ginger ones yet.


So aside from the belly gnawing side effect it was a decent compound. Rather weak at one hit but visuals were trying to come through, just not really forming up completely. I could tell that with 1.5-2 hits it would be pretty solid. As for euphoria, I didn't really notice much. The second phase, after the belly gnawing subsided, was better. Still had slight visuals and a generally up mood. Nowhere near the agitation of AL-LAD, just a little bit of having to flip through channels a lot. Pretty smooth trip all told. I did boost it numerous times with cannabinoids which seemed helpful in spicing things up some. There was a little insomnia but it only lasted until about 10 hours after onset, which was pretty quick, like 45 min-1 hour after taking.


Conclusion; pretty good really, much preferable to AL-LAD for me due to no tremors or high agitation. As I said, a little weak at 1 hit but it certainly looks promising. I would choose it over any other psych out there, even LSD because I really can't stand tremors and LSD always gave me tremors though not as bad as AL-LAD. It was also pretty sexy feeling in the second phase, though it may have been the cannabinoids helping that out. Nutsack was not contracted as with LSD, so that's always a plus. I also wasn't at all hyperthermic or vasoconstricted. Definitely beats AL-LAD and LSD on all bodyload effects because there's really none at all aside from the belly gnawing, which was the same as I always got from LSD and which I call "acid indigestion".

Wow, these reports are making this look amazing! All of the other reports I came across didn't make it look very good. I was surprised to read all of these excellent reviews towards the end. I'm assuming a good dose would be 75-150 ug's, IDK maybe more. Most of the blotters I've heard about were 75 ug's each. 


I wonder how tolerance is for this and AL-LAD. I know regular LSD has never given me serious tolerance issues. (As in i could trip hard two days in a row without issues)

Recently tested this again, similar circumstances to last time but blotters were swallowed immediately instead of gummed for an hour. Effects *may* have been stronger but they definitely did come on faster! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

So whats the deal.. How similar is the LSZ available right now to N. Sands product from a few decades ago? How similar are the precursor and synth?

Pretty much asking if I got Nicholas's LSZ Years back how similar would it be to a product available currently in the UK?

Identical? 


I guess the only differences possible are precursor and purity's 


Lets start a dirty LSZ FAQ

JK Love you all

Well if all goes to plan and I'll be trying it for the first time today. Planning on doing just one blotter, but I planned on doing just one my first time with AL-LAD, ended up eating all three, lol.


@Si Ingwe: haven't tried LSZ so far, but with AL-LAD it's definitely faster if you just chew and swallow.

The case appears the same for each compound then. Coincidence?


Good luck on your Liz trip, I still havent got round do doing a whole tab of LSz in one go. After reading about the differing ROA I decided first to replicate the original research using a different method of application & I felt it would queer the pitch if I didn't use the same dosage regime.


My final LSz dose was a bit too late on Sunday, approx 6pm & I unsurprisingly found myself unable to sleep at midnight. Dozed off about 1am & awoke at 6 feeling a bit shite! Once up & off to work though, I felt great, definitely more of an afterglow than a hangover! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Better absorption from the stomach? Maybe due to the acidic environment?

is there any clue whether or not this is the S,S isomer or ?


that GC/MS, unless it was derivatized, is concerning:

1. it shows only a ~1 minute window of a 15 minute wide trace.

2. the compound doesn't matched published MS data for LSZ ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

3. it shows several other compounds whose MS are not shown

Yeah I was told that as well. I would have expected better potency from the theoretical structural superiority, but it can still very well be true.

Interesting, I'd not really bothered to scrutinise the data from this after the success that was AL-LAD. It is indeed puported to be enantiomerically pure.

I know people that say that LSA is more potent that LSD as well. I've never found anything that's come close to as strong as a strong acid trip. With the exception of DMT and maybe some 2c family drugs. But I'd still be real interested in trying it/hearing about someones experience that is very knowledgeable in this area, since I've never actually tried LSZ. I'll watch for the report.

Anyway, because I know people don't read far back - yesterday was my first time with LSZ, ate 1 blotter and I must say I was very impressed.


If AL-LAD is the extroverted visual brother, LSZ is the introverted one.


The come up abut as fast as AL-LAD (30 min for me, I just chew and swallow), but where with AL-LAD you start getting more and more visuals, the come up from LSZ is almost 100% mental. What other have said is true, it is very introspective, allows you do think and talk about your problems, perhaps find solutions, ... None of it is forced, the drug just helps you if you wish. The sensory effects were minimal, just a little bit at the peak. Physically it's totally benign (AL-LAD is also for me), no nausea, no cramping, no jaw clenching, .... It's also not stimmy at all, if anyone remembers, yesterday I was complaining about being sleepy. Also, like AL-LAD, there were never hints of anxiety. Even while on I feel I could have gone asleep if I wanted to, think I actually did come close a few times*


(this is for lower doses 1-2 tabs):

Anyway if you're looking to have some fun, do something with friends, stuff like that go for AL-LAD, if you're looking to explore your self LSZ is the one.


Things to still explore: higher doses of LSZ and a combo of LSZ and AL-LAD


*I actually fell asleep on a combo of apb 5 and 6 (75mg of both I think) and on mapb5 alone. I also have insomnia sober a lot of the  time.

I tried a 150 ug blotter of this on sunday night. I think i had ate too much prior to taking only about an hour before ingesting. This was at exactly ten to eight pm and didnt actually feel anything till after midnight. There was some faint cev patterning but  next to nothing with eyes open. It did keep me awake till the dawn though. There was something there but as i was smoking a lot of noids they may have masked any psychedelic effects. maybe i just got a bad one but i still have 2 left so will start earlier in the day next time and if effects are similar i will be able to drop a second one so heres hoping.

I'd go for one & a half straight off, if you're experienced with psychedelics... I had this yesterday & updated my report on my initial LSz test - [http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/683345-quot-er-giggly-ergoloids-quot-LSz-2-x-75ug-experienced](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/683345-quot-er-giggly-ergoloids-quot-LSz-2-x-75ug-experienced)


I am pretty light-weight, with low tolerance but lots of experience tripping, if I can handle 225ug LSz on my own, any other experienced traveller will also ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I always thought, & I'd hate to criticise this vendor after they've shown so much forsight sourcing these remarkable compounds, that the Al-Lad should have been 200ug. I'd now say the same for the LSz.

Personally I think 100ug would have been ideal. One can easily take two but for those who might not want the full intensity first time, it's ever so slightly more hassle to halve a tab.

I suspect it would be simply a case of finding your idea dosage.


Although the trips on 4-subs are clearly, subjectively different to these lysergide, both LSz & Al-Lad do have something in common with them. Both LSz & Al-Lad are about as gentle on the system as 4-subs but last a fair bit longer, especially LSz which produced a 12 hour trip at 225ug...

Yup, 2 was excessive for me. And the visuals weren't even boosted much, just the side effects. I got a lot more visuals from the AL-LAD actually, just that the tremors were rather severe and lasted the whole duration. LSZ is not as good as I thought it would be based on its 5-HT receptor affinities. The first few hours are quite unpleasant really and even after that part subsides it isn't anything particularly great. I'll use the 100 hits I bought, but only because at one hit there isn't noticeable tremors and only light nausea. I would prefer AL-LAD based on the visuals and lack of nausea but the tremors have turned me off from it. I may be able to prevent the nausea somehow, ginger didn't work but maybe diphenhydramine would work, haven't tried that yet.

How long does tolerance from this last I had one 150ug blotter of LSZ of the 3rd of September and 3 AL-LAD blotters just an hour 10 min ago. Still feeling nothing really and usually AL-LAD gives me first alerts in 30 min or sooner and then rises quite fast.

Doesn't look like to be just a delay, 2h and still basically nothing. If the 10 day think is true the next time I can try is around 18th.

Folk with higher tolerance & those who dig bigger doses might have to wait even longer. But try 10 days & see how it goes. Make notes coz this information will be useful ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

But that's just it my last (and only) dose of lsz was just 1 150ug blotter (now wishing I hat eaten more if the tolerance lasts this long). Not a large dose or anything. And as for tolerances go, for other substances my tolerances always dropped in the normal few days to a week. Well, I'll give it some time and try again. Perhaps next try will consist of lsz instead of al-lad..

The 300µg dose was in no way too much to handle, it was possibly just a wee bit too much in terms of how 'magically' or 'good' it could've been. I think around ~250 - 275µg could have been sufficient. Too much rarely means more fun.


And i just don't know if 'work' is an adequate description of being that massively engaged in wallowing oneself in exuberant enjoyment and utter bliss - ...but well, regarding the sheer intensity of the experience, ahm yes, i think it really is! 


Btw i kept the blotters in my mouth, for about ~25mins before swallowed 'em. I am 100% positive that i noticed the first changes within the first fifteen minutes. Mentioning this i should add that i had some MXE before dosing the LSZ, i'd say ~10mgs.


Thanks God i was cautious as i usually am and did not take the 450µg as planned after my friend meant 300 were rather disappointing ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)8(

That may be what saved you from getting nausea and other unpleasant effects, the MXE. Once I took some PCP and then later I took some mushrooms and I didn't even get nauseous and it was a really enjoyable trip while normally shrooms make me feel like crap. MXE is related to PCP so maybe it did the same thing with the LSZ as PCP did with sbrooms for me.

tried this last night. 

very impressed... no side effects whatsoever for me, and i had not taken anything (but for a soft drink) for a couple of hours prior. no drugs for the past weeks.


here is my report: [http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/...-try-midnight-delight?p=11825711#post11825711](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/690675-LSZ-%281-1-2-blotters-150-ug%29-first-try-midnight-delight?p=11825711#post11825711)


while allad is way more visual, this is more easygoing and perhaps closer in mood to a low dose lsd.

Have you had ANY pleasant psychedelic experiences lately? You may just not react well to ANY psychedelics nowadays...IIRC you're middle aged correct?


either way I don't really understand why you keep taking al-lad and lsz, probably more often than anyone whos fully ENJOYED their time on it...I know I wouldnt have the will to completely ruin multiple days a month with unpleasant bodyload and subpar GOOD effexts.

I keep hoping I can find something that will cut the nausea so I keep taking the LSZ to find out. It's actually only the 3rd time now that I tried it. Ginger antinausea tablets did nothing to prevent the nausea, at least not at first. After I puked I felt better but I don't know if that was the ginger or just because the puking was over. 


So this time I tried peppermint oil, 4-5 drops, hard to tell exactly how many drops came out, but at least 4. Didn't help, just made me have peppermint burps. Then I had to take 50 mg diphenhydramine. That actually seems to have helped a lot but still didn't totally get rid of the bad feeling. At least the drowsiness of it seems to have taken the edge off the LSZ agitation. So 4.5 hours after admin of one hit LSZ and 90 minutes after admin of diphenhydramine I'm not feeling too bad really.

I always seem to have negative body effects including that tingly electric not good feeling, along with nausea and stomach cramps when I can't let go and accept the situation. When I'm on edge my body feels like shit. When I take deep breaths and tell myself all is well, this is where I need to be, or deal with whatever mental/emotional trouble I'm having, it goes away.


When these feelings arise, take a deep look into your mind and just feel. Don't think, just feel. A thought might just pop up into your head that next thing you know you realize is the reason your body is feeling this way. Then you can deal with it and move on.


If you're positive it isn't something you're deeply unhappy or upset with that you're covering, which is trying to come out, then I don't know what to say.

Nah, the nausea is a direct effect of the LSZ. It happens every time. This time the nausea ceased completely about 90 minutes after taking 50 mg diphenhydramine, but that was about 3 hrs into the trip which is usually when the nausea drops off anyway. Next time I'll take it right at the start and see if it prevents the nausea even beginning. 


The LSZ effects are nice after the nausea phase though. No tremors, which is certainly good. AL-LAD made me feel like crap the whole 8 hrs, at least with two hits. With LSZ it looks like diphenhydramine is a necessary accompaniment. I got no bad effects from the diphenydramine, which I bought as a "sleeping aid" but which is also used for nausea in car sickness. Maybe LSZ hits the same part of the brain that causes motion sickness.

Hard to say really. I got a lot more visuals and general weirdness from 2 hits of AL-LAD than from two of LSZ, but I did upchuck my stomach contents about 90 minutes or so in so I may have lost some of the dose. I think they're about the same potency, or so close it's not significant.

But they ALL give me nausea and I have to use one of them because otherwise life is too boring. I think LSZ may be amenable to treatment with diphenhydramine. LSZ seems to be much like Mescaline, making you feel sick for the first few hours and then you're fine after that.

I just ordered 3 of the 150ug blotters (smallest increment I could order... kind of annoying, wish I could have gotten 4.) I plan on taking 2 to start based on reports from this thread. I'm a little peeved as I didn't read the AL-LAD thread before making the purchase, it sounds like AL-LAD is more visual and I do like that aspect of tripping... although if LSZ is more sonically-pleasing then I've made the correct choice.

Can you go into more detail about certain aspects of the trip? For instance, how were the visuals and music enhancement? I gather there was LSD-like euphoria from your description but I'm wondering about how this drug would be to hang out alone and jam out to some tunes.

So it's been asked before but never answered, did anyone try lizzie with al yet. I only tried lsz at 150mg and experience was very un visual , high vascular load , neck etc but not so bad it spoilt the moment. Ended up cleaning most the house , felt somewhat mdma like.

After reading all these treads about AL-LAD & LSZ;

 It seems that mixing Al-Lad and LSZ together would give you the LSD effects most are familiar with..

 patiently waiting for that report to come out.

LSZ is orally active so it is not 25C-NBOMe.


I would be wary of starting with two tabs (300ug) unless you're down for a rather powerful experience.

250ug of AL-LAD, whose potency is comparable, was way more intense than I wanted for the festival setting I was in.

i kind of doubt that mixing lsz with allad would "add up" to an lsd experience. it is very rare that chemicas interact in such a simple fashion. 

i would still advise anyone trying to combine them to start with lowered dosages of both.


wonder how long it would last though. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

am I the only one who found AL-LAD extremely close to acid by itself? don't know why you would need to add anything to it to make it more lsd-like.

I retract my previous statements - people have sent me more chromatograms that do indeed look like LSZ. So maybe there are ballsy RC salespeople, another Pickard maybe, somewhere out there....

Hell yeah, thanks for the heads up Sekio.


I can't fucking wait for my LSZ to get here. I'm gonna have to hit up the AL-LAD soon too before it's gone.

so how sure can we be that this claim is true? is there any way to find out by analyzing the given material?

Some people are claiming there is bad nausea, while others are claiming there is none whatsoever. I know everyone's different but that just doesn't make much sense to me. I honestly think some of this may have been some type of Phen. As far as being orally active goes, most people keep blotters in their mouth for 20 minutes or more so I wouldn't be surprised if it was just 25C, it can produce bad nausea. I think there is real LSZ going around, (hence the good nausea free reports) but I also strongly believe that some of these LSZ printed bloters have been 100% bunk. Just my 2 cents

The stuff I got was real LSZ, no doubt about that. It's tasteless, orally active and lasts 8-10 hours. No noticeable stimulation, so it's not a DOC type psychedelic amphetamine. It apparently just effects people differently, causing nausea in some and none in others. People who bought from the same vendor as me didn't get nausea. I'm actually one of the few who have reported nausea. I get nausea from all psychs really, sometimes even LSD. I'm also the only one who reported tremors from AL-LAD, again from the same vendor as others used who had no tremors.

No, that report was fairly isolated and it's to be expected because some people react sensitively to all psychedelics concerning the GI. Why someone who is prone to GI issues would order 100 blotters of a psychedelic they hadn't tried yet is beyond me, though...

Yeah, I had some GI issues on 225ug, but nothing untoward. No nausea was noted with low or staggered dosing.


This is definitely NOT some dodgy NBOMe or whatever. I swallowed straight away & had the same effects from buccal dosing!

I took about 400ug of LSZ at Shambhala music festival this year.. 

Product i ordered myself,

With 140mg of 5-apb and oh my god, that had to have been one of the most viscerally enthralling and highly sustainably visual and complex trip i'd ever been on.


I actually wished i was indoors. I cannot even begin to communicate the divinely intricate hallucinations and feelings i had thrust upon me.


When i say, complete and total, ego death. I mean, i was a Levitating ball of energy who floated from place to place.

I could see into peoples minds and feel their happiness.

Communication was hard. I could not speak. But then again i'm fairly certain i was speaking using only my mind. 

To other telepaths//empaths who were there. 


No substance or combination of substances has even been able to shy as remotely close as that combo. 

*tips imaginary hat* 


That is an Epic Combo. and here i thought i was the only one.

Because there's nothing else to buy for psychs that doesn't cause nausea anyway, and it turned out I made the right move because LSZ is the only psych RC that doesn't cause tremors. So you see, I won by getting rid of one of the worst effects of RC psychs, the tremors. With only nausea to deal with, I can simply use diphenhydramine with it. In fact, I'll also take some Motherwort tincture to prevent vasoconstriction and other adrenergic effects. Getting high on psychs isn't as simple as swallowing a hit. You have to take the proper "cocktail", in this case the Motherwort/Diphenhydramine/LSZ cocktail.

Tried this at about 225ug.  Mostly like LSD, not sure i could tell the difference... maybe clearer head? Less jitters..  Same color enhancement and feel as LSD but with less body load possibly.  Feels like its on the "same frequency" as LSD, where AL-LAD is tuned off a bit... (which for now makes it the more interesting one for me just because its novel).

It seems pertinent to point out that the GI discomfort and nausea on these could be related to 5HT3 agonism. In which case, a small dose of ondansetron would be the logical pharmacological answer. Easier to find 5ht3 antagonists are Mirtazapine, or also Trazodone in US, which have a lot of other effects as well which may affect the action of the first compound. Tremors should be fairly easy to fix with Clonazepam small dose. Can't wait to try or hear reports of 150mics of LSZ combined with 150mics AL-LAD.

LSZ is a fucking amazing substance, that's all there is to it. 


I took 300ug and it was great - I felt physically wonderful, no side effects at all, music sounded awesome, but the trip was JUST verging on where I really wanted to go. So I topped it off at the peak with 100ug of 25c nasally - and OH MY GOD, this was one of the most fucking orgasmically amazing trips I've ever had. EXTREME O and CEVs, INCREDIBLE, I mean I really can't stress enough, INCREDIBLE music enhancement, everything sounded out of this fucking world. I had zero side effects. No GI discomfort, no uncomfortable tension, nothing. 


LSZ is one of the cleanest drugs I've ever taken, possibly the cleanest. It's cleaner than good old L itself. 


I've ordered 10 more blotters, and I also ordered 10 AL-LAD blotters because I'm extremely interested in that chemical as well. 


By the way, the duration was about in line with that of LSD. 


Everyone, get ahold of as much of this drug as your finances permit while it's still around. It's a fucking winner. It may just be the best psychedelic drug I've ever taken. I plan to take 450ug next time as I felt it could have easily been taken much higher.

Oh, I'm aware, haha. I have quite a bit of etizolam on hand if anything goes wrong. 


Luckily, though, I think things will go well. The drug was so physically benign that I can't imagine having problems - every single difficult psychedelic experience I've had has been due to bad setting or body load.

It's possible to get a little over-confident too! Careful about exposing yourself to unpredictable situations on this & Al-Lad, both these compounds are quite capable of producing very awkward experiences regrardless of how benign they may appear after one go. I've had 5 on Al-Lad & 3 on LSz & I've had afew difficult moments on each.


Keep the repsonse curve & "setting" in mind when pushing the dosage of these remarkable compounds!

Is LSZ (and AL-LAD for that matter) less potent than LSD? 150μg of acid would be quite a strong hit.

Hard to say, both these are supposed to be stronger than LSD, weight-for-weight (through in vitro affinity testing, I think), but this is not being borne out in reality as far as I can see. Perhaps they are actually stronger than an equivelent LSD dose but becuase the effects are less in your face they may "feel" less strong...

I have four gummy bears injected with LSZ. I am excited to test these out. Unfortunately I am unaware of the dose, but I believe that it is quite small as a friend of mine took 2 and said he could handle a bit more. What are the average doses? Is there a danger zone one should watch for? Any advice is swell.

The average dose blotters have been laid with is 150ug. 


I wouldn't say there's a danger zone as far as the drug being physically unsafe, at least in reasonable ranges given it's similarity to LSD both structurally (although I'm not chemistry competent so if this assumption is incorrect someone with more knowledge than me should please correct that, and everyone else take this with a grain of salt) and in its effects. 


300ug for me was fantastic but not strong enough. I've got more coming on the way along with some AL-LAD and I'll be testing the waters more and updating the threads periodically.

The trip report that I posted didn't contain a potency comparison to LSD but perhaps it should. Conclusion: Assuming that the blotter was accurately loaded with 150ug and hadn't degraded much, LSZ is significantly less potent than LSD. 150ug of LSD would be an easy +++ whereas the same dose of LSZ was just touching ++.

Psychedelia is definitely there, but µg for µg there are certainly less visuals than for AL-LAD (if at all?). I never took a full 150 µg blotter of this one though.

I got visuals even with my 125ug trip so perhaps yours had degraded somewhat?

I didn't get much visuals either. It's 5-HT2a affinity is only 8, which is about 40 % that of LSD, while its 5-HT2c affinity is almost the same as LSD. 5-HT1a affinity is is about 2.5 times that of LSD. So it's basically LSD with the 5-HT2a and 5-HT1a affinities reversed and 5-HT2c staying the same. 5-HT2a is the one responsible for the psychedelic effects. 5-HT1a has antidepressant effects but not psychedelic effects. So judging just from the affinities you would expect LSZ to be considerably less psychedelic than LSD. On the good side, it also has much less tremor producing effects.


I've read that D-Lysergic acid pyrrolidide, which is almost the same as LSZ but with a 5 member ring on the amide instead of the 4 member ring, only has about 1/10th the potency of LSD, same with the morpholide which is also very similar, so it's actually surprising that LSZ would be close in potency to LSD. To me it feels like an LSD trip that never really lifts off, but the most I've taken is only two blotters and I did throw up that time so some may have been lost. 3 or 4 blotters might do it but I'm worried about too severe body load. It's possible that a high dose would actually have less body load though, since 5-HT1a is supposed to have antinausea effects. Maybe 1 or 2 blotters isn't enough for that effect to overpower the nausea.

Use the classic tips for avoiding nausea such as ginger and cannabis, also a good diet for a few days leading up to the trip.  Something like diphenhydramine would probably kill the trip or else I would recommend it.  Phenergan would too.  Is there anything similar that isn't a 5-ht2a antagonist?

Maybe I've just been unlucky with this one?  I've made multiple attempts at 150 mcg, a couple at 300 mcg, and one at 450 mcg.  I guess I could keep chasing whatever it is I'm chasing up the dosage ladder.  But, this one is telling me, "it's just not working out between us."  I'm going to listen and raise the white flag, I think.


Nothing warrants a trip report -- good or bad.  In short, at lower doses, nothing much happens for me.  Physically, it's pretty innocuous (and no visuals).  Mentally, it's a little and quite pleasantly introspective.  At higher doses, it can get pretty rocky (and barely any visuals).  Physically, it's awful -- or maybe the feeling of being choked for six hours just doesn't appeal to me the way it once did.  Mentally, it's a tedious and relentless boredom trap ... like "c'mon, I don't need psychedelics to work out this mundane crap ... give me something interesting to turn over in my mind -- or just let me go."  8)


When I hear "fucking amazing substance"; "fucking winner"; "best psychedelic drug I've ever taken" ... I really have to wonder whether we're taking the same psychedelic drug?!?!?  I mean, seriously, 450 mcg of a legit LSD analog working at its peak should not inspire me to check my e-mail, make coffee, and start working out how to conduct an upcoming estate auction.  ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)


That ... and the feeling like my throat was closing up???  I'll be honest:  there were moments of pretty intense anxiety in that 450 mcg experience related to the choking feeling and difficulty swallowing.  I always have at least a couple of milligrams (OK, a couple of bottles) of a Benzo around, but in 25 years, I have never aborted a trip -- no matter how difficult things became.  That said, I almost shot this one down.  I was tempted.  As it was, I did take 0.25 mg of Klonopin several hours in just to get things back on an even keel.  (I should be as clear as I can be.  There was no panic, but there was *plenty* of anxiety ... along the lines of "am I suffocating?" and "if I am, would I know in time?" and "if I knew in time, what would I do?"  Not to be self-congratulatory at all, but in someone else, this may well have spiraled into full panic.  And from a physical side-effect!  Man, I thought if I were going to get taken down, my own mind would do it!)


Listen, I'm FAR from overly-tolerant to psychedelics.  Experiences with 150 mcg of AL-LAD, for example, have been some of the most intensely pleasurable in my life.  I do not feel the need to chase anything with that chemical.  And jeez ... just *show me a picture* of a San Pedro cutting and I'm instantly at a Victorian garden party on Venus with Alice and the white rabbit being served tea by a bound and naked Indian girl who flew in on her mountain banshee for the occasion.  No trouble getting there (if I want to) at all.  So, why LSZ is *such* a nothing experience (with awful physicals at higher doses) is totally beyond me.  ![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)  And yet, I'm as confident in this source (with all that entails -- genuineness, accuracy of dosage, handling and storage) as I can be.  If I questioned the source, I would certainly say so.


Oh well ... S'OK ... there are plenty of other fish in the sea.  And for those of you who really get on with this stuff, all the best to you!

Totally fair question.  Right now, I try to space trips out by a week.  Sometimes by more, never by less.  That 450 mcg LSZ experience occurred after a nine-day hiatus.  In general, that amount of time may not be enough ... especially when it turns into week after week after week.  Point noted.  Thanks!

Has anyone come across LSZ blotters that didn't have the normal "LSZ" on them? These resemble actual LSD blotters as well, including in size which I found was not the case with AL-LAD.

In reguards to some people not having as much fun as others with this compound.

Well i really hate to say it but not everyones mind is exactly the same. 


For example. 2c's 

I don't think i have ever met any two people who have the exact same kind of trip off of any 2c'

Like Jim and John could take 2c-e and unless they took it together, they would both have a similar trip.


If they took it seperately and one guy was like "urgh my body" and another guy was like "I'm Lovin it" 

it turns into a rendition of is it set or setting?

is it your own Physical make up?

Did you eat something funny that day before taking the LSZ.


I've noticed that if i eat meat, especially processed Meat, before consuming any Lysergimides. I generally do not hallucinate.

Instead i have a very very heady, very godlike experience.


Anyone who has NOT had fun with this compound i strongly recommend a fast, before doing it. 

Then once you get used to how it is a little bit Heavier than LSD perhaps your mind can manifest more amazingness out of it.


Also out of the two compounds ALD-52 is the Clear Winner.

Wow... well I love both these new lysergamides, I do not eat much meat & I always fast before even light psychedelics. I also amost always EAT once I've come up, tripping, which has been almost universally successful for me.


I tend to have lower tolerance generally, I wonder if that is a diet thing... Interesting points anyway...

Has anyone tried this in combination with AMT ?? I was thinking 20/25mg of AMT with half a tab, maybe a whole if I'm feeling it, this will be in a party setting, for some reason I find communication a little difficult on LSZ hence why I want to add some AMT in the mix, I'm pretty experienced with both chemicals.

Thanks for this.  I'm one of the ones who has "NOT had fun with this compound."  Pretty much the opposite of fun, actually.  In fact, I had pretty well decided to give up on LSZ ... but maybe I'll give it one more shot with a total fast?  Since I've got the material, and it would otherwise go to waste most likely, I might as well.

Somebody should try predosing with Kudzu, a natural plant root which antagonizes 5-HT2c receptors. I can't get it in the small city I live in because nobody stocks it. Others would have a better chance of finding it though. 5-HT2c has negative effects and is actually anti-euphoric. LSZ has stronger 5-HT2c affinity than the psychedelic 5-HT2a affinity, which is  8.3, higher numbers meaning less strong effects. LSD in contrast is about 3.5. So LSZ is significantly weaker on that one while having 5-HT2c affinity of 6.5 (LSD has 5.5). Now if you could knock down the 5-HT2c effects of LSZ you might be able to make it a lot more like LSD.

I'd be up for trying this as your logic makes sense.  I live in NYC ... and if it's not at my local store (run by a Bhutanese family, so it's possible) I think I could definitely find it in Chinatown.  Any more info. or suggestions?

So in essence as far as I remember this is more like mushrooms, given the 5HT2C affinities? I believed that's why I never really got into mushrooms or 4-AcO-DMT as it was either to mild or to anxiogenic. Now i'm kinda put off about trying this one.

As I said a couple of posts up, I'm game for trying this.  I dropped by the health food store on my block tonight on my way home.  They have Kudzu ... both supplement capsules and a big bag of "Kudzu starch" meant to be used as a thickening agent in cooking.  What's your recommendation?  That I take a whole bunch of the supplement capsules -- maybe even for days in advance -- and have at it?  What dose of LSZ?  I've tried up to 450ug with plenty of physical discomfort and not much else.  I'm all ears...

Okay, we're getting somewhere now. Firstly, the starch is good for cooking but that's about all, it's a high quality starch though, good for gourmet types. The capsules are what we need for this experiment. You don't want to take a large dose, as I've read that it can have adverse effects at high doses. You would want probably about 500-700 mg, which would likely be a single capsule. You would take it shortly before the LSZ so it can have time to process in your system, maybe 30 minutes before the LSZ. Then you would take probably 2 blotters of LSZ, a moderate dose sufficient to test if Kudzu can suppress bad effects. Then simply wait and see what happens. Thanks for doing this, by the way. This may help a lot of people, especially me, as I get quite unpleasant effects from LSZ and no euphoria whatsoever. Let the experiment begin, Dr Jekyl.

The capsules I found were 613 mg (really?) so they're right in your suggested range.  Question for you ... even if they're not available locally to you, they're all over the Internet.  Any reason you haven't just ordered them from a vitamin/herb vendor?


Whatever the case, I'm definitely still down to try this -- I want to figure it out, too.  I *think* I have 300ug of LSZ on hand, but I'm not totally sure -- need to check.  (That may sound strange, but I kind of lost track of my personal supply of LSZ when I decided to give up on it.  I bought a bunch but could never get anywhere with it.  That was hugely disappointing BTW ... I thought LSZ was going to be IT.)  Anyway, if I don't have any, it's only slightly harder to obtain than the herbal supplement.  (Man, who ever thought I'd be typing something like that?)  A week at most.  Not sure when I can make this happen ... maybe end of next week or the week after?

The capsules are what we need for this experiment. You don't want to take a large dose, as I've read that it can have adverse effects at high doses. You would want probably about 500-700 mg, which would likely be a single capsule. You would take it shortly before the LSZ so it can have time to process in your system, maybe 30 minutes before the LSZ. Then you would take probably 2 blotters of LSZ, a moderate dose sufficient to test if Kudzu can suppress bad effects. Then simply wait and see what happens. Thanks for doing this, by the way. This may help a lot of people, especially me, as I get quite unpleasant effects from LSZ and no euphoria whatsoever. Let the experiment begin, Dr Jekyl.

It's a good experiment, but I must honestly ask you J7 after reading the majority of your posts, have you had a "good trip" on any psychedelic chemical you like? You said you always wanted to explicitly LSD type trip

(back in the 80's or something... sorry can't quite coin it!), is this simply all your searching for an exact match? I can see you understand pharmacodynamics, as such, but are you in s good place in life? 


So far it seems the LSZ pool is a mixture of contradiction's. At least at certain doses. Whilst AL-LAD remains reliable as always. It reminds me exactly of the opposition I know some feel from mushrooms/4-AcO-DMT/in comparison between the two. Especially given the affinities, obviously a lysergamide is going to be a potent pup to play with, but can we wholly summarize that with LSZ's higher 5HT2c agnoist qualitlities, that is is more like "LSD murshrooms", while AL-LAD is simply laying in line with LSD.....?


This is all i'm looking for, because I need to test LSZ but I do know 5HT2c's have always given me a bit of a problem. I know "technically" we shouldn't even bring 4-HO-DMT into this conversation, but i'm beginning to wonder if like Mushies;s to me, LSZ will still be acceptable because synthetic "4-HO-DMT" in pure form was a ride for sure, but as most others agree it was very different from 4-AcO-DMT/Mushrooms!


Either way bravo to J7 for his idea, it is indeed, one of thought!

I live in Canada and the only source I could find was Nature's Way Supplements but they don't sell from their site, you have to find a local distributor and their list said there are none in my Province. Ordering stuff from the US is way too much trouble with Customs and I also would rather not have a package come to my PO box that feels and sounds like a bottle of pills anyway. However, if you test it and find it's valuable then I could go to the trouble of having a local health store order it in and then me pick it up there. Regarding you not actually having any LSZ on hand, that is a bit of a fly in ointment.

No, I haven't had a good trip from any RC psych yet really. The first time I tried AL-LAD it was only one and I barely felt it. Second time I took 2 but I also took some Motherwort tincture with it to counter adrenergic effects like vaso. I felt pretty crappy that time but it may have been the Motherwort interacting in a bad way. I only ordered 3 AL-LAD so that was end of the supply. I had rather severe tremors the whole trip and felt generally really uncomfortable. LSZ had no tremors but the nausea for the first few hours made it unworth the somewhat better latter part of the trip, which lacked the nausea but wasn't really anything special, some slight visuals and no perceptible euphoria. Right now I have an aversion to trying it again. Diphenhydramine might cut the nausea but it still wouldn't have any euphoric component. I'm hoping that antagonizing the 5-HT2c effects with Kudzu might actually make it euphoric and less ill feeling.

Then the experiment is on, in a week or so. In the meantime, maybe you could try a capsule by itself and see is it produces a mild euphoric state as some have said. As long as you don't take any for a couple days before the experiment the results should be valid.

GG, looking at the very stark comparison between your experiences and that of others, I would be more inclined to believe that what you have may not be LSZ. In such case, I'd check with others who purchased from the same vendor, if that is not possible, I'd either try to get a friend to try your stash and/or to procure more from another vendor.


I'm thinking of getting some of this as well, but hoping that prices would drop a bit. The illegal counterpart is cheaper at this point.

I agree that it is, indeed, stark.  Sorry about that.  I just figure that we're all different.  But, of course you're absolutely welcome to believe whatever makes the most sense to you.  I've done at least a couple of things that you suggest:  namely, I've conferred with others who have purchased from the same vendor (different experience than mine); and I've ordered from two different vendors (same personal experience across vendors).  I've also got absolutely no reason to mistrust what I received from my preferred vendor.  Every other product has been absolutely as indicated.  And, let's face it ... aren't we all using the same outfits and getting the same stuff?  Especially those of us who have found upstanding vendors who are willing to ship to the U.S.?  Let's just say that there aren't a thousand of them, right?


That said, if you have a suggestion as to what this might have been, I'll totally hear you out.  I'm certainly not here to defend anything or anyone.  I wish LSZ were more positive for me than it is.  And if I can get it to be that?  Hey, so much the better!

Could someone here who actually HAS some LSZ try it with Kudzu tablets/capsules and see if it cuts the bodyload any please. It's in your own interest to try it. I'm not trying to prank you or anything. Or am I the only person here who really has LSZ and everyone else is just making up stories? No stores have Kudzu where I live, thus my request for others to try it. Finding someone to do so seems to be as hard as finding the Holy Grail though, oddly enough. Seems like a simple enough thing to do if you live in a major metropolitan area with numerous health stores. Kudzu is quite cheap.

... no, I'd rather not. As I have tried this compound in varying doses & found almost non-existant body-load, if indeed there were any unpleasant aspects to the material, I do not feel the need to risk queering the pitch by adding anything to the mix. Do you live in some self-contained fascist state where you can bizarrely buy LSz on the internet but not "Kudzu"? If not, just buy some on the internet, have it delivered... & best of luck to you!


I am delighted to admit that I do indeed have a little LSz on ice, because such a blatant admission of possession of a LEGAL lysergide harms no-one...

Yeah ... maybe you're the only person over the last couple hundred posts on LSZ who actually has it ... and the rest of us are all just making up stories.  'Cause that's such a fun way to spend time.  Or maybe I have both LSZ *and* Kudzu *and* agreed to run your experiment like, what, a week or so ago?  "Seems to be as hard as finding the Holy Grail" ... huh?  Man, you're impatient.  Why so uptight about this?  Just as a practical matter, did you really want me to satisfy your request, come back with my results, and then tell you that the whole thing was probably inconclusive because of cross-tolerance issues?  I said I needed some time.  You came back and said I needed less time.  I used to work for people like you.


I'm also a little suspicious (as I alluded to in an earlier post) of someone who is afraid to buy a perfectly legal and cheap herbal supplement through the mail.  Actually, I'm getting more and more suspicious the more I think about it.  People do that ALL THE TIME.  I can't figure out what's going on here.  Why so much urgency and pressure?  I think I now agree with the advice you were given above.  I'm willing to do this on my schedule -- even though I really dislike LSZ.  That said, if you need this done ***NOW!*** then I think you'd be best off doing it yourself.  I hope it works out for you...

Planning on finally trying LSZ for the first time this weekend.  Think I'll just hop in with 1 tab though, as 1 tab of AL-LAD hit the spot nicely for me.  Very interested to see how it differs from AL and particularly LSD.  How do you generally feel the next day?  An afterglow effect or feeling tired and drained?

Jason I have to admit; it sounds really ridiculous that you'd be even dealing with psychedelics at this point. I mean, I don't mean to be a dick, but I have to say that you sound like a glutton for punishment at this point. Have you ever just though that perhaps they aren't for you? I mean, it seems as though an awful lot of effort is being put into one failure after another, then kind of poisoning the well by making negative comments about AL and LSZ. Again, I've been reading all of these for months, and it's gone from the sublime to the ridiculous, but that's just me. I'd run, not walk, away from ANY psychedelic at this point. Hopefully, with all your negative reactions to them, you don't wind up in an emergency room somewhere. I hope not. Have you ever considered that playing russian roulette with these chemicals, KNOWING that you are a poor responder, is a wise thing to do? It's your body, so you can obviously do what you want, but it does seem a bit foolish an endeavor for you, personally.

Yes, I live in the Fascist country known as "Canada". I don't feel like ordering pills over the internet and there are no internet sources for it in Canada, smartass. You can't order stuff from the US without a lot of hassle with Customs so I won't even bother. Now either take the Kudzu challenge or zip it.

'Cause that's such a fun way to spend time.  Or maybe I have both LSZ *and* Kudzu *and* agreed to run your experiment like, what, a week or so ago?  "Seems to be as hard as finding the Holy Grail" ... huh?  Man, you're impatient.  Why so uptight about this?  Just as a practical matter, did you really want me to satisfy your request, come back with my results, and then tell you that the whole thing was probably inconclusive because of cross-tolerance issues?  I said I needed some time.  You came back and said I needed less time.  I used to work for people like you.

Actually, I'm getting more and more suspicious the more I think about it.  People do that ALL THE TIME.  I can't figure out what's going on here.  Why so much urgency and pressure?  I think I now agree with the advice you were given above.  I'm willing to do this on my schedule -- even though I really dislike LSZ.  That said, if you need this done ***NOW!*** then I think you'd be best off doing it yourself.  I hope it works out for you...

So why didn't you do the experiment yet then, Mr. I have LSZ and Kudzu? Just forget it. I don't want any experiment results from you. You said you would do it then a bunch of time passed with no update so I figured just another wanker. That's STILL what I figure. I shouldn't even have mentioned Kudzu because you deserve full bodyload. What a waste of time this forum is. I'm not even going to post here anymore. It's just a bunch of rude people here who won't do one lousy little Kudzu experiment in a timely manner. And as for your suspicions, yeah, I'm a cop and I want to trick you into taking the deadly combination of Kudzu and LSZ just for kicks. I gotta go eat some donuts now. So long, useless rude BL forum people. And don't even bother replying cuz I won't even be reading this forum anymore. I'm removing it from my bookmarks list and I sure won't bother typing the URL in.

some people have no patience at all trying to rush folks here for his own agenda though it may be a good idea . I for one wouldnt take either al-lad or lsz or even lsd more than once a month or eventually it will lose some of its magic and only my feelings but it takes me at least a month to get the receptors back to normal.If you find this forum a waste of time thats your call but i am sure a lot of people do get a lot of good information here as i have yes there will be rude people who hide behind their computers to slag people off kind of like you have just done.I am actually disappointed in your last post as you may have even brought some good information to this forum but your choice and maybe even your loss. Take care in your future experiments but as someone once said if you cant take care dont take anything

Crazy! I think LSD produces the greatest tolerance of anything I've ever done!  If I start off with just 100 mics, I can continue to eat 1000 mics, spread out over a 30 hour period, and not get nearly as high as I would if I ate 300 mics to start off.  This is obviously due to rapid, extreme tolerance.  


My one experience with AL-LAD seemed very different.  I ate 150 mics of AL-LAD one night, and then ate 200-300 mics of LSD the following night, expecting cross-tolerance, and experienced none!  That second night I tripped like I had no tolerance at all, which came as a huge surprise!


To those of you complaining about the jittery side effects of some of these compounds: You are aware that taking something like 5-10mg diazepam during a trip makes **a world of difference**, right?  Most people just take benzos to fall asleep, but I think they go great during the trip itself!  They just seem to go right to the root of those jittery, anxious side effects, making it so you can take a deep breath and relax.

That's interesting.  If I take something like 0.5 mg of Klonopin -- so roughly equivalent to your 10 mg of Valium -- I find that it seriously ratchets down the intensity of the entire experience ... both physically and mentally.

I find low dose (how much is that depends on your tolerance) etizolam great for this purpose, doesn't really affect the trip much, but gets rid of any uncomfortable stimulation (not that I need it with lsd and it's cousins, but for 2c-x it's quite useful since I hate the stimulation).


Anyway, I have a question about LSZ and visuals - do they get better at higher doses? I only tried 150ug and they were quite underwhelming compared to 150ug al-lad, everything else was fine (bodyload, headspace, ...). Would they get better with 225ug or 300ug (that's the most I can take, only have to blotters left)?

^ Yeah I agree, I've found 150ug to be pretty underwhelming.  Having a great time and all but was definitely looking for more.  I do like how it appears to be much more chilled out than AL-LAD.  Compared to my first time on Alladin this does pale in comparison though.  Will definitely go for a higher dose next time.


How would a little bit of MDMA go down with this?

al-lad is pretty chilled for me... or to be more precise it is if i want it to be... i can just relax, watch a movie and enjoy the psychedelic effect if i want to or i can go out exploring, it doesn't force me to do anything (for example with 2c-e i have to go out and walk because it's way to stimulating to relax at home)... and the visuals are one of the prettiest (like everything looking like it has photoshops line finding filter applied, or like looking through a kaleidoscope) of all psys i've tried even at 150ug but at the same time aren't overwhelming (meaning if you concentrate hard, you can get rid of them for a while, 2c-e visuals are also strong, but much less controllable, but it does have better synaesthesisa). This is comparing 150ug al-lad with 16mg 2c-e, higher doses are of course less controlable...


Still for those  who have tried lsz at 225 or 300ug... do the visuals get better? Because, again, that's the only thing that I find missing from it. Or should I maybe combine it with some more visual psy (500ug of 2c-nboh/some 4-ho-met or something else with little mind fuck but lots of visuals)?


> How would a little bit of MDMA go down with this? 

Probably great if you like mdma + lsd.

I want to try an al-lad + 5-apb/6-apb combo (mdma is a bit to stimulating for me) one day, but since the UK ban the apbs are hard to find and al-lad is running scarce as well (hope they make more, and not just al-lad but all the still legal lysergamides).

I had another go at 150ug of lsz on friday night and must admit i got hit a lot harder than the last time i tried it. it must have been very little on that blotter the first time as i really enjoyed it on friday. I swallowed tab at 7 pm while relaxing in the bath and started to feel effects about an hour later. The wifes friend then came over so i hid in kitchen playing music on computer till she left just before 10 pm. The music really sounded fantastic possibly even more so than on al-lad. there was very little body load though i was a bit unsteady when i had to go to the toilet. Also nice and euphoric as a beatific grin kept appearing on my face for no reason at all. Very mild oevs but the cevs were quite strong but not like al-lad. i also got very hungry after a few hours and was eating quite a lot all through the trip.I also smoked quite a lot of polm after the first couple of hours as it did make me want to smoke. probably a waste then as the lsz did over power it for most of the trip.I dont like to smoke noids when on other chemicals as it just doesn't feel right so i just stuck to the hash.I ended up watching a film 633 squadron on the telly but this does make you emotional as i was nearly in tears at the end of it. I was still awake at 6.45 am so i took 2mg of etiz went to bed and slept right through to 4.45 pm on saturday and had to get up as the wife was cracking up. I was in a fog for an hour or so but also had the afterglow i actually ended up assembling some bathroom furniture up till around 11pm last night.When i had my first spliff last night it was like being back in amsterdam as it almost gave me a whitey. I love the way this happens the day after i trip. yes i like this chemical very much but dont think it is as strong as al-lad and as i have only one lsz tab left and also have an odd half a tab of al-lad i think i will try that out next time sometime before christmas. so next time out 150ug of lsz and 75ug of al-lad should be very good in my opinion.

I don't find it (doing a small amount of benzo) does fuck all to intensity, however I only use 2.5 mg or so of diazepam (Valium). I also use meth while on psychedelics which I find does change the subjective experience more clear thought process with slightly reduced visuals but massive stimulation. 40 mg of very pure 2ce needed 2-3 mg of xanax just to be managed and it was only fucking just under control.

I have exactly the same intuitive feeling.

Can anybody please tell how are the biggest differences between LSD and LSZ especially in regards to cognition enhancement?

Anybody tried LSZ micro-dosing? 

**Most all of what's the tolerance of LSZ?**

Yes I did, and based on that I would say the tolerance is about the same as that of AL-LAD or LSD, i.e. at least double the dose for same effects after 24h, and still up it after 48h. I microdosed every other day the same dose, and after 10 days (5 doses) it had no more effect. Repeated the experiment every third day and was more successful, even though there still may be some remaining tolerance (little effects after 2+ weeks of such repetitive exposure).


When it comes to the actual results of the micro-dosing (10 to 20 µg being a single dose btw, up it if you have tolerance), they were extremely positive (enhanced energy, creativity, productivity, empathy, general hygiene), although I may have a preferance for AL-LAD in this respect.

Thanks for sharing your experience.

I have a very similar experience in regards to tolerance when micro-dosing LSD. Every third day - works really well. However on the day after, even with increased dose, I get very poor results - mainly stimulation and energy, not so much cognitive enhancement anymore:-(


Why do you have a preference for AL-LAD to LSZ?

Is there any reason for micro-dosing AL-LAD or LSZ instead of LSD? Aren't LSD effects still superior in most areas?

This is very subjective and only concerns micro-dosing, since I happen to never have found time for a full normal LSZ trip.

The general impression I had was that my AL-LAD micro-dosed days were slightly better than the LSZ ones. Perhaps more empathy, and definitely better appreciation for visual stimuli.

One reason is that I am sticking to legals for the time being. I have been doing so for about two years, but I have extensive experience with LSD prior to that.


Another reason is that I simply am not convinced that LSD is so superior. It is almost exactly the same, and perhaps AL-LAD is even slightly better. It is a difficult fact for most to admit because LSD has this enormous historical glow, but from my experiences, my AL-LAD trips were probably better than my LSD ones.

I am inclined to agree - LSD is a molecule of perfection 


Nevertheless , some acid is better than others ....

The best that I have ever seen was the Welsh microdots that disappeared after Operation Julie ...


But , having said that , these new analogue tabs are the best acid that I've seen since Julie .


I am convinced that set , setting , and the user's state of mind and metabolism are significant factors in the quality of a trip if the acid is of good quality.


Of course , I have noticed differences to the acid of times long past , but for me no two trips are ever the same ...

This is a topic that has fascinated me for a long time. Pretty much every tryptamine I've tried has an absolute consistency every time I take the same chemical at the same dose. But LSD is so variable every time I take it. I wonder if this is unique to ergoloids ? Although all LSD is supposed to be exactly the same every time it's synthed it sure seems like every batch I've ever tried over the years or at least what's been on different blotters all seems to have its own unique flavour. 

What I last had last summer seemed like every one that took it agreed on similar effects (truly godly closed eye visuals, almost no noticeable come up, and smooth and manageable as fuck even on 6+ hits).It seems though that the same batches of Al-Lad and LSZ seem to be producing highly variable effects in individuals based on reading as many trip reports as I could read.  This just confuses me even more about the variable Acid experience.

Factors/variables:

- different doses (never sure exactly how much the blotter is)

- set and setting

- tolerance (LSD and other psychedelics recently/regularly taken)

- diet, supplements

- if you're rested or tired

- ...

- or some other magic like the phase of the moon (I always feel a bit differently during the few days preceding full moon. At that time I've also noticed that acid works stronger than usual on me)

None of those factors affect Tryptamines for me. Even higher or lower dosages of most trypts don't  significantly change the character of the experience like I get with acid. I've had some acid that purely tactile ( this was before I'd ever tried mdma) .

You just have a very vivid imagination. LSD Is LSD - it's a set arrangement of atoms in a certain structure. There's no "atom out of the wrong place that works like LSD but makes it a bit more tactile LSD". It's simply all in your imagination.

Yes, I actually made a point of stating exactly that all LSD that is synthed is supposed to be the same. But how well understood is LSD mechanism of action? Most people I believe will make the argument that unlike MOST other psychedelics LSD has a degree of variability every time you take it that I suspect is far more complicated than just set and setting.


Also, that purely tactile acid I had was years before I'd ever taken mdma. My girlfriend who dropped with me and had been using mdma for over ten years remarked many times in the evening how much this acid was like mdma. It had zero visuals and we ended up just having sex all night (it was our very first date). It was absolutley unlike any other acid I've ever taken. But we bought about 20 hits and had a very similar experience each time we took it. 

We actually got 2 supposedly different batches of acid from that same dealer that night. If my memory serves correct it was blue Hieroglyphs and red Simpsons acid.  The red Simpsons acid was purely tactile every time. It's possible that this was some other chemical but this was also almost 10 years ago and had no taste and was a very very very trustworthy source. (Close friend who actually cared about the spiritual aspect of spreading LSD and not about profit).

Yeah ballz - I agree that LSD has a vast range of effects. But it's still just LSD. 


What alternative do you have? That there's a thousand different molecules all active at the same dose as LSD but which cause slightly different effects? I think someone would have discovered them by now.

Again I'm not saying its a variation of the molecule but possibly how LSD is metabolized at the moment it's consumed, possibly not. We really do not have great understanding of how LSD works it's magic. It also, binds to a bunch of receptors that most other psychedelics don't (unless I'm mistaken ). You probably know a lot more the dynamics of LSD at an acedemic level. But even the best in this field don't understand it well.  I'm pretty much basing my opinion on personal experience with LSD which had A LOT of experience with. Every time I do mushrooms it's more or less the same. Every time I do 4-aco-met it's pretty damn similar as the last time.  Every time I score acid it seems to be very unique and I am aware of the many factors that could contribute this situation. All I'm saying I personally strongly suspect something more complicated is going on. I'm no chemist or even a scientist. But I do have a fascination with psychedelics and Especially LSD. I've always approached the subject with as much objectivity, intelligence, and reverence as I can. I know I'm not the only who feels this way.


I am hoping to secure some AL-LAD very soon and hopefully LSZ as well in the near future. I am very curious if the "variable" phenomenon is unique to ergoloids and Tryptamines are just a lot more consistent? As soon as I can I will explore these LSD analogues and see for myself I guess.

With respect , I am not so sure about this [ ^ ] ....

I feel that there are more variables to the experience than simply just the mcg dosage , set , setting , and the user's state of mind and physiology , etc ...

I suspect that the actual composition of the " acid " in the tab is also a very significant factor 


I recall that during the 70's there was an abundance of different tabs in circulation in Australia  - dots , domes , cones , clear lights , barrels ,  etc , etc , and there was indeed very significant differences between some of them that must have been due to more than just the mcg dosages . Some of it was said to have come from USA [ clear light , orange barrels , ] , and others were allegedly from Europe [ cones , domes , dots , etc ,] ...


I remember that one type was truly exceptional  - " Welsh brown microdots " [ they looked like tiny squares of chopped up photograph negative , and came in between two strips of cellotape ] .  These were just brilliant - no  nausea , body load , jitters , or malaise  at all when coming on . The first alert after an hour or so was for me on  the first trip when a black and white poster started changing colours of day-glo fluro green and orange ; and the next 10 hours was indescribable brilliant visuals and ecstatic bliss , love , and cosmic knowledge . 

Sadly this " Welsh " acid was pretty scarce and there was never much around , however , it certainly made all the rest [ which was also good ] look rather ordinary at the time ...

I have never seen anything like this "Welsh " acid in the decades since ...


Now , with the benefit of hindsight [ post " Operation Julie " ] , it is quite likely that the outstanding " Welsh " microdots were Richard Kemp's acid [ reported to be 

the purest ever analysed in Dick Lee's book - the head Julie cop ] ; and according to " Leaf " Fielding [ " ...above the law " ] and Lee and other authors , Kemp had hit upon a method of production that did not produce any iso-LSD or other impurities whatsoever ....

Kemp's acid was said to be better than that produced by Sandoz ...


The Julie cops analysed the tabs of the time in Britain and discovered that there was predominantly two types of acid getting around , although it was being packaged in a variety of ways - [ dots , domes , cones , microdots , etc ] ...

One type contained iso-LSD , the other had no iso-LSD at all and was the purest ever to be analysed anywhere in the world , [ inc Sandoz acid ].


I have read somewhere [ Psychedelic Chemistry , M. V . Smith , I think , and elsewhere ] that the presence of iso-LSD is suspected to detract from the " cosmicity " of  trips ...


Therefore , as Ismene suggests - LSD is LSD ...

BUT , it is variable in it's effects due to factors other than merely mcg dosages ...

There are in fact other variables to be considered [ I believe ] , including purity and the presence of iso- LSD .

I have seen various posts suggesting that the degradation impurities described in the TiKHAL entry (what Shulgin calls "iso-LSD", the epimerization degradation product, and "lumi-LSD", the oxidation product) may possibly be physically active even if not psychologically active, and perhaps account for some feeling differences. I don't see linked evidence to this one way or another, but that's a speculation.


Perhaps this is true of all of the "non-active" stereoisomers as well. LSD has four stereoisomers and care must be taken in synthesis to isolate the only hallucinogenic active one, d-LSD. Are the other three *completely* inactive? No idea. 


All of this of course may make exact dosing difficult between batches I imagine. That, and chemical misrepresentation (it happened even in the old days, when ALD-52 was sold as "Orange Sunshine" LSD in the late 1960s!) can explain perhaps *some* variability in effects.

Don't you think Guys that we would already know if the difference would be related to the "iso-LSD" or "lumi-LSD" or something alike?


I still think the psychedelics are mainly about sets and settings. I've been experiencing totally different trips with exactly the same material and the same dose. The other factors/variables (that I've mentioned in my previous post) do the rest. At least this is my experience and probably the experience of most people who take LSD.

Then why is 4-aco/ho-xxx so consistent compared to the LSD experience? Every single time I take 4-aco-dmt, 4-aco-met, 4-ho-det, etc it's extremely similar to the last time if the dosages are the same? I'm not say every trip I have with the same chemical is identical but very VERY similar to the point that I could tell 4-ho-mipt from 4-aco-whatever.  I've taken acid MANY times where the overall experience is just so Godamn different.  I like to trip regularly and this is definetly something that I've noticed is unique to LSD (maybe all Ergoloids?). 

It is at least theoretically possible that Iso-LSD and Lumi-LSD might behave in a sort of sympathomimetic sort of way with actual LSD and is responsible for these reports of such variation in experience. Or, it just might be that LSD and it's cousins just tend to create a highly variable psychedelic state plain and simple. I really can't wait to run trials with Al-Lad to see how it compares to the "variable LSD experience". I highly suspect it to be the same.

Maybe LSD is able to trigger many more different mechanisms in our brains than other psychedelics. And because of that it is much easier to get very different experiences with LSD than with the other drugs. 

(More mechanisms could effect more brain "parts" and each "part" might be in a different state each time we trip hence the interaction with LSD produces such a variety of different experiences).

There is, unfortunately, very little research that I see out there. The only thing I found was [this old paper](http://www.erowid.org/references/texts/show/1605docid1470) which indicates that the isomers are practically inactive at serotonin, same with lumi-LSD. One saturated product called "d-dihydro-LSD" was half as active, I don't know if this occurs in nature or not.


My personal guess: dosing probably accounts for most if not all of any "variable experience".  


LSD is typically sold in "blotters" with an unknown amount of chemical per blotter. It's also fragile. If you don't store it right, who knows how much you are taking and how much has decayed into mostly inactive molecules?


Mushrooms sometimes have widely variable reports and I think this too is the reason. Same with most street level chemicals (eg "molly"/"ecstasy" pills), with the added bonus of lots of impurities. (LSD is not immune from misrepresented product, too, and I can't rule out that in addition to the NBOMes some of the analogues may have made it on the street. Though I doubt many of them, only the few that are as or more potent than LSD to me would be candidates...)


In contrast, with the 4-ACOs / HOs, you can always measure the same mg every time. It is much easier to get a more consistent trip if you know how much you are taking. These chemicals seem to be far more stable, as a bonus. For an RC, they've suffered less from purity / misrepresentation issues for some reason.


I can't rule out activity of the decayed products, of course, because I see no information about them. I don't think the analogues of LSD have been studied very heavily since the 1950s Sandoz days. But dosing inconsistency makes more sense to me. LSD is so potent I think it would overwhelm any impurity's contribution.

I agree that mushrooms can be slightly variable but mushrooms have their own unique signature so much that regardless of dose it's not all that hard to tell mushrooms from the 4-aco-dmt. Every single tryptamine is SO much more consistent at least in terms of being able to tell the signature of the substance.  

LSD, seems to have such a wide varaiation in so many of its effects.  Sometimes the come up on 2 hits is extremely rough and jittery with extreme body load through and not much visuals. . Sometimes the come up on 6 hits of another batch has no noticeable come up at all, in fact no body load and is VERY visual.  I highly suspect there is something more going on that just set and setting.

Got a question for people who have tried both LSZ and mushrooms (separately).


I've been eating mushrooms for about 22 months, once or twice a week in doses ranging from 0.67g to ~7.5g dried Cubensis. Never tried LSD; never had it available to me.


Found a source of LSZ and have ordered 3x150 ug blotter.


I intend to start with 1/2 tab, wait that out (a 2-3 hour coming up period?), and then move on to 1 tab a week or 2 later.


I know everyone is different. I expect a little bit of nausea, but can deal with that. Not too hot on getting tremors (4-HO-DiPT), but only a test will tell.


What is the headspace like on LSZ? Mostly introspection? Is it deep, and can you get caught in thought loops? (these don't bother me; I once stood in my grow room for over 2 hours just lost in thought).


I guess I'm asking if there is anything specific I should look out for. I don't have Benzo's, (I quit cold turkey about 5 years ago), but figure that the worst a bad trip would do is leave me in a quivering foetal position. Lots of water available, fairly healthy snacks/light food and plenty of distractions


I'm thinking it will be ~8-12 hours in length.


Any advice, tips, tricks, hints or pointers gladly accepted


thanks


Tom


( and no I am not asking what should I take or how much, that has already been decided)

I think you will be fine if you're used to mushrooms, a bad trip on either is a very similar beast.


Personally I'd say LSZ is a little less introspective than mushrooms, but there is a potential for thought loops the same as with any psychedelic.

This discussion on differences between batches of what are probably the same compound is very interesting.  I have definitely had these discussions before that wound up meandering into some pretty esoteric speculations like the molecule's horoscope, and the energy of the people synthing and handling it - haha.  

I don't know enough about the chemistry to make a very educated guess, but it's true that it is highly unlikely, if not impossible, that these differences are due to a different molecular configuration of the primary product.  The activity of the degradation products is an interesting possibility.  The isomer theory seems highly plausible, as this is the case with many other drugs, such as amphetamine and ketamine, and I think even mda/mdma.


Coming back to the main thread topic, I tried one of these labeled 150mcg LSZ blotters a couple days ago, and I found the effects almost indistinguishable from 100mcg of LSD!  I've eaten LSD hundreds of times, though not in very high doses.  I'm so stricken by the variation in people's reports!  I expected the effects to be more unique.  When I tried Al, I found the effects, while similar to LSD, to be easy to differentiate, but not with this one.  You guys sure you're not expecting your way into having a unique experience?  I'm gonna have to push the dose a little further to see if I can tell the difference then....

yes if you dont want to trip as hard. sometimes i like a nice gentle one probably cause i actually got bored tripping about 20 years ago doing it all the time it lost its magic and it wasnt until my first go with al-lad that i found a little bit of the magic again. not quite there with lsz but still enjoyable all the same. nice for a quiet night in listening to some good sounds. also it is not class A a very big advantage if ever caught with it in your possession.

So you say you had acid 20 years ago last time? If so, you would definitely experience it completely differently now.


LSD effects change their qualities along with changes in doses. From my experience I'd say 1/4 blotter gives much different effects than 1-2 full blotters (let's say blotter = 120uq![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

at 150ug both times i have had it wasnt like acid for that al-lad comes a lot closer it was really mellow and comfortable and music appreciation would be as high on lsz but it also made me very hungry which i never got from acid and its shorter lasting.i wouldnt want to push it much higher though i reckon my days of balls out tripping are done now i got too many responsibilities now as im now a grandfather

I always dose psyches on an empty stomach & eat once it's hit! Never ate much on LSD, but LSz made me feel quite uncomfortable UNTIL I'd eaten. Just a penny's worth for the thread...


I once tried to eat a bowl of museli at the tail end of an LSD trip, I chewed one mouthful for about an hour, by which point the rest of the bowl had solidified! I gave up. This must have been 1989 & I can see the room I was sat in, the TV in the corner, everything as if it were yesterday.

^^

I find that dosing on an empty gut is easier and seems to absorb better and faster , but after a while eating something nutritious and easily digestible [ fruit , dates , etc ,...] seems to raise things up a little more . Tripping when hungry is not pleasant for me , and a little food seems to settle my gut.


LSZ made me vomit the first time I tried it with 2 tabs [ 300 mcg ] on an empty stomach , but after retching and something to eat and drink I felt better and had a wonderful day .

Now I space out the tabs for a hour or so apart and the nausea is much less without vomiting ...

LSZ has the advantages that it's legal, dosed consistently and reliably, is relatively inexpensive and is also safe and highly enjoyable like LSD.

Be interesting but I'm not sure tryptamines on top of tryptamines mesh so well. LSD works better with MDMA or mescaline etc.

How bad is the body load generally with this chem? Like 2C-E/P aching muscle cramp body load or more like a lysergic body load? (joints ache, spinal discomfort, and generally uncomfortable muscles.) or am I way off and is it just nausea that can get people with this one?

Ahh yes I forgot your doses were on the low side, but thanks for the info. Hopefully I'll get a few more opinions in the next day or so. I'm considering getting some but I didn't like the prices when they first hit the scene. Kind of looking for an LSD replacement because of my area's NBOMe issue but I don't want to have to pay very high if this turns out to have a bad BL or little spiritual depth like NBOMe ya know? Also can anyone confirm that is has a definite "lysergic feel" to it? Like how LSA has the same special lysergic feel as LSD.

yes you know its a proper trip not like the nbomes at all though they didnt have any depth to me at all but you want al-lad for closest to acid i had a really nice trip not so long ago on it and there was some of the magic i thought i had lost after abusing lsd for a good number of years

definite lysergic feel

but I also have only done low doses,

I get what I would expect from lsd exactly at 1/4 blotter, will be upping that but not by too much over the coming weeks

visual, mental, emotional - same as lsd

no body load.

satisfactory

not cheap

Okay cool cool, all this is getting my hopes up! I haven't used LSD in 4 years or so just because it hasn't been available or reasonably priced but when I used to take it a lot I also thought I had lost the magic to LSD in my last half dozen or so trips. Maybe I will be able to revive that! I've tried many psychedelics since LSD and LSD is the only one that could SHOW ME "god" or whatever you wanna call it, actually I didn't believe in god until LSD, and same for my father apparently when he was touring with the dead. And yeah nbome never had any depth for me either.

You ever tried mushrooms sean? I think they've got the edge on LSD in the finding God stakes.

here we see that  nbome is **double strong** on 5HT2A and pretty strong on 5HT2C

while LSD is more broadly strong

indicating more widespread brain stimulation.

(lower numbers are stronger binding effects)

Yeah I've done tons of different psychedelics, surprisingly haven't tried DMT yet so that one could take the cake. Mushrooms though haven't ever made me talk to god or have very religious experiences like that, however 4-aco-DMT seemed like it was close but I only did 18mg the time I tried it.

Oral DMT is sort of like turbocharged mushrooms. You can get the oral DMT effect by taking a 300mg tablet of moclobemide with your mushrooms.

Found this to be a mixed but overall good experience. Personally I was more interested in AL-LAD but that doesn't seem to be around anymore (sadly) so got these instead. Myself and 2 others took one tab each. The effects were very similar to acid but seemed to change more rapidly. It's difficult to explain but it was like each effect came on in different stages and never stayed consistent for very long. One minute I'd have the typical LSD body feeling but few visuals, then the next no body feeling and tripping intensely. At one point we all got the giggles but one moment we were laughing, then the next almost trying not to. Very confusing! Also, it never felt like we were all on the same "level" as these changing effects weren't happening to us in unison which made it a less social experience than I usually find when I have LSD. In fact I found that I most enjoyed the experience when I was by myself at which point the rapid changes in mood didn't seem to matter. The solution to this strangeness seemed to be watching programs (lots of cartoons) as it gave us all a mutual audio/visual point of reference.

Hello guys,


I have a quick question please if you don't mind, that would be helpful. Do you know for how much time I can store my AL-LAD & LSZ in the freezer before it's start to degrades?


I still have some AL-LAD in my freezer since August 2013 but saddenly I don't have a lot of occasion to do a trip.


I plan to stock some more just in case, do you think it will be OK to store them for a year or 2 ?


They are all in the freezer. I can't research them a lot so...


Thank you very much ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

They were still active? I won't be at my home for like 8 months... (personnal problems). So i may stock some in the future just in case.. It would be nice if I could store them for like 1 - 2 years...

Mixed one tab (150ug) of lsz with 60mg pure mdma (30mg up the nose, 30mg orally) and continuous little bumps of ketamine last night while in a cabin in the forest. I've never been so comfortable in my life. I kind of lost track of time so I don't know if I'll be able to write a legitimate trip report but I'll try.


One of the most interesting points of the trip I was laying on a big hammock with 3 other friends covered in a pile of blankets and pillows looking up at the stars, all of the sudden it felt like the very center of my forehead opened up and I could feel and visualize this ray of energy seeping into the "opened" hole in my head. It really was an indescribable feeling but the only thing I can equate it to is the feeling of being recharged. This lasted for maybe 20 minutes of clock time but in the moment it's hard to say how long it felt.  All of the sudden the feeling started to spread through my whole body and I couldn't really tell where my skin ended. It was a journey.

I did 300ug of LSZ and for all intents and purposes found it to be indistinguishable from LSD. Granted I have not had a proper trip with LSD in a couple years, but if some one sold me that as LSD I do not think I could tell the difference.


I think that dose was perfect for me. Would probably recommend 150ug to green trippers, to be safe.


There was a group of four of us, and during the peak it started to get to the point where we were having trouble functioning and communicating in any kind of productive way. But just when you started to think: "Oh man, I think I took too much, this is getting hard to control," it started to subside in intensity after a peak of about 4 hours or so. There was a lot of spontaneous laughter, you know, when you burst out laughing just because some one else is laughing, to the point where your eyes are watering and your sides hurt from laughing so much. And still you keep laughing.


There was no abnormal body load like I have seen some people mention. No nausea. Just a general tenseness in the muscles. Much like I get with LSD.


I would say the timeline went something like this: 


Dropped at 10:30pm. Tripped pretty hard from 11:30pm till 2:30am. The intensity started to ebb after 2:30am, but with a steady plateau till 5:00am. Was still pretty fucked at at 7:00am, but would not call it tripping per se. At around noon the next day almost all the visuals were gone and felt pretty much at baseline, but "tweaked"


Could not fall asleep until around 10pm the next day though.


BRILLIANT closed eye visuals ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I'm not even going to write up a trip report. This stuff is basically LSD. The come-up took a LONG time (for me it was about 3.5-4 hours!), I had some nausea and weakness about 45 min after I put the tab in, lasting for maybe 2 hrs. But the effects are so LSD it's not even worth writing anything to try and differentiate it.

LSZ is much better for me to be on in a public place. tripping at a bar, nightclub or a rave gets weird on LSD but its a little easier to handle on LSZ. its typically less of an introspective mind fuck and usually the visuals are a little lighter from my experience.

Did 300 mcg of LSZ recently. Very similar to LSD, almost indistinguishable, and maybe even more - to AL-LAD. 

More side effects on come-up then both, though, something with ears and swallowing. Come-up took 1.5 hours, first effects after 40 mins.

300mcg was very light trip for me, but I have extremely low sensitivity to all psychs.

I think this is great substance, feelings of wonder, party, happiness, afterglow in next days.

But I think I like  AL-LAD even more.

Get it while it is still legal in most places.

Also, orgasm on LSZ is something very wonderful. It's like colored shards of happiness everywhere,  you just smile, and you are feeling great.

In response to the question of the "lysergic feel", I found both 150mcg of Al LAD and LSZ to have very obvious lysergic similarities to LSD.  By comparison, they do not feel like a phenethylamine or tryptamine.  In fact, I would say that only Al LAD had noticeable differences at this dosage - similar feel, but clearly distinct, and it seems that the distinctions are a little different from person to person (The one time I tried it, I found it to be less kaleidoscopic and visual, but also to be kinda easy-going and pleasant, despite the sharper/shorter peak).  

One night about a month ago, I tried 150mcg of LSZ and my fiancee (less inclined to try new things until I've tested the waters) ate 100mcg LSD, and we were pretty much in the exact same zone.  If someone had told me I'd eaten 100mcg hit of LSD, I would have believed them, and I've eaten LSD hundreds of times.  As someone else mentioned, the only benefit of LSZ over LSD is the legality, and perhaps the dosage regularity.  Maybe they become more distinct at a higher dosage, but at the standard "one hit" level, 150 mcg LSZ and 100 mcg LSD were very very similar to me.

This is all very interesting. I found an apparently extremely reliable site selling LSZ and AL-LAD but unfortunately, while prices are decent, they are in Euros, with the (again) dwindling Canadian dollar I'd get screwed buying some of these pre-laid blotter. And I still can get LSD sheets whenever I want for about the same prices, well whenever I want, it is easy as hell to get the same old print circulating in Canada since a decade+ (multiple logos of punk rock bands, cartoon characters, tim leary, sid vicious and other funny/weird drawings per blotter) that come in either red on white, blue on white and green on white 1/4 inch x 1/4 inch hits. They are very good when obtained at the "i only sell sheets buddy" level, but when some random punk / skater and now from the identity-less younger generation, they will be degraded by poor manipulation, storage etc.


I think this print is made in Quebec only but the actual LSD comes from BC. Which is why we are flooded by those hits during the winter, and when everyone feels like tripping (summer), it starts becoming extremely scarce. At least this same cycle happened from the early 2000's to around 2008 when I last did those  hits.


Anyways...those LSD and AL-LAD providers could be original...I have never seen windowpane/geltab hits in my life and only saw orange Microdots in 1999 when the local market was flooded with orange dots with LSD and red Nexus (2c-B) pills. I only had 2c-b then cos I knew it didn't last long so I never had a microdot cos I was still pretty scared of drugs back then.


In retrospect I should have stayed. This one random hit I took that didn't have the so ever present design of blotter print sometimes in late 2002 (they were playing card symbols hits...quite the gamble indeed), was a DOB hit, was fun for maybe 5-6 hours, the remaing 20 to 22 hours were just anxiety and hell. I know they were DOB, because they certainly weren't DOM, and other DOx weren't sold online then still. But lots of reports on the internet from police seizures trying to cause hysteria (kinda warranted, as it was sold as "acid" but wasn't) were appearing in the media in those days reporting DOB blotters in Canada and Australia in particular. This DOB hit hurt me mentally for 3 years certainly, causing a lot of psychosomatic "pain" and now i'm just another guy on suboxone...with actual pain issues that are really undertreated by the crappy painkiller suboxone is. But this isn't the drug biography thread so I'll stop now. The etaqualone and valium are making me want to talk and talk and talk ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Ive gotten a good offer on 50hits of al-lad and or lsz.


Any reason why i should not take 25 of each?


Im putting them in the freezer for future research well packed except 5 of each that i will indulge in a few trials with friends.

I'm a bit aghast that LSz hasn't done better in relation to Al-Lad, to be honest. Maybe the market it just spoiled, with two legal lysergamides appearing in the same year. 


My advice would be to go for it, but other people might suggest you got 80/20 Al-Lad/LSz. Some people just don't seem to like LSz...

Is all the LSZ coming out of the same distribution center/country? I have reason to believe the he isn't that synthed LSZ and AL-LAD resides in a particular country, and the chemist are one in the same.

That my friend, is a very long & unresolved discussion...


Some people believe there to be multiple labs in Europe alone supplying these drugs. Others that they're from China. I am one of those who believes both of these are being sourced from one, single lab. I suspect it would be in Europe because if the technology & know-how to produce this shit in quality & qauntity for sale existed in China, there'd be BUCKETS of the stuff going round... & that is certainly not the case...


... yet.

I only ask select questions. And am rewarded with information about the distribution.

The only thing stopping me from getting a sheet of LSZ is my respect for LSD.

How is sex on LSZ? I'm not noticing much mention about it (nor with al-lad), so wondering if these new ergoloids (do we call them ergoloids?) are less sexy than LSD.

Sorry but that's just bullshit. Back not so long ago I would even order RC's from the US. I even ordered a huge bottle of pure DXM and DPT right before 911, it took a long time to arrive due to the anthrax bullshit but it came in, unopened. You seem like you might just be a LEO trying to discourage lurkers if I push it a little.


Also all those complaints of tremors...lol. I had bad trips with LSD, and so did my friends, never did we have any tremors of any kind. This isn't amphetamine. 


Seriously you can't just fuck around ordering something that might just be LSD to some retarded cops, and be scared of ordering some little bottle of a supplement. What if they open it ? They'll realize it's nothing. Canadian customs aren't trouble at all, the only problem is that they are slow, just like the postal service.

The same applies to LSD still since the Pickard (be thankful, he invented that LSZ skinner wasn't happy with), never much if any busts of large quantities of LSD since then. I remember one guy in my province got caught with beautiful artsy blotter in the quantity of 1000+ around 2004 but that was it. I don't follow the drug busts thread anymore, if it even exists still.

There should be no need. Lysergamides like these are readily absorbed fundally / you can take them sublingually or orally and it should be plenty potent - high bioavailability. Hey I've plugged stuff before and it is probably fine with this one, but if there is no advantage to it, there is no reason to do it unless you like corpus alienus i.e. sticking things up your bum in which case there are many more options like vaulting poles or certain kinds of tax return forms.

The Rolling Stones article + testimony from Neurocunt girl. The Rolling Stones article is huge and old but still easy to find online. I think someone pasted it in a post over at the shroomery.


Here's what Neurorape Girl said in her Vice interview (from another site, it is verbatim) :


[http://countyourculture.com/2011/12/01/non-lsd-ergoloids/](http://countyourculture.com/2011/12/01/non-lsd-ergoloids/)


    There were other novel substances as well. Leonard [Pickard] made a new LSD analog called “diazedine,” though I don’t know exactly what that was either.


    Are you familiar with lysergic acid 2,4-dimethylazetidide?*


    No, but they were calling this diazedine. It was also crazy, but nothing earth-shattering. Leonard [Pickard] gave it to Todd [Skinner] in a bottle of Everclear for testing, and we would dose a capful at a time. Apparently, diazedine failed to be doable on a large scale because the production costs were too high and the yields too low. Diazedine caused a lot of stress between Todd and Leonard, because they had high expectations for it as an LSD alternative.


    *Lysergic acid 2,4-dimethylazetidide (aka LSZ) belongs to a very small group of serotonergic psychedelics that surpass LSD in potency. Aside from the fact that “diazedine” is a lexical clipping of dimethylazetidine (diazedine<dimethylazetidine), the first paper describing the chemistry and pharmacology of LSZ came out of a laboratory at Purdue University, where Leonard had previously studied under the renowned chemist David Nichols. Though the paper was published after Leonard’s arrest, it is still quite likely he was aware of the preliminary research. When I asked Dr. Nichols whether he thought Pickard may have produced LSZ, he replied, “Leonard knew of our work, of that I am certain.” Rumors of LSZ distributed on blotter paper (purportedly under the name λ) have circulated for years, though there are few confirmed reports of its existence. Of course, the name diazedine is ambiguous and could be referring to just about anything, but I would bet a kilo of benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate that LSZ and diazedine are one and the same.

Tried one blotter ( 150 ug ), was pleasantly suprised about it.

I liked the wohle trip , it feels just as pleasant as LSD , 

i was just smiling all day long .


But at this dosage ( at least for me ) are nearly zero visual at all , 

some minor movement in my vision if I look on walls and things like that.


I wanteds to try 2 blotters this weekend , should I wait another week to get my tolerance to zero ? 

Or should it be okay , I dont want such a light trip this time.


Anyone of you guy tried LSZ with some MXE and MDMA ? 

Im courious bout this combo.

The isomers each appear to display very different binding properties. Discrimination studies showed the SS isomer to be most potent in animal models. This doesn't guarantee similar effects in humans. The ratio of 5ht1a and 5ht2a appears to change the subjective character of psychedelics in humans. The ratio in LSD is ~ 1 to 3 (1) and in SS-LSZ ~ 1 to 16 (1). SS-LSZ appears to show significant selectivity for 5ht1a over 5ht2a as compared to LSD.


I don't have direct experience with any LSZ isomer. My concern based on the data and experience is that the effects might greatly differ from LSD. Someone inexperienced might misinterpret the information available on LSZ, manage to obtain isometrically pure SS-LSZ , and distribute the chemical. The SS-LSZ would field test as LSD and could cause destructive consequences to the people who unwittingly consume the chemical thinking they received LSD.


The overall effects of psychedelics are dependent upon many variables. The only true test would be a human assessment. SS-LSZ might have very different effects than LSD. My goal is to emphasize the uncertainty and resultant risk with LSZ.

as far as I know all the LSZ currently on the market (or at least all that comes on the blotters with lsz printed on them) is the same isomer and does not test positive for lsd (back in september the police took a few blotters for me and tested them in their lab, they couldn't confirm it's 100% lsz because they didn't have a sample to compare, but it was definitely a lysergamide and not lsd... actually I think those were the first lsz blotters tested by the police anywhere in the eu)

That might be true. I don't know how someone could confirm every blotter with this design contained the same thing, even if they were the person laying the print. Could there be counterfeit prints circulating? There has been at least one counterfeit Hoffman print. (1) I have always presumed people laying blotter copy each others prints or use W.O.W. in order to obfuscate origin and mask distribution network even if they are laying LSD.

I am unfamiliar with the Bunk Police. If they confirmed isometric purity I deduce they were using something more sophisticated than a reagent field test or black light. I couldn't find any published results on their website. Did they explain how they tested the sample?

I meant the real police they had a warrant to search my apartment, found a few LSZ blotters, sent them to their lab to be tested, lab said it's a lysergamide, not lsd, and may well be lsz (couldn't confirm the last part 100% because they had no samples at the time).

Likely there is some.  All psychedelics are cross-tolerant to some degree.  However I would expect the cross-tolerance to not be too severe, as it would be, say, between AMT and MDMA (both releasers and entactogens).

had a very comfortable Monday night with 1/2 blotter (75 mics) LSZ - compared to recent tests with 25-i-nboh, it is much more awakened and less tweaky, superior overall like great bouillabaisse in moonlight compared to fish and chips in a tight drum.

As a general rule of thumb, drugs which share effects will exhibit cross-tolerance of those effects.

Big cross tolerance there must be between aMT and LSZ. I started with 1½ blotter earlier (6 hours ago??), now ate my last one I had. Not much had happen, last I tried it, it blew my mind away on 1 single blotter. Weird.

I usually need 3 or 4 days for LSZ to work again but I only use half blotters, and probably would have used half the AMT you had too.

oh well

you probably need a full week or more for your dose to dissipate and let a good redosing happen

I remember reading somewhere along the way that LSZ is possibly more active when taken orally (swallowed) than bucally (gummed). I've always taken LSD bucally, because I assumed it was more efficient that way, but wondering if that was all a myth, and if the reverse might even be true for LSZ? Thoughts?

Realistically or in an ideal world where someone is prepared to fund whichever crazy experiment I think up of?


First is probably a wash, maybe you could try eating a huge meal and then a tab to see if the effects take longer to begin and/or are longer but less intense. Repeat many times with many people.


Second the same + measure the blood level of each of the substances every 15 min.

I would always recommend chewing and then swallowing within 30s to rule out 25X-NBOMe. Ergoloids have a very high oral bioavailability so buccal administration is totally unnecessary, *if* it is more effective.

I swallowed a blotter tab of this whole yesterday, no chewing. I wish I had chewed it a bit first cause the blotter got stuck in my throat on the way down, took about 15 minutes of swallowing to get it to go all the way down, a bit uncomfortable ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)


I'd concur that LSZ is pretty damn close to LSD. I feel like it's slightly different, but I can't say how, and I think I'd have to do it a few more times before I'd be able to put my finger on what's different about it. I wouldn't be able to tell the difference in a blind test. Dropped 150ug at 4:30pm, by 2am was still a bit too wide awake to sleep, drifted off by about 2:30am, so it seems about a 10hr commitment for me. Woke up in the middle of the night feeling a little bit trippy still. Next day, feeling focused and afterglow effects. I like it.

My friend and I plan to take 375ug (2.5 tabs) of LSZ each next week. We're also going to smoke 5F-AKB-48 during the trip, my favourite 3rd gen synthnoid. In my experience, smoking synthnoids/weed alleviates the side effects of any psychoactive drug that I take, so I'm hoping that nausea and tension will not be a problem for us. I shall report back the experience eventually.


I should mention that the last drug I took was a medium dose of bk-2c-b, over a month ago, and before that it'd been many months of not tripping. So I expect my tolerance to be pretty low. Also, I haven't smoked synthnoids for over a month, but this was after a very heavy binge, so I'm expecting mild to moderate tolerance to them.

You shouldn't experience any significant tolerance.  Also I think smoking cannabinoids on it is a good idea, however I haven't really heard of people complaining about nausea from LSZ... people say it's very similar to LSD, to the extent that it would be hard to tell apart in a double blind test.

I'm very much looking forward to this. I've been eagerly awaiting a legal psychedelic that one could possibly dose as high as one could dose with LSD and be relatively unharmed. I have taken 1500ug (1.5mg) of LSD before and had an immense trip, and only slight body tension during the come up which turned into an ecstatic body high, that felt like my skin was conducting lightning.


Of course, I'm going to work my way up and not dose anywhere near that high straight away. I'm under the impression that AL-LAD is more "benign" than LSZ, in this sense that I am looking for. Has anyone tried both at doses of 300ug+?

It would indeed be lovely to have a legal  lysergamide that makes for good fuel for high-powered high-dose trips to the psych ward^W^W^W^W, but I fear that LSZ may not be It.


450ug was too much for me in terms of bodyload. I had a queasy feeling in just about every part of my body I cared to focus my attention on. I'm pretty sure I could have found something wrong with my toes had I wanted to. There was also nausea - to put it in scientific terms, I don't often find myself hunched over the toilet, dry heaving in the hope that I can expel the cause of my stomach upset, but that's exactly what I did that day, and the wicked LSZ wouldn't even let me have that small victory, opting instead to keep me in the "feeling sick" mode for a couple more hours. 


Add on top of that a headache and an overall feeling of muscle  stiffness in the entire body, and it's not something I'd care to go through again. Which is a shame, because LSZ is an intriguing drug.


For what it's worth, I felt fine on 300ug. It was in fact very nice.


I concur that AL-LAD is more benign, and might just be the one for adventures north of a milligram.


By the way - if you google a little bit, you may come across some high-dose LSZ reports, including a 1mg LSZ trip report, which did not go very well for the reporting fella. I'd paste the link here, except I'm not sure if linking to the infamous D.F. website is considered kosher on Bluelight. Just google for *"Next I threw up into the bin next to me, the world was now a spiraling coloured mess every time i opened my eyes."* :D

Oh dear! It's the bodyload that makes me feel that the NBOMe's would be dangerous (B, C, D and I - NBOMe) past a few mgs. 3mg of 25D was too uncomfortable for me.


I'll still give this a go, of course, and try AL-LAD some time in the future.


I think that when you *genuinely* can't distinguish OEVs to CEVs is when the trip is *really* something special. I've only experienced with LSD so far! Yet to try DMT though...

Got my hands on a 150ug blotter of this and will be trying it some time soon. I'll report back when I do.


I have a rather prying question though - how comfortable does ones body feel on LSZ? On 2C-X for example I do not feel comfortable just sitting or laying down usually, and have to be doing things, on 2C-B its hit or miss, but on LSD itself I feel so comfortable whatever position I'm in that I can just lay in bed staring at the ceiling and feel amazing enjoying the CEVs.


I'd kinda like to do just that with LSZ and go for an introspective trip but I'm concerned as some mentioned nausea/body-load.

After reading this thread, I'm under the impression that 150ug is unlikely to make you uncomfortable. I can't comment from experience, though.

I took a 150mcg blotter of this the other day. I had taken a blotter of 25c nboh about 3 days before, but I had a few of these and I was very curious about tolerance, and about the drug in general.


To sum up a long and strange trip report, I either didn't experience any real cross tolerance, or lsz is some powerful stuff. It took about 2 hours to do anything really interesting, a bit sedating at first, but once it hit me, it was like my first lsd trip all over again. This stuff is like the creeper weed of LSD, you start thinking you just got a bunch of crap then suddenly, you're toast lol.


The sky grew closer to me, and took on a red/golden hue. Everything was beautiful. I was fully separated mentally from my body. I had an incredible body buzz going. Nearly lost my ego. It kept getting stronger over the course of the next 4 hours too. By the end of it minutes were passing by so slowly it was like I could shovel the entire backyard, workout, have a smoke, eat, and poop and 2 minutes would pass. Crazy shit. The peak was very very much like acid. No real negative effects to report other than a general sedated feeling that I generally dont get from acid. 10/10 will buy again. In quantity.

Idk about 25c-nboh after lsz, but 3 or 4 days after 300ug lsz, 25c-nboh did just about nothing for me.

clearly the same receptors are involved and 300mics lsz is a strong receptor impact. so 4 days wont replenish receptivity

Better late than never: I finally sampled a full 150 µg blotter that had been sitting in a drawer for months.


Previous commenters here weren't joking when they said there was no visuals. No morphing, no CEV. But an incredibly useful mindfuck.

I am very happy I managed to get myself to do what I actually had planned to do during the trip: read a fascinating a book on spacetime physics. Usually reading while tripping is problematic when the letters morph around before your eyes. Not a problem here!


It's all I did for hours and hours, and it brought me some incredible insights.


So yeah, I loved it. It was more mental and serious than AL-LAD, or even LSD. And my experiences with AL-LAD were a lot more visual and "less serious" (read: "more fun"!)

Interesting report ZFC. Did you find reading comprehension at all impaired on LSZ? Sounds like you had no troubles, but Sometimes I find it difficult to read on PDs, because of distractibility, or getting too deep into analyzing the meaning of words and phrases etc. So what was your experience like wrt this?

Well reading per se was not at all impaired, neither was comprehension. But I did find myself reading a paragraph, and then hanging there *thinking about it* and all its fascinating implications for 20 minutes (I don't call that being distracted). So I wouldn't say I was reading faster, I was actually reading slower, but this is because of all the fascinating insights caused by the reading.

Has anyone taken 150ug LSZ soon after taking AL-LAD and experienced little/no tolerance? I experience little tolerance dosing LSD fairly often (I did it every few days 6x once) to the euphoria or headspace but the visuals were greatly reduced. Is this the same case here and how long would you recommend waiting?


I'm normally patient but I'm itching to try LSZ since I don't like having myself a stash anymore and don't want to build up a collection like I once did. I also have 2mg of 25D-NBOMe to try and that'll be tried last for obvious reasons.


Personally I'm hoping for PRO-LAD and ETH-LAD to appear after hhow wonderful I found Ethyl and Propyl (and Propoxy) psychedelics - bad thing to go on but eh.

How soon do you mean by soon? I've taken 150ug LSZ just as the AL-LAD was wearing off and the trip continued like normal. If by soon you mean take al-lad, trip ends, you sleep, take lsz - that never worked for me.

apparently lsz can be visual!


i say this because my previous trial at the same dose (150ug) were all devoid of anything visual except a bit of wavy ness to things... and no CEVs at all.


not so when in combos. LSZ taken after 3h from dropping ~0,75 mg DOC made everything very visual indeed. neither chem on its own would have given me the amount of visuals i had. heck it was about the same level as allad in this regard... still a pretty nice chem to have around.


@JG if you want to experience the full spectrum and power of a chem you already know the answer to your question... meaning you have to wait a while to be sure you get 100% effects. otherwise you can go ahead and trip a bit im sure but you ll keep having the impression that perhaps it wouldve been better had you waited a bit longer ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

It's always visual for me... not very visual and not the best visuals like 4-ho-met or al-lad or 2c-e or something, but there's some visuals (talking about 150ug and 300ug).

Please use this thread to discuss LSZ's effects, pharmacology, and availability (within the PD guidelines). Allowing this to become a social thread or a lysergamides thread makes it challenging to research a compound from the thread.

**Edit:** TL;DR is at the bottom


Well three, maybe four (it sure feels like two sets of two blotters inside the vacuum pack but I don't want to break the seal until I'm gonna drop it due to concerns of it breaking down faster than normal acid or AL-LAD, which the vendors seem to suggest on things like SOS) 150ug tabs made their way to me in the post today and I'll probably be dropping two of them mid afternoon on Friday. This thread seems to be rife with heavily mixed reports although some seem to be from people wanting the perfect psychedelic experience then being disappointed due to things like nausea or body load. I really hope I get at least something of a visual experience as the previous 'acid' I had were two purple microdots which seemed to cumulatively be only a threshold dose (probably due to me swallowing what was likely a NBOMe).

If they seem to be weak after +2h I'll probably up my dose to 375/450 and see where I get from there, though only if I'm in a position where I won't inadvertently wreak havoc on all around me or freak out uncontrollably.

I'll try and keep a notepad on hand so I can write up a blow-by-blow report for you guys since LSZ receives much less coverage than AL-LAD and the reports seem to be heavily conflicting.

Just for the record the blotters are in a silver vacuum sealed packet (labeled with the full molecular name, a picture of the molecule and it's CAS number) which is currently being stored in my freezer so the only time the molecule could have degraded is when it was in transit to me, which according to when I got an 'item shipped' email would have been two days, but the possibility of a fourth tab hints that they may have forgotten to send the letter (first class post always arrives next day in ~95% of cases), depending on how the vendors store their product before shipping I hope to be getting a minimally degraded sample.


If the experience turns out to be shit and I still have some Z left over, I'll order some AL-LAD this week and do a trip report on a dual 300mcg dose the following Friday. If the experience turns out well I'll be happy that a second legal ergoloid can be added to my arsenal, which seems to be the way to go since the acid scene has gotten a little too much "Make profit, fuck customers over, pass off cheaper, shittier chemicals as LSD" in any case I'll probably want to bring either Al or Lizzie with me to the Netherlands this summer, just in case I can't find good cid there.

Apologies if I'm rambling a bit, I tend to do that; expect many edits as well.


**TL;DR** - Got 3 (maybe four) 150ug blotters of LSZ in the post today, I'll drop a 300mcg dose mid afternoon on Friday and write up a comprehensive trip report, the LSZ is stored in a way to help slow degradation of the sample which should help give a more accurate report on Z's effects.

Don't think that'll work. I think that'll just extend duration. Could be wrong but fairly sure.

I agree with this completely. Start writing notes when you're coming down and you're in the reflection stage of the trip. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I'll type up details of my experience with 375mcg LSZ later today.

Would you prefer people write down their plans or flood bluelight with "I just took X is Y going to happen to me now" threads? Writing down one's plans allows others to make suggestions as to possible alterations to that plan, like the two people below you. Encouraging people to post their plans also helps people who are less experienced not have a terrible experience, or in cases of other more dangerous drugs; end up dead. I'd say that making plans and letting others know about them is a good harm reductionist strategy, you can't change things once you've already taken the drug, so giving a day or two's notice, especially when it's your very first time trying a new and novel drug should be promoted heavily.

I've always enjoyed running around with a notepad jotting down notes in the first person while on acid, though you may well be right as it does seem to act as somewhat of an anchor and keep you from breaking into that really trippy headphase, so I may well just jot down notes toward the end of this trip. As for redosing at 2h not adding to the intensity, you may be correct; I guess I'll stick with 300 and if that fails try 150 Z and 150 AL-AD then write that up the following week.

You're right, it's a good chance for the community to review and steer people away from any bad plans. I was probably feeling a bit grumpy when I posted that. But still I think if you are unsure of your dosage, you should pose it as a question to BL, otherwise it just comes off like rambling about your next trip.. which is cluttering.

Trip report 150 ug LSZ blotter (LSZ marked on one side, molecule print on reverse)


Experience level - Low to high doses of LSD. Low to moderate doses Mescaline. Low to high doses psilocybin. Minimal experience with RCs. Very sensitive to psychedelics. 100- 120 UG LSD is enough for ego dissolution but have dosed as high as 500-700 ug. Most I have taken of psilocybin was just over two grams extremely potent "penis envy" strain. Resulted in full blown mystical experience and several year long after glow. Basically I feel that I am sensitive to psychedelics because many of my peers require more to get to the same place as I.


T-00 One third blotter is placed in mouth and lightly chewed (I figured, if allegedly "more potent than LSD" I should have felt more than threshold effects @ 50ug and decided to test this theory whilst getting my feet wet so to speak ). My partner in Crime, "S" decided to start with the same method of administration at 75ug. The taste was slightly bitter, exactly how normal LSD blotter taste to me, slightly bitter and metallic.


T-15 Im sensitive to tryptamines and ergolines, in fact Im sensitive to any shift in body sensations brought on by compounds so at this point I definatly felt off baseline, a general stimulation and mood lift not unlike what one would feel from a few espressos.


T-30 I and S decide to walk to the liquor store and pick up some beers to drink throughout the evening. Definatly feeling effects now. Frame like vision, laughter and humor comes easier, lights off of the cars are more noticeable. When we arrive at the store, upon entering I notice the effect I get with most psychs; dark to light environment is difficult for my eyes to adjust to. I notice that my whole visual field has that familiar "electric" overlay. Everything has that glow to it. I thought to myself "wow, at 50ug this seems very promising". At this point S is unsure if he feels anything.


T-45 We are back at the house and we make a fire in the front yard. I feel as though the LSZ is leveling off, but decide to give it another 15 minutes before titrating up. S says "fuck it" and eats his other half, now at 150ug , expressing hes not feeling much. 


T-1:00 Administer another 50ug of my blotter now totaling at 100ug. And go back outside to the fire and crack a beer with S, some caual conversation begins and I notice some pretty extreme time dilation and colors become rather interesting. S grabs some glowsticks to fuck around with tracers. There appeared to be some weak tracers and I was beginning to wonder if this stuff was going to take off soon or not. 


T-2:00 - 3:00 All effects previously noted are now more pronounced but nothing "magical" is happening in regards to headspace or visuals. My visual field appeared more interesting and time dilation felt rather extreme, although this could be due to the fact that we were "waiting" for something to happen. More casual conversation ensued, beers continued to crack open and the fire was glowing. Headspace became slightly difficult but was easy to manage. A bit of anxiety and worry infiltrated my thoughts. I began to think about my GF and the fights we were having lately. Along with this some uneasy body sensations crept up. Alhough this sort of thing happens co-morbidly for me when a headspace becomes uncomfortable. Im not sure which comes first the negative hedspace or body sensations. My visual field grows a little more interesting, I notice electric pinks and yellows mostly but NO OEV or CEV really develop from this. S is also feeling disappointed, as he says he feels something but its weak. 


T-3:15 S suggests we go to the bars and get around people, try and have some fun. Im not feeling social so Im trying to convince him to stay behind with me. Somehow we decide to part ways and I go to my room and take the final 50ug. Now Im on a total of 150 ug, but I feel that this is just dragging this "twighlight zone like" effect out. Just feeling caught in a limbo like state which never really takes off. 


T-3:45- 4:15 S leaves to the bar and at this point Im not really worried about and decide to occupy my time browsing the webs in my room. Headspace stays the same, visual effects still the same. 


T-5:00 - 7:00 I continue to browse the internet with no change in effect and Im getting rather bored so I just continue to increase my alcohol buzz with beer. Meanwhile S and I are texting back and forth. He reports feeling extreme time dilation and being extraordinarily social. He says hes having a very stimulating time with some distortion and morphing of objects in his peripheral but not much in regards to patterning OEVs/CEVs. He says its "ok" but nothing to write home about.


T-7:00 - 8:00 More or less baseline, at least headspace wise. Visual effects still present but weaker and less interesting. S claims hes still going but not really excited about the effects. He comes home and suggests we drop the 25c-nbome he had stashed away...he was really pushy about it but I resisted , as it was 3:00am.....finally I gave in.....but that is A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY FOR ANOTHER TIME :D


Conclusion. Even when taking threshold amounts of LSD I feel its "magic" so to speak. LSD felt more prominent in the visual department as opposed to LSZ headspace/time dilation. Im wondering if the LSZ was actually more around 100ug because the alleged 50ug felt nearly exactly about 20-30 ug of LSD. There is no doubt a "Lysergic feel" and it was clearly a cousin of LSD and had I taken it thinking it was LSD I wouldn't have argued. I don't know if it was due to the way I staggered my doses but this stuff felt as though it just draaaaagged. It could also be due to LSZ longer duration in come up, because when I stagger LSD doses this way I feel it increase in intensity with every titration. This wasn't the case with LSZ. It just felt like it lengthened the threshold effects. I also felt as though this stuff had more of a "sedating" effect similar to psilocybin and felt rather tryptamine like to me while still maintaining a strong lysergic headspace/body buzz. LSZ sort of left a bad taste in my mouth because had I taken a low-dose of LSD, I feel I would have still felt some "magic" and there probably would have been a little more going in the visual department. If I try LSZ again I will take a whole tab at once at very least and maybe this will give me a better feel for it but Im not too sure because S took his dose in two parts and he titrated to his total 150ug much sooner than I did and did not report very interesting effects. One last thing to note is that I never get bodyload from psychedelics exceptthe occasional anxiety/overexcitement and that no exception to LSZ. Little to no body load reported from S or I.  All in all, I feel as of now that LSZ is less interesting than LSD. Thanks for reading.

Thanks for sharing a detailed report. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I am willing to bet a large sum of money that your experience would have been significantly stronger and different had you taken it all at once, or taken 100ug at first and then a 50ug redose.  Tolerance to psychedelics develops very quickly, so staggering doses is a good way to make the effects substantially stronger.  I find that unless I redose substantially larger than the original dose, beyond the an short initial time period, the nature of the first dose will dominate the rest of the trip.

YOu are probably correct in your assumption , especially with this compound in particular, as I seemed to develop a more rapid tolerance than with LSD. As I stated Ive done this with LSD before and titration resulted in rapid increase of effects , even if the doses weren't any larger than the initial. I think this may be due to slower onset of LSZ...it was toooooo sloooow to be interesting.


But you are right I will try it again in the method that you mention. Have you tried Al-LAD? Do you like one more than the other?

I haven't tried LSZ or AL-LAD actually.  I am surprised you are able to increase the effects so easily with LSD too, honestly.  I have never had much luck with that method and psychedelics.

It works great with mushrooms too....It depends in my mood, if I want trip in a social setting and want to take the edge off I stagger my doses and it doesn't hit me as hard and is more of a gradual come up....I do this within the first few hours of either lsd or psilocybin with success but waiting much longer doesn't usually work as well

This has probably been asked before, but can anyone provide me with information about the stability of this stuff? Has a large amount of this stored in a drawer (in its original packaging), and won't be touching it for a few months. Is it at risk of degrading?


I will add that I stored 25 tabs of AL-LAD in their original packaging for months and months, and noticed no drop in potency...

No one knows for sure how stable it is yet. Compared to AL-LAD, I think it should in theory be a little bit more stables, so if you found the method worked fine for AL-LAD, should be fine for LSZ. Keep it in orig packaging, don't open it until you must, keep it out of any light, keep it cool, should be good.

Just got my LSZ, looking forward to my first psychedelic experience i've been wanting one for ages man. I'll be doing it in a common setting with a sitter and a few other mates. Can you can swallow it straight away and have maximum effects? or should I chew it / let it sit on my tounge for a while? Any recommended movies / shows / music I should get for the trip? Sticking to 150ug for the first time, will go up after if all goes well, or I will try to get ahold of some AL-LAD after. Hopefully the comeup anxiety isn't too much like i've experienced on MDMA.

You can swallow it right away, it's the recommended ROA these days, as a precaution against accidentally ingesting NBOMe. If you have the standard, mail-order LSZ blotter with LSZ printed on it, it should be fine though. I found the tabs were a bit big to go down smooth, so give it a quick chew, and down the hatch.


I recommend that you set aside some music you love beforehand so that it's ready to go, so you don't have to fuss whilst tripping. For movies, I think the sort of movies without dialogue are good, like Samsara, Manufactured Landscapes, Microcosmos etc.. although that's just a guess, I rarely want to sit down to watch a screen while tripping. 


I felt some mild anxiety during comeup of LSZ, maybe more like restlessness, nothing too much though.

just swallow it and that will rule out it being one of the nbxxx compounds and 150 should be more than enough for a first time. i would say have an empty tummy though as i have had this a few times and once straight after dinner and it was not as good as the other times. it seemed very weak and took quite a while before i felt anything...hope you have a good time

Don't want to scare you but psychedelic comeups can be pretty anxious.  If/when that happens, go outside or change the music or something - it passes quickly and then you'll feel GREAT!

I have similar problems, I always get the fear on the come-up. Staggering my dose & incremental dosing seems to help. My first MDMA dose was half a caps worth, I suspect they were strong though, maybe 175mg in a whole cap. From then on my doses have dropped & I rarely use more than 100mg in 4 doses these days.


Same goes for psyches. With a drug such as LSz, the duration makes it easy to peak without having to dose 150ug in one go. If I am really nervous, I'll do a quarter, followed an hour later by another quarter, saving the last half for until I'm 100% sure I'm ready to continue. If I'm a bit more confident probably two halves, or even 3/4 of a tab followd by a half tab or the same again later if I'm really in the mood! No matter what though, I almost always stagger my doses & if I don't, I often regret it. 


Bear in mind staggering the dose will stretch out an already medium length experience, & that an adrenergic tail end sometimes prevents sleep for a further couple hours at least.

a half is solid but mild.

I usually stagger mine too! Im still trying to find the perfect formula for staggering. Everytime I do it I get better at it. Mushrooms are one substance that I will always stagger....to lessen the inevitable uncomfortable peak. It always uncomfortable for me anyway. Al-lad I found to be a bit gentler on the psyche so I do see much of a need to stagger unless I dose very high

Took a tab tonight for my first psy, pretty dissapointed man.


Took  half the tab at 5:00pm, chewed for 10 minutes and swollowed. Took the  other half 30 mins later at 5:30. Noticed a bit of nausia and anxiety an  hour later and a really uncomfortable body feeling. By half 6 / 7 I  felt like I was stoned which was pretty good apart from my body feeling  heavy as fuck. For 2 hours food tasted better, music sounded better and  was laughing alot, not much euphoria or anything though just random  laughter. Constantly had this pretty horrible pain / feeling in my  stomach and tremors which ruined it. Like stomach cramping, some muscle  pain and sickness, had some dark chocolate and it seemed to ease about  10pm ish. Saw no visuals really apart from when I moved my phone  around in the dark and didn't focus on it I could see trails of the  screen. That was cool as fuck, but still not much compared to what I  expected. My thoughts were normal for the most part too, not much deep /  different thinking or anything.


So yeah, not what expected.  Will wait for the next batch of AL-LAD I reckon. Maybe 2 tabs would've  been needed for proper visuals and trip, but i'm not sure if I could  handle the side effects from 2.

From what I can tell, LSZ has more body load than AL-LAD and LSD both. Don't let it discourage you from other psychs, they're all very unique! You just gotta find what works for you.

Meh , dose curve response is steep....if you get a chance you may only need to take 1.5 tabs to reach a good level. Ive noticed body load is more noticeable with psychedelics at lower doses. For me anyway. I believe its several reasons. First because its a powerful mind altering substance which creates distorted awareness of you body. Partial distorted awareness can feel awkward , kind of like a state of limbo, if you will. second, if you are relating body load to feelings of queeziness and tension, psychedelics tend help you not totice at higher doses because you are focused on the good effects as opposed to the side effects. Just my opinion. I can see LSZ being more interesting at higher doses. you and I sort of dosed similarly but I staggered mine even more so I probably got even less pronounced effects but I did not find it uncomfortable in the slightest

Take it from me, increasing the dose of a substance doesn't usually decrease the side effect profile. Since we're talking anecdotes here, I've noticed higher levels of anxiety = higher body load for me.

In some cases, increasing the dose increases the actual effects enough to distract the tripper from body-load etc. In *some* cases!


Psychedelics are so unpredictable anyway, I'm not going to list every reason their effects vary so wildly, but I'm sure it would suffice to say that unless you really hate it or suffer some wierd reaction, you need to try varying doses & settings for a new psyche & there's no way you can judge new material after just one whirl. 


To make my point, I can assure you that a single tab of either Al-Lad or LSz, in one go, is considerably different in effect, to the best of my experience, to a single tab ingested in two seperate havles. 


Bear in mind also that the vendor who has brought these to market knows only that they are psychedelic compounds & not what possible dangerous side effects might appear at higher doses. It may cme to pass that these new psyches are better dosed at 200ug per tab rather than 150ug, but introducing new compounds at high doses is foolhardy at the least.

Yeah, definately going to wait for the next AL-LAD batch I don't fancy LSZ again really. Think i'll take 150ug and then 50 / 75 ug an hour or so later. From what i've read it's easier on the body.


I slept for 8 hours and can still see trails which is strange, thought the effects would have all gone by now. But they're only noticeable in the dark, isn't a big deal.

I have a few trip reports written up here.

[http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=219697](http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=219697)


I found alot of creativity and spirituality within this particular compound, around 1000 ug the come up was pretty intolerable but once i focused my energies and had a few bowls i was on top of the world with intense kaleido vision for at least 30-45 mins during the peak.

I think 750 ug isnt a very good dose for me as the body load stayed for longer and only induced a dreamy state with little visuals besides shape morphing.

Im sorry to hear it Jim0, Im sure it will subside with time, for some it takes a few years. I would be careful indulging in psychedelics for a bit if you are worried about the after effects getting worse.


All Im saying is it will probably subside in less time but it can last several years in some people . Cheers ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I would not make a big deal about this.

you are probably now noticing things that in the past you just ignored.

that is a very common side effect.

after a while, if these artifacts of normal vision become uninteresting to you you will not notice them any more again.

much of early childhood is learning what to track and react to.

I don't have much experience with lysergamides...do they cause  strong vasoconstriction like the NBOMEs ?

LSD and AL-LAD caused very little for me. LSZ did however. Weird combo of stimulation and vasoconstriction that led to some transient depression in my trial with LSZ.

not at all like that

nbomes are practically stimulants

heart races and nerves jangle in feedback a bit

that does not happen with LSZ

but all the ergot like drugs have a kind of vasoconstriction, and a kind of smooth muscle contraction - I think the original research was about abortifacients or something like that.

for me LSZ is very very gentle physically

cannabis is much stronger physically

Hi everybody, I posted in this thread several months ago about the possibility of the herb Kudzu being able to reduce the undesirable physical effects of LSZ. At that time I was unable to get Kudzu capsules where I live so I wasn't able to test it out then but I was recently able to get some so I did do the test. I took the "Kudzu challenge", as I called it since nobody had ever combined Kudzu and LSZ before, or at least not reported doing so in any forum. 


I took 2 capsules of Kudzu root, 613 mg each, and then immediately took 150 mcg LSZ (chewed the blotter a while and swallowed). What happened was that there were hardly any unpleasant effects at all, just slight stomach discomfort. Every other time I used LSZ I had quite unpleasant nausea and agitation for the first 3 hours or so. Now, I can't say that it was actually pleasant but it was only slightly UNpleasant, which is good for LSZ. It was like a low dose of LSD without the pleasurable physical aspects or pronounced visuals thereof. To me, LSD has an almost amphetamine-like body orgasm type quality and LSZ just doesn't have that for me. On the plus side there were only slight tremors whereas LSD has rather severe tremors in may case. 


My overall impression of the LSZ/Kudzu trip is that it was something to do but I wouldn't go out of my way to repeat it like I would with LSD. There is just no pleasurable reinforcing aspect to it that would compel me to repeat. The important thing, in regard to my experiment, is that the Kudzu did seem to have a positive effect but could not actually turn LSZ into LSD. Another thing I may try sometime is Curcumin, which is also supposed to be a 5-ht2c antagonist like Kudzu, which is why I thought Kudzu might cut the nausea etc in the first place. Kudzu on its own was insufficient to turn lead into gold, but it did make it considerably less leady, if you will. Kudzu is also reported to have 5-HT2a antagonism properties so that may actually have dulled the psychedelic effects of the LSZ somewhat. It didn't neutralize them though. It was still close to what I would expect from one blotter.

For me:

AL-LAD - no bad bodyload (nausea, vasoconstriction, ..)

LSD - maybe some really minor hints of it but really minor

LSZ - same as LSD, perhaps a tiny bit worse

Good to see you back, & with the results of your experiment! Pity it didn't pan out, I guess LSz just isn't for you. 


Do you smoke weed, tried that for nausea? Also, 150ug is a pretty conservative dose for anyone with experience tripping. If you've tripped more than 20 or 30 times, you should be pretty comfortable dosing twice that dose. In some cases with insensitive individuals the active dose needed is higher, & lower doses produce only body-load & other difficult physical or emotional phenomena. Before you give up on LSz altogether, might be worth trying a couple higher dose trips. Don't be shy to combine anti-nauseating compounds, provided you're doing so entirely safely of course. For instance, Lemon & Ginger tea, with a fat spliff as well as your Kudzu thingies, might help in combo like that.


Then agan, *if* you can get real acid, & you prefer it, might be worth keeping any LSz yo might have until you meet someone cool who's also dead eager to try it.

I did try two LSZ blotters once and I vomited. That's why I only used one for the Kudzu experiment but it did go smoothly enough that I probably could take 2 if I try it again. I have decided to just get real LSD for now though, since it's available at reasonable prices in certain online markets which of course I can't name. I don't think anything else is going to work as a substitute really. I tried a lot of different RC psychs from NBOMes to psilocybin derivatives to AL-LAD and LSZ and none of them were anywhere near real LSD for me. I actually threw all of them out recently except the LSZ. There was no way I was ever going to take another hit of NBOMe so why even keep it around? Same with the 2CE, 2CI, escaline, allylescaline, MET and 5 meo-DALT. All that stuff was piling up and I had an aversion to every one of them so I had to dump them. Not good having all that shit around anyway really.

Well, I finally tried LSZ. Myself and two friends (who we'll call G and M) went camping and each took 150 micrograms. We took our doses at 9:00PM, the blotter was held in our gums for approximately 15 minutes before being swallowed. What surprised me most was the duration of the come up. It took over two hours to really start tripping. About two and a half hours into the experience, I could tell we were peaking. Of the three of us, no one experienced any nausea or discomfort, nor was there vasoconstriction to any degree. Apart from the long and very gradual onset, we found it to be almost indistinguishable from LSD. This was M's first psychedelic experience, but G and I have done LSD dozens upon dozens of times. We both agreed that apart from onset and duration, it was almost an identical experience.


The major differences I was able to distinguish were:


***Duration:*** It took over two hours to begin feeling effects- far longer than any time that I've used LSD, whether in blotter or liquid form. Also, the peak seemed to last about 5 full hours and tapered off very gradually.


***Stimulation:*** It definitely seemed less stimulating than LSD usually is for me. Usually LSD is almost somewhat "speedy" for lack of a better word. Not in an amphetamine way, but I usually find it extremely energizing. LSZ however, was much more relaxed. I certainly would not have been able to fall asleep, but I wasn't overcome with an urge to run around like a lunatic either. So I guess I would sum it up as being neither stimulating nor sedating, but very comfortably in between.


Apart from that, it really seemed like any other LSD trip. Even the differences noted above could be written off as unique to that particular trip, as trips do vary wildly sometimes with LSD. I'll need to try it again several more times, as well as incrementally increasing dosage, to see if the noted differences continue to manifest or if any other differences become apparent. Also, I have to state that I think I find LSZ to be somewhat weaker in dosage than LSD. Either that or my LSD has always just been very strong (a possibility as I'm in California). I base this on the fact that 150 micrograms of LSZ seemed equivalent to one hit of good LSD, which I've always guessed was about 100 micrograms. But this is speculatory, as I have no way of knowing exactly what the dosage of my LSD blotter has been. 


Visually it was decent, but about in line with a trip from one good hit of LSD. Some very light patterning and everything definitely had that "LSD High Definition" look to it. The body high (or body load I suppose) seemed less intense than LSD which for some people may be nice, but I've always loved how my body feels on LSD. I'm sure more of a body high will manifest with higher dosage though.


In summary, it was great! Loved the experience, it was very *very* much like LSD. I will be trying this again soon, I'm just waiting long enough to ensure that my tolerance is back to normal.

Great report theacidtest. 


My single trial with LSZ agrees very much with all your observations. It was very much like LSD, but slower come up, and I would say less stimulating as well. Also, the potency was about the same as a typical acid tab that I assume to be 100ug.

No, I had only bought 3 AL-LADs and I used them all up long ago. I didn't like it though. One hit was like a very light acid trip with very slight visual effects and two was actually quite unpleasant with nasty tremors and general all over bad body feeling. The visuals were something like acid but not as enjoyable. It was like a bunch of squashed down acid visuals like my visual field was all a bunch of squarish areas filled with lines. It wasn't even pretty to look at like acid visuals are. 


Regarding the other stuff I chucked out, it could all gag a maggot. I got tired of looking at them so they all had to go, and by go I mean washing them down the sink.


 Regarding LSZ being almost indistinguishable from acid, as some people have commented, I didn't find that. I found that it had really weak visuals that were only very slightly acid-like. I could tell that I took a serotonergic substance but it was only vaguely similar to acid for me.

I edited out the quantities later, but yeah I did chuck out 7 grams of 2CE. It just had too much bodyload and I didn't even find it had good visuals. Basically it just made me feel like crap without even a decent visual payoff. Why ever torture myself with that again? I suppose I might have been able to sell it to somebody but just too much trouble really. Its only good point was the short duration. Nope, no more substituted PEAs for me, nor tryptamines. Those also cause too much nausea and other bodyload.


 Lysergamides are the only good psychs for me. Granted, they are a tryptamine of sorts, but not a crude tryptamine, a much more elaborated one which seems to make it much more refined in its effects. Why use crude compounds and get all kinds of nasty side effects when there's a much more advanced compound available? When you have steak available you don't really want to eat that soy burger anymore.


About LSZ, from what I've been reading in forums it looks like the trick to getting a good solid trip is to take fairly high doses, like 3 or more blotters. I haven't tried more than 2 since I got sick from that. I did eat some grapes right before the LSZ though, which may not have been a great idea.

My girlfriend and one of her friends tried LSZ last night based on my recommendation. As I stated a little bit ago in this thread, myself and an experienced friend suffered no ill effects and found it to be indistinguishable from LSD. My girlfriend and her friend, however, did not have nearly the same experience. She says she experienced:


*-Heavy pressure on thyroid area

*-*Cramps

**-Feverish

-Clenching jaw

-All around physically uncomfortable*​

I tried LSZ in various doses up to 450µg and never experienced unusual side-effects.


Those Pressure/Cramps you mentioned are common side-effects that Ergoloids are known to cause, which is usually and from experience with LSD/LSA/LSZ/AL-LAD, mostly dose-dependent. LSA for example, is infamous and worst in this regard! And 'feeling physically uncomfortable' is something that even Caffeine can cause, so that's absolutely nothing to blame the LSZ for.

I find this interesting, as my girlfriend has used LSD with none of the side effects that manifested during her LSZ experience. She's curious if some side effects could be gender related. She stated that the side effects were startlingly similar to the physical side effects of starting her birth control regimen a couple years ago, her female friend experienced identical effects. My test group who reported so positively were all male. I would be very interested to see a breakdown of side effects experienced based on the gender of the testers.


Also, her experience was rather short with a peak lasting only about an hour, despite the fact that she took 225 micrograms. My companions and I had a 10 hour experience with a five-six hour peak off of a 150 microgram dose.

She stated that the side effects were startlingly similar to the physical side effects of starting her birth control regimen a couple years ago, her female friend experienced identical effects. My test group who reported so positively were all male. I would be very interested to see a breakdown of side effects experienced based on the gender of the testers.

... it's very curious, but it is possible that these side effects are gender specific.


Are the girls aware that ergotomine, a chemical related to LSD, LSz & other ergoloid psychedelics, is used in childbirth & has been for centuries? If not, then their symptoms might be a correlative side-effect. If so, their symptoms might have been psychosomatic.


Equally, it could be an unexpected interraction with their birth control meds! Find out if they're on the same basic hormone pill or treatment.

I was thinking along the same lines regarding the cramping symptoms, because I thought that Ergotamine is used to induce labour. Perhaps LSZ has some crossover in this activity.


I'm not sure if I'm correct that Ergotamine is actually used to induce labour, just going on fuzzy memories here.

I think it used to be, back in the middle ages, but these days refined, synthetic, easier dosed variants probably exist. Perhaps much like yourself, perp, midwifery is not something I can claim to have specialised knowledge of.

My girlfriend and her companion were unaware of ergoloid's role in childbirth, so we can rule out the psychosomatic angle. Also, I inquired just now and my girlfriend's companion was using no birth control of any type, so I don't think it could be any sort of interaction between medications. She's going to try it one more time just to see if it's unpleasant effects are consistent for her. I have another female friend who is interested in trying it, I'll see if she wants to guinea pig my gender related effects theory (I'll warn her of course).

Good to hear. I just find the wide variance in effects very strange. Everyone I've ever known who used LSD tolerated it very well, for myself and two friends who tested LSZ we found it to be almost indistinguishable. I'm somewhat disappointed, as my girlfriend was pretty excited about a legal (kind of) substitute for LSD. I'll be testing LSZ quite a bit more, so far 150 micrograms was incredibly enjoyable. I'm not sure if my next dose will be 225 or if I want to go all out and push it to 300 mics.

The particulars of these side effects are odd, & concerning, but I'm not surprised by the variation in the effects of any psychedelic. They're all quite capable of producing both heavenly & hellish effects, often within the same trip.


Whatever the reason for it, it still may well have been a one-off. Let's hope so ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

LSZ effects can vary rather widely from one person to another, from what I've read so far. Some get no bodyload at all while others get rather severe bodyload, including nausea or even vomiting. Some get good visuals and others get very little.

Holy Cow, you tripped 10hrs with just 150µg. Even with those 450µg i mentioned (also the most enjoyable experience with LSZ so far), the experience lasted not that long, but yeah, things like this are different from one person to another and are influenced by many factors like body composition, weight, metabolism - to name just a few. Another thing that many people really underestimate is, that our brain is a very powerful machinery which, especially in certain exceptional situations, can do things to us or to be precise, our perception, that we never ever dreamt of - just a reminder: 'feeling physically uncomfortable' and the much more important fact, that one of the most potent Psychedelics ever invented was involved - i mean this makes everything possible, you know what i wanna say? But that's just speculation and another point of view, so pls don't take this as an offense that i don't believe in what you told us happened to your girlfriend.

No, I understand but I still find it strange. Then again, a lot of people on bluelight seem to report unpleasant body sensations from LSD which I find absolutely baffling. Bear in mind, she didn't have a bad trip per se and did enjoy the mental effects, but was extremely uncomfortable due to the body load and didn't feel that it resembled LSD very closely. Set and setting were both good as well: at home, with a close friend, intending and expecting to thoroughly enjoy themselves. She's going to try it again at a dose of 150 micrograms though, so I'll report back how that goes for her.


I'm still undecided if I want to test the waters again at 150 micrograms or if I want to bump the dose up by another 50% or 100%. I found that LSZ agreed with me quite well, with no hint of body load. This gives me a lot of confidence in trying a higher dose, but we'll see. I have a pretty decent stash to play with and I plan on exploring this chemical quite extensively. I'm just bummed that I hesitated on AL-LAD and now my vendor is out of stock.

I'm quite certain Al will make a return soon enough!


I'm one of those with the body-loaded LSD trips, I'm afraid. I can count only one or two, of the 30 or 40 trips I took back in the 90's that were truly free of body-load, nausea or some kind of annoying physical discomfort. Those two were bloody good trips though ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) 


I've had some very tricky moments, both back in the day on LSD or in recent years on some new psychedelic, but fortunately I cannot confess to ever having a tuly bad trip, from start to finish.

Even though many ppl prefer AL-LAD, in my experience with both and many trials and giving AL-LAD some fair chances to convince me, i still say that LSZ is the one to try, beautiful lovely, totally unique while also being reminiscent of LSD, even though this one is the best (well ok, 4-AcO-DMT is also a Gem that no one should miss!).

Tomorrow night the same two friends and I will be conducting our second trial with LSZ. The first time we each took 1 blotter of 150 micrograms and had a great time and experienced absolutely no body load whatsoever. We're thinking tomorrow night we'll bump it up to 225 micrograms (1 1/2 blotters). 


Does anyone have any advice on the best times to dose? We're thinking of taking 150 micrograms, then consuming the additional 75 micrograms around 30-45 minutes later.

I'd dose it all at the same time, otherwise it's possible that immediate tolerance caused from the 1st dose may hinder the 2nd dose.

That may be the case but I would not expect this "tachyphylaxis" to be so pronounced. I would be quite happy recommending staggered dosing to avoid side effects, especially if you haven't tripped much before.

Avoiding side effects is the main idea behind staggering the dosage for us. However, I certainly don't want to waste the second dose. Myself and one of my companions are extremely experienced trippers (dozens of times with LSD), but for our third companion it's only his second psychedelic experience ever.

Me and friends tried LSZ yesterday, and what a wonderful drug! We took 75µg each, and this was enough to give us a very joyful night time at the park!

It made us feel so relaxed, with a very pleasant body high. We also laughed our asses off, just like children.

Despite the relatively low dose, it exceeded expectations. 

- At this dose I, couldn't distinguish the effects from LSD (its been a long time since I took LSD for the last time, however).

- We all could eat at the peak of the effects! And we did, and the food tasted great! Thats very, very unusual for me. I have taken lots of different kinds of substances and all of them took my hunger away, but not LSZ. The same for my friends.

- The only bad effect I got was some neck/shoulder pain. However I wouldn't associate it to the drug if I hadn't read reports here in BL about the drug giving neck tension. It wasn't so bad anyway, and the pain went away as soon as I plateaued and got into a more relaxed state. So I concluded the drugs wasn't causing pains per se, but my own anxiety/tension. One other friend described a similar feeling.


Overall a very nice and gentle drug, at least in smaller dose. I don't know when but I will certainly try a bigger dosage.

IMO it`s definitely worth stocking this one up!

2nd experience with LSZ:


I took 225 micrograms along with three other people consuming the same dose. 2 of us experienced no unpleasant side effects, the other 2 had a general feeling of discomfort during the come up; this feeling subsided as the the experience peaked. The onset was very slow, much like the first time. This time it took 1 1/2 hours to feel effects, compared to 2 full hours when we each consumed 150 micrograms.


Otherwise the experience was much the same as the first. Very similar to LSD, though having done some amazing liquid LSD recently I think I can definitely tell the experiences apart. It was visual in a sort of mild acid way, certainly less visual than 225 mics of LSD would have been. The body high was definitely more strongly apparent, though less intense and less "pushy" than it is with LSD. Music appreciation was greatly enhanced, we spent a great deal of time watching a Les Claypool DVD and also were pretty blown away listening to Dark Side of The Moon.


All in all, quite pleasant and we'll definitely be pushing the dose higher next time.

75 ug the day after a roll on the 2-fma/5-mapb/tryptamine combo + using Xanax to sleep had very light effects.  A slight sparkle if I paid attention to it, energy, and a huge laughing-crying fit after smoking cannabis.  


A friend who has Bipolar II and is taking Lamotrigine had a full-on trip on 75 ug and ran around "on a journey" all day into the night.

I took 150ug of this with a friend on Sunday. Swallowed tab at 11:00, took about an hour before it started to kick in. There was a bit of unpleasant body load on the come up (tremors and an upset stomach), but this smoothed out by the time the peak came around. Very pretty visuals, great enhancement of music. A typical and very enjoyable psychedelic experience. The peak was from 14:00 to 16:00. By 18:00 I was coming down quickly and was happy to travel back across the city to my home. Felt completely back to normal by 21:00.


The following day I noticed two reasonably large unexplained bruises on my legs, one just below my knee, one on my shin. Can't attribute it to the drug for sure, but can't think of another cause.


This felt very similar to LSD, just with a slightly more intense body load, unpleasant on the come up. I would be willing to dose higher, but I can easily imagine that above 300ug or so the uncomfortable body load would outweigh the positives.

My next experience with this will definitely be at least 300ug. I honestly found 225ug to be somewhat underwhelming, I expected it to be a much greater increase in intensity compared to 150ug. I figure I'll keep pushing the dose higher until the body load becomes unpleasant. I'm also thinking that the next time I dip into my liquid LSD, I'll be trying 1 hit of LSD combined with 150ug of LSZ. A friend of mine tried this about a week ago and said it was excellent and that the duration of the two combined was much greater than either alone.

I had a 150ug experience the other day for the first time with LSZ, or  any lsergamide (sp?). It took about an hour to notice any changes and  slowly rose to a peak at 2.5-3 hours from ingestion. I found the feeling  very spiritual or personally meaningful, however you define it. I had  made a list of things for myself to ponder under the influence and upon  reading them I was very strongly emotionally inspired to overcome  personal problems and to better myself. I felt like 'myself' in a way I  hadn't for quite some time and it was very refreshing. The next morning I  went through with what i had promised myself and disposed of a sizable  stash of drugs that were causing harm in my life and relationships.


I  was having anxiety prior to the trip and once it kicked in, it  continued for a while with a fast heart beat (it was fast before  ingestion too). After I had reached an agreement with myself on my  personal issues, I felt much more calm and relaxed more, about 3-4 hours  into the trip. Around the point I put on some music (The Beatles -  White album) and the listening experience was orgasmic and amazing,  indescribable even. The trip tapered off, coming down around 6-7 hours  after ingestion, but after effects lingered several more hours and I had  trouble sleeping. The next day I was very tired, but in a fantastic  mood, which still persists until today, 4 days later.


Visuals  were relatively subtle; brightened and saturated colours, a mild 'fish  eye' type distortion, some movement in my peripheral vision. The closed  eye visuals I think were more impressive, but I have a hard time  remembering. I also had some muscle tension, mostly pronounced in the  first 4 hours, though it was not uncomfortable. Compared to 2c-e, maybe  1/3rd as much tension.


All in all an absolutely fantastic psychedelic. It felt a lot more powerful than I was expecting from one hit!

Great report, sounds like a wonderful first lysergamide experience. LSD was always my favorite compound (by far) so I was extremely excited to try LSZ and it was certainly not a let down. I'm really looking forward to AL-LAD becoming available again.

I believe I read that it is, but only slightly. Also, individual reactions seem to vary quite a bit. Some people have had decent trips with as little as 75ug, while I still found 225ug to be not quite as intense as I would like.

The (S,S)-(+) isomer (which is what is supposedly being sold) should be in theory the most potent one so far (even more than LSD). Irl I'd say all three are about the same potency, but since the effects aren't identical (AL-LAD is more visual), some would call it more potent.


>My next experience with this will definitely be at least 300ug

300ug is an excellent choice, should be more visual at that dose too.


>What color does LSZ show when performing an ehrlich test? 

LSZ, LSD, AL-LAD and all the other lysergamides should produce the same result. Or to be more exact, ehrlich's test tests for the presence of an indole, so anything containing that should give the same results.

pic related, indole:

I'm surprised at the range of repsonse to; difference in bodyload and some can't tell it from acid.

I would know this from acid blind without a doubt and the physical was noticable but tempted to try again; mostly getting positive responses.

I found LSD, AL-LAD and LSZ all to be unique enough to be their own things and worthy on their own merits rather than as replacements of each other, but I found LSZ slightly closer in effects to LSD itself, though I only took AL-LAD and LSZ once each, and had a little tolerance when I tried LSZ at 150ug, so it wasn't as strong as it would normally have been at that dosage. Felt similar to maybe 70ug-ish LSD with no tolerance.


That said though, of the lot I found LSD the best "all-rounder" of the three, AL-LAD was slightly more giggly and recreational and silly, and LSZ was a little more serious, introverted, and thoughtful. As I said, all have their own merits ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

It's interesting that this stereotype has developed between the three, it seems most people agree. Between the two that I've tried, LSD and LSZ, I'd say that the stereotype holds. LSD seems to be a bit more manic than LSZ too. I've only done LSZ once though so I should stop talking like an expert now.

I have a couple of LSZ-tabs left, and I want to do the rest with a buddy of mine. Problem is, he gets regulary piss test, so what I'm wondering is if LSZ can give a false-positive (or whatever it is called) for LSD. Does anyone know?

I didn't even think it would be possible to test for LSD, because of the tiny doses. 

I think if there is actually a test sensitive enough to pick up LSD in urine (days later at least), there is a good chance it would also pick up LSZ.

But it depends on if they're just searching for LSD itself.  I don't know the answer but just because it picks up LSD, an equally small dose, doesn't mean it will pick up LSZ.  But it might, I'll wait for someone else to chime in who knows.

If you give a lab tech a sample of blood/urine and ask is there any LSD in it is much different from 'here's a sample, identify every compound in it'.

**lsz trip report**


Ok guys this is my first post and first trip report so be gentle..


Gender: Male 

Weight: 13 stone

Pervious experience: cannabis, lsd, mdpv, synthetic cannabinoids, MDMA, cocaine, 25i-nboh


Setting

Spontaneous camping trip up mountain range close by in Northern Ireland. Me and boyfriend only. Day started with hour drive down to park car near a trail. 


Headed up trail and hiked uphill for 3-4 hours stopping for lunch. Arrived about 3:30pm at pre-determined wild camp site to find we have it to ourselves. 


Previously boyfriend had agreed to take it with me but decided not to last minute and instead would be my sitter. Were exhausted from the walk but decided to take on empty stomach for best results. 


T+00:00 (3:45pm)Took 1 and 1/2 tabs of 150ug strength for a total dose of ~225ug. I'd taken ~500ug og 25i-nboh 4 days previously and was worried about cross tolerance. 


T+00:20 swallow tabs bit feeling no first alerts yet.


T+00:30 feel nauseous and like my blood sugar is really low and I'm going to faint. Start to think hiking for 3-4 hours then dropping this on an empty stomach may have been a bad idea.


I spend the next 1 hour 30 minutes huddled in a ball complaining I'm feeling very nauseous, light headed and motion sick.


T+2:00 nausea begins to pass and I come out of my cocoon to face the world and it's like I'm opening my eyes for the first time. Colours are vibrant and everything is breathing.


From this point on I have absolutley no body load or nausea or discomfort of any kind. Neck is ever so slightly stiff but not in any way uncomfortable.


T+2:30 brought my Bose sound link mini speaker with me and put on the gorillaz, plastic beach album. We are camped looking up at a valley and the grass all along it was swaying to the music and pulsing in time. It was beautiful and I kept remarking how nice nature was.


T+3:30 still outside and enjoying listening to music and talking to my boyfriend who is doing a good job of picking music and keeping the conversation interesting.


T+4:00 decide to smoke a few hits of cannabis from a small glass pipe I'd brought as it had previously mixed well with acid for me. 


T+4:30 cannabis has made the experience slightly cloudier and get lost mid sentence in thoughts that I couldn't recover. Decided it was best not to fret over the lost thoughts and get down so just kept it moving on when this happened.


Visuals were intensified with the weed. I could now see spiraling patterns within  everything I looked at. The mountains were still swaying and breathing but now also rotating like a kaleidoscope.


T+5:00 was getting late and we'd been camping all day and boyfriend wanted to go to bed. We retired indoors but it was still light outside as sunset was after 10pm and it was before 9pm. I decided to sit outside alone and smoke more weed over the course of the next half hour and be alone with my thoughts.


T+5:30 visuals shifted to an intricate pattern of interlocking L shaped blocks and these blocks were rotating to cause the spiral patterns described earlier. I felt I'd understood the visuals more and was being let in on the secret behind how the whole drug was working to produce its hallucinations. 


There also appeared to be a transparent grid across every surface that had black nodes or markers positioned along it. 


T+6:00 was getting darker now and my boyfriend was snoring loudly inside the tent which freaked me out so I made my way inside. 


T+6:10 couldn't sleep and was still tripping fairly hard so browsed my phone to see what I had. Had a copy of american beauty in HD which I watched, visual quality of movie appeared terrible on my nexus 5's screen although usually looks terrific. Enjoyable watch nonetheless.


T+8:00 have snack of sesame rolls with tuna and seed snack bars ensuring I drink plenty of water. 


Smoke more weed before putting head down and sleep with no problems. 


Conclusion

Overall experience was comparable to acid I've had although I've only ever taken low doses of acid so don't know how it compares to higher doses but had a good time and after the initial discomfort which I put down to the stupid decision to dose after exhausting hiking for 3-4 hours. 


Also I may have had cross tolerance with 25i-nboh which if is anything like the nbome tolerance I've read about then could definitely have played a factor.


Further study 

Have 3 1/2 tabs left so plan to take 1 and a half next time with at least a weeks gap and prefferably two and then the same gap before trying 2 tabs (300ug).

I have a couple new things to contribute here.


After taking (on different occasions) 150ug LSZ, 1 drop (unknown quantity) of LSD with 150ug LSZ, and 225ug LSZ, my good friend G decided to take 3 1/2 hits (525ug) of LSZ. He normally tolerates psychedelics quite well (particularly LSD) and was curious as to what a high dose of LSZ would be like. He reported that the come up was much quicker than with all previous trials with LSZ. Nausea increased steadily until he was forced to throw up right before the peak of the experience. He reported that this vomiting was incredibly intense, sort of a "purge" type feeling/activity. The trip itself was intense but not as much as expected. He said it was about on par with 2-3 hits of decent LSD but with less of a visual component. 7 hours after ingestion he was surprisingly clear headed but still suffering from mild stomach discomfort.


Yesterday my friend M ingested two hits (300ug) of LSZ by himself. His trip was spent listening to Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix. He described it as his most intense psychedelic experience yet, his previous experiences being: 150ug LSZ, 225ug LSZ, and one drop (unknown quantity) of LSD. He said that it was less visual than LSD, but the physical and mental intensity was incredibly strong. His most profound experience during this trip was extreme time dilation, to the point of observing reality in "slow motion". He reported that there were multiple instances where he was left questioning his sanity, this reality, divinity, and the nature of the universe. While less "recreational" than his previous experiences, he said it was by far his most rewarding experience yet. He said that, for him at least, 300ug LSZ might be the "sweet spot" dose.

I don't think I ever reported back my experience, so here it is, later rather than never.


My friend D and I took 2.5 tabs (~375mcg) of LSZ each. It took a while to come up, about 2 hours before we started having interesting visuals. I smoked 5f-akb-48 during the trip, which considerably boosted the intensity of the visuals. It also prevented any come up poo, which I usually get when taking drugs. I got some vasoconstriction, which I wouldn't say was severe, but was unsettling at times. I think the cannabinoid helped alleviate it a little.


The visuals were not as strong as what I expected from this dose, but I feel the experience could have been affected by me eating food during the come up, despite having had breakfast just 2 hours before. My short term memory was appalling, so much so that I couldn't form a sentence that structurally made sense, because I'd forget everything that I'd just said. I think smoking made this even more pronounced, seeing as 5f-akb makes me feel stupified just by itself. I felt more aware of things that normally I would not waste time processing consciously - simple things, like noticing a plug socket and then having an in depth chain of thought about plugs.


Being in public was uncomfortable for me, and it was very obvious that I was tripping. There was a moment when I was walking the D back to the bus station and a police van drove past us and just stopped some short distance down the road, all as we were waiting to cross a busy road. My heart has never pounded so fast! I've never been arrested before and it's something I'm very paranoid about whenever I'm in public when I'm high.


So my final thought on this experience is that it was very similar to my experience on LSD in terms of altered consciousness, but the visuals were not as crazy as I would've hoped for. I've had stronger visuals from 2mg 25B-NBOMe. I'm deffo gonna try AL-LAD next, it seems to have a stronger visual component to the trip.

I'm fairly surprised that LSZ isn't more popular. It's not quite on the same level as LSD, but very close. I rather enjoy it and hope it remains available. I'm really looking forward to combining it with AL-LAD soon, as well as combining it with LSD. In fact, I feel that its real potential may be using it to augment other lysergamides.

love it but find the density on the blotter lower than hoped for, or the potency weaker than assumed on a microgram basis.

I think 300mics per cardboard blotter of this size would be way better.

too much paper per microgram as it is with 150 mics on the LSZ squares

I only did 150mics once and found it light-ish (like a nominal half blotter of good acid), 

I did 75mics a few times and found it light but interesting especially mixed with a bit of nbome.

I love LSZ, but find I am eating too much paper per session, 

and if I do the calculation it is much more costly than LSD per layer of psychedelic effect.

maybe next month I can get some more, it is a strange opportunity that it is legal to purchase, and one I am thankful for.

**Last Night**


My two cents on LSZ.


Took it for the first time last night (around 225 ug - 1.5 tabs). Drop both at around 20:00. Took about 2 hours for a noticeable effect. I dropped after a large meal 1 hour prior so that might have slowed things down a little. 


From around 22:00 to 02:00 the effects slowly increased. They're were some open eye visuals, enhance vision, some morphing and distortion (albeit a lot milder than I was expecting). Music sounded good, nice body feeling, i found myself looking up more info on the psychedelic - was pretty engrossed. I was able to function pretty well during this time. Once it got to a certain stage it didn't feel like the effects would increase. 


I turned in around 02:30. Turned the lights off leaving only the light through my window, effects were still there (again mild), fuzziness, some minor tracers.


Overall I would say this is a nice chemical, a definate LSD like feeling. I didn't notice any problems with the come up. I was a little underwhelmed with the visuals if I'm honest- I was looking for a bit more - but I will be trying this again at 300 ug and see where I can get with it.

Will probably gum them for a bit before swallowing this time to see if there is any difference in onset.

I did 300 mcg today and I chewed and swished the blotters for 20 minutes before swallowing and had no nausea at all really. Still took a long time to come on, like 2 hours. Mild acid-like CEVs  and some slight open-eye visual disturbances, nothing major. I did do a couple kits of acid last weekend so there may have been a little residual tolerance. Pretty mild effects for 300 mcg really.

Precisely. Chew those big ol' cardboardy LSZ blotters up good. Looks like they used special heavy gauge blotter paper for those babies. It's some tough chewing.

I wonder why they used such heavy paper and large squares for this and also the AL-LAD blotters. Anyway, it was an okay trip at 300 mcg. I liked the fact that it didn't make me emotional and "peace and lovey" like acid does. It was very clear-headed. Probably 450 mcg would be a full trip. I was almost making out acid-lke CEVs. They just couldn't make it all the way through to clear resolution.

How safe is LSZ compared to LSD? Is there any evidence of it (or AL-LAD) being less safe in any way?

Seems to be about the same, pretty much impossible to OD on. Some people reported vasoconstriction but that's about it. Should be safe up to  1 mg anyway. I've seen reports of 900 mcg doses with no problems. Personally I wouldn't go above 600 mcg since it's doubtful that more than that would improve the experience so why waste product?

LSZ seems to have the highest incidence of reports of body load. It also seems like the response to the drug is very varied, individually.


You probably don't want to jump in at a high dose. Start with 150mcg and take it from there.


As for AL-LAD, it seems to have a more LSD-like side effects profile, in that it's exceptionally well tolerated. A high-dose may be taxing, psychologically, but you should be fine body load-wise.

frankly lsz is a waste of money and time, al-lad is far superior. lsz is really subtle for me anyway. it's not body loading - it's just it lacks in just about everything frankly.

9,10 dihydrolysergamides  [ e.g , LSZ , etc ] are known to have emetic activity [ or as tested in canines anyway in the above reference ] . 


Unfortunately there is no human experimental data reports  [ that I can locate ] , however , I suspect that the above referenced report may help explain the " body load " and nausea of LSZ , etc .

I dosed 300ug of LSZ yesterday. It was fun and relaxing, with no negative bodyload, but it also wasn't as intense as I was hoping. It seems to me that LSZ can only really take you so far. It was enjoyable, but not earth shattering like 2 or more decent hits of LSD would be.


I'm finding LSZ to be perfect for a mellow trip, one where I'm still capable of operating my dvd player and carrying on a conversation with my tripping buddy. It's probably the perfect level of tripping for most people, but I'll definitely be keeping some actual LSD around for when I really want to go all out.


For other times though, LSZ is quite nice. At 300ug I had a wonderful body high, enhanced colors, very light patterning with my eyes open, and excellent music enhancement.

It is known that LSZ is a bit less potent than LSD so it's not entirely surprising that 2 hits wasn't "earth shattering like 2 or more decent hits of LSD would be."

I would love to give LSZ a whirl. Just to see what it's all about... probably much more enjoyable than what people here in UT try to pass off as LSD. Its a fuckin joke anymore, people think nbome's and DOX are LSD around here. I haven't consumed a quality tab of LSD since last October, that's how bad it is here, lol. So, LSZ don't sound half bad IMO.

It certainly is. I've shared LSZ with a fairly large (and well informed) test group. 4 of us have had no negative side effects, 1 experienced mild physical discomfort, and 2 experienced fairly severe side effects.

I've actually not tried AL-LAD yet, though I will soon. From what I've read the general consensus seems to be that it does have some sort of ceiling where any more is a waste, but I'll be very curious to see for myself. I generally like to push dosage up to whatever is the upper limit of physical comfort for me, so we'll see what that is.

I highly recommend LSZ. How well it's tolerated seems to vary from person to person, but assuming it agrees with you physically I'd say that it's a great alternative if you have trouble reliably procuring LSD.

I hav experienced lsz many times and it's easy to get like candy at convenient store  have learned it does not come with the energy tht lsd does not that it doesn't have speedy affect it's just mental not affecting body it's actually relaxing on body make u wanna sit down somewhat of body load on the come up golden during peak very very visual in swims experience 8hr duration doesn't go deep spiritual wise but gives you ability to choose very recreational but  heard bad experience from others and wonderful ones everyone's got a different chemistry IMO next best thing to lsd swim mite actually prefer it but both are awesome have yet to dabble in al-lAD 


Ps. Anyone ever had blotters dipped in mint oil ? Not a metallic taste tho Mint

To me LSZ is like a very light acid trip with more stomach discomfort. It's not bad aside from the stomach discomfort, if you just want a light stimulation with some minor visual effects. 3 hits didn't do much more for me than 2, but did cause more stomach discomfort so I would recommend sticking with 2. Even with 3 the stomach discomfort wasn't severe but enough to be unpleasant. 2 seems to be the sweet spot for LSZ in my experience. It also helps to reduce stomach discomfort if you chew it and keep it in your mouth for 20 minutes before swallowing so most of it absorbs through your mouth and doesn't reach your stomach. I got pretty bad nausea when I just swallowed it right away.

I've noticed nausea on the come up  myself but it's Not every time I've had a lot of trials with it n I wish I knew the dosage but I'm able to take 1 n it's still very visual n all in all good trip but that was after month break 2 is best by far and as far as I will go with noticeable affects 30min in everytime

I've found (and my group of "test subjects" seem to agree) that two blotters (300ug) seems to be the sweet spot dose with LSZ. I don't feel that pushing it any higher will add much other than bodyload. 


300ug is quite comfortable for me, but somehow I just had the feeling that anymore would result in some degree of nausea. My friend who took 3 1/2 (525ug) stated that the effects of that dose were quite similar to 2, except for the addition of horrid nausea. 


I look forward to doing this quite a bit more, though I'm not sure when. Right now I'm a little preoccupied with AL-LAD, as I just recently acquired it and have only tried it once.

Has anybody plugged it? I'm guessing you could get around 50 percent potency increase that way, maybe better (reportedly LSD too goes through significant first-pass metabolism). Put a couple milliliters of water in a shot glass with the blotter dumped in it, either wait awhile for the compound to diffuse or stick it in the microwave to force it to, then suck it up in a needleless syringe, stick that up your butt, and eat the soggy paper. Voila! instant increase to your return on investment. (theoretically)

Yeah, that's the thing: the assumption of great bioavailability. But what is the actual empirical data? I'm recalling [this old post on the topic](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/191798-Snorting-LSD-Merged?p=4617724#post4617724) by fastandbulbous:


> Rectal administration has an advantage (dose wise) if the drug is metabolized in the liver as it escapes 1st pass metabolism. As LSD is metabolized in the liver, it's almost certain that plugging would require a lesser dose than the oral route; by how much though, you can continue arguing about!
> 		
> Click to expand...
Others in that same thread tried LSD rectally and claim higher potency, as well.


I think the mythology of LSD getting dumped on a chemist's hands leading to tripping (transdermal administration of LSD has not been shown to be effective to my knowledge) has seeded the notion that Lucy and company can get fully into the body by nearly any means of ingress. But I'm not sure it's true. It may just be like most other compounds where up the butt administration is more potent.


The fact that LSD is usually put on media that's not conducive to alternative ROAs (one does not look at a square of paper or a sugar cube and think "I'd like to snort that or stick it up my ass") may also have bolstered the assumption that it's 100 percent bioavailable orally.

I was curious so I searched out an academic mention of LSD's oral bioavailability.

If this is true (and they do state it "may be around") I find it strange that common wisdom suggests that there's no sense in taking LSD by non-oral administration, since nearly 1/3 appears to get lost (perhaps there's other more conclusive studies that have found different?). In any case, LSZ and AL-LAD may have different properties that could make other ROAs more worthwhile than with LSD.

Snorting crushed up LSD microdots always worked well for me. Came on a lot faster and no stomach upset. Though once I actually did chuck after snorting 4 hits of purple mikes. It was just due to the sudden onset I think. It only ever happened that one time. Maybe it was something I ate, who knows. Snorting is definitely my preferred ROA for acid though. Problem is, you need microdots or "barrels", unless you have liquid that you could put a drop of up the honker.

Are the 'standard' LSZ blotters ( ie the ones with molecule printed on most people have access to ) as unpredictable dosewise as AL-LAD appears to be ?

Al-lad has been quite predictable for me. It's so bizarre that people have such drastically different experiences with what I thought was blotter from the same ultimate source.

I still maintain that LSZ is an under-rated gem. I think tomorrow night I'm going to take 225ug. Nothing new really, I've taken it up to 300ug before. But I've been using AL-LAD and LSD lately, so I feel like it's time to hang out with "lizzie" again. 


I'll be pretty bummed when my supply runs out. I think I have like 24 tabs left. I can see why AL-LAD has been more popular, but it's a shame that it has so completely overshadowed LSZ.

Yeah too bad LSZ got so overshadowed, it would be nice to see it stick around. I only tried it once, but really liked it. I hope it doesn't disappear, it might be now or never if you want to pick some up.


Pupnik: When you say you find lsz more interesting psychologically, are you talking about full tab (or more) trips, or 1/4 blotters or what? Or do you find this to be independant of dose level? And can you explain in what way you find it more interesting?

perpetualdawn,

1/4 does not work for me with al-lad nor with lsz, but 1/2 is repeatedly very interesting with either of them especially when tolerance is low, i.e. with 5 days or more between.


One tab of either is a fair bit stronger and 1&1/2 tabs is the most I have had and I don't think I even want more than that really.

Trouble is it's only an under-rated gem for some; read round the forums - over and over again people like different things and can't except the fact; AL_LAD completely overshadows LSZ for me 'cause it was fucking brilliant and Z wasn't and that was what a lot experienced but I accept you like it. I was hoping to but nope.

Understandable. Different people have different reactions. Also, people use these chemicals for different reasons. I found AL-LAD a bit shallow (though fun, don't get me wrong- I like it quite a bit) but I find LSZ much more mentally and emotionally deep, an effect I generally seek in psychedelic drugs.

The main reason I've avoided LSZ is the supposedly much worse body load. AL-LAD is pretty mild, even at 750 ug.

I found AL-LAD shallow compared to LSD for sure but still very good and certainly fun. That sounds a criticism but I take these things for all the different reasons. Fun is fine but I like depth. Thought LSZ might be good since people said although it wasn't so much fun it was introspective; haven't found much of that at all so AL_LAD Still wins on that account. I agree with those that say Z lacks spirituality and I do find it's in AL-LAD. Z's just washed out for me and bodyloaded - shame really coz it's one less option for me so it's a win for you there. With Z there seems so much personal variation which is there with most things but with Z a lot.

It definitely seems that reactions to LSZ vary more than AL-LAD. Out of everyone I've shared with, five people really enjoyed LSZ, two people got really sick, and one person found it ok but disliked the bodyload.

I wish I would have jumped on trying some LSZ or AL-LAD when they first started surfacing. Now it seems the probability of getting any to the US is Quite slim.... I swear I always wait too long and fuck my chances at trying cool new RCs.

You would think they would come up with some better more discrete shipping methods. I know I can think of a few for blotter that would be nearly fool proof. But, we arent allowed to discuss such matters here!

Bummer to hear this guys. I thought it wouldn't be so hard still, because I know of at least one vendor that has ample stock of each of the new lysergemides. Pupnik did Canada Customs seize your orders or what?

Why would customs seize LSZ though? Perhaps they thought that it was LSD and there was a typo on the blotter :D Bad jokes aside, even if we're talking about US, I fail to understand on what basis would customs seize small quantities of LSZ - it may fall afoul of the Analog Act, but you can't consume it while it's still in the mail...

there was a tracking system on the MAIL  of a recent order

then it went marked DELIVERED.

the address was correct but nothing came to my place.


I requested a replacement by regular mail and the vendor said they sent it (a final replacement) but that did not arrive for 3 weeks.

so 

I have no idea what is happening with the mail or with my address and the mail, like has an individual started opening them up or am I on a watchlist?

I suspect that **missing return addresses makes the envelopes suspect**.

Lay low. It could be bad neighbors or shaky mail men.  Most probably the issue originates with the government. The U.S.A., AU, and others have elaborate domestic spying programs. History of mail, money orders, phone calls, web activity, ect. gets recorded. Eventually each vendor is flagged. If the government correlates your activity with flagged vendors you get flagged. These records last many years. Millions of contraband items get through the mail each year. They only peruse some of the leads. The question isn't "Do they know?".     


Nixon told us who was "the most dangerous man in America" (Timothy Leary). Americas past drug policies created the highest incarceration rate in the world. You are using the same type of drugs Leary used. Considering this information the question is "Do they care?".

Last night I took 225ug of LSZ. Having played around with this chemical numerous times at several doses, I really think 225ug is my favorite dose. Very comfortable come up, decently visual (but not too in your face about it), and a duration of about 8 or 9 hours. 


The evening was spent listening to Primus and Electric Wizard, all in all a nice and, dare I say, relaxing trip.

I suppose it's worth mentioning as well that I've finally decided that I like LSZ better than AL-LAD. I feel that it's a more well rounded trip and a much deeper and more immersive experience. 


Don't get me wrong, I enjoy AL-LAD quite a bit. I would like to try upping the dosage with AL-LAD to 450ug, but am not sure if it would be a worthwhile usage of my limited supply. 


I'm pretty happy about the fact that 225ug LSZ puts me exactly where I want to be. If I want or need a more intense experience, I'll probably just dip into my supply of LSD.

Get it while you still can amigos... LSZ is much less likely to be produced for the street and darknet after the ban, given the massive popular preference for AL-LAD.

Agreed, though it seems individual reactions vary a bit more with LSZ. I've known a couple of people to get fairly sick from it, I experience no bodyload and love it. AL-LAD seems less impressive, but also more consistent in terms of a lack of bodyload.

on a half blotter today which I thought was mild but interesting, 

my wife commented that I was squirming in my chair at hour 2 to hour 3.

I felt great, but I guess that happens. 

we went out to dinner and baby sit with some friends after hour 3. 

we took a taxi but I felt I would have been able to drive.

*do not float and drive*.

the 4 year old related to me as an equal, as per usual.

That could be. I thought it was stupid myself when I got my order in an envelope with no return address. That's not being stealthy, it's raising a red flag. They're supposed to use various fake return addresses. A fake one is better than none. So what if it goes back to an address that turns out to be a Starbucks or something? A thieving postal worker would also be tempted to steal an envelope with no return address because he would figure out that it's something dirty and that its theft won't be reported. Anyway, try using a PO box and see if it still happens. Maybe your current address is flagged now by Customs.

I'd also say, as i did before, that LSZ is definitely preferable and far more enjoyable as AL-LAD is - even though i quit researching those and disagree to what the majority says, i.e. that the latter one is better. But this is just my subjective opinion and so bears no real value, eh?!

The best way to not get caught, send' n something in the mail... 


You should, put your idem (sealed).. into an envelope or little box... seal it, address it... just like you would have any ways..


This is the important part.


PUT THAT Envelope or box, into another envelope, or box... Address it, with a return address  (made up or not) 

 and the receivers address...  Now it is safe to send it. 


Why do I know this, you may ask?


.... I worked the "Undeliverable Unit" at USPS... this works for all other carriers too UPS FED-X... et cetera


 This is how you can get caught.. it is really rear though  ....

 lets say; something you send, becomes damaged at the mail facility... this does happen but rear (via water damage, being crushed lots of things can happen).


 If a clerk cant read the address, they have to send the letter or box to the undeliverable Unit then.... Clerks, mail handlers can not open ANY mail... or you get fired!!!


Guess what.... Undeliverable Clerks can open mail; We have to figure out, how to send that package on.... or back to sender... that's there only job...


 I get to open any letter or package 

in HOPES to find a address inside... then we have to seal it up, and send it on its way....with a stamp; saying, damaged in the mail... So (don't get paranoid if you see this stamp) Ether to the sender or receiver depending on what address we find... remember it is VERY rear something gets found ???? 


SOOOO

If I do find something questionable... I have to bring it to the attention of postal inspectors and or customs... 

No real need to be paranoid just be smart about how you send something... \


By the way....

Damaged and or unclaimed packages, because of bad address do to damage etc.. are saved, and then auctioned off to the public... any thing of danger is destroyed etc...


I hope this helps...

Interesting. You gotta stop writing "rear" instead of "rare" though. Best not to use the word rear any more than necessary really. 


What happens when something has no return address on it? Do the postal workers find it suspicious or is it common?

^ At which Dose? I've found it not nearly as "good" as LSZ, with both at doses around 400 - 450 as far as i remember. But tbh none of both were as nice as good ole Daisy is ?

I've done about 790 ug and that was the most intense trip I've ever had. Obviously set and setting, blah blah blah... But the potential is there. 600 was much more mentally interesting than 450 as well.

Postal workers don't care about what's in letters or packages sent within the usa.

Letters coming from another country. The customs unit deals with overseas mail) yes, they should have a return address on them real or not.. or change it every once in a while. 


If a senders address ever become suspect... Yes, it is place on a watch list... boxes too..... Letters are really not watch as much as the bigger boxes are... Letters, there are to many of them.... to watch 100% of the time. 


Customs will save suspect packages. \

 Once or twice a week, the clerks  dump the sacks, of save mail, onto a belt... 


Then a dog would walk back and forth and find what ever that dog is trained to find... Drugs, Plants, Live Animals etc... 

The drugs they found where always, Heroin, cocaine, meth & Pot...  I have never seen LSD or small packets of RC's  ever.. 


Remember each facility near an airport receive hundreds of thousands of packages and letters every day...


 I wouldn't worry bout anything sent in a letter  that is flat...

So sat. im considering testing 1 al lad + 1 lsz or 2 lsz. i tried 2 allad previously, it was enjoyable, too intense for a hour or two but nothing CRAZY just disphoric/uncomfortable. next time i was thinking cut 1/4th off one blotter or even half the next time i take 2 al lad and MAYBE just dont take it or stagger the 1/4-1/2  like a hour after i drop , in hopes to lessen uncomfortable feeling....anyway thats not my real question. does anyone have any experience with 1 allad + 1 lsz ? i would think they fill in the gaps each are missing and the visuals would be as strong s 2 blotts of of either ? from what i read its not like that...any thoughts ? 


what are peole meaning by bodyload, nausea, tremors ? al lad and lsd do not give me a "body load" i consider most but not all PEAs and things like 5 meo amt even AMT to have a bodyload ime. so not ever having a negative or nauseating feeling on lsd or al lad i cant imagine lsz doing that to me, so im just wondering specifically what they mean by that "terrible bodyload from lsz" ive read about, now waaaay back in HS one of my best early trips was on LSA and it was real deal, quite diff than lsd but if i could access that pure i def would anyway that gave me aching legs, like growing pains and nausea so i guess i have "bad " side effects from a lysergimide (sp)... although it was lsa.


Also i didnt get the in awe feeling and electric euphoria i get when i take lsd when i took al lad. is that feeling "awe/amazement" there with lsz or that super electric feeling euphoria like lsd has ? 


and last how would u gauge 250-300ug lsz's OR 1 lsz + 1 al lad visuals to say 100ug-130ug of lsd's visuals ? al lad was visual but in a diff way than lsd, not particularly amazing or wowing or intricate like even low dose lsd.


ps. i just want to comment on the super high doses im seeing on lsz and al lad.... im confused 1 thats just ALOT of $ taking 5-6 blotts but even more than that. are people who do this the same people that love taking insane lsd dosed like 5-10 blotters ? bc i couldnt imagine me taking more than 2 lsd blotts ever. 100-150ug lsd totally satisfies me with minimal anxiety...so is this just a case of people liking really high doses or its just not "THAT" crazy at those doses 450ug+ bc 300ug al lad was intense not ego dissolving but i couldnt imagine being MORE confused or double what i was feeling on 300ug, any thought on that too ? also when i say 1 or 2 blotts im talking about 150ug blotters. thanks ! peace

How would it compare to al-lad or lsd-25?

Those are the only lysergic compounds tried by myself. Definitely interested in the whole family.

  i havent tried the lsz only al lad. but al lad def felt like Lsd, ish, different but def a good replacement considering i never leave the house so finding real lsd is pretty hard. although for the high price i could take it leave it and just grab a gram of 4 aco/ho xxx . those are JUST as recreational as al lad if not more IMO but i bought 50 of each off rip in 2013 bc they would last me litterally forever just eating them myself and a bud...


any experiences with 1 al lad + 1 lsz or 2 lsz (300ug) ?

I think a few pages back I posted a short summary of my experience mixing 150ug LSZ and 150ug AL-LAD. Both were taken simultaneously. The come up was awful. It was one of the worst come ups I've ever experienced. It was dysphoric and the body load was incredibly unpleasant. Normally LSZ or AL-LAD take about two hours to really kick in for me, but the combo hit fast and hard with it only taking about an hour to begin peaking.


Once the come up resolved into the peak, it was really enjoyable. All the side effects from the onset period disappeared quite rapidly. I felt the two substances complimented eachother quite well, it was a really neat experience and I really enjoyed it. I felt like there was definitely synergy between the two, it certainly seemed more unique than I anticipated from just LSZ+AL-LAD. 


I hesitate to do it again though just because of how difficult the come up was. I've taken both LSZ and AL-LAD individually in doses of up to 300ug and never experienced any negative side effects on their own. Also, normally my come ups are pretty smooth. 


In summary, it's cool and I say go for it. Just be prepared for the possibility of a difficult first hour.

Part of it is likely just personal preference, some people love roller coasters for example, while others can't fathom how anyone could enjoy them. The other part is brain chemistry. Different people can react very differently to the same dose. 300 ug of AL-LAD is barely a trip for me: minimal visuals, zero confusion, almost no effects on the body. I could go to work on 2 tabs of AL-LAD. I could take the SATs. It's the same for my girlfriend, only more so. 450-600 ug (3-4 blotters) is the point it becomes worthwhile to me. On the other hand, one of my friends finds 300 ug the maximum he can handle.

Im curious are u the type that takes 30+mg of 4 subs 1mg or higher of nbomes or take really high 2c doses for effects ? Bc i see those doses and just have to think more than avg use and tolerance is at play bc 25mg-30mg MAX is plenty for any 4 sub i cant imagine people taking 45-100mg of 4 subs but i see report all the time.  Jw seems like the people who take those in really high doses are the ones taking these in high doses of these and maybe some people r just hardheaded or have a tolerance?  I mean in no way a light weight my doses r avg for everything 20-25mg  on 4 subs 20-30mg for SOME 2cs def one not of those people that  take 8 or 12 or even 15mg of a 4 ho xxx and says they tripped balls or like 12mg 2ce.  If the dose isnt 20mg min. For most things its not even worth my time and i trip once every 2 weeks maybe once a week so i dont have a tolerance....


Ive decided to take 2 lsz this sat, first before trying to mix it with stuff. Dam your trip sounded good but the come up wouldn't b worth it for me so i may.just forget the 1lsz+ 1al lad idea....

I don't do nbomes, but yes my doses are generally high. It's not tolerance, regardless of whether there's been two weeks to several months between the doses I need are just higher. I guess you can refuse to believe it if that's your preference, but like I said before people's brains and bodies are different.

Thats what i meant that either tolerance is at play or people r hardheaded and thats y i see these huge doses

 Sounds like u fall in the hardhead catagory ? So that explaines y 300ug is enough for me and.your friend.but you like around 450-600ug. Which leads me to believe 300ug would be perfect  for me

 I dont have a tolerance and i dont need high doses or low doses

 I usually take aroung 5mg+ of the prefered dose. Like 25mg 4-aco-dmt or 25mg 2ci instead of people that take 45mg 4-aco-dmt or trip on 13mg 4-aco-dmt. Im right.in he middle, what i call average. 


The people that ive read that seem to be avg. Enjoy lsz more so fingers crossed . like i said i could take al lad or leave for the price and is as equally recreational as any 4 aco xx imo so hopefully im in the group that like lsz more. It seemed like the peole who take higher doses of these enjoy al lad more.bc.of the bodyload associated with 600ug or so. Which isnt my case so we will see which group i fall into.


Ill post what i thought about it. Im testing 2 lsz fri or sat...

so i tried 2 lsz blotts last fri. It was ok. I can see how people can take 600ug of this ,@ 275ug i felt like i ate one decent acid blotter minus any OEVs and the electric euphoria ive only felt on lsd. Although there were fun CEVs...


Wanting something more i bumped 5-10mg 4 aco dmt and it put me right were i wanted to be. Before the bump i was tripping , nothing spectacular. after the bump i felt just like i ate a decent blotter + 1g mush.


It was wierd and hard to explain. The lsz had a light body buzz. 4 aco dmt has a specific tryptamine feel to it diff than lsz. After the small bump its like the aco dmts body buzz lasso'd the lsz's and it felt like a strong 4 aco dmt dose from only a small amount. I think ill only add 4 ho xxx's to lsz from now on as i dont wanna eat $40 of lss at one time lol. @ 275ug i def felt like i could have upped it. My friend said he wouldn't go higher and he is the one thats likes high doses, which was wierd. He kept mentioning his jaw ached and felt wired shut...he didnt seem too have  good time also he didnt do the 4 aco dmt bump which totally turned on my trip like a switch. I kept hinting he should do some but i dont think he wanted to. Last weekend i hinted he should re dose on 2cb and he bumped 10mg and was too much. So i think he thought he would be overwhelmed and the same thing would happen.


So next weekend im thinking about re testing al lad + a 4 ho xxx sometime OR 3.5g mushrooms or a 4 aco/ho xxx. Im thinking maybe a 4 aco xxx. My friend has never tried those and he has tried shrooms plenty of times. So im thinking about either 4 ho det OR 4 aco dmt if he wants something more similar to psilocyban....

Everyone is different and so their reactions. I would always go bad trippin´.. Anytime, anywhere, at a certain moment things will go dark.

Maybe it has to do with the effects lasting so long. Last time it was over 10 hours.

My sub 4s must be weak batches cause I have to eat 40-40mg to trip hard...and I am usually sensitive to psychs.....I thought it was maybe just a tolerance issue so I took a month off and same story....underwhelmed last night on 40mg 4ho met.....Seesm like 20 would do nothing.....crazy part Is when I first got the 4 acodet I tripped balls off 30mg.....either I'm just used to the 4 subs (I've got 4 different ones and have used them 1-2 times a month for the past 5 months) or my batches suck!

Yea I've been reading alot of crazy high doses. I bought all my 4 ho xxx 2 years ago. They are all furamate not hcl, maybe that is the diff.  Im very pos. All of mine are 99%+ pure and i trip hard.on 25mg of all of them, usual dose is 20mg +5mg bumped . Id neeeever go over 30mg. Theres no need. I litterally have +3 - +4 from 20-30mg and 30 mg is high. Id never take that much orally at once....wierd. but yea lsz + 4 aco dmt felt 90% just like acid. So ill be repeating this again.


Excited to try al lad with 4 ho xxx's.

The dosage difference between the salts is too small to account for Peacephrog's problem. For example, in the case of 4-HO-MET, 20mg of the freebase equals 23.34mg of the hydrochloride and 25.31mg of the fumarate; 40mg of the fumarate equals 36.87mg of the hydrochloride -- both heavy doses that can wipe out most people.

yea, it crossed my mind if adding a MOAI would do something extra. i dont any of the chemistry behind maoi's bc ive never taken ayuhuasca but i wonder if this would work. i know it work with regular MET. 


your not alone peacephrog my bud tried 30mg 4 aco dmt w/ 20mg mxe today. first time doing any 4 aco xxx and he got zero visuals, major tremors, and not much if any ego loss. its crazy  to me. he is having a ball though, texting me pics of him laying in the snow making snow angels in the dark lol sucks bc i bought mass 4 subs for me and him to try and it seems the 4 substitution tryptamines dont do much to him at all. although he is willing to IM psychedelics. If he cant achieve regular results with a couple more tests im sure he would try IM. i find it hard t see him NOT tripping if he did it that way. 


back on topic. my next solo trial with lsz will be 450ug, no clue when that will b bc it synergized so well 4 aco dmt, i think ill only do it with the other 4 subs. We may try al-lad this sat or maybe mushrooms or maybe a nbome. we'll see..

Sorry, I know this is old.

Obviously your story didn't happen in the United States.


Pupnik hasn't been online recently. I hope he/she avoided arrest. At least I am glad your friend is safe. Canada has relatively relaxed psychedelic laws compared with America. I herd psychedelics aren't in the same category as harder drugs. In America things are different they consider almost anything an analogue of something. 2C-I is illegal anyway. If you're a black guy (like me) they'd bust your for the drug, shoot you while you ran away, then frame you leaving Tasers with your corpse. The problem is so bad this is a running gag in America.

Hah, I know about it all, I read alternative news sites, and by that, really alternative, not funded through the back by NGO's led by Soros, Rockefeller Institute, Ford Institute and the like. That Gardner guy thing would NEVER fly in Canada, and we have a lot of black people in Montreal and Toronto, basically in the Windsor/Quebec City corridor where 1/3 of the country lives. Instead of giving millions to gas companies for fracking, they should I dunno, give millions to Ontario and Quebec to build a High Speed Train between both Windsor and Quebec City. We're backwards too here but not too much, it's the fault of the "Conservatives" who got into Majority power in 2011, since then they pass Omnibus laws and since they are in majority, there is no need to debate and Omnibus means not even the regular conservative MP (same as a House Rep.) will know what those things contain. We get to know it little by little.


In September we lose door to door mail delivery....Canada was 15 years #1 on the UN HDI Index (basically list of countries with the best quality of life according to very large math involving other indexes. Now we dropped below the US...during the Bush years the US dropped below the 10th position..while we were chilling at #3 or so. Norway has been #1 since ever Canada lost its spot, thanks to the "conservatives", really, their point seems to destroy Canada and reshape to Herr Harper's ideas. Thankfully we'll most likely kick him out comes October, we got fixed elections now, except in exceptional circumstances, like what gave them their majority to start with, because all 3 opposition parties voted a no confidence...well vote against the Prime Minister which automatically dissolves parliament and starts new elections. 2 out of 3 opposition parties were wrecked because of how much one (the NDP, centre-left with social-democrat policies) raised to Official Opposition (they get more time than others to question the majority).


I fear we'll just drop him back to Minority government, where he was for 6 years, going mad because almost everything he tried to pass (which is more repression of all kinds) was blocked by all other parties, now all hell breaks loose, even if they lose power in october, the party who wins will be then privy to the contents of these omnibus bills and I don't know how much of them they'll be able to repeal.


I want my fucking mail at home, I live in a city of 300 000 people. I'm thinking of people living in those streets with huge slopes (Canada has a lot of that) who have no car, walking to their community mailbox slipping on the ice during winters breaking their legs (lots of old people) just to get their mail. Although according to the survey results, per area they will continue delivery to the elderly according to a doctor's notice, same with handicapped people...


They haven't even told us where they will be placed yet. The city has no word in where they will be placed. Imagine having that stuff installed on your front yard and you can't do anything about it, people will throw away all the crap mail and circulars on the ground around, it's inevitable. It's gonna such shit. I can't believe a so-called industrialized country will not have mail-people. I was only assured that when I order something and that they need my signature, they will still deliver home first, which is kind of a relief, but I order a ton of stuff through the internet, what about electronics, vinyl records and the community mailbox (basically they're the same as if we lived in the middle of nowhere) happens to be really far from me, like at the farthest point possible from my address block, I'll have to burn gas for nothing just to get my stuff. Not all deliveries need signatures, when you buy something and choose delivery methods, sometimes such is not offered.


Totally unrelated but you've brought out my ranting for today considering politics. And yeah this is Canada, last psychedelic to be banned is 2C-B in 1994. They banned some cannabinoids and MDPV (both things I could care less about, bottom of the barrel stuff if you ask me, except Cesamet, that's some sweet prescription cannabinoid that works just fine orally). I think they banned Khat not long ago only to piss off the large arab community that comes from french speaking countries in northern africa, we have a lot of them in Quebec since speaking french helps a lot if living there.

It's still around in people's stashes ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) but it doesn't seem to be getting produced or distributed anymore.


I'm trying to figure out the best way to experience the small amount I have, as I don't think I'll ever come across it again. I've dosed it once at 150ug, so I think I'll try either 225ug or 300ug next.


What are some good settings for enjoying LSZ? To let it's character shine, for someone like me who doesn't have very much and wants to explore the chemical. Like has anyone noticed unique characteristics of LSZ that would lend it to slightly different settings than other PDs?

I always enjoyed it the most in the comfort of my own home listening to music. And 225ug is my favorite dose.

thanks theacidtest, I was hoping you'd chime in because I remember you're one of the people who really liked LSZ. Do you prefer it with company or solo? Time of day, weather, phase of the moon ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I always prefer to have a tripping buddy. Normally I prefer day tripping, but some of my favorite LSZ trips have been at night indoors. I've taken LSZ all the way up to 300ug, but I really feel that 225ug is the sweet spot for me personally. 


I'm pretty bummed it's not being made anymore. I still have some left, but I would love to have been able to buy a lifetime supply. I find it to definitely be a more interesting trip than AL-LAD.

Once I got off my ass and started exploring LSZ at doses larger than 75 ug, I have to say I was pretty disappointed. Tried oral and buccal dosing..


I went 75 > 150 > 225 ug. It always took ~ 2.5 hours to kick in and was extremely mild for me. It felt like 0.5g dried Cubensis or perhaps 5 mg 4-AcO-DMT.fumarate.


A bit of light sensitivity, a slight feeling of being off kilter and mild insomnia. It always felt like something was about to happen (but never did).


Not impressed

What settings did you take the lsz in Thomas Davie? I'm hunting for patterns to the way people trip, and whether or not they enjoyed LSZ.

I remember some light sensitivity too, but I think I get that with most psychedelics. Same for insomnia.

Shame, I still love the stuff, though it's been awhile since I had a (s)whirl!


I'd go hiking, hang out in a forest or riverside. I loved tripping outdoors on LSZ, I did not like sitting about indoors. I don't really like tripping indoors much... Well, I'm okay if I come back in once the trip is well established.

At home, in my basement, surrounded by my 3 dogs/2 cats. The same as when I've indulged in any other substance. And solo, as always.


No fears, no hassles and no pressure from nothing.

I've tried this compound at dosages exceeding 300ug per session and I found it to be extremely visual (specially OEVs) than psychological. Sex was really nice, I remember seeing fireworks in OEVs as well as other kind of deformations while I was about to orgasm (similar patterning to LSD, but different since it really lacks the "psycho" aspect).


It has a very good recreational usage, but the body load is horrible when you exceed 200ug per session (and even more necessary to fully develop a +++ for everybody in my "psychedelic group"), so I will never do it again.


For me it's another toy that should not be pushed to high dosages due to body load... It looks like a substance for "playing" or enjoying some beers outside.


With AL-LAD happened the same to me... :-( Really looking forward to try 1p-LSD.

Not sure about LSZ, AL-LAD is. Also, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index) *shrug* .

Shame I never met anyone who actually thought LSZ was really good - they would have been welcome to it - threw 20 tabs away.


I agree if you like it keep it as low as possible and just use it for fun but it wasn't fun and even 300ug hardly touched the sides psychedelically - better stuff out there for a mild simple minded trip.

It was deep to the point that words were gibberish in my mind and even the term "spiritual" lost all meaning. Deep in a very literal sense. Maybe not spiritually deep on this first attempt but... It felt like the mind was unshackled and free from subjective opinion. In fact, the internal "voice" that would normally describe the things you observe to yourself was simply not there.

Not so this time and my activities ranged from playing guitar and lying on the floor because i felt like it. In a very, very weird way it felt like the first trip i've ever had: Not in a way that it mirrored a previous occasion but rather that all the previous occassions were moot and that it was the *new* first trip.

It felt like a seed was implanted in my mind and grew to encompass it whole. It was a weird mix of being able to perfectly function, and at the same time hold the dual state of being in DMT land or something. Without hindrance from either upon each other.

This thing doesn't strictly *beat* LSD... But it is its own "LSD" in a way. I don't like making predictions about the future because of too many variables: But this thing will be big. Just wait and see.

Very similar here too, very funny to read the same about the inner voice being silent, everything was present and no meaning for karma and other thing of this kind, wird.  When it kicked in, was teleport in other reality or something, creating imaginary people and had conversation with them ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)). 

Still the visual was amazing, could see the molecules and much more it was fantastic

The best experiences I had were in low doses. Its weird, cause for me 1/4 tab is a great social lubricant and the general feeling was great, while 1 whole tab was socialy uncomfortable and sometimes phisically too... I gues from now on I will probably use it like this. I imagine a low dose like this might be great fo concerts.

Watching the last Hobbit movie in the cinema on 150ug was craaaazy (despite the movie being quite shitty). And, yes, it was indeed visual! The movie was surely more 3d than ever...

Yeah same issue now. I had two tabs. I took one about 2 months ago and remember it being incredibly mild and not very noteworthy (150mcg per tab).


Took the other tab today around 3pm expecting the same thing and to carry on my day with a psychedelic tinge.. no such chance. This tab feels at least 3 times as strong which doesn't even make sense... its gripping me completely. I admit the first 5-6 hours were great (I didn't really experience any mental depth like I do on lsd though) but now its just gone into full on uncomfortable.. tight muscles, abdominal cramping, sweating, heartbeat weirdness. I'm certain at least some of it is in my mind but the body load is pretty brutal. I can slowly feel the effects are starting to fade so that's a relief but overall I think I'm cashing in my chips on lsz. It was a good experiment but something about it just feels a bit 'off' to me. lsd is still my holy grail.

The LSZ that was recently sold wasn't the true SS enitomer. I've made  LSZ and 75mcg the pure SS isomer felt like 100-125mcg of LSD. And it had  far less body-load, unlike the shit public LSZ. Don't let the horrible batch of LSZ ruin your opinion of it... It was not the same as real LASSAz. Animal tests will tell ya the same story as anyone who has tried properly-made LSZ. There was ZERO body load with the good stuff and it was MORE potent than LSD.

Has anybody here ever tried combining LSZ and 4-FA? I'm might be getting a small sample of both and in thinking of doing 50ug LSZ with maybe 90mg 4-FA.

Any opinions/insight on my idea?

AL-LAD and LSZ  both tend to make me nauseous and experience heavy " body load "  for several hours , to the point where I no longer have any interest in consuming any more of my stash of these lysergamides .


Curiously , LSD  [ except at very high doses - e.g  450ug + ]  rarely causes me to experience any physical distress at all .....


I am wondering at the practicality of boosting my LSD trips with small doses of AL or LSZ  - perhaps in the range of 50 - 75 ug . Hopefully this may not produce significant malaise ???   [ and avoid flushing my stash ] .  I am somewhat reluctant to actually take either again , even in small doses and on top of Lucy ....


Wondering if anyone has any experience with this , or the above quoted combos . Would love to hear of any suggestions . Thanks .

Well, as one of the few people who absolutely loved LSZ, I feel obligated to bump this thread due to the fact that I'll be taking some LSZ tomorrow evening! My stash is quite low, but I haven't tripped in almost a year and have a bit left. 


I'll be going mellow tomorrow, just 150ug and relaxing at home by myself. I'll post an update after the trip.


I still think it's a shame that LSZ never caught on more. My two best friends and I really enjoyed it. Never really encountered much body load either, certainly less than mushrooms. I find it to be the most underrated psychedelic around. Oh well, c'est la vie.

^^ Yeah I cant believe it either, to me LSZ was the best lysergamide produced, I almost prefer it to LSD. 


I know psychedelics are different for everyone but its always baffled me that it wasn't that popular. I recently took a couple of tabs out of storage, one to experiment with micro dosing and one to take whole at my leisure, I found that even with 1/8th of a tab its still extremely active (too much for micro dosing!) I'm looking forward to trying it at 150ug, 75ug was always my sweet spot.

Nice, glad I'm not alone in appreciating it. My sweet spot was 225ug, but that's for a fairly strong trip. 150ug is nice for a solid, but not challenging, trip for me personally. Hopefully at some point it will be produced again, I'm crossing my fingers. It certainly has a unique character and I found it to be a far more interesting substance than AL-LAD. I have yet to try 1P-LSD, ETH-LAD, or ALD-52, so I can't comment or compare to those. But they're definitely on my list.

I never really got on well with AL-LAD the whole experience just seemed extremely shallow to me,there's no depth what so ever. On anything over 150ug it always produced a great deal of amnesia for me, so even if it was a good trip I wouldn't recall much, if anything from it anyway. 1P-LSD I hold in high regard I find it extremely rewarding but it still doesn't have anything on LSZ.


 I'm yet to try ETH-LAD & ALD-52  I have far too many psychedelics and not nearly enough time unfortunately so I doubt I'll find the time to try them, No point stockpiling them and letting them sit in my stash for god knows how long while others can be consuming them.

Well, My LSZ trip turned out great. I took my tab (150ug) at about 10pm. The come up took about 2 hours, which is what I've come to expect from LSZ. Despite having my tabs for just over 2 years, I didn't notice significant degradation. It's possible that they've lost a small amount of potency, but the experience was more or less what I remember one hit being like. 


It wasn't particularly visual. Visual activity was pretty much limited to that sort of crisp "high definition" look that everything has on lysergamides, along with some very mild patterning if I stared at the ceiling or floor.


The come up was smooth and anxiety free. The experience itself was quite relaxing, it was very much a mellow and laid back sort of experience, psychedelic enough to be worthwhile but at no point difficult or challenging. 


I watched Futurama while coming up, as I began peaking I was in extra good spirits and was laughing quite a bit at the ironic humor in the show. Once the peak truly started I switched to listening to music through headphones. Music appreciation was everything I hoped it would be. I drank a few beers slowly throughout the duration of the experience and was able to sleep about 8 hours after ingesting my tab (which would be about 6 hours into tripping). I was definitely still feeling the effects, but tired enough that sleep came without much difficulty.

Any of you guys hear about that vendor that was selling weak lsd as lsz up until recently? Crazy stuff. Another vendor bought some and sent it in for lab testing and they said it was like 36mcg of lsd or something. The vendor not wanting to risk legal trouble got rid of it. Just goes to show you might not be in a legal gray area if a vendor is untrustworthy. Makes sense as LSD crystal seems to be quite a decent amount cheaper than these novel lysergimides, this should be noted when working with less reputable sources.

It's possible that some of it really was LSZ. I was sent a sample blotter of the supposed 200ug LSZ and gave a friend a quarter tab. He tripped pretty hard off just that quarter tab and described it the same way most people describe the differences between LSZ and LSD.

I believe it was the lower dose blotters that tested as lsd. I had two of those left and took them last sunday. It definitely felt like a low dose lsd trip, which was nice but as a collector I liked the idea of having lsz in my stash for its novelty.

I think this week I'm going to take the last of my LSZ stash, 300ug. I'll be sad to see it go, but who knows, maybe someday it'll be produced again. I've really enjoyed this chemical. While it may not agree with everyone, for me personally it has been one hell of a gem, second only to LSD itself.

I think it's great with its utter lack of undesirable side effects, but sadly lacking visually and takes a high dose for things to really get going. Great for concerts though!

This one came with a very "stoning" come-up for me, which I didn't particularly liked, but the second half of the trip was very dreamy and introspective. It had few visuals for me. I also got the most time dilation I've ever gotten from a substance with it. I only dosed it once on it's own though, because I bought a very limited amount and I combined the reminder of my tabs with AL-LAD, a combo which I enjoyed most than each of the substance on it's own. 


Looking back I regret doing that, it was a unique substance. I wonder why it didn't took off and faded away.

It was claimed that the synthetic route ensured that the SS enantiomer was only produced, and the rationale for this was economically and scientifically sound, so it seems quite plausible.

After trying LSZ once a few years ago, I recently decided to try it  again. Last month, I took 150ug and had an enjoyable but underwhelming  experience. Today I took 225ug and had a great time.


The first  time I tried LSZ, I experienced the body load that many people complain  about, and it made me not want to try it again. But now, LSZ gives me  absolutely no discomfort. I think it's because I'm in better physical  shape now. I eat healthy and work out almost every day now. LSZ without  the body load is pretty damn fun.


LSZ is not as visual or as  magical as LSD, but it has a nice mellow dreamy high. I took a walk  downtown and constantly struggled not to burst into laughter as I walked  past random people. Everything was very amusing to me. It was a purely  positive experience. As much as I enjoyed it at 225ug, though, it still  wasn't very intense. I'll think I'll try 300ug next time. I'm not sure  if it will actually be better or not. LSZ by nature seems subtler in  effect than the other lysergamides. The first time I tried it, I redosed  and ended up taking 450ug, and the higher dose mostly just increased  the side effects.

Thank you for this cj187! Knowledge on LSZ is pretty thin, so it's good to have a few more morsels. I'll be excited to hear about your 300µg dose if you do that.


For reference, what doses of other Lysergamides would you compare the intensity of 225µg LSZ to?

It's kinda hard to compare because of the differences in their effects, but I would say maybe 75ug of LSD or 200ug of AL-LAD.

OK thanks. I think next time I try this, I might jump in at 300µg too then, or at least 225µg. My only trial so far was 150µg, which was pretty mild.

These's been fair coverage of LSZ but it never gained huge public acceptance. I'd also say agree 300mics LSZ was akin to *perhaps* 70mics of acid but miles inferior (oh sorry your comparing 225mg well perhaps 50mics acid then I dunno), no headspace at all and a pretty uncomfortable bodyload.  Tried again and just as bad. I sort of wondered if I should have pushed it higher in case something happened higher but couldn't face it. I mean I am tempted to say you'd be fine on 300ug and it's never causes any real harm I know of but the heart thing was a bit of a downer (post 593) after a couple of hours extremely slow climb to near nothing mentally

The same lsz sold as a rc was actually used in a scientific study published under the name 'Return of the lysergamides. Part II Analytical and behavioural characterization of N6-allyl-6-norlysergic acid diethylamide (AL-LAD) and (2S,4S)-lysergic acid 2,4-dimethylazetidide (LSZ) Return of the lysergamides' so I guess it was the SS enantiomer since it's claimed to be that one there too.

Here's a little report after tonight's test...


I felt a vague "something" approximately forty-five minutes after ingestion of 300ug. This ambiguous sensation didn't turn into a true onset for another thirty minutes. The onset was steady, but very sluggish and uneventful.


At two hours, I felt as if this wasn't going to go very far, so I ingested another 150ug. Fifteen minutes after that, the onset became more rapid and pronounced, but not necessarily forceful -- it was rather smooth, in fact. This onset continued for a surprising two additional hours; the peak, which arrived over four hours after the initial dose was taken, was heady and rewarding.


Curiously, visuals were not particularly prominent until past the seventh hour. At that time, and for the next two hours, visual effects -- with open and closed eyes -- were obvious, albeit not very brightly colored.


The easy return to baseline took three hours, bringing the total duration of the experience to twelve.


Worthy of note was the odd lack of humor throughout the entirely of the test. On the other hand, good things like depth, introspection, creativity, empathy, libido and aesthetic appreciation were abundantly present.


Overall, I would describe this experience as having had a serious tone, but that seems to be typical for me while under the influence of LSZ. My tests from years ago had a similar character.

Cool blast from the past. Have you gotten a handle on the sweet spot for dosing this (maybe in comparison to LSD) for anyone with a limited stash that wants to explore this one?


I only tried it once at 150ug iirc and I remember a slightly serious tone to it as well, which could have been due to circumstances tbh. 150ug didnt seem overwhelming or anything, weaker than LSD.

Hey, Star. For me, 150ug is too mild -- an underdose, which is wasteful and annoying -- but 300-450ug is fine. I prefer 450ug, but 300ug is decent enough. Since you're very experienced with psychedelics, I would recommend 375ug. With that dose, you should have a reasonably strong experience without having to worry about becoming overwhelmed. After that, you can adjust future doses up or down, if necessary.


Keep in mind that the onset tends to be unusually slow (as with 2C-P); be patient and the reward will probably come. Also, an LSZ trip's potentially somber tone means that set and setting is probably even more important than usual.

I'd say 300ug is maybe like 100ug LSD so quite inline 225ug equalling 75ug. It's less visual, euphoric and seems to lack most of the spiritual and intellectual aspects of LSD (and yes very slow) - it's very stripped back compared with L but being less head fucky could make it potentially good for some situations. 450ug sounds like more of a dose but the side effects the times I tried 300 didn't make me very keen to go higher but it does have it's fans

Lsz is kinda meh, it's not bad but nothing special. Messing around R2/R3 (lsz, mipla, eipla, ...) destroys the magic of lysergamides imo. The diethyl amide is necessary to retain the magic. R6 subs keep the magic too, and are all unique vs lsd, but still feel like lysergamides. R1 subs retain the magic too most of the time... shorter subs like 1a or 1p lsd are better at retaining the magic but longer ones tend to lose some magic and potency (see 1b-lsd).


300 ug is a nice dose for lsz, about as intense as 150 or maybe 200 ug lsd/1a-lsd/1p-lsd, but more boring both mentally and visually. Higher doses  cause nausea to most people so increasing the dose isn't a good idea for most. If you haven't tried it, you haven't missed anything special. It was ok, but not something that I'd love to see return (I'd love more R6 subs, the few great R1 subs and combinations of R6 and R1 subs (1a-eth-lad for example)).

I wonder if LSZ would be a good microdose for workdays. Y'know since everyone finds it on the serious/boring side.


Trying to figure out the best way to use up a limited stash.


Or maybe it would be good in combo with AL-LAD, balance all that silliness out a bit ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


What do you think?

I remember when I had LSZ, my favorite experiences with it were in combination with AL-LAD. I tried 75ug + 75ug and 150 + 150. That second dose was the closest in headspace to LSD itself, but with the unreal/dreamy feeling of LSZ and the amazing AL-LAD visuals. 


I still have a leftover 75 ug. Don't really know what to do with it. Should probably combine with AL-LAD I guess. Maybe mix a disso in too.

I still have a sheet of it. I was on a buying spree when AL-LAD and LSZ came about because I figured they would not be around long. I also found LSZ to be rather odd. I do agree that smaller doses are disagreeable, overall, and that the compound shined for me at 300 to 450ug. Also, I agree that it is less visual in terms of colors/shapes/patterns, and takes a while to kick in. I remember that the best visuals, which seemed to come out of nowhere, came about 3 or 4 hours after dosing, and it all happened at once. I remember going out in the dark, with only the streetlights on, and everything just changed, almost instantly, and suddenly everything was bathed in psychedelia. And it does seem to have a sinister vibe, and not happy go lucky like an AL-LAD. I also experienced more nausea than usual, but I think that was a 450+ dose, perhaps 600ugs. It has been sealed and vaulted and to be honest, I don't know what I will do with it. I have enough "other things" that I don't go looking for it. But I am sure I will get at it again. Same with ETH-LAD. Have almost a sheet of that which I may or may not ever use. I tried it a couple of times and while interesting, the bodyload seemed too heavy, and I usually don't think much about bodyload.

^ I also find ETH-LAD a little too heavy and too punishing. Everytime I try it I end up feeling guilty for taking a drug, which is annoying as hell. I have a friend who reported a similar effect. It says more about how deeply rooted some of our cultural biases against drugs are than about the substance itself, but for some reason ETH-LAD *really* brings that kind of shit out. That being said, a low-dose of ETH-LAD as a supplement to a larger LSD dose can be nice.

Interesting.  My one large dose of ETH-LAD (300ug, my first trip on it) was very strong, incredibly visual, yet I felt emotionally and mentally serene, it reminded me of mescaline in the peace and comfort I felt.  Since then I haven't taken it in large doses but I have combined it as part of a trip with ALD-52 or AL-LAD.  Never really experienced difficulty with it though the come-up does contain more bodyload than other lysergamides I've tried.  I'm not sure why I haven't taken another full dose of it to be honest, I think it's probably about time I do.

It looks like this should be back soon, listing is up, no prices yet. This was the only one I missed out I did all the other grey area lysergamides that came out after but missed LSZ

I'm really excited that LSZ will get a second shot here.. it seemed like she might have gotten sidelined when her hotter sister, AL-LAD, came out right after. Looking forward to any reports that come out from this second round.

I never got a chance to try LSZ, I ordered some  but the order never arrived and by the time they would reship, they were sold out.  I am down to try any LSD analogue that is more different from LSD than a 1-sub of LSD.

this is an interesting observation.


as mostly a mini doser (heavy microdoser 20-35 mics more than once/week) these two Eth-Lad and LSZ both shone brightly producing extra sensitivity (many people would call it anxiety) as well as sharpened concentration or interest - the ordinary world gets much more depth the way I use it. 


1p-LSD similarly provides this edge. but the name "LSZ" lends a cool comic book feel to the activities.


1cp, alLad, and ald52 are also great but have lighter minidose effects, but still great.

I enjoyed my time with Lizzie.

I'd agree its not as deep as LSD. It was sorta stoney. Like the indica of lysergamides. I enjoyed taking it an looking at the clouds. Usually 2 blotters, but I don't remember what they were dosed at. Probably the same ones everyone else had.

I kinda agree with this sentiment. But I associate Indicas with anxiolytic bliss, and I remember the comedown from LSZ being kinda moody and a little bit edgy.

Well this one is back. Color me surprised--it never sounded that good to me in the first place. I won't be bothering with it, but I know a lot of you were hoping to add this to the collection and the window has reopened, so you may want to start looking.

I really liked LSZ back in the day when it first appeared. Sadly it's controlled nowadays where I live. 


Maybe we'll see 1p-LSZ or even something like ETH-LSZ one day ![🤞](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f91e.png)

I kinda liked it, it has a serious tone a little bit like 2C-E does. I think part of its unpopularity was majorly caused by the fact that it was released at the same time Al-LAD was, which is much more widely appreciated. Btw, i remember those two synergized really nicely.


But Im sure you will find LSZ at least interesting. It has a unique flavor for sure.

Too bad the only vendor that has it is in a country where orders are taking 2 months or more, if they even arrive. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)  I have an outstanding order with them that is going on 3 months now, no love letter and no package.

I got a couple LSZ blotters where they were as easy to get as cigarettes. That and almost all LSD analogues....but the best store of them all, which was in my country, not in europe, not asia, not USA, it was the best effing candystore for psychedelics, too bad they had to sell off all they had to european stores. Canadian customs are a bitch nowadays and not worth wasting money or even worse btc on european sources, once I got a blotter sheet in a regular envelope with a normal amount of paper in it of clonazolam seized, I gave up, after the one European source I had that never failed just closed out of the blue while I was browsing to buy, the guy was doing all the business by himself and he couldn't handle the stress anymore, making him sick physically he was saying. A shame, as much as losing that no-border-crossings source.


I never touched them though, they're sitting somewhere in a safe, in the original mylar bag they came in, they were a gift for buying something else. It never got great reviews like ETH-LAD (best happy feeling psychedelic of all time, the comedown is nowhere like the philosophical hell that can sometimes follow LSD), AL-LAD, 1P-ETH-LAD, 1P-LSD (although I'm glad it is still very accessible and that some minds out there will benefit from it, I'd rather just take real "street" LSD than this) and butyl-LSD, that last one I got more than I can spare, never done it either though, it's in powder form and well, I got it at extreme fire sale prices, I think it's one of the analogues Nick Sand invented, I think? If not, there's a butyl in there of that analogue he produced out in BC in the late 90's that other people continued to sell on the streets for a long time and still may be, once I fell in a pool with my cellphone in it about a decade ago, I lost so many contacts, golden ones, which led me to the heavy shit I always promised myself not to mess with (smoking freebase, shooting opioids).


Anyways, LSZ was said to be underwhelming in some and I vaguely remember some reports here and elsewhere that made it somehow...not too enticing, so I cautiously gave myself and my friends many ETH-LAD and AL-LAD trips. A friend of mine stopped drinking back in 2014 from a mixed AL-LAD and LSD trip and never went back. The 2015 purchased LSZ blotters are 150ug. But I would have to review all the old posts around here before I can definitely say "hell yeah, that's good news!"

That was a rollercoaster of a post there [@THE_REAL_OBLIVION](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/67802/) I didn't know there were LSD analogues being distributed in BC in the late 90s, that's super cool. Sweet you scored a good deal on the powder, I'm jealous.

Honestly, random LSD analogues would be a pretty good Occam's Razor answer as to why different batches of LSD have 'different' effects. Many of us very well could have tried analogues before we knew they existed and thought we simply had a different 'batch' of acid.

This became available domestically but given the price I doubt I’ll give it a whirl. So glad I got in on some of the other analogues  before they returned as rare collectors items (lol)

I am sitting here gambling on bitcoin going up before I pull trigger on a sample reading old trip reports. This report I assume is of 150 mic hits, took 4 and could hear each others thoughts


I couldn't tell by now if my eyes were open or closed, but I do remember looking at E, and hearing his voice within my head. This creeped me the fuck out at first, and strangely, E looked equally as spooked. I suddenly realised that I could communicate with E (or so I thought) without opening my mouth. We entered into fragmented discussions about what we were experiencing, and how this was possible.

This shit could be epic and give you super powers lol, but unlike the guy at the start of this thread who bought a 100 never having tried it, I'm going to buy 5 and check it out. I still have the other 4 hits of my ETH-LAD sample, thank god i didn't buy a sheet of that.

Thank you so much, [@Psychestim](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/543082/) !

Would love to hear reports from folks who tried those bunk blotters. How were their trips? Just weak, or with added physical discomfort?

I have both the LSZ and the pink 1P-LSD blotters but I haven’t tried them yet.


I had one half of these LSZ blotters lab-tested myself and the result was LSZ, as expected. 


Purity wasn’t determined though and I imagine it’s pretty hard to detect novel lysergamide stereoisomers, so it’s probably possible that my LSZ is actually trans-LSZ. I messaged the testing-facility and will probably hand in another, full LSZ tab and one of these 1P-LSD blotters. The good thing is they have referance material for 1P, so they can quantitatively analyze the contents as well.

The most important factor for me is vendors trustworthy-ness rather than the price. I saw those colored blotters on reddit glad my vendor sells the real ones. 

Back in the 80s and 90s I used to get GI issues from LSD, the problem was it wasn't consistent. One hit caused "gutrot" and the one next to it you took a month later didn't. And now it never happens no matter where i source the LSD, so I wrote it off as my teenage body chemistry not Pickard's microdots. I'm still not sold on 10 micrograms of impurities causing stomach issues, though I don't want to open the dirty/pure acid debate either.

Finally took took 1.5 of these 225 mics. I have been reading these reports for so long I was half expecting Ayahusca purging or something, I had minor stomach flutters. I don't know, I got zero visuals which is a metric I use to judge how strong something is so it's hard to say if it's close to LSD strength. If I took this amount of 1cp-LSD I would have visuals, and that is much cheaper. "LSZ it's like acid but no visuals", isn't a real strong selling point. AL-LAD and ETH LAD offered something different not sure what LSZ brings to the table that is different or unique. Its okay and I enjoyed it but visuals are kind of why I am here. Maybe this shit is great for CEV's with headphones or whatever, I guess every drug has it's place. This is add a ten strip to the stash rather than buy a sheet, but if larger doses improve my opinion of this I'm open to it, next one is 300 or more. Grade C+

IMO you're missing a lot of what makes psychedelics beautiful and magical if you're only using them for visuals. I was like that when I first started using psychedelics in high school, so I understand that perspective, and I'd really recommend paying attention to somatic, emotional, and psychological aspects of tripping. That's where the magic really comes from, in my experience.

I've never done LSZ. I'm simply commenting that I think it's missing a lot to disregard an experience because of a lack of visuals. For instance, many of my ALD-52 and LSD trips are less visual, the more psychologically depthful they are. The visuals just disappear.

5-meo-DMT has no visuals and its great, LSZ isn't even remotely as earth shattering as that though. Even if you were looking for some cosmic mystical trip, I'd probably look elsewhere for that too rather than LSZ.  When I take a bigger dose my opinion on it may change.

Probably gonna be trying this tonight at 300ug each with my GF...

This is the one Lysergamide I never thought I'd get to try out but I managed to snag a few tabs at a ridiculously high price relative to other analogs....I'm really hoping I end up getting some 1V-LSD next before it disappears from the market ....heard it's getting banned in NL.

Well...unfortunately I'd have to rate this maybe a 6/10

I tried it at 300ug

It's by far the most clear headed Lysergamide I've ever tried.... Absolutely ZERO mindfuck (that typical cosmic lsd headspace) definitely had some decent visuals but nothing spectacular.  Mostly just bubling and morphing of patterns on the ceiling.

It definitely caused a lot of neck muscle tension and some very slight gastrointestinal issues but very minor.

I'd have to say out of all the analogs I've tried this one is one of the least interesting and most expensive....but as always YMMV!!!!

For me I'd rate the analogs from personal favorite to least would be

1P-ETH-LAD > ETH-LAD > 1P-LSD > ALD-52 > AL-LAD > LSZ > 1CP-LSD

Yet to try 1V.... but I'm super eager to try that one especially!!

You need to try AL-LAD... I find that one super interesting and unique.  Extremely recreational, it has a very euphoric and silly headspace, with unique visuals, and at higher dosages, a pretty unique sort of unreality to its headspace.

Oh I've definitely done quite a bit of AL-LAD  and it's lovely material but consistently produces very bad back neck pain as does Ald-52 but Eth-LAD and 1P-LSD for me me have the cleanest most visual trips with really no side effects at all for myself. The one I actually liked the least was 1cP-LSD....it produced lots muscle tremors, muscle tension and a very VERY  stimulating feeling that lingered after the comedian....it was fun and visual but had a lot of negatives with my own body chemistry.

[@Ballz_Trippington](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/301774/)   maybe you forgot to do your morning push-ups, stretches and tummy crunches,

you cannot take drugs and just neglect the way the body goes all to pot.

Oh I work out regularly....And I have to I pour molten metal for a living...extremely hard and physical difficult....but also have Eosinophilic Facciitis and so basically a very difficult to treat autoimmune inflammation disorder.

A lot of psychedelics trigger inflammation throughout my body especially Phenethylamines but certain Lysergamides are really bad.

Surprisingly,  ETH-LAD and 1P-LSD have never invoked any muscle tension or inflammation....even super pure GG LSD cause some degree of neck and back and wrist and ankle inflammation....I've been of my Ketogenic diet which is the only thing I've found besides corticosteroids and Methotrexate to help and I won't take either of those two to help...also some benzos with strong muscle relaxation properties like Diazepam really help but the Keto Diet for myself has been by for the most benefit.

sounds like you arre on top of your overall mento-physical ecology. 

I really look forward to a day when auto-immune disorders are a thing of the past.

My heart goes out to you and absolutely anyone suffering with an autoimmune disorder....I suffered for decades and just figured I guess I'm getting arthritis....but what is most perplexing is that I have what appears to be severe rhumatoid arthritis but my blood work always comes back Seronegative for rhumatoid factors....my sister tests positive for rheumatoid factors but is asymptomatic....my cousin has Eosinophilic Faciitis but is also Seronegative....no idea what tge fuck is going on with inflammation genetically within my family but it seems to be unusual and severe...

After prednisone and methotrexate were hardly keeping my symptoms in check....I literally watched a YouTube video about a guy who was suffering in a similar manner as myself and thought it was completely bullocks that carbohydrates might be tge problem but I was so desperate and in so much absolutely crippling pain that I just decided to try this low/no carb diet for a month and see what happens....was expecting nothing....

Within 2 weeks all my inflammation began to recede....it was probably the most shocking moment in my entire life .

I'm not sure what your autoimmune issues are but there is a solution out there somewhere....I know how discouraging it can be but if there's anything I could do to help you please send me a message I'm always happy to help anyone who needs it in any capacity.

I read in NYTimes that diet coke (saccharine and aspartame) can aggravate these symptoms

Lol then it must be true....

For myself, I hate most diet soda but I'm quite fond of Coke zero, diet Dr pepper and diet a&w root beer.

Some Zevia isn't too bad imho too.

Buy I've noticed no negative effects from sugar substitutes...just from actual sugar and carbs.
