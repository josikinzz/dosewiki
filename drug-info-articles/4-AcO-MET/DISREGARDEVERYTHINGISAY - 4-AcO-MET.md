**4-Acetoxy-MET** (**4-Acetoxy-*****N*****-methyl-*****N*****-ethyltryptamine**, **metacetin** or **4-AcO-MET**) is a psychedelic tryptamine thought to be a serotonergic psychedelic similar to 4-AcO-DMT, LSD and DMT. Its molecular structure and pharmacological effects resemble those of the tryptamine psilocin which is the primary psychoactive chemical in magic mushrooms.

In terms of its chemistry, 4-AcO-MET is the acetate ester of 4-HO-MET. It is a substituted tryptamine with an acetoxy group at the 4 position of the cyclohexane ring, an ethyl chain and a methyl chain on the nitrogen position.

It is hypothesized that this compound is quickly hydrolyzed into the free phenolic 4-HO-MET, although human studies concerning the metabolic fate of this drug are lacking. This would explain a somewhat similar experience in their subjective effects. This is similar to how 4-AcO-DMT is thought to be deacetylated to 4-HO-DMT during first pass metabolism and subsequent passes through the liver.

In terms of its pharmacology, 4-AcO-MET’s psychedelic effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the 5-HT2A receptor as a partial agonist. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

4-AcO-MET is commonly sold as a research chemical through the use of online vendors. In terms of its effects, it can be vaguely described as somewhat more synthetic in feel to that of other tryptamines but with a shorter duration.

The effects listed below are based upon the [subjective effects index](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index) and personal experiences of [PsychonautWiki](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) contributors. The listed effects will rarely if ever occur all at once but heavier dosages will increase the chances and are more likely to induce a full range of effects.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of 4-AcO-MET can be broken down into three components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- [Spontaneous tactile sensations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Spontaneous_tactile_sensations) - The “body high” of 4-AcO-MET can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft and all-encompassing tingling sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- [Sedation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Sedation) - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, 4-AcO-MET is considered by most to be relaxing, stoning and mildly sedating. This sense of sedation is often accompanied by compulsive yawning.
- [Nausea](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Nausea)

**Cognitive Effects:**

The cognitive effects of 4-AcO-MET are described by many as somewhat relaxing, yet face-paced in style with similarities to psychedelics such as LSD or 2C-B which tend to be cognitively energetic and stimulating. The drug contains a large number of typical and unique psychedelic cognitive effects.

The most prominent of these typical effects generally include:

- [Enhancement of current mind state](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Enhancement_of_current_mind_state)
- [Connectivity of thought](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Connectivity_of_thought)
- [Acceleration of thought](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Acceleration_of_thought)
- [Feelings of fascination, importance and awe](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Feelings_of_fascination,_importance_and_awe)
- [Time distortion](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Time_distortion)
- [Outrospection](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Outrospection)
- [Thought loops](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Thought_loops)
- [Removal of cultural filter](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Removal_of_cultural_filter)
- [Conceptual thinking](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Conceptual_thinking)
- [Direct communication with the subconscious](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Direct_communication_with_the_subconscious)
- [Ego suppression, loss and death](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Ego_suppression,_loss_and_death)
- [Feelings of interdependent opposites](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Feelings_of_interdependent_opposites)
- [Delusions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Delusions)
- [States of unity and interconnectedness](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_States_of_unity_and_interconnectedness)

**Visual effects:**

*Enhancements*

4-AcO-MET presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally includes:

- **[Increased visual acuity](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Increased_visual_acuity)**
- **[Enhancement of colour](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Enhancement_of_colour)**
- **[Enhanced pattern recognition](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Enhanced_pattern_recognition)**

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, the effects experienced are detailed below:

- [Drifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting) *([Melting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting#Melting), [Flowing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting#Flowing), [Breathing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting#morphing))* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, cartooon-like in style, slow and smooth in motion and static in appearance.
- [Tracers](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics#Tracers)
- [After images](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics#After_images)
- [Texture repetition](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics#Symmetrical_texture_repetition)
- [Colour shifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics#Colour_shifting)
- [Scenery slicing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics#Scenery_Slicing)

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as somewhat similar in appearance to that of Psilocin, 4-AcO-DMT and 4-HO-MiPT but with far stronger synthetic digital undertones reminiscent of LSD or 2C-B. 4-AcO-MET can be comprehensively described through its [variations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, equally synthetic and organic in style, structured in organization, extremely brightly lit and multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, sharp in edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, angular in corners, unimmersive in depth and consistent in intensity. The visuals have a contradictory “natural” and “synthetic” feel to them which is reminiscent of both LSD and and Psilocybin. Higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of [Level 8A](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) visual geometry over [Level 8B](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B).

*Hallucinatory States*

4-AcO-MET and its various other forms produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. These effects generally include:

- [Transformations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Transformations)
- [Internal hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations) ([Autonomous entities](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Autonomous_entities), [Settings, sceneries, and landscapes](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes), [Alterations in perspective](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Alterations_in_perspective) and [Scenarios and plots](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Scenarios_and_plots)) - This effect is very consistent in dark environments at appropriately high dosages. They can be comprehensively described through their [variations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, geometry-based in style and almost exclusively of a religious, spiritual, mystical, science fiction or transcendental nature in overall theme.

**Auditory Effects:**

The auditory effects of 4-AcO-MET are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- **[Enhancements](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_effects:_Enhancements)**
- **[Distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_effects:_Distortions)**
- **[Hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_effects:_Hallucinations)**

**Physical Health Effects, Potential Addiction and Tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational 4-AcO-MET use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 4-AcO-MET is a research chemical with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried 4-AcO-MET within the psychonaut community suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

There is no current data for the LD50 of 4-AcO-MET, but it is thought to be high.

4-AcO-MET does not seem to be physically addictive and many users experience a self-regulating quality. There seems to be a tolerance build up when used consecutively multiple days in a row which requires one to double their dosage each time to achieve the same effects.

**Legal issues:**

**USA:** 4-Acetoxy-MET is unscheduled in the United States, but the possession and sale of 4-Acetoxy-MET could possibly be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act if intent to consume can be proven because of its structural similarities to psilocin.

**Conclusion:**

4-AcO-MET induced a trip which was distinctively different from that of other more commonly used research chemicals that I have tried. The colourful, digital and synthetic geometry was in sharp contrast to that of 4-AcO-DMT, psilocybin and ayahuasca. This combined with its shorter duration and equally insightful headspace made for a therapeutic and recreational experience somewhat halfway between that of mushrooms and LSD.
