I seem to be hogging this thread.


It is time for my next mescaline journey. This one will take place in an expansive sand dune desert a couple of hours from where I live, at night to avoid other people and the glaring summer sun. I'm taking a considerably larger amount than last time and tripping solo, which makes me a little wary, but I have a system worked out: bring a GPS and phone, follow the beach line and don't lose sight of the ocean, so provided I'm adequately prepared, not much can really go wrong.


Now fellow Bluelighters you have been so helpful before, I have a few more questions...


[Query redacted by user]


I plan to pulverise the cactus into powder with a coffee grinder, both for ease of transport and to try a new method of ingestion with minimal alkaloid loss. Does anyone have experience with this method? Is it easier to get down than just drinking it? I'm not intending to use gelcaps, just putting it on the tongue and following with water.


As ever, thanks for any and all replies.

**Mescaline Vs. LSD**


I have been trying to acquire some mescaline lately, and I was wondering for when I get it what would be a good starter dose for someone who is trying to get acquainted with the mind altering substance.  Im a highly experienced tripper and have done many a drug, LSD being my favorite. 

 I'm sorry if this seems like a "what should I take" thread, but it is meant purely just so I can get some advice from experienced mescaline users.

Asking for a starter dosage isn't a "What should I take?" thread, so don't worry there. This would be best in the big [Mescaline/Cactus thread](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=377136) though, so it'll likely be merged with that thread soon. However since you're still new, it's courtesy to let you reply first. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I'd always advise a more cautious starter dose than that for any drug, simply on principle - you don't know how you're going to react, and it's best to get to know the substance first. However, IF you have a safe reaction to it, 400mg ought to be fine for someone who's already experienced with psychedelics.

^I concur (first setence).  

I was already very experienced with LSD, LSA, mushrooms and DXM before I had the opportunity to try mescaline.  It's not like it's the grandpappy of psychedelics or anything, but it obviously has a whole different personality than what one might be used to expecting.

how did your trip go ?? it sounds like a good setting, and GPS i always find fucking useful too


i ate some dried cactus i'd kept for a few months the other day, but i fucked up on predicting how things would turn out, the plan was to see this band on the other side of town, but it wasn't so easy, plus bad bad nausea. good closed eye visuals though, but they were mild. it was kind of like taking 20-60mg of MDMA with a tripped twist, i didnt want a big trip


i pottered about a forest the next day, in retrospect i should've eaten 2C-B that night and saved the mescaline for the forest

Kind of a screw-up. I ended up just boiling it again, but botched the operation and ended up with four cups worth of almost solid sludge. It took me two hours to get through two thirds of it, after which I gave up; it would have been easier to just eat it raw. The trip was mild and not worth driving three hours to the sand dunes for. However, some interesting things did happen and I would like to do it again someday, probably on mushrooms though.


The very first thing that happened when I started feeling the slightest effects was, I ran into someone I haven't seen in a long time... who lives six hours away. I was once this man's student in a cult, before he disappeared with a great deal of my money. It was very distressing to see him again, especially while I was tripping - I wanted to confront him, I'd been imagining doing just that for a long time, but I called a friend for advice and he reminded me that if things went badly, it would effect the trip and it could psychologically damage me. I had to let him go, but I got the bastard's number plate, and stared him in the eye as he drove away (I don't think he recognised me).


This whole episode really threw me, and I spent most of the trip feeling nihilistic and unhappy, but making the most of it. The desert was truly beautiful. Playing haunting ambient music under the stars was magic. In some parts, the dunes stretched on in all directions and it felt like being in the middle of the Sahara. I also listened to The Walk and Tick Tock by Gazpacho (prog rock songs about Antoine de Saint Exupery when he was lost in a desert) and it was amazing.


At one point I thought I saw a lighthouse off in the distance, and decided to spend the night heading towards it. As I got closer though, it turned out I'd been pursuing the headlights of cars that were driving around in circles on the beach. For a full hour I ran through the sparse shrubs, hiding behind what little cover I could find, as these 4-wheel drives came after me. I had no idea who they were or what they wanted. They might have been rescue workers, or kids who wouldn't mind beating the shit out of / killing some random guy wandering the sands, after all no one would ever find out... As it turned out, they hadn't seen me at all, but merely kept coming close to me by coincidence. I eventually realised they were just tourists on dune driving tours (in the middle of the night?!) but it was exhilerating all the same, literally running for my life while tripping.


I've decided to try again this week, staying at home this time, the drive just wasn't worth it. If anyone has tips on the best way to get down 18 inches of cactus, I'm all ears. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

yes i've taken to simply blending raw cactus and eating that without the cooking shizz, i still get effects, i asked a police officer if he knew where to buy some crack cocaine. but i think fresh works better then dry cactus


you had sand dunes beaches and deserts !! i've been dreaming of moving to oceania recently, im in the city with horrifically brightly lit electric trains and concrete pavements. sounds fucking sweet tripping in the desert, i can only imagine the stars in the sky


sounds bad you bumped into that guy but good idea to have called a friend for advice. well i find, too, it can be difficult catching courage in situations under pressure. what you could do is make a big voodoo of him and then just burn it or something, burning man style, or find some way to get a sense of psychological closure from this guy


jesus you thought they were trying to kill you ? maybe it shows how much you want to live ! sounds like an adventure


as for eating it, you could cook it with food, i've seen some recipes on the internet i've been wondering about trying. one of them simply fried cactus chunks with spring onions ?? i think it's pretty open to experimentation to be honest. perhaps **a mescaline sandwich **!


EDIT: upon further reflection, i'd also like to push the idea that perhaps cactus alkaloids can continue to metabolize and be absorbed by the human body for a few days after you eat the cactus, in your digestion system. i ate a combination of three different organic trichaosaurus* at the same time which brought these kinds of aftereffects, and after seeing the erowid page of the different chemical makeups of the different cacti, i think i may be right

[http://www.erowid.org/plants/cacti/cacti_guide/cacti_guide_trichoce.shtml](http://www.erowid.org/plants/cacti/cacti_guide/cacti_guide_trichoce.shtml)

so i think similarly to mild/noticable effects lingering with LSD, for hours, even days, the cactus can also facilitate something similar, but in a different kind of metabolic way


EDIT2: i'd also like to add i think mescaline is one of the most seriously valuable substances, moreso then MDMA and perhaps even moreso [or in a different way?] then LSD.** it was both anne and sacha shulgins first trip, too !** but ofc PiHKAL readers may already know ... !


* spelt the way i like it to be spelt !

I'll need a quick response on this one if anyone could be so kind, as I'm boiling my cactus right now in preparation for tomorrow's trip. This is a redosing question, because I haven't been able to find much information on redosing mescaline.


I am boiling 18 inches. 8 of these inches are from the branch I used last time, so I know it's about average strength. I estimate I got down about 12 inches for 270mg mescaline last time; if the 10-inch branch is of similar potency, my 18-inch trip should give me about 405mg worth, a borderline strong trip according to Erowid. At the most, it probably won't be more than 500.


Now... I have 3 or 4 inches left over. If it doesn't reach the level I want, or if ~400mg turns out to be weaker than I was hoping, at what point is it too late to redose? I'm thinking of guaging how strong the trip is while I'm coming up, and if it's not enough, cutting up and eating the remaining 3 or 4 inches.


LSD and mushrooms have a cut-off point beyond which the trip doesn't get any stronger, just longer; that's why I'm asking.


**huolesoh:** Yeah it was a hell of an adventure, and I wasn't sure what they wanted but the worst-case scenario was they were thugs and they'd spotted me. Fortunately, neither turned out to be true. As for my former teacher - at least I got his number plate. I've tried many things to get over what happened, short of voodoo I must admit! - but ultimately I think getting my money back and exposing him in the process would be good closure.


The stars were great, among the most numerous and luminous I've ever seen them, and at 1a.m., the moon turned red-ish and sank under the horizon. I got minor visual activity when looking at the stars, could see demons mostly, and the face of God, which I haven't spotted since my second acid trip. On my THIRD acid trip, I saw deities of the Greek underworld. That was probably the coolest star effect I've ever had.


EDIT: A further question, because I've always been curious about this. People talk about taking legendary doses of LSD (700+ micrograms) or mushrooms (8+ grams), but one rarely hears the same for cacti. Is there a reason for that? Is a dose beyond 700mg of mescaline truly psychologically damaging or something?


I have found some information on redosing, the consensus is don't, but if you do, the two or three-hour mark would be the time. Apparently though it takes the trip in weird and unpleasant directions.

The first and only time I took San Pedro, I redosed about 1 hour and half after the first dose because we wanted more than a ++. ~1 hour later this second dose I was getting a deliciously strong full on +++. We ended taking 50g (dried) each instead of the 33g planned and it was perfect.

I gently boiled mine (it was dry, IDK if that make a difference) in acidic water for 2-3 hours and filtered it several times (first with a mesh than with cotton clothe). Then I putted it in the fridge until the next day. This way a lot of particles settled down in the bottom during the night and it was possible collect only the clearer liquid to consume (but we drank all of it eventually). If you can, it would be even better to let it sit 2-3 days in the fridge to let more of the particles settle down. It is easier to drink when it's cool too. I had a little bit of nausea but it wasn't that bad. My GF threw up but she's quite sensitive.

Damnit... mescaline, you win again... I got through anywhere from 10 to 15 inches before nausea made it impossible to continue. Currently swaying on the spot and waiting to throw up, then for a ++ trip, seems today is not the day to break through on mescaline either. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) So disappointed.


[returns after throwing up] Wow... I think that's the first time I've ever vomitted so hard it came out of my nose. Well, so much for redosing. I'm going to look up a simple extraction method.


[returns on the tail end of a... 6-hour trip?!] It appears that while I'm very sensitive to mushrooms, I'm not at all sensitive to mescaline... from now on, extracted mescaline only, and a minimum of 500mg of it. Used to be my favourite substance but I've felt underwhelmed of late.

I would recommend trying another type of cacti.  A 12" by 3" cutting of T. Bridgesii has always given me stronger trips than the same amount of San Pedro or Peruvian Torch.  I've done extractions with San Pedro and my yields weren't the best, if you want to try it then definitely go for it, but I much prefer the boiling and straining method.  Extracted mescaline makes me much more nauseated as well, but I don't think this is the case with most people.

With regard to the ginger tea: it seems that the anti emetic substance is not water soluble, so drink it with the ginger pieces for more effect. I think its anti emetic effect was linked to galanolactone.


Definitely look into extractions if you can't stand the taste. Moreover, even crude extracts are so much more convenient and consistent than eating raw cacti. On the other hand, a part of the cacti experience is left out, but that depends on your preference.


Hope you're luckier next time ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I always had a fantastic time eating a 12 inch t. bridgesii cactus, and I am no by no means a light doser. For comparison, I usually take about 30mg 2c-e orally, 35mg 2c-i, 100mg 2c-c, a little over an eighth of shrooms, 7mg + of DOC, etc...


But mescaline never made me puke, whereas literally all the other above substances have made me puked before. The bridgesii seemed to give me a more fully bodied and darker trip than a normal san pedro trip. I greatly preferred it.

Thanks. I tried both of these, but I think the sheer amount of liquid was what made me throw up. I was also taking in orange juice and water to mask the taste. Straining through a T-shirt was a good way to keep it consistently liquid.


I'll keep an eye out for T. Bridgesii, but it won't be for another four months or so - the effort and cost I have to go to for an unreliable trip is starting to piss me off, so I think I'll stick to acid and DMT for a while. Also if the extract proves too difficult, I'm thinking of just drying the cactus, grinding it up into powder (or using a cheese grater?), putting the powder on my tongue and swallowing. Probably doesn't taste as bad that way, even if I do throw it up.

Man a couple of weeks ago I finally returned to Mesc after an almost year long absence and mixed it up with the best combo I've ever found. The feeling of peace was just so........unbelievable. I always forgot literally how fucking much mesc will add any trip, I guess since you never really see the bottom of many wells you consider that the bottom is just there somewhere but mescaline is like an infinite well of depth to say the very least. Of course I was granted the feeling of eternal connection. On mescaline i've always just felt so connected to every living being, I remember once when I sat under a gigantic oak tree to smoke a joint on a walk through the woods. The feeling was so much more than splendid. Simply gazing upon the tree I could feel its specific resonance, the mark its left on this Earth, how unbelievably long it must of been here to reach such heights and grandeur. I could feel that it must have witnessed and been around for some incredible events, it felt so old that it most likely was granted the gift to witness the Earth form around it(in terms of the land around it changing over the hundred years of its life). When I touched my hand to its was like an electrical charge specified with that trees energy ran through me. Ah theres nothing like good ol'Mesc. Probably be returning as soon as the times right.

try GINGER ! it's surprisingly effective, another BL user who recommended it is Cryptix

EDIT: others beat me to it


but seriously in retrospect based on personal experiences i don't think i'll ever eat cacti without eating ginger at the same time

Mm I tried ginger, even chewed it raw. Usually it helps but not this time. Then again, it might have been slightly off, as it was discoloured on the inside.

That's fine, purging sucks but it lasts for less than a minute and I always feel better after. Whereas gulping down 18 inches worth of tea takes me at least half an hour. How does the powder taste - more endurable? I would think there'd at least be less of it to get down.

when i used 'powdered green flesh' back in the day i would just put 20g in a ~12oz glass of water and drink it down. if you drink it quickly its a sandy muck beverage...if you wait 30-60and let it rehydrate its a snot muck beverage. different times each are preferable...lol. i never got nauseous at all really, a couple times maybe, but i've never puked from it. i think diet is a factor i ate a very clean all natural vegetarian diet at the time. maybe the extreme of a juice fast beforehand could be helpful for quelling nausea, but i would recommend a raw foods or fruit fast for a few days beforehand. could go a long way, cant say for sure.


the cactus powder i use to get in quantity (i ate 100+g a month at the time, a student to the cactus), came from Peru and was strong enough that a small handful of the green sand was a strong strong experience. 40g was a full-on visionary trance which you don't even think about what 'coming down' is until near the 12th hour lol. 


oh and don't try eating the powder straight. lol you won't make it, no amount of saliva can compensate for that amount of sand, and if you're going to end up with a mouthful of liquid gunk anyways then you should just stir it up first as to avoid overwhelming textures. and, i've never seen someone finish consuming it if they adultered the jungle gunk with a flavor. someone added kool aid and never finished his glass, flavoring is not an effective means of masking the flavor.


i used to take the powder and make chocolates though, which was decently effective. i used carob to avoid potential maoi interactions, i am vegan afterall, so i'd avoid milk chocolates and be using a high percentage cocoa. regardless of the potential maoi effects though, a chocolate made as small as possible was a decent means of 'choking it down' for my friends. i just melted them, added honey, added as much cactus as i could while maintaining a chocolatey texture and then sometimes added organic rice krispies lol. could get a dose down to something like a half muffin worth of solid chocolate...it definitely didn't taste good, but texturally was prefered by my more sensitive friends. i've never had a problem with drinking sludge personally, but i tried a few different preparations on my friends behalves.


one time i threw a bag of cactus sand into quarter jar of peanut butter and mixed it then swallowed it almost all whole lol. that was decently effective i must say...

you should filter and reduce volume, so 18" would be about 1-2 shots worth of syrup(much easier than 50-100 OO gelcaps

imo)


for me, the plant matter has caused not just a purge, but hours of stomach discomfort and the runs too

I tried an ounce of powdered peruvian torch a few years ago. I didn't feel any nausea really but it took a long ass time to eat that much material. First we tried mixing it with chocolate but it turned into a slimy mess. I ended up just rolling it into balls with a little water and swallowing them like pellets. 


I know people often cook it down to reduce volume, but is it really very difficult to extract the mescaline from the cactus? Does anyone have any idea how with basic lab reagents and tools?

I've wondered that before. There's a Big and Dandy Mescaline Extraction Thread, and the first method there sounds simple and cheap, no need for chemistry expertise or toxic elements. Still I don't want to resort to that unless I have to, because the cactus alkaloid content counts to the trip and I'd probably screw it up anyway.


Thanks thoughtsUnThought. When the time comes, I'll try it with powder and water. Now I must ask about getting it down to powder to start with. Tried drying cactus in an oven once, but it ended up melting into goo, whereas I thought it was supposed to get hard and stale. Assuming I can get it dried correctly, can I grind it down with a cheese grater or something instead of a coffee grinder? Those things are expensive and I'd only end up using it for this one particular purpose anyway.

i imagine you could get little flakes by using a cheese grater..but i dont know if it'll suffice. it'll definitely effect the texture when you put water in it. i'm not a much of a texture-guy, so i wouldn't mind, but having little flakey chunks mixed in with your slime cup may be undesirable.


really i'd shoot for (was gonna say walmart but you're in australia lol) a cheap home-appliance section of a mart and get a 10 dollar blade grinder. you shouldn't pay more than that, the kinda good ones are 20 i think, so 10 should get you a cactus grinder lol.


but yeah, i've never dried it myself..i have a dehydrator now, but thats at 350 investment...i'm sure oven drying would work if you left it in long enough, just make sure the temps not too high. i know mescaline can survive heat, but i'm sure it doesn't like it

i find it extremely curios the common cacti has evaded law enforcement all this time - the most basic, historical psychedelic, even LSD was once upon a time referred to as a "mescaline analogue" according to PiHKAL - perhaps mescaline just hasn't and isn't capable of causing the same level of social hypocrisy as LSD, but even the mushroom has become outcast by the anti-drug lobbyists, and for a good few years. even cannabis has too, strangely, been banned in most western countries


but how has the cacti remained under the radar ?? maybe it's profoundly unparticularly-delicious flavour has protected it from latent popularity ?? maybe it's simply the low potency ??? i find it a counter-intuitive curiosity

One reason that comes to mind is that cacti are much more appealing aesthetically as ornamentals. Mescaline is also much less popularly known than mushrooms and LSD, especially in non-peyote forms. I dunno though.

I've asked the same question, huolesoh. There was a time when mescaline was one of the 'classics' alongside LSD and mushrooms, which suggests to me that people used to consume it often. Why people have suddenly gotten cold feet about the flavour, I don't know. But I think our current culture is more geared towards immediate satisfaction. LSD is a piece of paper you stick on your tongue, you chew shrooms for all of one minute, and you're tripping within the hour. Cactus takes a great deal of preparation and, in *ahem* some cases, many failed attempts before you get any results, and even then those results are like to be vomiting, nausea and body load.


**The failed cactus student returns with more questions.**


A Bluelighter told me via PM that three hours might not be enough time to boil the cactus juice. This might explain why my past yields have been so poor. Is it best to keep adding water and simmer the stuff for as long as possible to get the highest yield? My objective was always to separate it as fast as possible from the solid stuff and just drink it, so I used minimum water. Perhaps now, I'll FINALLY get a solid trip when I simmer my twenty inches for twelve hours! (Too solid?)


Could I then simmer the remaining liquid down to almost nothing? The mescaline survives so I assume you could theoretically burn the liquid away until you just have mescaline. I wouldn't go that far, but why not reduce it to 50mLs of disgusting tea if it can indeed be done?

Simmering the blended cactus for two hours before straining has always proven successful for me.  After you strain it, you can always continue reducing to your desired amount.  I would not try to boil all of the liquid away but instead use a very small pot to reduce it to 50mL so you don't risk destroying the mescaline.

I don't think so, willow. By my method, it's always been a pretty clear, if thick, liquid.


Damn Ethyl, I was so set on this new method of simmering it longer. I'll try it anyway, and hope for the best. Maybe bring some LSD along in case the trip is as weak as usual. For the 50mL idea; that is what I was thinking, and for the same reason.


Well, I'll update in a few weeks time when I get the chance to try this again, if I remember.

yes i think you are right, here. have been thinking along these lines too


the endless quick fixes of a burn-out society............


as for getting stronger effects, the trick i've discovered is to eat all the cactus, strain it, drink it, then eat it all. the nausea is more profound done this way, so be sure to finely chop up some ginger and consume lots of that, too. of course you'll want to make the cactus as finely ground up as possible to ensure maximum absorbtion


done this way you will feel nauseous initally, but it inevitably fades, and you'll catch the altered perceptions, heightened awareness

Flickering, yeah, I didn't read that you were talking about strained cactus 'tea', for some reason I thought you were talking about boiling pure sludge...My bad...


I don't really know why mescaline isn't more widely used when compared to other drugs, but I would note that the earliest 'psychedelic movement' in the western world involved mescaline/peyote. It held a unique place in a society that used things like morphine, heroin, cocaine relatively freely. You will find people like Aleister Crowley talking about it in his writings as well as its early isolation from peyote in the late 1890's. Things like ayahuasca/yage, hallucinogenic mushrooms, LSA contaning seeds, snuffs, etc were known at that time period, but were often seen poisonous or immoral. Mescaline wast the first psychedelic isolated and was seen as the benchmark simply because of its early history. In other words, I don't think people disregard mescaline just because it can be difficult to ingest and possibly time consuming; its effects are largely superseded by stronger and more potent psychedelics. I think we can more readily attach personalised western mythology onto LSD then we can mescaline; and regardless, LSD certainly played a more dominant role in shaping modern society then mescaline did.


I must add, I think mescaline is truly a wonderful substance. Its an uncomparable feeling with a true signature of its own. I don't buy into the romanticising of mescaline as organic and warm, because (at high enough doses) it is not all that different to something like acid, but at a lowish dose of 300mg, it is very enjoyable. I've had my most successful experiences with synthetic. I've had my most rewarding trips on synthetic mescaline and LSD. Yay...

**First ever psychedelic experience on Peruvian Torch?**


Hi everyone, I am new to this forum as well as entheogens and everything related in general, so I am pretty much a noob here. Hopefully I am posting in the right section so here it goes. 


With a friend I am planning on my first ever psychedelic experience. I've never tried anything before apart from pot which I did three times. Once via a joint where I didn't really feel anything, just a bit shaky which wasn't pleasant. The second time was from a bong, it hit me straight away, lots of coughing, feeling weak and shaky (I hardly ate that day, maybe that's why?), and alcohol like vision. I went through lots of different feelings, scared, etc and had a bit of a bad experience, most likely due to the setting, there were people around that I did not know, and I never really knew what to expect. One of the best parts of my experience was when I looked in the mirror when trying to wash my face and it looked as if it was in a kaleidoscope where different shapes where seen, hard to explain, especially because it was over a year ago. Oh and munchies too. The third experience was from a bottle and slightly less than a year later, with different people and while drunk. It was a good experience as far as I remember, I laughed a lot at random things but I can't remember much due to alcohol. My friend hasn't tried anything other than pot but never with me. He hasn't really told much about his experience with pot, but he's probably done it more than I have. 


So after my experience, I became quite interested in psychedelics, I don't like smoking in general therefore not a great fan of pot. I first found out about cacti about a year ago, I didn't really look into it much at the time but nevertheless was interested. Recently I felt ready to deepen my knowledge and do some research. I read through some of the information on Erowid including at least ten different experience reports as well as information available on various forums. I quite liked the fact that cacti seems to be a gentle plant and a one where a bad experience is less likely to happen. I think I've done enough research to give it a try and I want to do so within the next week with one of my friends who doesn't know much about cacti other than what I told him. I want to do this with this particular person because I can trust him and I feel safe to do so with him as he's a very responsible friend. 


I and my friend decided to order 25g each of dried Peruvian Torch chips, so 50g together, from an online ethnobotanical source. I understand that drinking this as a tea will most likely be really hard and I want to do all that is possible to avoid puking. I don't want to do any extracts at this time, nor do I want to boil the chips for hours. After reading all sorts of information I was thinking of trying the following:


- Powder the dried chips

- Add small amounts of lemon juice as well as water

- Mix until it's like dough

- Make small swallow-able pieces

- Put them in the freezer to let them cool (maybe)


- Drink ginger tea made fresh from ginger root (and have anti nausea tablets handy)

- Swallow them with apple juice (or any other juice)

- Drink ginger tea again


- Have buckets handy (just in case)


I think that this could possibly be a nice way of making this work. Other than that it would just have to be tea (powder mixed with warm water). I was wondering what you think of this? Has anyone tried mixing the powder with milk?


We're both waiting for the weekend and can't wait to see your reply. Advice as well as anything we should know is also very welcome.


PS. I posted this on another forum as well because I wasn't sure if I'd get a good response by the weekend as cacti seems to be less talked about. Hopefully this isn't against the forum rules.


PSS. During the experience I was thinking of trying to look back at good old memories, is this possible?

Bill sounds like a bit of a jackass..if Bill can't handle smoking a bit of weed from a bong, what makes him think he's prepared for a much more immersive experience? 


While I've never done any type of cactus, I don't know that its ideal for a first time psychedelic experience. That method of ingestion seems like it would be highly unpleasant as well. 


I'm sure the cactus people will have much better info.

You may be right, I might be a bit of a jackass but I don't like smoking in general whatever it would be. When I've had the bong experience I never knew what I was in for, I was told it was fun and it would make me feel good so I decided to try it without doing any prior research. My friend did it, so I didn't think anything could go wrong. Due to the fact that I never knew what to expect I was slightly confused. The setting wasn't the best place either since my friend's friends where there and I never really knew them and felt a bit like an outsider. I am a lightweight so that may be the reason for my weak and shaky feeling? I'm not sure to be honest. I was slightly scared that I might get caught doing something that I shouldn't be and thats probably the bit where anxiety creeped in. I also had lenses at the time which made me feel uncomfortable after a while. All in all I enjoyed parts of the experience and after the come down felt really good and enjoyed listening to music. After the whole experience I came to a conclusion that it's all about the mindset as well as the mood that you are in at the time.

sounds fine to me, the nausea is the big problem and you have that covered. I find cactus tea to be much easier on the stomach and works just as well although it takes more time/effort to make it. With the dough i would sometimes get pretty bad stomach cramps so it may be worthwhile to consider the tea. 


make sure you are well rested and in a comfortable (preferably not public) place and you should be okay.

Shoes are inanimate objects and incapable of the things you describe, seek psychological help. Really though, we don't allow SWIM or any of that third person balderdash here, just say "I" (yes this is a rule). Please edit your post to conform with this rule, it's really annoying to read it as it's written, and a lot of us flat out won't do it.


Anyhow, this thread will be merged with this one soon enough.

IME the main problem is the taste/consistency of hearty cacti meals, I never had significant nausea. When you decide to ingest as pellets or tea (look for recipes, it's not that trivial to not end up with a snotty liquid) don't try to make it more palatable by mixing with other foods. That just doesn't work taste-wise and you have to eat more material. A better way is to just accept the taste as something you have to get through to experience the cactus' effects.


Maybe I'm just lucky with regard to the nausea. There's abundant mention of puking under the influence of cacti / even pure mescaline. But that happens more often in the beginning of the experience and once cleansed you'll feel a whole lot better. Don't try to avoid puking at all cost, as the fixation on nausea could ruin the trip. Feel free to puke, when your body tells you to, it's certainly not that bad and will have a very relieving effect.

But in any case, your best bet is perhaps ginger tea as you mentioned already. Have one about 30-60 minutes before the cactus and drink it with the ginger chunks (because at least one possibly antiemetic substance is not soluble in the tea). Try to have more of it while ingesting if possible, but don't force you to, if you don't like ginger ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I will be going bed early the day before and will probably wake up to do this at 6-7AM. I will most likely stay at home for most of the experience, I've got quite a nice view out of my window. If I feel like I can go out into a park, I might do so.


Is it possible to make the tea without having to boil it for too long? I live with other people and it would look weird If I boiled something green for hours...

Anything that tastes bad is hard to mask with other foods so I pretty much understand. In the end you will have to eat a lot more so I'll definitely stick to accepting the taste how it is, well hopefully I will. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)


I find ginger tea with lemon to be rather okay, some people find it hard to drink, not really the case for me so I'll definitely have some more.

I definitely agree about making the tea, I've heard everywhere that it makes the nausea better. Ime I've thrown up every time I broke threshold, even with ginger, but maybe u have a stronger stomach.... in any case, my advice is to fast, and avoid prosessed foods and anything that might have tyramine. Watching your diet the day before and fasting for 15 hrs prior will make a big difference in your stomach//intestines, and it willb just be more pleasant... although throwing up kinda jump starts your trip and makes you feel cleansed, less dizzy so the nausea is not all bad, and usually gets better after ~2 hrs...


Re: weed, many ppl have anxious reactions to it. Although the cactus is gentle, any psychedelic can cause anxiety. In any case, part of tripping is overcoming your fears, so learn to breathe well in those situations and remind yourself that you took a drug and the way you're feeling will change soon. 


Having said this, I hope you enjoy it, welcome to the club![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Alright, I've had my first experience, it was a bit disappointing but if your not too busy and don't mind reading it, here it is:


Alright folks, I've never before written a trip report so I don't really know where to start but here it goes. During the last week me and my friend ended up acquiring 50g (each) of dried Peruvian Torch chips. We wanted to find out a way to prepare them without having to take hours to boil/extract via alcohol and so we did. We ended up powdering the chips, mixing them with lemonade and finally freezing them in order to drink them as frozen ice. The proportions were eyeballed because we didn't have a scale, and to make sure we would have roughly the same amount we also cut up the two frozen ice boxes in half in order to make sure we'd have a proportion that would be as equal as possible. We thought a hammer would be necessary to break up the ice but when we saw it we ended up using a knife to cut it up into small pieces. We didn't want the pieces to be too small as otherwise they would break up. We ended up filling 6 plastic cups each of the frozen cactus pieces.


On Friday night, just before Saturday we were getting ready, we've bought all sorts of fruit and a few other things to eat. In terms of drinks we've had orange juice, apple juice as well as water bottles and lemonade. We also prepared ginger tea for stomach pains. We've put some music together, made some plans and all of this took some time so in the end we ended up having only around 5 hours of sleep time.


**Time - Details**


07:00 - We've woken up from around 5 hours of sleep ready to go on our first ever psychedelic journey.

07:05 - We've each taken motion sickness pills, around one hour before starting the journey and we then just got ready like you would in the morning after waking up.

07:50 - We've reheated ginger tea and drank it down.

08:10 - We've had two toasts each as we thought that could help. We've not eaten anything for at least the past 14 hours.

08:20 - We started to prepare the ice by chopping it up into edible pieces. Orange juice was also prepared.

08:46 - We asked for a smooth journey as well as mind expansion. In total we had 6 cups of cactus ice with lemonade that we started to take in. At first it wasn't bad but because the pieces were slightly too big to swallow we had to munch them and then gulp them down with orange juice. With the first cup it was quite easy and we didn't really feel the taste. As we moved onto the second cup it was still fairly easy but we started to feel the taste. The next two cups got harder and the 5th cup was where it started to become a pain. We each ended up drinking about 1.2 liters of orange juice as well as 5 cups of ice.

09:14 - 28 minutes later we were only left with one cup each but my friend started getting headaches and stomach pains. Both our stomach's were bloated and although I didn't feel great I wasn't complaining as it wasn't that bad, no headaches for me.

09:28 - Since my friend couldn't do the last cup and we ended up waiting too long I decided not to take my one too, so we ended up pouring our last cups down the toilet. We then, not feeling too well headed outside with nothing else but the keys and a banana. As soon as we entered the park I started feeling really bad, I stopped because I could feel that I was about to vomit, saliva was building up and I thought it was all about to come out but I was calm and managed to hold it in, soon the feeling of having to vomit passed and I was better, we found a bench we sat down and rested for a bit. After a few minutes we got up and started following the pathway again, suddenly from nowhere my friend just let it all go right in front of him, he couldn't hold it in and it all came out. This was roughly about 40 minutes after taking in the last cup. As soon as it came out his headache and stomach pains disappeared. I felt disappointed and didn't want to be the only one tripping so I kept thinking about vomiting it out as well, I didn't want to force myself as that's not something I would do but I also didn't want to be the only one tripping.

10:32 - After around an hour outside we decided to get back inside. My friend popped into the bed where as I went into the toilet for #2 (it was smelly, lol), I was in there for a bit and as soon as the urge to vomit came, I let it all out, I didn't even try keeping it down as I wasn't feeling like being the only one with cactus inside my stomach. This was roughly an hour and a half after taking in the last cup, maybe slightly more, maybe slightly less. As soon as I came out of the toilet I felt good, I had some apple juice and popped into the bed aswell.

10:51 - Feeling fairly alright with a bloated stomach and still in bed as it felt nice and warm.

11:11 - Around two hours after take in, not seeing/feeling anything really, while in bed with closed eyes, very light colors could be seen but only for a bit. We ended up feeling extreme hunger after smelling some nice food smells from downstairs and so we ended up baking a pizza. My friend randomly started cleaning up the kitchen, I was surprised.

11:22 - Friend feeling hungry where as I'm feeling full with only a bite of pizza. We ended up having some fruit, after one of those fruits, watermelon, I sort of started getting a painful stomach ache. Still feeling bloated but it wasn't too bad.

12:06 - Around three hours after take in, feeling a little buzz, we don't think it's working and feel a bit disappointed, but then again we did vomit it all out way too early. Although it doesn't seem to be working, we're not feeling normal either.

12:16 - Friend isn't thinking about time, nor am I, feeling a bit empty minded.

13:30 - Don't think it's working, just feeling a body buzz and from then on we decided not to even bother with logging anything or timing anything.


13:30 onwards - So we ended up listening to some music, in general it felt really nice. We had all sorts of TV shows, including six episodes of Planet Earth but we didn't even think about watching it, we instead decided to watch some comedy TV show. As time went on my friend wanted to go outside, we didn't really talk much as our minds were pretty much empty I guess. I think it took us quite a while to get outside as I ended up in a sort of loop where I would do the same thing and then I'd feel as if I forgot what I was doing and in general I didn't feel the urge to do anything in the first place, but in the end we ended up going outside. My friend felt good, no stomach pains, no nothing, whereas I started getting really bad stomach cramps/pains, it felt like gas was building up inside the stomach and it would feel good if I was able to pop the gas bubble inside. Since I was feeling stomach pains we stopped every now and then to sit down for a bit, I sat on the pavement whereas my friend stood, the day was awesome but colors seemed to be normal just like in any other day, bright and colorful but nothing amazing as we've read from some experiences. Then again I usually wear lenses due to my eyesight so maybe if I wore them at the time, maybe it would be different. It felt good to sit down and not think about anything and just look around and feel the air and everything around. After getting up we talked a bit about trying something else like shrooms to get a comparison since we pretty much don't have anything to compare too. We walked around the neighborhood stopping here and there where in one place when we sat down I sort of tuned out and felt "one" with everything. My stomach was still bloated with even more pain, painful but bearable, I think the body high was helping with not really focusing on it. My friend felt fine but we decided to go back inside, before we got home we sat down for a bit once more and when I looked into a bunch of tall tree's I saw them swaying together in a clockwise motion which was really cool, my friend couldn't see this but I did. Once we got back inside we just jammed, listened to music, watched TV shows, ate fruits, etc. I though ginger tea would help with the stomach pain but in fact it felt as if it made it even worse. In general some periods felt as if time was passing by really slowly at other times it didn't feel like anything, I noticed that when I was in certain positions when laying on the bed that the stomach pain would go away and it would be possible to fart out the gas (not really sure how to put this). Anyway, there's not much to say to be honest we felt good for the whole day but it wasn't really what we'd expect, we ended up walking to get some food at around 21:00 and in general we just watched TV shows and listened to music through the whole day, nothing exciting but it felt good. The whole body feeling wore completely off at around 1AM where we were then able to fall asleep. In general we had some random conversations but most of them where bullshit as I didn't really know how to put things into words, or I didn't really have the vocabulary to put things into words. In terms of the stomach acke I think I've had hangovers from alcohol that were wrose than this.


**In Conclusion**


In conclusion we pretty much felt an all day body high similar to maybe weed but different in many ways. We were clear minded for the whole day. A few days before I was recommended to read a 24 page PDF, "The Doors of Perception" by Aldous Huxley, with his experience and although I found the read to have a lot of stuff that I couldn't be bothered to read I still read it. I didn't understand most of it but some of the parts I found very interesting. After the experience I've had I started to slowly understand what Huxley really meant. While I was downstairs washing my cups I saw myself washing them but I felt like I was this "something" I felt like I was in a different state of conscious which was really nice, it wasn't powerful but it was there. That's where I started to understand some of the things that I've read from the book. I felt "one" with nature, my friend didn't seem to but I did. I don't really know how to explain this but even before trying cactus or anything else for that matter, when I was a young teen, even a young child I've always had this feeling of that "something" that "one" which I never really knew how to explain, I thought about it and tried talking about it with others but no one would really understand so I just left it but now after trying cactus I really feel the urge to find out more. All in all, although quite disappointed, we enjoyed the experience as it was and will be looking forward to another one soon, though this time maybe with two extra friends and definitely a better way of taking in the cactus, either an extraction through alcohol or a boil. The only thing that worried me at the end of the day is that I still haven't had any real psychedelic experiences, no visuals, which kind of keeps me anxious as to what I have yet to see. Anyway, I'm not great at explaining, writing down trip reports so there may be things that I wanted to add/say but I just can't remember them now. PS. We felt completely normal the following day, no hangover no nothing.


**Some Questions**


We were wondering how different are shrooms to cactus? Do you get that feeling of "one" with shrooms too? Or is that just from the cactus? I really want to experience a stronger feeling of "one".


We were thinking of soon trying cactus again though this time through an extraction and we wondered if it would be good to continue with cactus or maybe go for something easier?


Thank you for reading this long report and taking your time to reply.

I've never tried shrooms but on stronger doses of mescaline I definitely get this feeling.

If you are planning on doing anything more lengthy than a basic alcohol extraction it takes a bit of time.  I've never gotten great yields from cactus powder but I've never tried drying fresh cactus, powdering it, and then extracting that, which might give better yields.  In general, I've received higher quality live cactus than the equivalent of "a foot a cactus" of powder. 


50g of chips of average quality should still have given you a nice experience, I think that there was so much stuff in your stomach that a lot of the cactus didn't get digested but sat in your stomach until you threw up.  If you had 200mL of orange juice to get down 2 cups of ice, that might make absorption faster, but I would recommend getting a foot of cactus and brew up a shot or two of tea.

Thanks for the information, I'll definitely be looking towards an extraction just not sure yet if an alcohol one or a simple tea.

i'd go for mushrooms, they will most certainly make you trip unless you get shitty ones. Nothing wrong with cactus except the taste but i find mushrooms to be more reliable in providing a satisfying trip, with peruvian torch the amount of cactus you have to eat can sometimes negate any psychedelia. 


simple tea is fine, but it is a pain to make, you definitely want to heat and stir it so you can reduce the amount of cactus juice you have to drink. It took me a couple of hours to get it down to a reasonable amount, it also makes a bit of a mess and smells funny so not the best for being discrete.


mushrooms are so simple, i just grind them up and eat the powder.

If only I had easy access to some mushrooms, I'd look into them. At the moment I don't. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Cactus is definitely a very interesting and fun experience and therefore not a one to miss.

I am interested in trying to increase the mescaline yield of my Peyote cactus, but I don't want to do something rash and inflict any harm to the cactus. I know that dopamine is involved in Peyote's mescaline biosynthetic pathway, so I started wondering whether injecting dopamine HCl into the cactus would be worthwhile. I'm hoping someone out there has tried this before. If so, how much dopamine HCl did you inject into the cactus? Is this tinkering worth the risk?

Don't listen to StickyChron. I've tripped on LSD, salvia, mushrooms, DXM and last but not least cactus, and tomorrow, ayahuasca. And I can't handle weed. Some people it just rubs the wrong way. You don't need weed anyway, it's a great way to waste time but not good for much else.


Mushrooms are very different from cactus though. Expect much more apparent and in-your-face effects, and a much more alien / less rational mindset. I recommend starting quite low with mushrooms, 1.5g at the most. (Most people would say start higher, but the thing with trying a substance for the first time is, you have no idea how you'll react - cue my usual story about taking 2g and going insane in my bedroom for four hours. So it's better to start lower than you think, which is why your 'disappointing' mescaline experience sounds like an ideal first trip to me.)

If you really want to "know" something with this medicine, eat 100 buttons, but if you want to say "I know something.." eat 500 buttons. Peyote will take you farther than you can imagine with the right intent and the willingness to do the work. As for the visuals, while fantastic indeed to say the least, are also there to keep out those who aren't prepared yet. Then as your heart you leave the mind's attention, step out the maze-ing  4th dimension, your welcome in the 5th.

Does anyone have experience with IM injection of synthetic mescaline? Are there advantages or disadvantages? If anything, it would be an advantage to me that it would be impossible to throw up (part of) your dose.


I have had only one experience with synthetic mescaline (none with extract, one threshold experience with cactus goo), and it was at the same time heart opening and trancendental but not very trippy which was remarkable to me. At what dose does it get truly visual and psychedelic and transformative for you, and also I have proscaline and a possible option for allylescaline, I'm interested in similarities and differences. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I recently watched a You tube video in where this Aussie graphs a Peyote Button on to a different mescaline producing cacti, this   got me thinking about other  varieties of cactus, and if all species of cactus could be grown together?  The Botany of cactus's        seems so alien, but I am considering taking it up as a hobby.

Indeed this is called grafting, you probably learned from the video that just like with various kinds of trees you can combine a root system and/or stem of one tree or cactus but the top phenotype of another plant or cactus, the part that shows, that often matters to us most, the part that is most visible, etc.

To be honest I'm not sure which types can be combined but if peyote which belongs to the Lophophoria family can be grafted onto Trichocereus or other stems then it seems to me there is pretty tolerant compatibility.

In addition, I think there may be something like a 'root-preparation', a nutrient and maybe also hormone-rich liquid which can be applied to cut-off surfaces of plants or cacti when this is done, but I forgot if it was good or bad to let it form a callus first (like a thickening of the skin or a crusty layer on a wound, just like people get). Also you want to position the parts you want to graft excentrically meaning the centers or origins of the circles must not overlap, but you want to shift it. In other words, grafting should be done ever so slightly crooked to better match the adapting plant parts.


In my vocabulary, grafting is also known as 'going frankenstein on your ass'.


*edit: yes you want to have it form a callus first.*

If I was looking for a psy to try as a festival would mescaline be my safest bet? (now that I'm finally able to source HCL) What's the potential of me freaking out or having a bad trip, I can normally keep myself together fairly well but saying that I've only done acid a couple of times and it was on fairly weak blotters.

Ill be doing "Trichocereus Bridgesii " fairly soon. I was wondering what the simplest way to ingest it is without having to do a lot of extractions or whatever? can i just cut it up and munch it down or would i get really nauseous?

You will get nauseous from eating the cactus flesh, but it is doable. Personally, given that I'm not a very chem savvy person, each of the 4 times I tripped on t. bridgesii I simply despined the cactus, then cut the fibrous core out of the middle, and finally scraped the flesh off of the skin using a knife. I would eat the flesh whole, usually after frying it up in some olive oil to make it *slightly* more palatable (but it never gets palatable, ever). I only threw up once doing this, and though I always get nauseous on the come up, it was transient.

Bump...  this thread needs to stay alive! Anyway I have a question, I have 3 trichocereus pachanoi cuttings that Ive rooted, two are very healthy and have rooted without problems, but the small cutting I received from a different specimen doesnt seem to be wanting to root at all...


![MyPachanois.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi571.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fss159%2Fdexterlovesyou%2FMyPachanois.png&hash=f491dab28460e6a336e8e812197f22f4)

These are the large ones after 3 weeks of being in Sunshine mix #4 potting soil (Its all I have ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) ) Theyre both rooted great


![MyPachanoiPup.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi571.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fss159%2Fdexterlovesyou%2FMyPachanoiPup.png&hash=30182764a611f4e3e71b978f2cbb41b5)


This is also 3 weeks in in the same soil and same conditions, but this cutting doesnt seem to be wanting to root at all!


The small cutting is the one that I want to be mother plant, Ive consumed brew from both cacti, and the small cutting I received is from a decently potent cactus, where as the other one I got the two larger cuttings from was surprisingly weak. 


I live in the desert, I let all of the cuttings calous before planting them, Ive kept them in shaded sunlight, I havent watered at all (except for the larger ones which rooted already). And its been around 100 degrees Farenheit the whole time. Anyone have suggestions of what I could do to help this little guy along?

These are my babies, both of the specimens mothers have given and taught me alot just from the two experiences I had. Its my turn to give something back to these cacti and give them life! Im just unsure on what I should do with the pup? Should I just leave it alone and hope nature works its magic? Should it come inside where its cooler? should I maybe give it a slight amount of water? Im new to cacti growing and these specific cuttings really mean alot to me! I dont want to just leave it alone and have it die, and I dont want to guess what I should do and kill it. Please, any advice from an experienced cacti grower would be greatly appreciated ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Edit:

Nevermind, the pup is starting to do good, and I also found out the brew I consumed with my friend the second time was not from the same cactus as this one. He had a dozen cuttings that he ordered of monstrose variety, so the large cuttings are Trichocereus Pachanoi Monstrose. Beautiful huh? ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Well another season has passed.


I'm going to be chopping some down and replanting as usually , almost 10 years of growth ... T. bridgesii's all cuttings from a 1 plant naturally ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 

Whats funny that i only found out that people let the cuttings dry out before re planting... i never had any problems and don't plan on doing it in the future. None have died or root to death "touch wood", (unless they really small like psilocybinsane cactus) anyways don't recommend anyone make cuttings smaller then say 20cm..not logical to remove cuttings that tiny as it would take twice as long to catch up to a uncut rooted/potted plant.Most idea to build a nazi concentration camp style metal shed.. and feed it daily with water / fert... gives you explosive results just dont over do it, ( they will turn white and stop growing for ages even after it gains the color back)most importantly have fun and happy growing ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Found and placed an order for five pounds of San Pedro yesterday, it's already shipped and on its way.. I plan on doing my own a/b extraction. This will be my first ever contact with mescaline (other than some fake ish at a music festival in arkansas this year), and I cannot be more excited. I'm a fairly experienced tripper, having eaten boomers, acid, ketamine, broke through on dmt, salvia, 2c-e, -i, and -p. All have been great in their own way, but from what I've already and expect from mescaline, I don't think any of them will compare to its spirituality and divine uniqueness.

Mescaline is a beautiful and spiritually aligning experience!  I was blessed with its company yesterday and I cannot  enough express my gratitude to it ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


I've worked with San Pedro much, this time was around thirty grams of green flesh powder, very intense but lucid and gentle. 


Eat the cactus straight or do simple water infusion is my advice much more profound and thorough of an exp than extractions IME. And don't forget to admire those clouds! Woods are an ideal setting I feel


Natures lessons are so clear with cactus by m Y side...helps me to understand what I need to do with my life And allows me to make peace with the past in a deep way. 


Best wishes!

I have a feeling tomato passata could mix well with raw mescaline pulp. Maybe the acidic flavours of the tomato could balance the vinegar flavours of the green stuff. Might be wrong too ...

Have you ever tried eating/drinking it? Might've been better to order a small amount just to see whether you can stomach it. 


A/B extraction is very awkward too - many times more difficult than a DMT extraction. The cactus forms a thick viscous snot that you have a terrible time extracting from.

the trick is to get the viscous "snot" runny before adding your nonpolar. 

so-let cacti sit in very basic conditions until the mix slacks before adding your np and continuing with mix and pull. this takes from 12-48hrs.

Tried variations on that but once you've got a kilo of snot in a viscous snotball nothing loosens if off. Perhaps it works if you're just working with smaller amounts?

I am hoping to have my first experience of mescaline soon - extracted Hcl or acetate ... Not sure which tek my supplier will use.


I would like the experience to be as smooth as possible, hence my research and this question - is there any more I can do to minimise chances of nausea and projectile vomiting?


I am planning to:

- T - 0:30 -have some fresh ginger

- T - have 200mg equivalent of freebase mescaline in mint tea

- T - have a couple of puffs of mj

- T + 0:45 have another 200mg equivalent of pure mescaline in mint tea


Will this maximise my chances of holding it all down?


Thank you for your thoughts

Took about 25g of San Pedro resin earlier today, still going strong. Felt a bit edgy physically, but had no weed on hand to smooth things out. Had the bright idea to add 4-5mg of 5-MEO-MIPT, surprisingly it worked out okay and has rounded things off nicely.

making tea is not hard at all. there isn't any effective extraction method that is easier than boiled water. don't powderize the skin...just let the chunks sit in there for 12+ hours, boil to smaller amount, strain chunks. consuming it is a different story.


even the easiest and safest of the extractions takes a lot of time and patience, it the odor isn't really fitting for being discreet...

^You can store it as long as you want, I believe mescaline does not degrade.


Let us know how it goes when he takes it. A friend of mine also tried that method and found it vomit inducing before the effects took place. It still creates a lot of material compared to a proper extract.

It's only a little more time consuming than making tea and the only chemical used is water.

I have recently acquired 56 grams of Dried Peruvian Torch cactus powder from a fairly well known vendor (wont say who). I am planning on taking it this coming weekend, but I have a few questions. 


I don't want to make any teas or anything, I just want to take the powder. Would mixing my dose with water and chugging it be a good method? Should I divide my dose into 2 separate doses around 30 minutes a part? Would putting it all in gel caps be a better idea? I'm open so suggestions.


And also, how much should I take for a strong trip? I am an experienced psychedelic drug user, and this isn't even my first time using Mescaline. It's my first time in 3 years. Back in late 09 I did it a few times. First 3 times I eat straight up fresh cactus flesh. The cactus was Bridgessi. All 3 of those times I was never able to get enough down to have a full blown trip. I definitely got effects, mild but definitely there. Later that year, and the last time I ever tried Mescaline cacti, I bought some Peruvian Torch Powder and took around 22 grams. My method was adding a little bit of water and rolling the powder up into little cactus dough balls. I still couldn't get enough down. 22 grams was all I could do. Now that was the strongest Mescalin experience I ever had. It was a good couple notches above the fresh cactus, some pretty good visuals for a while but nothing too intense. It still wasn't where I wanted to be. So close, yet so damn far. I got a good feel for what Mescaline is like though, and ever since then Ive wanted to go all out and really explore it all the way. Ive done Shrooms probably about 30 times in my life, and at times found some very potent mushrooms. I'm quite experienced with LSD as well. The most LSD Ive ever taken was 9 hits, which was extremely intense for me. On average I do anywhere from 2 to 4 hits of Lucy. So I am pretty experienced with pyches and I really want a full blown Mescaline experience for once. Should I just go for the entire 56 grams, or would that be too intense on my stomach?


Any help/ advice/ tips are very much appreciated.

IME, short of a full extraction, there's no good way to get a bunch of cactus in you. It tastes terrible, it's chalky dry & slimy wet. The tea is pretty disgusting, snotty in texture, but at least with that you can reduce it down to a couple shots worth.


Sorry that's probably not much help

The problem with making tea is I live at home with my parents and I don't think I would ever have a chance to secretly boiling cactus juice for several hours. Plus, I know you loose some of the Mescaline that way. As far as extraction goes, Ive looked into several and have been interested in the food grade limonene extraction for a while. I just don't have a place to do it (at the moment), and in addition to that I don't have the cash to spend on a food dehydrator. They aren't cheap. As I said, Ive done powdered Torch before, and it didn't make me too nauseous. Actually if I remember correctly it didn't give me any real nausea, but it did make my stomach feel... ehh not the greatest. It was hard to move for a while. It was uncomfortable but certainly wasn't anything unbearable for me. If I was on a higher dose experiencing a full blown Mescaline trip it would probably bother me even less.

^If you can't make tea and don't have a place to do a proper extraction you should look into IPA/Grain alcohol extractions. They are some what crude and take 6-8 days but its definitely a step up from eating cactus. I like them because they don't require constant attention. You just have to shake up the jar 2-3 times a day and change out the alcohol every third day, other than that you can put it up somewhere and forget about it. Just make sure that if you use IPA you give it plenty of time to evaporate.

**Mescaline HCL**


OK, I have layed my hands on a gram of mescaline HCL.  Tried an extraction with the delemonine (or whatever its called) last year, got virtually bugger all out of it, a very, very small amount, considering the amount of money I spent dealing with that project I was sorely disappointed!  I could feel it but only just and very very slight visuals.


Basically I have 1g of Mescaline HCL (its been sold to me as that anyway) to go at, me and a mate are going to do it in in a few weeks.  I have a gram in powder form.  Me and my mate are gonna split it 50/50, were both pretty experienced with psychedelics and drugs in general (be it a good 15 years ago)


What do I do with it?  Disolve it in water and drink or snort the stuff? - my moneys going on dissolving in warmish water and drinking slowly over about half an hour.  Apparently it makes you sick though, that being said ive been sick that many times im surprised ive even mentioned that...


you recon 500mg each will be enough?  or should I get some more and go all out for the  750~mg?


me mate is on about getting some "rockstar" coke in,  I'm not sure thats a good idea but if the mescaline is a dud its a good fall back plan.  If its not a dud then is the coke gonna be ok with the mescaline ? (and lets be honest here beer)


I used to love my physcadeics and have been waiting to try this stuff for about 20 years, I want to rock it.


What do I do with it ?

d-limonene is what you mean. I did an extraction too, but knocked stuff over halfway through and had half of it go down the drain ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) Still got about half a gram, which I did as two doses, 200mg and 300mg a couple months later. Yes, it is pretty nauseating, though there are also nice body tingles like you would get from MDMA to take your mind off of that. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I would do an allergy dose of 1mg first, then a few days later try around 10mg to rule out a research chem like 2C-E being sold as mescaline (which is a lot more likely than getting actual synthetic mescaline, if you don't personally know an organic chemist). You can just put the powder in an empty gelcap or even wrap it up in a little pouch of toilet paper and swallow it. (Though you'd probably need to use liquid measurement for the allergy dose if you don't have a microgram scale.)

500mg is a pretty high dose from what I've heard but if you're experienced with psyched you should be fine.

Some people get blown out of the water from 300mg though so be careful, but you should be able to judge based on if your dosage for psyches in general is higher than most peoples, specifically phenethylamines.

But this is all anecdotal as I've never tried it but it's definitely on my bucket list

Before you take 500mg of it you need to be aware that the chances of it actually being "Mescaline HCL" are next to nill. If it's a white powder then it'll just be some obscure research chemical. Very, very few people would consider selling Mescaline HCL - it takes an awful lot of time extracting it from cactus and almost everyone would simply take it themselves - unless you're paying £300 a gram.


Just capsule it and swallow it. Real mescaline is very gentle - the gentlest of all the psychedelics. Beautiful experience but you arn't going to be "tripping balls" like you would on a high dose of acid or mushrooms.

There is synthetic mescaline and it isn't necessarily that expensive - I know this from personal experience, had it lab-tested and I tripped two times on it thus far... but yes it is relatively rare, though it may have a better market nowadays with the advent of a 'certain network'.


Still, test it by titrating a dose (at the very least try it at a couple mg, then 25-50 mg before jumping to 500), because it is possible you got something else. Even if it is active at the dosage range it should be it is still possible someone mixed another much cheaper phenethylamine with an inert powder.

Don't take more than 500 mg for a first time. That you had bad luck in the past doesn't mean you should overdo it. Don't expect it to be wildly hallucinogenic, in my experience mescaline just doesn't tend to have the mindfucks and warping but instead is calmer and more visionary (showing you things when you lie down with your eyes closed). Hoping for something it just isn't will only disappoint you which would be a shame since mescaline has it's own sublime charm if you are just open to appreciate it.


The plan to drink a watery solution over the course of half an hour is fine - I've done that - but no need to make the water warm or tepid, that will just make it more revolting. Mescaline should dissolve okay, and you can always stir a bit extra.

Capsuling also works (did that another time with crystals from a different source), but I would recommend spreading the dose over 3 parts spaced again over like half an hour.

Don't snort it, it's way too much and I doubt it would even help.


Personally I think coke and psychedelics are a disgusting mix, a psychedelic trip is beautiful because it shows you something beyond your myopic ego but drugs like coke mostly inflate your ego, your confidence and self-involvement. IMO save it for a totally different day. Just smoke some weed if the trip turned out disappointing.


Here is our subthread specifically for synthetic or at least purified mescaline (rather than cactus / alkaloid mix):

[http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/...escaline-Dosage-amp-Methods-of-Administration](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/652724-Mescaline-Subthread-Synthetic-Pure-Mescaline-Dosage-amp-Methods-of-Administration)

It will be merged later.


(P.S. the solvent is called D-limonene)

Can't imagine coke on mescaline - mescaline is quite stimulating anyway. Plus once the coke dies down it might take a lot of the trip with it. Like when you mix ecstasy with LSD - once the E wears off the trip pretty much dies too.

If you do take it in water, you could add some honey and a couple drops of peppermint oil to help mask the bitter taste. That's how I do all of my 2C-Xs, I never bother to cap them anymore. The peppermint oil should help ease the nausea a bit too.

I never got any nausea from mescaline once you'd done a full a/b extraction. Only nausea was eating the cactus or drinking an alcohol extraction.

Ismene: I got moderate nausea from my 200mg extracted dose, and pretty bad lying-in-the-fetal-position nausea from 300mg. Though I got the sense that some of it was psychosomatic and due to being stuck inside with it raining all day. I might have felt better if I could have taken a walk outside and gotten some sun...

on the mixture of cocaine & mescaline:

I did this a long time ago at a festival. Potentiated the mescaline, especially visually, A LOT for around 20 minutes, it was extremely euphoric. I can't say it was bad mix at all actually but it really hits with a boom... it certainly didn't inflate my ego but contributed to ego-loss....

Cocaine might be a 'dirty' addictive euphoriant drug, but the mixture was... well idk, something else entirely - like a candyflip I guess.

Need a little advice on this lady--I've eaten san Pedro a couple times, and once had the sacrament at a half moon ceremony, but never had a chance to try the synthetic. I acquired a gram of it about 2 years ago from a good friend who always seems to have oddities. My gf hounded me to eat some w her while drunk one night and I refused, so she decided to brat out and go grab the vial and dump some in her mouth..which ended up weighing a little over 400mg she purged right up anyway. Sigh.


So my question is to experience w synth mesc, is the remaining 580 or so I have evn worth splitting two ways, or should I just eat 4-500 and save the other Hundo for a combo or something? My whole reason i held onto it forever was to share the experience, but I don't wanna waste it. Opinion greatly appreciated.

IMO / IME if you want a psychedelic experience there is a good chance it is not worth splitting both ways, especially if you got the sulfate salt or even less potent ones. If you want to have 2 emotional / spiritual healing sessions instead of one potent trip then you could split it.


So it really depends on whether you want to explore the entheogenic and psychedelic potential because even at 450 mg of the HCl (most potent salt) I didn't really find it heavy, although there was a pronounced body high. It is excellent as a therapeutic drug at more modest doses like low dose MDMA: opening you up without necessarily rolling or tripping or sth like that.

Considering taking mescaline next Thursday (12/12). Last week I took 125mg 4-FA (11/27) and ~900ug 25B-NBOMe (11/29). I'm also thinking about taking some MDA at a show on Friday (12/6). Would there be significant cross-tolerance from those drugs?

Hey I plan on making a tea or doing an alcohol extraction of T. Bridgesii (1-2 12 inch cuttings) within the next few weeks, this will be my first time experimenting with mescaline and I have some questions about dosage and about the nausea associated with mescaline. When you make a tea is it solely the taste of the tea that makes you nauseous or is it the consistency and plant matter? Also is the taste comparable to kratom at all? I can down that stuff with ease.


 Is the nausea significantly reduced with the alcohol extraction? I have seen some people say its worse but that doesn't really seem to make much sense. Would taking the doses over a longer period of time help at all? Any other help and tips would be great, I probably need it. I have been doing a lot of reading on it the last few weeks but could always use more. Is it likely is it to get a low yielding T. Bridgesii? I have read reports of low yielding cacti but I haven't seen one for T. Bridgesii.


I saw the D-Limonene Tek also but would the be feasible for someone with no formal chemistry knowledge? I would prefer to come out of this with crystals if possible.


EDIT: I thought this was the extraction thread, if this post could be moved to it I would appreciate it. Thank you

Hi.

May I ask a question ?

The idea that peyote needs to be about 10 years old to be worth eating, is there any evidence of this or is it just one of those things that spreads word of mouth so many times people accept it as fact ?


I have googled this btw, not totally lazy just thought I'd ask.


P.S appreciate any responses, no rush ( it may well be 10 years before it really matters ! ) 

P.P.S I won't be depleting natural stocks so no worries of me eating an endangered species


Cheers my love 

All the best

Hey Bummer:


It makes me so happy to hear you aren't going to be depleting the natural stocks of this endangered plant! It's such a special organism, we really need to protect, because it's given us all so much. It's really not OK to eat wild harvested peyote anymore, because we can grow it indoors, or use alternatives like the abundant and prolific San Pedro or Peruvian Torch, or the synthetics (mescaline or other phenethlamines). Long live Lophophora!


I think there is truth to the old peyote being more full of alkyloids. From experience, I can say that eating a 2 gnarly old anicent peyote buttons was as strong as I reckon most reports I've read of the 4-6 buttons people say is the "normal" dose. It's hard to say though, because old buttons are also larger, so is there more alkyloid per weight? Not sure, but again I suspect so. I think the plant produces alkyloids as some kind of metabolic byproduct over it's whole life, and this mescaline etc. just builds up during the course of it's life. AFAIK they don't excrete the mescaline, and it seems to be a metabolic endpoint for the chemical. We know that phenethylamines are very stable, and this is probably true inside the plant as well.


I think everyone should buy some peyote seeds and start growing! Then when you're old and grey, you'll have an old grandpa peyote waiting for you ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Even if you never eat it, they are one of the most beautiful plants in the world, and a make a great companion. Sadly, my peyote plant died when it was uprooted and squished by an infant, so I need to start over.


Also, it seems you can speed up the growing a lot by grafting. Check out grafting on pereskiopsis, and San Pedro.

I recently had an absolute blast on 275mg of mescaline HCl (it's been over a year), but it was quite underwhelming in terms of psychedelia relative to 100mcg LSD or 2g shrooms. Can I expect more with a higher dosage? By higher I'm talking 350-400mg. I ask this because taking higher dosages of 2C-B didn't affect my head space as much and as such I gave up on doing it by itself. I'm looking for a 'functional' psychedelic trip like 100-150mcg LSD.

I didn't find 450 mg of mesc HCl to even be that trippy, but it was still strong in the visionary department. It was good for showing me my path, and cleansing the soul somehow. With closed eyes I was transported to another world (a vision) and effects were very strong - I lied down on a sofa like that for a while totally immersed, but with open eyes there was not much activity the rest of the experience apart from a very pure look at things as if seeing their true nature and aesthetics.


Please choose another compound if you want more typical psychedelia, such as many a tryptamine... and use the mescaline accepting it for what it is, which is special in its own right.


Others do seem to get the more typical trippiness at higher doses though, so I guess despite my advice it is not impossible for everyone.

I have never really had a lot of trippiness from mescaline either, though colors become very distinct and sublimely beautiful.  And everything appears beautiful and special.  Emotionally it is extremely opening but also more than that.  It's hard to explain the state of mind.  Everything seems significant and meaningful.  I've only done it outside during the day, I've never tried to go inward (I've only really fully done it once, and had lower doses a couple of times).  I love mescaline, it's beautiful, and powerful, but not like tryptamines or ergoloids, or even really the 2Cs and many other types of phenethylamines.

I was wondering if I was just underdosing or if this is what mescaline is. Having only done it three times within the 200-275mg doses it's still my favourite substance.

Hi all,


New to the forums and I've read through the rules and guidelines. If the following question does happen to be against the rules or in the incorrect thread, I apologise and will happily remove it.


I am a 90kg (200 pound), 28 year old male with extensive experience with LSD & mushrooms and light experience with salvia, DMT and a number of research chems. This would be my first attempt with Mescaline.


I recently obtained a cutting of San Pedro with the below measurements:

Length: 42cm (1'5")

Diameter of cutting, point to point: 10cm (4 inches)

Diameter of core: 4cm-5cm (1.5 - 2 inches)

Weight: 2.5kgs (5.5 pounds)


The cutting is reasonably fresh and has not been actively dried. Understanding that the active content of each individual plant can vary and is impossible to truly predict, I was wondering whether anyone could suggest how much might be a smart guideline for a safe but reasonable dose, using a blending/boiling/filtering method such as the method below. The guide states that 1ft is enough for a single dose. It does not recommend a weight or diameter for the foot required. I am estimating, from my own research, that 1ft of this should be a reasonable amount, but was looking for some advice from a more knowledgeable member.

[http://www.erowid.org/plants/cacti/cacti_preparation5.shtml](http://www.erowid.org/plants/cacti/cacti_preparation5.shtml)


I am also wondering which might be the best way to preserve the cutting for a week or so. I was leaning toward freezing it.


Any help provided would be greatly appreciated.

Slightly off-topic and also late... but though I do not generally feel like combining cocaine and psychedelics is a good thing, I did once combine a small amount of cocaine (1 line of really quality) with 2C-B-fly, and the result was wonderful, glowing, beautiful.

No real need to freeze it if it's only a week. Anywhere dry should be fine, out in the open rather than a sealed container. No need to worry about preserving it IMO. When taking cuttings its standard practice to leave them out in the open while waiting for a callous to form. Mesc is stable too so no need to overthink

I'm taking a combination of mescaline HCl (350-400mg) and some smaller amount of extract of san pedro to get the full alkaloid range, on Saturday. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Really looking forward to it.

Have fun brother! The higher the dose the better, if you have some synthetic(lucky you!)I would personally IM it then eat the Pedro extract. Mescaline is a full land highly powerful psychedelic past 750mgs for most people I know, also almost all of them count it as one of the most beautiful experiences possible!


Will be sending dem good vibrations your way!

Trichocerus Bridgesii is the shit! I love that shit! I've done close to 2 feet on a couple occasions and just like 1 foot on a couple others. The first time I did Trichocereus Bridgesii, this guy dosed me with 20mgs of 25i-nbome and told me it was only like 2.5 mgs. I was on like 1 +2/3 feet of Trichocereus Bridgesii already and I forgot that I even took 25i at all. I was driving for like 45 minutes on the come up from that shit and I was freaked the fuck out. I remember it was like 3 day salvia. ![O.o](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f635.png) crazy shit man.

Can I expect more with a higher dosage? By higher I'm talking 350-400mg. I ask this because taking higher dosages of 2C-B didn't affect my head space as much and as such I gave up on doing it by itself. I'm looking for a 'functional' psychedelic trip like 100-150mcg LSD.

I took a little over 500mg of mescaline HCl and it was a beautiful experience but I was extremely with myself, very little even in the visual department, mostly just an astounding increase in my sensitivity to subtle color variations and my vision became much crisper than usual.  I hope to be able to try it at 750mg in the future, as I hear that's where it starts to get truly psychedelic.

That's horrible, what sick fuck would dose someone with 20mg of that and tell them it was 2.5mg.  People have died on FAR less than that, not to mention the cactus.

Never done it myself, but everything I've read leads to no definite answer - some report an equal potency, some a 20-30% increase.  There aren't too many trip reports about this and I don't see a lot of them popping up in the near future.  If you decide to venture down this route, post a TR!

I thinks mescaline starts to be very visual around the 1000 mg hcl.

Im at around 750mg trips and am getting much more visual compared to my 250 to 500 mg hcl.

Cut off the bad bits.


Your box is full or something, so I can't reply. But I haven't eaten the bulk of the extract yet so I don't know how active it is. The cactus was in great shape when I got it and we both got minor effects from a small fraction of a dose, so signs point to it being active. I could have written it off as placebo but she said said she definitely felt the effects.

2 pounds should be enough to give definite effects if the cactus is anything but low potency, I think. Unless you split it?

It may be too far gone for that. But I imagine the alkaloids are unaffected so I wouldn't want to toss it. I'm wondering if an extraction would render it safe again.

why wouldnt it be safe?


I dont understand people using 500mg hcl, 500mg is a clear ++ and for some +++, but you cannot breakthourght on 500mg. 

however, I dont extract my material, only go with the tea.


if you want a true ++++ experience, you need to get into the 1000 mg zone.

and if you look carefully, experienced user says that the fun only begins at 1000mg, some recommend going for 1500 mg.

I would like to know as well!

but I think its likely safe even over 2000 mg.


anyone knows that?


All I know, is that  you can find on mycotopia a couple of guys who regurlarly dose 1000 to 2000 mg, and that I plan on doing my first 1000mg dose very soon, withint a month, and will make a report, because high dose mescaline trip reports are very rare! Ive had a lot of experience with mescaline over the years in the 200 to 750 mg range and its time for me to try higher dosage|!

Man to be honest I don't think you can overdose and die from eating/taking to much cactus, whatever the situation is. I bet years ago the Shamans of the tribe would eat massive doses during rituals or maybe it was a rite of passage for anyone to become an adult to eat some.


Now as for the powder mescaline. I'm sure you can overdose there.. So i'd be extremely carful not to take to much. (Unlike the cactus, if u took to much there you would just purge).

yeah, I doubt that 2000mg is enough to even come close to kill you. must be over 3-4g hcl may becomes problematic.

Yea.. Those white powders i'd be carful with. I've herd stories of people overdosing on synthetic chemicals, which is why i prefer not even taking them. (Unless i know exactly what i got and its not in a pill or capsule form unless i trust the motherfucker , even the. I'm not paying until i feel the effects!)


As for the toxicity of mescaline.. If you look at it like this..


Purchase a mouse or catch one outside. Find a source and purchase a gram or 2. Next mix the mescaline in the rats food such as a ball of cheese. Note exactly how much you use, and if the mouse dies just do the math!


Lmao i'm unaware and just thought of this idea..i love all animals and if i were to do it to a mouse i'd make sure to have a proper burial.

Its 800-1200 mg per kg in rats. There is an unconfirmed report of a human dying from 200 mg/kg intravenous. So I guess my concern was misplaced. Getting even 20 g out of cactus would require an absurd quantity of plant matter. Even an extract or pure powder would be ridiculous to look at.

I recently aquired some mescaline HCl and had never done it before either.

I plugged 500 mg and liked it VERY well....extemely "warm" psychedelic as well a sociable.

I just x2hours ago plugged 600mg and am coming up nicely.

So,IME, 400-600mg is a good start.

I'm sure I will get shit for this a 'too high a starting dose", but you said you were experienced and given that, I atnd by my recomendations.

Of course, purity of product makes a great deal of difference and I THINK this is very pure stuff considering my source...the same one I get my DOM from...BTW.

YOU NEVER KNOW THOUGH...so my 600mg might actually only be 300mg...haven't had is assayed...and won't/can't.

Doesn't matter now that I have a dosage baseline and I don't change vendors...what I am trying to say a i come onto the 600 i just plugged is that 600mg of MY mesc is agood dose...if yours is purer, then all bets are off...this is why we aren't supposed to post while tripping....bye.

We don't really do IDing here, might want to check the Shroomery where they specialize in that sort of thing.  Although the quality of that picture is abysmal, there's no way to see any detail at all.

I have to say, poppy pod tea is much more disgusting than the San Pedro brew I just consumed. I am known for my iron stomach, though I admit it was a feet drinking down like a upwards of a L of that nasty warm cactus broth. 


I opted to go for the dilute version and deal with the large volume instead of condensing it down to a super alkaloid bitter-rich cup of nasty. I just loath super bitter like that (for instance, I can't stand the taste of DXM HBr powder in solution). 


Now to see if I will need to purge ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) I still have 1/3 of the approx 1.25L San Pedro broth left. I am waiting for maybe half an hour to let my stomach settle a bit before continuing. Total cuttings used was about 20", so I'm hoping for the best. We shall see. Patience is a virtue with this as in all things.


I definitely missed that famous bitter psychedelic phenethylamine aftertaste ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Nice that you had a worthwhile trip, how was it beautiful? Not that I haven't been there with synthetic mesc, but still - it's personal so I'd like to hear about it. I wonder if I will ever get a more hallucinogenic / visual trip with mescaline. I wouldn't necessarily mind anyway because it is so spiritually powerful and healing which is more valuable than something superficial, surely, but still it would be a great bonus since sensory effects are fascinating and appeal to the imagination.

Hey it's my first post! 


Back in 2011 my friends and I were regularly eating 400mg hydrochloride salt derived from peruvian torch.  It was always what we considered a sufficient dose, but being naturally curious we started taking larger doses.  The highest I personally ever went was 1500mg.  It seemed that the insightfulness of the trip went right out the window, and a character of disorientation or dissociation began to take hold.  It was certainly fun and challenging, and it was indeed hard to imagine during the trip that normality was anywhere nearby, but the next day I only felt mildly more tired than the usual day-after-mescaline feeling.  


A few years later I titrated doses from a different batch of cactus and found that 250mg bore more similarity to the 400mg trips of yesteryear, and when I tried 400mg it completely floored me and was nearly overwhelming with very loud musical/auditory hallucinations and a strong unpleasant vibration throughout my body.  Taking 1500mg of this seems like it would be nightmarish.


As for visuals, I've always felt like mescaline has a lot in common with LSD in the visual arena, which is to say there is barely any effect there.  Some noise, some changes for example in the perceived size of the visual field, and the occasional change in the perceived shape of the visual field (sometimes with either drug I feel like I am looking through a television set, that the corners are distinct corners, not rounded off like normal day-to-day vision).  But as for visual hallucinations, even taking 1500mg had a much stronger effect on the patterns of thinking and openness of emotion rather than on perception.  Mushrooms and DMT are the winners of that particular competition.

I cooked 620grams of fresh San Pedro and made a tea in a pressure cooker for 20 min @ 15psi (250). The piece was 3" in diameter and about 10" long. I was high but had no visuals, not even closed eye. I weigh 190 lbs and am guestimating that I had 200mg +or- of mescaline. I think a kilo fresh would get me where I want to go, in the 300mg ballpark. I think maybe the heat degraded the mescaline, so I will do a simple alcohol extraction on dried, ground up powder. I have X-F-B 200 proof grain alcohol that I use for Psilocybin extraction and I am waiting on my order of powdered San Pedro and Peruvian Torch from Peru (delivery takes about a month). Hopefully being grown in their native environment will yield a higher mescaline content. I fasted before my trip, drank a couple cups of ginger tea with fresh ginger to ease nausea. I had no stomach issues but I do have a strong constitution. A lot of people complain about how awful the tea tastes, what a bunch of whiners. I put the juice of a lemon in with the cactus, and although not tasty, it was not that bad, but then I am a salty/savory taster and love to eat and drink fermented stuff. I guess these tv babies today need everything to be easy, soft brats can't handle a little adversity. Buck up and stop complaining.

San Pedro is usually not very potent. Your trip sounds about right for how much you took. You should try Bridgesii. It's several times as potent. It seems to be pretty unpopular compared to San Pedro, but I honestly didn't notice any difference other than potency. I think Peruvian torch is supposed to be more potent than San Pedro also but I don't have any experience with it.

I have two 4" tops and three 14" T. Pachanoi cuttings that I put rooting gel on and am about to plant as well as three 12" T. Peruvianus cuttings. I also have an 18" Bridgesii that is potted and 5 small guys that were grown from seed. I am going to compare/contrast potency and effects between the sub-species. I will also compare mine to the powered cacti that is coming from the motherland, pachamama, Peru.

This is one of my new found favorite substances. A loving and gentle teacher, a warm positive push. Flowing Geometric visuals that blend into all of the surrounding imagery. Immersive patterns that are mesmerizing.


With a sense of euphoria reminiscent of MDMA but in a natural sense, less forceful. Surely one of the top teir psychedelics and positively worth exploring. This will more than likely be a lifelong companion.

Accurate description indeed. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I think of mescaline as a far gentler, more natural, more powerful and psychedelic MDMA.  The sense of true peace and benevolent love it instills is quite precious.  It's been a long time, I need to revisit this soon.

I have been growing a San Pedro cactus for over three years now. I'm thinking of growing some cuttings and boil and drink the rest of it. I also have some cactus chips from a previous cactus I had a few years ago, but I had planned to do an A/B extraction and try to get pure alkaloid content. Only I've been too lazy about that.


Yum, can't wait to eat them cactus. I should get around it whenever the occasion presents itself.

I had 2 san pedros, a bridgesii, and a peruvian torch, for years.  I am in the forest so they weren't growing the fastest or thickest but they were happy and I loved them.  Then one April day I was excited to put them outside again for the spring, and did, but a few nights later it got down to 28 degrees and I didn't realize, and they froze.  I brought them in in the morning, thought they were good but they were actually frozen and when they thawed they turned into puddles of slime. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)  It upset me greatly, I felt so bad.  Haven't had them since.

My goodness what a terrible loss.


The next time i make an extraction i will be using 200 grams of San Pedro chips. Take my time on low heat, i have a stock pot for the first part with the chips.


Then use one slightly smaller for when i filter it to reduce the slime down once again on low heat. Its pretty much impossible to know exactly how much Mescaline you consume this way. But it is totally mind blowing and life changing. You can compare the Mescaline content from dried samples to get an estimate, but every cactus varies.

I have some peruvian torch and san pedro that I started from seed. This talk made me realize they've passed their 10th birthday now! And I still haven't tested any of them out... Sadly I lost track of which ones are peruvian torch and which ones are san pedro. I had a tiny peyote for a while, but it perished many years ago ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) I'd love to start some of those again, they are so beautiful.


It's hard to schedule in time for psychedelics in a busy adult life, especially something long lasting like mescaline, but I really look forward to this.

It does indeed.  Mescaline is something I can make time for because it works well into my day if I'm going to be spending all day hiking or camping, which I do with some regularity on the weekends.  It's getting tough for DOXs though.  I have so many trials I want to do with them too, it's gonna take forever.  Which is actually probably a good thing. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

so..been sitting on (ouch) around 8ft of assorted healthy looking san pedro cacti, just in the dirt doing their thing, for like the last 10 years. yeah i know why didnt i eat any ever, im lazy and cant be bothered to de-spine and cook down my psychedelics when acid comes in vials. i figured id use roughly a foot and a half, mayyybe closer to 2 feet worth, question is will there be any loss of potency after a decade of just sitting in the ground? also just cuz im thinking of it, anyone know any cross tolerance with mesc and lsd? thanks

They won't lose potency due to age, if anything they'd be more potent.  Mescaline and LSD produce strong cross-tolerance.

Found Isopropyl Alcohol that's 99.9%

This is what I'm looking for correct?


This is exactly what I need for the Mescaline extract I plan with San Pedro powder. Plan on doing two separate 125gram batches. Leaving them sit and soak for a week before the filtering process. I'd really like to get it down to the point i can fit 500mgs in a gelcap to swallow. This is pretty much the only way I will be able to get my girl to take it with me.


I'd personally taken the Resin extract from boiling it down on the stovetop. But I'd really like to give this method a go regardless, will be much easier for me to weigh and dose. I know that she is going to love this one, such a beautiful experience. The euphoric push this one provides is simply sublime, I prefer it to MDMA very naturalistic.

I also prefer mescaline to MDMA.  I've never seen IPA at 99.9%, I've only seen 90%.  That should work for sure, but I've never extracted cactus.

Agreed, I like it way better than MDMA, as well.


So 99.9% IPA l just to pull and evap would work fine, I'd imagine. If you're going to try acid base purification etc to get pure mescaline, you'll want to dry the IPA first or you'll lose some in the residual water.

99% will work but may I suggest if you are going the crude extraction route to use water/vinegar instead? (5-10:1 ratio). This will pull less of the nasty tasting impurities that make you wanna yak.  The only benefit to using alcohols (iso, ethanol, methanol, etc) is that they dry fast, but overall produce a less pure extract.


For example I?ve seen 12-15g crude extract from a ?standard? size 12? cutting, that tasted vile when using isopropyl.  Whereas more around 10g crude extract using distilled water with a little vinegar with less nasty bitter taste.


Which brings me to my next point, your not getting down to a 500mg dosage unless you perform an A/B.  Or your girl is ok choking down 10-20 caps.


But yea Mescaline is magic alright ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I?ve been feeling really off this past year and couldn?t figure it out until I realized I haven?t had a good Mescaline trip in over a year.  I?ve been taking it fairly regularly since I was young and I feel it has strong anti-depressant like qualities that last long after the experience is over.  I?m now planning my next adventure very soon.


Mescaline and MDMA combined has brought me to a level of compassion that neither could accomplish alone.  Plus I think the other alkaloids in the cacti may potentiate the MDXX even more.  3 days after Shulgins passing I had a session with the two in honor of him and I feel he blessed me that day because that experience was life changing.

I finally have a chance to try Mescaline Hcl, it's been years since I had San Pedro and Peruvian Torch which I remember having nausea from.  How is the nausea with pure mescaline? Is the nausea from the plants from other alkaloids in the plant? I have ondansetron on hand but I've also heard mescaline is a good candidate for rectal dosing both for nausea and getting your money's worth in the amount required to peak. Besides the cactus, I have  experience with mescaline related compounds like the 2Cs, Dox, NBOHs etc all of which have no nausea for me. I'm just curious as to any factors that give mescaline the reputation for the hard come up (other than peyote rituals with purging being a component like ayahuasca). So far the only psychedelic that has given me nausea is ETH-LAD.

I am also interested in hearing people's experiences with synthetic mescaline. Any BLers tried it before? How does it compare to other PEAs and psychedelics? 


I have a chance to try it, and as the parent of the phenethylamines, I would like to get to know it before researching the class any further. 


I'm gonna read through this thread, and some erowid experience reports, but would love to hear what people have to say about it here these days.

I found mescaline hcl to lack a lot of the physical euphoria (as well as nausea etc) of cactus or cactus extract. It was also a bit more shallow and lacking in depth. Less therapeutic, less euphoric. Those other alkaloids play a huge role

That is good to know. I will likely go the synthetic route as it'll be easier than chugging down the cactus. But if it really does limit the full effect I could definitely see myself going that route. In general I love phenethylamines so I'm really excited for this.

I prefer a total alkaloid extract, even a crude one, to mescaline hcl, even though I don't like dealing with the nausea. And I've tried both isolated mescaline (which was acetate actually) as well as synthetic.


The acetate was a little more full bodied, potentially due to set and setting but I doubt it, more likely some other alkaloids made it thru the isolation process. (Dirty Sanchez as opposed to white fluff needles or yellowish powder)

I’ve had plenty of Mescaline acetate extracted, purified to the point where I was able to get nice Mescaline acetate crystals amongst the other alkaloids.


I felt the purified M. acetate was different than a crude extract or tea even, more a traditional psychedelic and less the empathogen that I adore.  Amazing visuals though, much stronger than tea or extract.


I think the best way to go to avoid puking and get the “full” experience is to use a crude extract made from diluted vinegar.  Dry completely then capsule up or reconstitute in a tea form again when ready to use.  (The reconstituted tea is MUCH better than regular tea, and you can exactly control how dilute you want it.)

I tried mescaline for the first time today. 395mg of brown extract crystals hcl. I tend to have a higher tolerance than others. I took a good thumbsize chunk of ginger root and blended it in hot water to make a strong ginger tea and drank about an hour before in failed effort to stave off nausea. 


+ 0:30 - Started to feel something that felt a little glowy. "Is this what people mean when they talk about rolling?" 


+ 1:00 - Nausea becomes pronounced and dominates my experience for the next hour and half. Oddly I felt sexual even while having nausea.


+ 4:00 - Talked to my sober girlfriend, felt very open and at ease and aware of the nuances of my psychology. I could easily share vulnerable things. I also felt aware of her, and could sense areas where she felt closed to me or afraid and felt accepting and complete non judgmental of her. We had a good long conversation. I remembered science things from college and shared about electron orbitals and light and the mystery of existence and she shared in the wonder with me. Went to a park and felt so open like light and energy were flowing out of me in all directions. I felt free of all anxiety, free of all judgement. Felt connected to others. Shared a smile with someone with a big leaf in their hair. Called my mom, sent my dad a picture of the sunset. Grateful to be alive. Feel very much at peace. I spent a few decades working with my demons and its so nice to just be able to have this ease. GI discomfort rides along but not overwhelming. No visuals. Felt more sexual than I ever felt with LSD, mushrooms or 2c-E. Was able to keep track of time, navigate for my girlfriend while she drove. Definitely felt the drug, however likely will need a higher dose to fully explore its nature. 


I am now at about + 10:00 and still feeling the openness and brightness. It was a nice long steady plateau that very slowly is tapering off, not waves of intensity like mushrooms. It felt like I could get a lot done with this.

![🌵](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f335.png)6 PSYCHOACTIVE CACTI THAT DON'T CONTAIN MESCALINE![🌵](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f335.png)


The desert holds secrets that don't fit in a single name. Not all psychoactivity in the Cactaceae kingdom comes from mescaline: there exists a complete universe of phenethylamines, extremely rare alkaloids, and nearly forgotten molecules that live in species equally sacred, ancient, and fascinating.


From macromerine to candicine, passing through unique compounds like weberine, longimammosine, longimammamine, and even little-known derivatives of mescaline, these cacti reveal the immense chemical diversity that Mexico and South America have silently protected for millions of years.


In this carousel I explore psychoactive cacti that DO NOT contain mescaline, but possess other alkaloids capable of generating altered, symbolic, and profoundly visionary states —from 11-meter giants to 4 cm miniatures that guard entire kingdoms in their sap.


Each species tells a story:

This post is not an invitation to consume ![😉](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png), but rather a tribute to visionary botany, natural chemistry, and the peoples who have safeguarded these species. ![🌵](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f335.png)![✨](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/2728.png)

Psychonautics is also knowledge, respect, and preservation.


5 Psychoactive Cacti That Don't Contain Mescaline


Coryphantha elephantidens var. Inermis


While Hikuri/Peyote has an average of 3.5% mescaline, this cactus contains its alkaloid at a quantity of 5%, making it one of the most potent cacti in the World.


It contains one of the least popular natural alkaloids in history, which is "Candicine".


It contains high quantities of two more complex substituted versions than mescaline:


N-Methylmescaline

N,N-Dimethylmescaline


Turbinicarpus pseudomacrochele is one of the smallest cacti in the World; some of its varieties reaching 4cm as their maximum size.


It contains high quantities of two alkaloids named in direct reference to this species:


Longimammosine

Longimammamine


In 2018 it was discovered to contain 3-methoxy-amphetamine, being one of the few amphetamine-containing organisms in the world.


One of the cheapest and most common cacti in the international market, with an average cost of $1 dollar per specimen.


Pachycereus weberi is one of the 3 largest cactus species in the World, capable of reaching up to 11 meters in height.


It contains one of the 3 least studied alkaloids of all cacti, which is Weberine.


In Coahuila they call Coryphantha macromeris "Doña Ana," referring to the spirit that personifies itself when consumed.


It contains a phenethylamine very similar to mescaline, which is "Macromerine"


The exact alkaloid of Obregonia denegrii is unknown; however, intrepid psychonauts report it as psychoactive.

El desierto guarda secretos que no caben en un solo nombre. No toda la psicoactividad del reino Cactaceae nace de la mezcalina: existe un universo completo de fenetilaminas, alcaloides rarísimos y moléculas casi olvidadas que viven en especies igual de sagradas, antiguas y fascinantes.


Desde la macromerina hasta la candicina, pasando por compuestos únicos como la weberina, longimamosina, longimamina, e incluso derivados poco conocidos de la mescalina, estos cactus revelan la inmensa diversidad química que México y Sudamérica han protegido silenciosamente durante millones de años.


En este carrusel exploro cactus psicoactivos que NO contienen mezcalina, pero que poseen otros alcaloides capaces de generar estados alterados, simbólicos y profundamente visionarios —desde gigantes de 11 metros hasta miniaturas de 4 cm que guardan reinos enteros en su savia.


Cada especie cuenta una historia:
