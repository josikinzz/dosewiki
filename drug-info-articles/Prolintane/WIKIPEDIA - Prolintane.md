Prolintane is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant and norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) of the phenylalkylpyrrolidine family developed in the 1950s. Being an amphetamine derivative, it is closely related in chemical structure to other drugs such as pyrovalerone, MDPV, and propylhexedrine, and has a similar mechanism of action. Many cases of prolintane abuse have been reported.
Under the brand name Katovit, prolintane was commercialized by the Spanish pharmaceutical company FHER until 2001. It was most often used by students and workers as a stimulant to provide energy and increase alertness and concentration.
