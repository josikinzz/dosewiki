## Effects
Nicotine promotes the release of the hormone adrenaline as well as the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin. In low quantities, nicotine thus has a stimulating effect. Nicotine briefly and reversibly accelerates the heartbeat and causes constriction of the blood vessels. The central short-term effects include above all an increase in psychomotor performance as well as attention and memory. In higher doses, nicotine has a calming and muscle-relaxing effect; it reduces feelings of hunger, anxiety and aggression. Nicotine is responsible for addiction to tobacco products.

## Dosage
Individual and dependent on the form of consumption. The lethal dose of nicotine for adults is about 60 mg; for children and adolescents it is significantly lower.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Reduction of the amount of oxygen in the blood and impairment of the sense of smell and taste. With regular consumption: increase in blood pressure and heart rate, increased release of adrenaline and increased activity of the gastrointestinal tract. Mostly with first or repeated consumption: drop in blood pressure, lowered body temperature, nausea and/or nausea, headache and dizziness.

### Long-term Risks
The accompanying substances of tobacco smoke (not nicotine) are responsible for the known health consequences of smoking such as increased risk of heart and lung diseases (asthma, chronic bronchitis, heart attack, stroke, thrombosis, lung cancer) and damage to the stomach lining (risk of stomach ulcers). Nicotine is suspected of having a cancer-promoting effect. Nicotine is one of the drugs with the highest dependence potential with psychological and physical symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can include depression, anxiety, restlessness, insomnia and (in the long term with abstinence) weight gain. Taking medication (e.g. birth control pills) in combination with high tobacco consumption impairs blood circulation (risk of thrombosis!). People with cardiovascular problems, lung and respiratory problems (asthma, chronic bronchitis) should not use tobacco.

## Safer Use
- Tobacco is a legal, freely available and socially accepted drug. However, this does not mean that this psychoactive substance is low-risk and harmless to health!
- With e-cigarettes or vaporizers (vaporisers), there are ways to consume tobacco with less risk.
- Nicotine is easily absorbed through all mucous membranes of the body. There are therefore lower-risk products such as snuff, chewing tobacco or nicotine gum.
- If you shoot yourself, make sure you use good filtering methods.
- For people with cardiovascular problems, risk of heart attack, lung and respiratory problems (asthma, bronchitis), it is recommended not to consume tobacco or to consume only small amounts.
- Women who use hormonal contraception run an increased risk of circulatory disorders, thromboses, varicose veins and thus heart attacks, strokes or pulmonary embolisms (blockage of blood vessels in the lungs) when they use tobacco. Women over 30 are particularly at risk.
- Smoking during pregnancy is generally not advisable, as the toxins in tobacco smoke enter the bloodstream of the foetus via the placenta.
- Always press out your cigarettes well. There is a risk of fire!
- Do not eat tobacco. If tobacco or tobacco dissolved in water is accidentally swallowed (especially by children), an emergency call should be made immediately. There is a danger to life!
