*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETH-LAD*

ETH-LAD, or ETHLAD, also known as 6-ethyl-6-nor-LSD, is a psychedelic drug of the lysergamide family related to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD; also known as METH-LAD). It is slightly more potent than LSD and is among the most potent psychedelics known. The drug is taken orally.
It acts as a serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. In addition, it binds to dopamine receptors. The drug produces psychedelic-like effects in animals. It is closely structurally related to LSD and to other psychedelic lysergamides like PRO-LAD and AL-LAD.
ETH-LAD was first described in the scientific literature by 1976. Its effects in humans were assessed and reported by Alexander Shulgin in the 1980s and 1990s. The drug was encountered as a novel recreational designer drug in Europe by 2016. In addition, a prodrug of ETH-LAD, 1P-ETH-LAD, has been developed and encountered as a designer drug.

## Use and effects

According to Alexander Shulgin in his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved), ETH-LAD has a dose of 40 to 150 μg orally and a duration of 8 to 12 hours. However, it also produced clear effects at a dose of 20 μg, and in other publications, Shulgin gave a lower dose range for the drug of 40 to 80 μg. Its onset ranges from 15 minutes to 1 hour and peak effects occur after about 1 to 2 hours.
Shulgin has stated that ETH-LAD is "a little more potent" than LSD or roughly twice as potent as LSD in humans. Other researchers have described it as "slightly more potent" or "somewhat more potent" than LSD in humans. For comparison, Shulgin lists the dose range of LSD as 60 to 200 μg or 50 to 200 μg in his publications. Based on the preceding findings, ETH-LAD is one of the most potent serotonergic psychedelics known in humans, if not the most potent known psychedelic. As a result of this, it has been said that LSD can no longer be considered the most potent psychedelic.
The effects of ETH-LAD have been reported to include closed-eye imagery, very few visual changes or distortions, gentle movements of objects, LSD-like visual aspects, two-dimensional surfaces looking three-dimensional, objects looking "magical", and possible time slowing. It was described as making the body feel balanced, thinking being easy, concepts easy to follow through, mind capable of realistic and down-to-earth thought, and warmth and humor being present. Other reported effects included feeling lazy, diuretic effects, no appetite loss, decongestant effects, stomach discomfort, and chills.
Compared to LSD, ETH-LAD was described as lacking the push and sparkle of LSD, allowing for extraordinary experiences with none of LSD's demands, being less aggressive than LSD and lacking its "taking control" nature, having a greatly modified degree of visual distortion relative to LSD, having visual effects similar to LSD but much more gentle, and being more allowing than demanding.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

ETH-LAD acts as a serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. It shows greater potency and efficacy as a serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist than LSD in vitro. In addition to the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, the drug binds with high affinity to the serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptors. Like LSD, ETH-LAD also binds with lower affinity to the dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5 receptors.
ETH-LAD shows psychedelic-like effects in animals, specifically rodent drug discrimination tests. It is about 1.6- to 2.3-fold more potent than LSD in these tests. Similarly to LSD, ETH-LAD shows moderate anti-inflammatory effects in preclinical research, but with slightly higher potency.

### Pharmacokinetics

The in-vitro metabolism of ETH-LAD has been studied.

## Chemistry

ETH-LAD, also known as 9,10-didehydro-N,N,6-triethylergoline-8β-carboxamide or as 6-ethyl-6-nor-LSD, is a substituted lysergamide derivative related to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD; also known as METH-LAD). It is the 6-ethyl derivative of nor-LSD (6-nor-LSD; H-LAD) and is the derivative of LSD with an ethyl group instead of methyl group at the 6 position of the ergoline ring system.

### Properties

According to Alexander Shulgin, ETH-LAD may be chemically unstable in solution.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of ETH-LAD has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of ETH-LAD include nor-LSD, LSD, PRO-LAD, IP-LAD, AL-LAD, FLUORETH-LAD, and CE-LAD, among others. 1P-ETH-LAD, a prodrug of ETH-LAD, has been developed and encountered as a novel designer drug.

## History

ETH-LAD was first described in the scientific literature by Tetsukichi Niwaguchi and colleagues by 1976. Subsequently, its preclinical pharmacology was studied and described by Andrew J. Hoffman and David E. Nichols in 1985. ETH-LAD's properties and effects in humans were assessed by Alexander Shulgin. These observations were reported via personal communication by Nichols in 1986, later described by Shulgin himself in a 1994 literature review, and described in-depth by Shulgin himself in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved). ETH-LAD was encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe by 2016.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Switzerland

ETH-LAD is illegal in Switzerland as of December 2015.

#### United Kingdom

On June 10, 2014, the United Kingdom Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) recommended that ETH-LAD be specifically named in the UK Misuse of Drugs Act as a class A drug despite not identifying it as ever having been sold or any harm associated with its use. The UK Home office accepted this advice and announced a ban of the substance to be enacted on 6 January 2015.
