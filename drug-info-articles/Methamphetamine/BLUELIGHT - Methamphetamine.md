> **What Is Methamphetamine?**
> 
> Methamphetamine is a stimulant chemical commonly used as a recreational drug. It is legally prescribed as a treatment for ADD under the brand name Desoxyn, for both children and adults. On the street, it is generally found as an odorless, white or off-white, bitter-tasting powder, though it is also found in pills, capsules and larger crystals. It is frequently snorted, but is also used orally, smoked, and injected. Methamphetamine is commonly known as "speed," "meth," and "chalk." In its smoked form, it is often referred to as "ice," "crystal," "crank," and "glass." It is a white, odorless, bitter-tasting crystalline powder that easily dissolves in water or alcohol. The drug was developed early last century from its parent drug, amphetamine, and was used originally in nasal decongestants and bronchial inhalers. Like amphetamine, methamphetamine causes increased activity and talkativeness, decreased appetite, and a general sense of well-being. However, methamphetamine differs from amphetamine in that at comparable doses, much higher levels of methamphetamine get into the brain, making it a more potent stimulant drug. It also has longer lasting and more harmful effects on the central nervous system.

> **Methamphetamine Addiction**
> 
> 
> 
> Long-term use and methamphetamine abuse will profoundly alter brain function. Because of damage to the neurons, an addict’s emotional health will be adversely impacted.  These changes can be acute and sometimes permanent.  It should be noted that the contents of crystal meth, the street form of the methamphetamine drug, tend to be a combination of toxic chemicals such as lye, Drano, pseudoephedrine, battery acid, insecticides, solvents, and ether. These types of chemicals are not designed to be ingested.Management of meth addiction relies heavily on forms of behavioral therapy, along with a few drugs that can be of some help with the craving that follows withdrawal from the drug. There is no known drug that can directly counter the effects of meth on the brain, but there are treatments available that help to minimise and reverse damage sustained through addiction.

> **Withdrawal Symptoms**
> 
> 
> 
> Methamphetamine is not known to be physically addictive. In most cases it takes between twenty four and forty eight hours for the drug to process through a person's system after the last dose is taken. While methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms can be very intense, they are generally psychological in nature.

> **Treating methamphetamine withdrawal:**
> 
> Methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms can be treated with a careful plan. In some cases the treatment requires a reduction in the dosage until the body adjusts to lower amounts, and, finally, no meth at all. It is also possible to help combat depression with anitdepressants as part of a treatment program. These are effective measures, especially in situations that feature medical uses for methamphetamine. For addicts who have been abusing meth for a long period of time, a combination of techniques might be used. There are residential treatment centers that specialize in treating severe addictions. These usually combine the step down method with pharmacological solutions. Counseling is also part of treating methamphetamine addiction and meth withdrawal symptoms. Abusers may learn techniques for helping them avoid focusing on the unpleasant effects of withdrawal. This can include meditation, physical activity and through developing a hobby. Overcoming any addiction is difficult, and one of the main reasons is due to withdrawal symptoms. Methamphetamine withdrawal is no exception. And due the nature of meth, withdrawals may be just as unpleasant as withdrawal from more physically addictive substances.

> **Stimulant Psychosis**
> 
> 
> 
> **What is it?**
> 
> Stimulant psychosis is a psychotic disorder that appears in some people who use stimulant drugs. The symptoms of stimulant psychosis are shared largely with the symptoms of organic psychosis, including hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder, and, in extreme cases, catatonia. Physical symptoms of prolonged stimulant abuse or acute overdose tend to accompany these psychotic symptoms in cases of stimulant psychosis (but not organic psychosis). These additional symptoms may include aggression, arrhythmia, dilated pupils, diarrhea, hypertension, hyperthermia, nausea, rapid breathing, restlessness, seizures, sleep deprivation, tremor, and vomiting. Methamphetamine is well known to cause psychosis, typically when abused chronically or in high doses. Stimulant psychosis can manifest in a number of ways:
> 
> 
> 
> **Hallucinations:**
> 
> Auditory - This is the false perception of sound and the most frequent type of hallucination. Most frequently the user "hears voices." Command hallucinations are “voices” that may issue commands for violence to others.
> 
> Visual - Seeing a person, object or animal that does not exist in the environment.
> 
> Olfactory - This is the false perception of smelling odors that are not present in the environment.
> 
> Tactile - This is a false perception of the sense of touch, often of something on or under the skin.
> 
> Gustatory - A false perception of the sense of taste.
> 
> 
> 
> **Delusions:**
> 
> Persecution - The individual feels threatened and believes that others intend to harm him in some way. For example, the user thinks that the CIA intends to kill him.
> 
> Grandeur - The individual has an exaggerated feeling of importance, power or knowledge. For example, a user thinks that he is in control of the state.
> 
> Reference - The individual thinks that unrelated events or happenings are somehow connected to him or her, usually in a negative way. For example, a user watching TV thinks the news broadcaster is trying to get a message to him.
> 
> Being controlled - The individual believes certain objects or persons have control over his/her behavior. For example, the user believes the president of the United States has control over his behavior.
> 
> Somatic delusions - The individual believes his/her body or parts of the body are changing or being distorted. The user believes his brain is rotting.
> 
> 
> 
> **Paranoia:**
> 
> The individual has extreme suspicion of others, their actions or perceived intentions. For example, a user sees a duck on the river and thinks the police have placed a camera in the duck to watch him.
> 
> 
> 
> **Obsessions:**
> 
> Compulsion or repetitive behaviors are manifestations of chronic meth use. Users may become obsessed or perform repetitive tasks such as cleaning, assembling and disassembling objects or washing hands several times in a 15 minute period. Other repetitive tasks include formication, grinding of teeth, and pulling out hair.
> 
> 
> 
> **Haldol Medication For Psychosis:**
> 
> Haldol is effective in the treatment of psychosis, however it has a number of unpleasant and dangerous side effects. Common side effects include anticholinergic manifestations (dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention and constipation), nausea, gastrointestinal upset, skin rash, sedation, orthostatic hypotension, photosensitivity, decreased libido, gynecomastia, weight gain, extrapyramidal symptoms (pseudoparkinsonism, akinesia, akathisia, dystonia, oculogyric crisis), tardive dyskinesia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. It is very important that the nurse be very familiar with the action and side effects of haldol.

Wth is with these replies?


I've personally only smoked meth, but I agree about the need for a IV meth thread similar to the heroin ones. I don't even know for sure if there is one or not cause I'm new and not interested in IVing it, but if there isn't one there should be.

How much should one person take at a time?

Depends on the person's tolerance, quality of dope, setting and mindframe...

For myself: I usually shot 1/8th of a gram of decent powder, less when I had some ice.


How often should you do a shot?

See above

For myself: I usually felt the need to redose about every 6-8 hours.


How do you know when you have been 'smoked down'?

Don't know what that means


When is it time to up your dosage?

When your usual dosage doesn't get you high or relieve crash symptoms.


What are the steps in preparing a shot of ice? Water - Dope ratio

I'd say 50%-50% is about right, to start. As a person gains their own technique they become set in their ways. Like me for instance: with heroin, I would always use a full 100 units of water when I would shoot a dose (usually 1/10th of a gram). People would say, "Damn, how much water do you use?" because they would usually use 30-80 units. It was just my own method.

That said, just put dope in spoon, add water, some people add heat but some don't. Filter, draw, slam.

I don't use Methamphetamine either, but how could we call ourselves an objective harm reduction forum, scoffing at the idea of using one drug while providing much invaluable information about the next?  It would be irrational and hypocritical to have loads of info regarding IV use of Heroin and Cocaine, but not Meth just because some of us are against the use of the drug.  


Better that someone who is determined to use Methamphetamine intravenously researches it here first and does it safely.  Harm reduction shouldn't discriminate between substances.

I feel the same way about people injecting meth as i do about children eating hash brownies..it doesnt concern me, therefore why should it concern anyone other than people in the users' immediate environment.

I started ***IV'ing*** meth in January of this year after having ***smoked*** it for the first time in October of 2009 and quickly saw my life as I knew it come to a screeching halt in early June. I lost everything, house, job, car, dogs...I would highly recommend leaving this drug alone, but if you're going to mess with it, IV is the cleanest delivery system, just make sure you are experienced in shooting and have plenty of discipline when it comes to drug use.


IMHO the following would be decent guidelines for your posted questions:


***How much should one person take at a time?***

Depends on indididual tolerance, quality of dope, ice, etc - if you're new to meth, a good starting shot might be 1/8 of a gram (.125). If your tolerance has increased due to frequent use, perhaps 1/4 gram (.25 - typically a purchased "twenty" in the US). Always test your dope prior to injection (especially when you obtain from several sources), to test: roll a small bowl in a piezo first, or run it on foil. Quantities just go up from there.


***How often should you do a shot?***

The rule of thumb prior to doing a follow-up shot is as follows: if you can't hit yourself then you're probably still high, no shot needed. Probably 4-6 hours after your first shot, but as stated above, if you can't hit a vein then you're too high to have another shot.


***How do you know when you have been 'smoked down'?***

I'm not exactly sure what you mean by "smoked down", perhaps you can explain this. Not a known term in meth circles.


***When is it time to up your dosage?***

If you're not getting ANY rush from your shot and you haven't missed, you probably need to up your dose.


***What are the steps in preparing a shot of ice? Water - Dope ratio:***

I've always used the same formula for prepping a shot of meth: whether I'm prepping a single shot or a shot for two, I ALWAYS use the same amount of water -40 units. That way I always know what comes back after I draw up. If the mixture is too thick, draw up a little more water into your syringe.

As far as method goes, put your meth in a spoon, add water, crush/stir so there aren't any chunks, cotton/wheel filter, draw up, bang away.


I can't stress enough that it is CRUCIAL you do NOT miss when injecting meth. Lord knows I missed plenty when I first started, unfortunately one of my misses ended up abscessing and getting infected. I had to be treated with IV antibiotics to cure the abscess, and I'm left with a gnarly little scar that'll probably never go away. Also, make sure that EVERYTHING that comes into contact with your dope is ABSOLUTELY CLEAN. Your spoon, your syringe, your water (tap water is fine) should be as clean as possible, that's just common sense.


Hope this helps

In my opinion (as a non-meth user and harm-reductionist) this is EXACTLY the kind of thread we need. The people who are going to IV meth are going to IV meth. I'd prefer they did it with some kind of guidance. The more harmful the drug, the more harm-reduction and education necessary

Pinpoint - You are exactly right. 


Once someone gets it in their mind, it stays there. There might as well be something on this website to help them and keep them from hurting themselves.

That's the whole point in harm reduction - people are going to use drugs if they want to, so why not provide access to information. We have all sorts of threads on how to IV pills and about shooting heroin etc, I don't shoot meth but I still think people messing with it should know as much as possible. HR is about making informed decisions and being safe. 


How can anyone act like they're better because they shoot H instead of meth? 8)

Any further off topic posts are going to get an infraction.  


It is possible to IV meth and have a good experience with it.

How much should one person take at a time?


If your dealing with pure ice, I'd say between 50-150mgs. 0.05gram to 0.15grams. I've did 0.15 150mgs my first time trying meth. I've never smoked or snorted it, I went into IV my first time trying because I wanted the best high.


How often should you do a shot?

Try not to redose, I'd say wait a week. When you start coming down, don't redose, have some benzos on hand. It really helps with the paranoia and hearing voices. 


How do you know when you have been 'smoked down'?


No Idea what this means. 


When is it time to up your dosage?


When you build a tolerance.


What are the steps in preparing a shot of ice? Water - Dope ratio

Use all sterile equipment, use about 40-60units of sterile saline, 100 unit syringe, about 30-31 gauge, swab with alcohol, insert syringe, register and push plunger. Don't miss the shot otherwise you won't get the intense rush. 


I've only shot meth 5 times, and its highly addictive. Only reason I've managed to not do it is the fact that I don't have a dealer. Otherwise I'd do it every week if possible. I don't suggest injecting meth. I've been clean off meth for 3 months now.

Wats up guys, im a bit of a regular user of meth but am still not touching the needle. It is damm tempting but I know its over if I do it, just out of curiosity what does the buzz actually feel like. The only time I would do it is if I was old and retired and had the money.

I'm curious as to how strong the rush with meth is, and how would it compare to the rush of heroin. I for one can seriously get off on the rush you get from H. Also, how is the high that's left behind, is it pretty euphoric? I'm kinda curious about meth, I use Adderall on a semi regular basis and have always kinda wondered how much more I could get done using meth, or maybe I wouldn't get anything done. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I will have to agree with this one~~I will not do it any other way now. If I'm gonna get high, I'm gonna shoot it. My best advice here is not to move on to a different form of administration until you are bored with the one you are currently using. If you just luv blowin clouds or takin capsules, stick with it. Because once u feel that rush, u are pretty much gonna stick with the needle.

For me, the rush is my favorite part. IMHO, the rush depends on the purity of the meth, the amount you are consuming, and the amount of water you use. If you have a decent size shot of good quality meth that is diluted half water half dope you will prolly get an amazing rush. It starts as a burning (not painful) in your stomach and it rises up your chest and exits as a cough. For me tho, it not only rushes up, but it also heads south and exits in 'other' areas. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I don't consider the feeling I get from shootin' meth a buzz. I would lean more toward an altered state of mind that is somewhere near La-La land and NeverNever Land ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I still smoke ocassionally but that is just a warm up for the main event. Since I slammed the first time I've been hooked. So seductive.

I went from smoking to shooting and now back to smoking methamphetamine. I dissolve in some water (like coke, there is no need to heat meth before shooting it), always micron filter my shots, then I shoot it. It was a great experience for myself when I did it. If you are prone to missing a shot DO NOT do meth via IV!!!! I've seen horrible experiences from missed meth shots.

I used to love a fat shot of meth. It wasn't a good shot if I didn't fear that it might kill me once the rush hit.


Meth has one hell of a head rush. I wish I could just have the rush and not have to go through the not sleeping for days part.

let me say this... i have not done meth next month being six years i smoked it for a year bfore i starting shooting it....i was already bad off... the first shot i took was the best intense wonderfull thing ever...its unimaginable and unbelievable but shooting meth took me down and i mean down quick to anyone who is considering shooting meth i PROMOMISE YOU once u do there is no going back. u will never even consider doing it any other way. it took me a long long time to get my life back and only by the grace of god i am still alive and actually have a life again. i would never ever recommend the needle to anyone. There r things that go along with shooting meth that u can not even imagine . its been 6 years next month and i still think about it and dream about it and i dont know if that will ever go away.

I've been an IV user for a long time now. It's a feeling like no other. The way your heart beats and your head rushes, it's intense and amazing.. It's pretty sad but the way I can tell if I've had enough, is if I feel like I'm on the verge of an OD. 


**How much should one person take at a time?**Depends on the quality, personal choice, effects you want, first time/not first time, there are heaps of variables.. Personally, the first time I shot it, I had a half gram shot and was absolutely, insanely high and thought I was going to die, I wouldn't recommend that to anyone! Be sensible the first few times (if not, every time) because as we know, it can go from woo to woah very quickly...


**How often should you do a shot?** I try not to shoot multiple times but it always happens, I find my veins thank me when I give them a break. If I have gear, I use it. I can go through three grams a day easily and that'd be about five shots worth. 


**How do you know when you have been 'smoked down'?** I don't understand the terminology either, lol.


**When is it time to up your dosage?** For me, it was losing that initial 'rush'. I think I fucked myself at the beginning though, having my first experience with it being half a gram. I've not yet come close to experiencing anything like that except for a quarter of a point of insane shards I had once. It's at the point now where I can still sleep after two grams. Tolerance is a bitch!


**What are the steps in preparing a shot of ice?** Well, I'll set up what I need, take a seat at my desk and prepare. Usually for a half gram shot, I'll use 60units of water, draw it up in my needle, tip gear into spoon, add water, mix til it's all mixed in and no bits laying in the bottom, draw it back up into the syringe, then bombs away!

I get whats called crank by a lot of people up here in NY/New England.  Its apparently a less purified version of meth, and easier to make.  I started off blowing lines of it, and stuck with that for a quite a few months.  I eventually did get used to smoking it, and enjoying the high that comes with that, and recently have been IVing it.  All three methods give quite different initial highs, and depending on the situation, I switch up how I do the drug.  Smoking is by far the smoothest and least overpowering high.  I can almost close my eyes and relax after a few good hits, but the high tapers off quick, so I'm never far from the bowl for the next hit.  Blowing/snorting a fat rail is a like getting woken up with a bucket of ice water-mostly ice-and hurts many times worse.  As the pain in your sinus' dissappears in the following 30-45 seconds, the high begins to build and feels like you just woke up from a 24 nap, at a huge meal, and are excited to begin whatever you may have planned.  This way seems to last the longest and most evenly for me before Im instrested in doing more.  IVing is always a strange sensation.  You obviously feel it the fastest and you get the most intense high or best initial peak. Theres no build up, or any "getting higher" indications, your just suddenly in the euphoric stage before you realize it, and depending on the size of the dose, can feel like you stepped from standing still on a sidewalk to instantly riding on the hood of a car on the freeway.  It can sometimes take a minute or 3 just to get used to how fast your brain is processing information and make the required adjustments to interact with the world in this over-accellerated state. Hopefully this landed in the right thread, i realize its more of a general experience post than specifically meth-IV related, but I saw quite a few people either mention they hadnt tried IVing the drug, and/or experienced it one way, but not others.  I wanted to give an idea of how the different methods compare to each other, as far as I have experienced.

I like the taste of ether after a shot of good old school ether dope aka crank..lol...the crystal lasts longer in general than crank but I have had some really fire white powder crank that was about as good purity wise as any crystal. People around here prefer the old school aka white pure ether crank ,especially IV meth users..crystal meth that is very pure is a good high but does not have that hardcore spin that crank does IMO,at least the good really clean ,purer crank..I used to get some yellowish crystal about 4 years ago from these Mexicans I knew, although I know a lot of Mexicans and whites,and black people that sell/use meth, but this yellow tinted crystal when you Injected it ,gave you that crank rush and you blew out ether after a shot like crank...I miss having that pink,white,peanut butter dope from Cali,and the yellow lemon drop from Cali ,the moist chunky meth that was fire to inject and smoked clean also...but the brown moist peanut butter crank from Cali was the best ever,back in 97 or 98,,we got a bunch and it looked like it was nasty dirty shit,,dark brown with orange,red,and lighter brown and blue crystals when you held that shit up to the light,also it turned blue in water and spun you out hard core and lasted a long time and made you feel like superman kinda meth..man dude said it was once a decade dope ,but now i think it was once in a lifetime dope,although we had a lot of it,it lasted for a month ,with us selling ounces a week even ...like I said we had a lot of it...

Wow, I can't believe you guys are suggesting 100mg+ initial dose for IV Meth. Maybe I am more sensitve to meth than most, but my first shot was 20mg, which didn't have much of a rush and my 2nd shot (a week later) was 40mg. 


40mg had that mdma type feeling for like 40 minutes, followed by a 120+bpm heartrate (I have 65bpm normal resting heart rate) for the next 24 hours without sleep. Before this I would smoke or snort 30- 50mgs maybe once a month and use it to be more productive. Didn't seem worth it to me but to each their own.

> Depends on indididual tolerance, quality of dope, ice, etc - if you're new to meth, a good starting shot might be 1/8 of a gram (.125). If your tolerance has increased due to frequent use, perhaps 1/4 gram (.25 - typically a purchased "twenty" in the US). Always test your dope prior to injection (especially when you obtain from several sources), to test: roll a small bowl in a piezo first, or run it on foil. Quantities just go up from there.

Lord knows I missed plenty when I first started, unfortunately one of my misses ended up abscessing and getting infected. I had to be treated with IV antibiotics to cure the abscess, and I'm left with a gnarly little scar that'll probably never go away. Also, make sure that EVERYTHING that comes into contact with your dope is ABSOLUTELY CLEAN. Your spoon, your syringe, your water (tap water is fine) should be as clean as possible, that's just common sense.

Meth is programmed to destroy all you have. Earlier or later, more or less, but for sure. It is always up to the user to recognize it as soon as possible and to save what remains.

![:!](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/argh.gif) Before I give my take on those five points, I need to respond to curlygurl's post.  First, no one can predict how another person's dope slamming story is going to unfold.  Some people never go back to smoking or snorting after they graduate, while others treat themselves to a shot every once in a while.  


Second, I still enjoy smoking and snorting and I have been banging crystal since 7/7/10 .  It all depends on the situation.  Sometimes you are with friends who are passing the pizzo, while another time you might have to snort a line in some random fucking bathroom because you don't have any money for a pipe.   


Finally, if the person is smoking an obscene amount of dope and still not getting high enough, why shouldn't they book a trip on the crimson cruise?  In my experience, slammers are much more functional than smokers, and we don't deserve *most* of the stigma society has shoved on us. 


Now for my version of the *Gack Guidelines*:  


*How much should one person take at a time?*

This mainly depends on the quality of the crank.  If it is exceptionally good, 75mg will do the trick, but typically 100-200 mg gets the job done.  If you keep doing the same amount, the instensity of the rush diminshes, so I usually increase my dose progressively.  But a rookie should avoid doing more than 0.2 g.      


*How often should you do a shot?*

This is purely personal preference.  It depends on how high you want to get for how long.  Some people like smaller issues every 2-3 hours, while others would rather do a monstrous dose every 12.  You should also take into account how often you tweak, so as not to ravage your body.  In other words, the more often you use, the more you should try to inject less and less, with more and more time in between.  


*How do you know when you have been 'smoked down'?*

I'm assuming that by 'smoked down' you mean when you do way too much.  I know that I have done more than I should have when I feel like I'm walking on clouds.  For a short time, I can't feel my body, I get dizzy, I'm somewhat sleepy and I feel a bit nauseous.  It's like when you spin a top so hard it wobbles from side to side until it steadies itself. 


*When is it time to up your dosage?*

When you want to intensify your rush.  Personally, I up the dosage a little bit with every shot.  


*What are the steps in preparing a shot of ice? Water - Dope ratio:* 

(1) Place your dope in a spoon or the bottom of a soda can.  (2) Add 10-20 units water to the dope.  I was taught that the less water you use, the more intense the shot is, so I never use more than 15-20 units.  (3) Crush the crystal.  I find the top of the syringe works best.  DO NOT USE A FLAME TO DISSOLVE CRYSTAL.  THE WATER WILL EVAPORATE, LEAVING A COATING OF DOPE ON YOUR SPOON THAT WILL NOT DISSOLVE  (4) Tear off a TINY piece of cotton from a Q-tip, roll it into a ball, and drop into liquid.  It's best not to use cotton balls as they may contain the bacteria *enterobacter agglomerans* which causes cotton fever.  (5) Slide the point of the syringe into the cotton at a shallow angle.  (6) Draw up the liquid.  (7) Tap the syringe so that any air bubbles rise to the tip.  (8.) Press on the plunger to eliminate the excess air in the syringe.  (9) Wipe injection area with alcohol.  (10) Don't miss. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) 


THERE ARE ONLY THREE WORDS YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER WHEN INJECTING...CLEAN, CLEAN, AND CLEAN!!!!!


After your shot, rinse your syringe with water so the blood doesn't clog the needle.  Save your cottons (when you are out of dope, 5-10 of those little guys makes a decent issue).  If your injection sites start to scar, poke a hole in a Vitamin E gelcap and rub a little on the scar.  


Lastly, keep in mind that ice is psychologically, rather than physically addictive (you only think that you need it).  And remember, what goes up MUST come down.  Stay safe...

And use a new cotton for every shot, as well as definitely not saving cottons to get residue out of later. Cotton fever is not caused by little bits of cotton being injected as many seem to believe, It's caused by the growth of bacteria in the cotton. The only time ever got this was when i used a cotton again from the night before before, which was incredibly stupid and irresponsible of me to do - let alone someone saving them up for a couple days, yuk! And as mentioned, clean your cooker. Use rubbing alcohol then shake it in the air to dry it, don't use a towel the alcohol with fly off and evaporate very quickly anyway.


Welcome to Bluelight! also please use the search engine in the future, you will find that the majority of simple questions like this have been discussed many times.

If you have good veins and can see and feel them, I would go for 31 gauge, short tips (5/16").  


If you are using normal doses, you shouldn't need to use a large volume of liquid to dissolve the amount you want to use in one shot.  


There's already a thread about injecting meth so I'll merge this in there.

I've had a few run-arounds with injecting, smoking, snorting, and even drinking meth. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) (yep-drinking it mixed in with some good old O.J.) I don't know anything about the different *types* of meth- its all the same to me, never knew there were different types. Makes sense though cause the strength does vary and the high can be different sometimes. 


![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) I will never do it again. Any ROA, doesn't matter how. Nothing really all that"bad" happened, its just not for me. If you do too much of it, you can get sooo paranoid- and in a different way than cocaine. I mean in a way where your imagining conspiracies, and it almost like your in a different realm. Reality doesn't truly exist when your high cause it can cause... well... I guess the word I'm looking for is hallucinations, only I wasn't really *seeing *things. More like imagining things. Maybe I saw a couple of little things that weren't there, but its hard to describe the feeling I'm talking about. I just *knew* that this person or that person was after me, or my stash ![(:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)Dlol) I didn't know where I was (I was at home too), wasn't sure about who I was with (my husband).... It was freaky.


We're talking about days upon days of being awake and shootin meth constantly. And this only happened once. But it was enough for me. I still did it after that too, but no more than a half a gram any given day from that poing on, and I wasn't staying awake tweaking for days, but only maybe 3 or 4 times after that and I decided to just say no. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)  I've probably done meth 30 times or so. (a 3 or 4 day binge would count as only 1 time, ya dig?) 


Anyways, it definately burns, even if you don't miss any, and regardless of the ROA (except for drinking). I can't answer any of those questions, cause I think it depends on the person, really. I just thought I'd add my own 2 cents too.


I also agree that for me at least, once I shot it up, there was no turning back. No way I'd ever take it a different way after feeling the rush. I have to say though that meth was never *really* all that great to me. The whole high IMO is like the worst part of crack smoking. You know, the comedown part where all you want is another hit, and your tweaking out, ready to surf the berber wave. i.e. the carpet lol. And the only way I EVER got a rush is IV. ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif) There are much better drugs out there.


Shot prep- Pretty much the same as everyone else. Put the goodies in the spoon, draw up water, then squirt into spoon (I use about 40 units of water), crush up the crystals (I use the bigger end of the plunger), put the filter on the tip of the needle, suck up the solution, squeeze out the "air," tie off, and bang

For my first shot, I had a friend dose it out based on how much it would cost (IE: $5 shot, $10 shot). It was about a thumbnail sized pile of crystals. I just eyeball it now, each shot a little bigger than the last if I do several in one night. I've done a shot 20 minutes after another one when I just want to feel the rush, or like tonight, I've waited almost 5 hours to do another, because I am enjoying the speedy buzz and music, the euphoric rush isn't all that I'm seeking. Whenever I want that extra kick or a major headrush that makes me cough, I do another.

How much should one person take at a time?


How often should you do a shot? well pending on the user and what type of high he/she likes you can go for hours  w/o another shot. i prefer to do one "good" one, then i dont find myself wanting another for awhile


How do you know when you have been 'smoked down'? im guessing your asking when you should go to bed? when all your friends are repulsively annoyed by you..lol  


When is it time to up your dosage? like stated before, when the same amount doesnt do the buzz, trying upping the dosage a little...if thats still not working, try laying off totally for a few days...let your body rest..


What are the steps in preparing a shot of ice? Water - Dope ratio  well for me it takes a bit more. ive been doing this for almost 7 years now. ill take like a .40 of a gram of crank/meth and add like 40-50 units of water. so if you was using like .20 of product, try using the same in water. that solution always worked for me. ALWAYS USE CLEAN MATERIALS!!!!!!! i cant stess this enough. Hep C can be contracted thru your own blood that has dried up on a rig. Always make sure you filter, espicially if your using crank..its such a dirty drug. If your a first time shooter with this drug i would recommend using a little bit to start out. if you ever get that one that makes your vision go yellow.... umm yeah try to stay calm, if you start blacking out, seek help asap!!!  hope this helps someone..love the site..keep it up!!

.25grams is what I did and could be unbearable or too much sensory input for a first timer.  


It's as easy for cooking up as heroin but this is the number one drug you don't want to miss shooting.  Although I never miss once I get that adrenaline flowing, it should help you as well. Respect the power and the intensity, easy does it.

**so im sure you've all realized that different areas of the body change the onset BUT**


I am debating whether i should mainline a shot into the veins that run across my chest, i however am not an idiot and know that close to the heart with meth being such a powerful stimulant. I'm wondering however, if the only danger in me getting the dosage wrong is overamping, or the proximity will make the consequences more dire.

About 7 years ago I used meth quite a lot, eventually got sick of it and quit (I've never had a problem with stimulants believe it or not). I didn't touch the stuff for at least 6 years. Then had a chance to try some again. I only took about 10 mg of shards, IV, (I use a mg scale and always weigh everything I use).


The effect of that tiny bit was so intense I couldn't sleep for 3 days (I lay there at night eyes closed for 8+ hours strait, 2 nights in a  row,  totally awake, mind flying like crazy trying to sleep). I didn't get back to normal for 5 days, I would actually wake up still high on the 4th and 5th day, even though I finally slept.


I've used meth a lot and it has never ever lasted that long nor been that strong. I couldn't believe that tiny bit could do that. That first day I was hallucinating and had ego meltdown events like psychedelics. I really don't think it was one of those long lasting bromonated methylenedioxy analogues, it really felt like speed, just hella intense.


I've used meth several times since then, IV. Even the same stuff I had that 1st time (I had a bunch left). Though I waited about 3 months to do it again (I kept it carefully in the freezer). That 1st time was scary. I thought I wasn't going to come down since speed isn't supposed to last that long.


So, just thought I'd share my experience since it was so outrageous.

Has anyone else heard of this happening with crystal meth? I've used it hundreds of times and it has never done that before or since. Any ideas?

hi i'm a recreational user of meth, and i haven't done any since 3 weeks ago, i've had alot of bad experiences with drugs that ever prevented me from becoming addicted to it, especially because the first few times i did it had some the nastiest side effects, and i have friends who tell me terrible stories. so anyways today i went to buy some, and instead of doing the whole bag of 20 dollars worth like i always do, for someone with no tolerance its too much, and doesn't make you feel anymore amazing just sick etc, so i all i did was a line and a half, and i've been noticing i have a mild headache, and nausea that comes and goes normally i don't feel the headache and nausea after its been too long since i ate or am coming down, but this is awkward because my high is far from over, but its hard to focus on the amazing feeling because my head and stomach is hurting at times i feel like throwing up, this is probably not a good batch of meth, but im forcing myself to eat now a bit, is this normal with even recreational use of meth? also i'm going to buy an over the counter pain killer because it helps alot, but i was wondering is it true caffeine enhances the euphoria and feeling of meth, because i've tried this once and besides my heart racing real fast, and it seemed like it brought it up, anyways advice, thanks.

Ya it sounds like you got bunk batch. I would never trust a dude selling 20 bags of Tina. Some days your the bug and some your the windshield. Do you have any left? If you do go and buy 100% acetone. They say dry it with epson salt first but i have fond as long as it is cold it will leave the product clean.  Stick it in the freezer till its cold. Stick the rest of the T in a coffee filter (Or you could just use a glass bowl) slowly pour enough acetone over top of the T (Make sure the filter is set up inside a cup to dispose of the acetone.) The cold solvent will dissolve many cuts in the ice Wait for the sludge to FULLY dry.  I would eat it, wrap it up in a little tissue paper and bombs away. Make sure you drink plenty of water and get 2 hours of sleep each 48 hours. Avoid prolonged use of stimulants together and it could kill you. I try to avoid caffeine while tweaking cause it causes me to have the 'feel my heart' syndrome. When you ingest caffeine causes the 'feel good' neurotransmitters that are already being released 20 times greater then the feeling of coke. So no... Caffeine will not increase euphoria. If you want more of that ohlala feeling choose an opioid, or take 5-HTP (supplement) when you are not partying.

Hmm.. I suspect a bad batch or the cut is making you sick and have a headache. I get 'nauseated' sometimes when I do it (i smoke it) but it's not a stomach ache kind of sick, it's just like a tickle in my throat and i cough until I get something up. When I get headaches I just take some ibuprofen, drink a tall glass of water and eat something. Usually it's because i'm hungry or dehydrated.


If you have trouble eating fruit is your best option. Bananas especially.

Headache and nausea is a common side effect profile for amphetamines, actually.  As misspharmacyashley mentioned, it could be due to dehydration and hunger (your body still needs food and water when you're on amphetamines, it just doesn't do that good of a job of telling you that it needs these things...until its too late.)


Drink some water.  I mean, more than a little cup of water.  A decent amount of water.  Eat some food and take an NSAID such as ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen (Aleve).

Please help! been shooting it, don't particularly enjoy the high all that much but need to clean my parents house, feel like a genius coming up with brilliant ideas, and play/write music, I don't remember many negative effects when i first slammed it, i know its very clean stuff, all big shards, no powder, and then i smoked a bit and i'm not sure but i believe that might have been when mad headache and stomach extreme disease began. Tried advil, helped a little. Tried eating, barely helped, been staying very hydrated, getting fresh air, tried smoking weed, not sure if it helped or not, thinking about taking tums but don't have any, Stomach still feels funky, very nauseous. any suggestions?

**Can I reuse a shot**


I did a shot last night that turned out to be too much in the syringe so I stopped when it felt right. Obviously there is some blood mixed in. Can I do the rest of it. If so how long is it good for? 

So glad for this forum right now cuz I am pretty new at this and the only person I know that does it this way feels guilty and won't talk to me. I have so many questions

I have a question for those who have shot up meth and plain amphetamine, because i want to know if there is much of a difference? I have only experience with i.v amphetamine, my dosage was usually around 30-50mg of fairly pure stuff (cleaned with A/B) every 4-6 hours. Meth i have only snorted a tiny amount of crystals mabye 500mg, but its a loooong time ago, and i dont remember much of a difference with both substances.

I was an IV meth user for about 6 months. I don't remember a whole lot. The majority of it was a blur, between the substance abuse and the physical and mental abuse from my boyfriend, I think my brain has just subconsciously blocked a lot of those memories out. I *DO* remember my first time, though... wow is all I can say. I couldn't even see straight, and I felt like I wet my pants (not pee, either)! After that, everytime we were gettin ready for a shot, I'd have to poop first, because I would get so excited! I never acheived that same high, although I'd come very close. Sometimes I'd get sleepy immediately after a shot. I have no idea why, because it is an upper - not a downer. But I'd nod kind of like what I see heroin users do. I've never done H, so I can't compare the two... but it was extremely strange! And it was pure, too. We made the shit ourselves, so we know it didn't have anything else in it. I never wanted to continue abusing on a daily basis like we did, but I had an abusive stalker boyfriend who would accuse me of sleeping with other men/women and getting high without him. He'd say that's why I didn't want to get high with him. When in reality, I just wanted to quit. Anyway, I never shot myself up - it was always him, and he NEVER missed. Not once! I once asked him what the most he'd given me was, and I guess my tolerance was up to about a .75 gram per shot (and I'm naturally a very small girl. 115 lbs off dope, got down to about 100lbs when I was using). He had these really cool glass syringes.. HUGE fuckers. Could hold a lot more than a regular insulin needle. Sorry for this being so long, I haven't talked to anyone about this in a long, LONG time. I quit cold turkey 2 years ago.

You were doing three-fourths of a gram in one shot???  Either the dope was mediocre or your tolerance was incredible.  Good on ya for pulling off of it.

I tend to use the veins that run just beneath my collarbones, kind of where my bra straps sit. Its highly visable, doesn't bruise easily and as I usually work in a corporate environment it means I can avoid having unsightly track marks on my arms..


How much should one person take at a time? Depending on tolerance and purity I usually go between 50-100mg per dose.


How often should you do a shot? Leaving a week or more between doses is your best bet.. But if you're going to binge than at least 12 hours between is a good guide. Or if your hands are shaking too much to mix or administer the shot than you're best off to wait a couple of hours. And in the meantime drink some water and force down a bite to eat


How do you know when you have been 'smoked down'?

Nonono don't shoot anything that has sat for any length of time, ESPECIALLY if there's blood mixed in.

you shouldn't leave even a freshly prepared shot too long. There are a number of reasons. coagulation, infection, blood clots, coronary problems, i don't need to go on.


your best bet is to remove the needle and plug it up the shooter.

always use fresh needles and freshly prepared shots.

stay safe. DJ

yes. meth is waaay stronger basically.

start with 0.05.

If it's proper stuff, that will be plenty.

you can always work your way up. but never can you reverse what has already been done!

^True 'dat, ma!


But it leaves the original question unanswered:  whytf are we NODDING on ICE?  Hel- lo this seems pretty damn strange to me.  If I were the type to stay up for days this would make sense.  But I have never done over 24 hours because I do not like sleep deprivation. 


 Did it happen to you after you had been up for awhile?

I don't remember, really. Those days were a blur.. I really don't think we were ever up more than a couple days at a time. but it would be immediately after a shot when the rush comes. I'd doze for probably 15 Mins (not 100% sure on how long it was) and then be up for a couple days like normal, whether I got that 'nod' in or not... idk about rocketqueen, though, it's never happened to me when I smoked it. She musta been smoking A LOT or something....

You can either break the needle off and try plugging it, or if you're bound and determined to shoot the rest of it, put it back in the spoon or whatever and re-filter it with a new cotton. I still wouldn't though, might have bacteria in it that's unfilterable.

It would be irrational and hypocritical to have loads of info regarding IV use of Heroin and Cocaine, but not Meth just because some of us are against the use of the drug.

i agree wholeheartedly ... i used to only smoke meth but i had friends who shot it, they used to try to get me to do it but i never would because i knew that there probably would not be any going back

but eventually i got too curious and asked my friend to draw me up a shot but then he wouldnt do it because i guess he didnt want me to end up where he was. but my needle using friends came over one night and accidentally left a used needle on my floor and i found it after they left, so i washed it like 10 times with bleach and sanitized it and all that cause i was going to draw up a shot myself and slam it. but the problem was, i was alone and didnt know how to properly inject meth, i mean i had watched plenty of other people do it but i didnt know enough about it to just go and shoot up on my own.  my only source of info on this was the internet on my phone so i searched google for how to properly inject meth, how to shoot up, how to hit a vein, all that stuff but i couldnt find any type of guideline or good enough advice that really helped me and when i slammed it i ended up missing the vein and it hurt so fucking bad.....i was tweakin out and getting all paranoid that maybe i hadn't totally rinsed all the bleach out of the needle and accidentaly shot up bleach. but now that i think about it that was highly unlikely cause i rinsed the shit out of that thing. i just missed the vein i was aiming for in my wrist and it was like a bluish white bubble underneath my skin, it scared me so much i held my wrist under the water and tried to rub it out but that made it hurt even more so i just held my wrist under the water for hella long and was extra careful with it for the rest of the day.... it barely even got me high too, it made me tweak out hella bad cause i thought it was bleach at first but it was a bad high more than an enjoyable one. and the meth under my skin faded a lot in the next few days, like it was gone within a week but sometimes in certain lighting i could still see traces of where it was weeks later


so my point is that a guide for slamming meth would be a really good thing and is most likely not going push anyone over the edge if they are on the fence about whether to slam it or not - i think it would do good more than bad and maybe prevent other people from having experiences like mine.... i know im a stupid fuck for trying to do it alone but im not the only one in this world. if i knew then what i know now about shooting up that would not have happened. if i had known about drawing back first to see if you get blood. i would have waited for someone else to be there so i wouldnt have to do it myself (even if i did it would have been so much better to have someone with me) because that shits dangerous, there are so many things that could go wrong, im lucky it was just one thing for me. the most important things i know about iv use now are dont do it alone (even if youre experienced you dont want to be alone if you overdose), use a fresh rig everytime, even if its only been used by you, use a fresh one because its safer and theyre only like 29 cents. when you slam it make the needle hole facing up so it goes in smoother, always draw back and see if theres blood to make sure your in a vein, and keep your hand absolutely still and steady esp. after you draw back blood cause there is a possibility of losing the vein once you find it


now with that all said i highly advise to never ever slam meth if you havent already because its not worth the addiction and all the pain caused from it. ive been clean 34 days only cause i was arrested and forced into a rehab program with drug testing and the only thing that keeps me going is looking forward to when i can use again. i hate living like this like im a prisoner to my addiction still even after five weeks of being totally clean. they say curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back, well in terms of slamming dope you will never be satisfied, it always wears off and you always want more so dont even start. its so much better if you just never do it because then when you eventually have to get clean you have one less thing to miss. slamming dope is like the one thing that made me lose hope of being content with a sober lifestyle - i feel like i could have recovered from smoking it or even shooting heroin but for me slamming dope was the best, and the worst, cause the feeling is irresistable, like im not strong enough to fight it

QUOTE["It should be noted that the contents of crystal meth, the street form of the methamphetamine drug, tend to be a combination of toxic chemicals such as lye, Drano, pseudoephedrine, battery acid, insecticides, solvents, and ether."]QUOTE 


The above statement I took from the lead post on this thread.  I think that we are being lied to and/or mislead.  When we do meth, if we were doing all of the crap listed above, how is it than any of us is still alive?  If I slammed lye, drano, and insecticides I would likely be toxic in a month or less.  So, this goes to the question on my thread, about transformation.  ARE we really consuming all of that shit or are we consuming...methamp.???  One person that posted says that the end result of making methamp. (which is methamp.) is NOTHING like what you started with - that by the process of cooking it has undergone chemical transformation.

i would say you induce harm to yourself by smoking from tinfoil. Its much easier to burn meth this way (burnt meth - toxic/stinky)

tinfoil also have little holes that flame of lighter comes though and burns product. 

In pyrex pipe, there is no way flame touches prroduct, but if you use torch lighter, you are more likely to overheat meth and destroy it.(so better to use regular lighter) Also pyex pipe keeps smoke inside from escaping, you are more likely to loose meth vapor on foil,

its my opinion, for some people its easier and more efficient to smoke from foil, for some from pyrex

as for dope water ratio: it don't matter, really. less water and thicker solution may be harder on yer veins though. i used to always use the same amount of water as i did dope, i.e. .25 of dope, 25 units of h2o. important thing is to measure water strictly cause u can tell how good yer shit is by how much you draw up after u break it down...the more the better. a double up is what to shoot for. no pun intended ha ha

I'm a IV drug user of many types, but IVing methamphetamine for the first time was the gnarliest/best experience I've had...


it's the only drug that I find myself craving long after its use...mainly if I find myself thinking about it I want it right then and there. some good shit ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Missing a meth shot will not get you abscess, but missing the vein will for sure give you nasty abscess and if its not taken care right away, there is a big possibility of loosing an arm

i hope you went to doctor to get it cut open

**Meth Iv questions new user**


First off ive never started a thread(is that right) i hope this is in the right place. So here it goes.... The first time I really tried meth was about 6 weeks ago. I decided to Iv it and the rush was great and kept wanting more so I would keep shooting every hour or so not knowing that's crazy but no one told me. I have a pretty extensive drug history but opiates are my first choice. Ironically I have add and take adderall daily but anyway I'm getting off topic I wanted to ask a few questions but I have not been able to find them in other forums.

1. Is it normal for one's heart to kind of hurt when using meth

2. I really like the rush when I IV how often can I safely Iv meth?

3. (maybe off topic but I think it's relevant)  I used to Iv heroin and I've had bad veins from the start. I've gained weight on methadone so it's even worse although I've been using my breasts . Is this safe? Also I used to be a pro I could hit with either hand but Ive been outa practice for about 5 years so is there a trick I can use to use my non. Dominant hand because I see a lot of veins on my right arm? LoOking for some better techniques one handed with left hand

4. What are some signs of od with meth?

5. Can children get meth in there system by touching me or sharing drink with me when I'm high?

6. I've never been told how much to do. I've done meth mow 3 times but each time was a 3 dayer anyway with average meth how much would u use as a beginner? I fear Ive been doing too much and waaaY To often


I apologize for being l over the place I just wanna be able to have a good time every few weeks and I wanna be safe and infortinately I have no one to really ask that I would trust? Please help and anything you can tell me would be greatly appreciated! I know I've forgot several questions I had so anything is helpful thanks

1.)yes

2.)never.  you'll go insane trying to get that rush over and over.  but uh.  if you really have the self control, like.  twice a year?

3.)practice.  don't miss.  you'll know when you miss.  don't try to hit yourself when you're too high.

4.)um. dunno.

5.)i doubt it

6.)i know this is damage prevention, but there's really no way of i.v.ing meth safely in my opinion.  i know a few people when would never do more than .2 never gotten the cough or the automatic ejaculation, or the blindness.  personally i go big when i do it.  like .4 i've done up to .8 but definately not safe at all.  quality is a big factor.  you'll get a feel for it after you've gotten that taste in your throat a few times right after doing a shot.  about the purity.  it's my personal opinion that i.v. meth is much worse than i.v. heroin.  less chance of overdose, but it's addictive in a completely different way.  and if you do it a lot...  heh.  i dunno.


I LOVE I.V. METH but my personal recommendation would be not to do it, unless you're prepared to lose yourself.

Thanks and I understand but I'm not in love with it really I'm not a big stimulant person I prefer downers and I e been doing meth every 2 to 3 weeks. I know I'm an addict and I probably sound in denial but I'm not worried about this becoming a day to day thing. I've lost everything before living in a bus stop and I know it won't happen again it's possible, yes but it would be opiates that would do it. But it would be cool if u could clarify something if I have two grams and I use it all in 3 days am I doing too much and is shooting up ever hour or two very dangerous? And I get that it's dangerous period but I just was curious how long is normal between shots (not big ones more like medium)

I feel like I shouldn't give advice on the matter on this forum, but I will because if you're like me...  Well.

There's no absolute right answer, too many variables.  Here's my advice though.


Quality is a major factor here.

But if you've already started, how much was the first one?


I usually start with a huge shot (because none will be like it after) Like a go blind, ejaculate body fluids everywhere, and cough your lungs out shot.

In my opinion this is the only one I really worry about overdosing on.

After that I wait.  Until I can't stand it anymore.  Like eight or nine hours.  (Don't get stuck, or you'll end up doing it all, find something to occupy your mind)

Hypothetically if I started with .6  after eight or nine hours,  I tend to start doing .1 - .2 every four hours or so.


To me, the shooting up every hour or two thing seems wasteful.  Like the rush is the best feeling ever, but if you keep trying to repeat it to quickly things can go south really quickly.  General insane behavior along with the extreme difficulty of hitting a vein when you're on meth make for a pretty dangerous combo.


Occupy your time with something in between shots other than just sitting there stuck on stupid.  Sex, writing, computers, arts and crafts.  Anything.  Because time will fly in between shots and you'll sort of get a feel for when you need to do another shot.


You'll have to clarify medium shots.


Personally, two grams could last me 12 hours or five or six days.  Doing medium shots every two hours would seem a little excessive to me wasteful if not dangerous.

Depends on how you want to spend your dope.


BUT after all that excessive off topic rambling, I'd say every hour or two is probably dangerous, yes.  Too much.  I'm 21 and I can roll with teh best of 'em and that seems like a waste to me.  I think there's a private option message on here.  If you want to talk about shooting meth message me because I get off topic and embarass myself in public x.x

Or if u know what I'm doing wrong to send messages let me know

Yea I'm not into giving my number out either lol I'm high and wasn't thinking. I'm hoping some other people will give me some opinions and advice although I don't need to hear that I should stop and Blanca I know it's risky and I'm just trying to be safe and learn about this drug I've never done or been around it would be more helpful to help educate me so I don't kill myself over something I could e avoided please anyone, anything u think will help I'm open

i've only smoked crack that way...but i don't see any reason why it wouldn't work, except you're likely to burn the hell out of it.

maybe try a different ROA?  hot rails? booty bumps?

I decided to Iv it and the rush was great and kept wanting more so I would keep shooting every hour or so not knowing that's crazy but no one told me. I have a pretty extensive drug history but opiates are my first choice. Ironically I have add and take adderall daily but anyway I'm getting off topic I wanted to ask a few questions but I have not been able to find them in other forums..............

1.) Its not really normal, because pain indicates that something is wrong. In case if you have "stabbing pain" in your heart. (Usually happens after too big dose of stimulants) you should lower the dosage. especially if you take Adderall daily, 

2.) injecting is in general not safe(although its my favorite method of administration)i say once a day is safest.

3.) I would say it is dangerous to IV in breast vein. (In case you miss the vein and get abscess in your breast) Breast Abscess is serious and complicated thing,  btw you can get similar rush by plugging your meth (taking drug suppository) takes only 10 to 20 seconds longer for rush to kick in than needle,

4.) Oral Lethal Dose [LD-50 of methamphetamine is 700mg/kg of body weight in healthy adult, 

This means that for a 70Kg person it would take 40+grams to kill approximately 50% of takers] but it varies person to person.

Symptoms of Overdose:  

  •Long-termed muscle twitching and contraction (more than few minutes)

  •Pain and inability to pass and secrete urine

  •Dark Brown Urine (Kidneys or Liver failing)

  •Hallucinations & Delirium (as, seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not really there)

  •Rapid breathing and Confusion

  •Changes in heart rhythm (arrhythmia) heart beat jumps from fast to slow and back

  •Diarrhea & Vomiting

5.) No your kids can not get high by touching you even though methamphetamine comes out your sweat 1,5 hr to 24 hrs after meth administration [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2714868/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2714868/) meth in sweat measured in ng/ml, its waaaay too small amount to produce any effects, but its enough for pigs and doctors to detect drug in your system by doing sweat test.

6.) With any substance or compound, Abusing it hard and often eventually will get boring, the meth will loose its magick glowing rush, 

I myself abused meth for 7 long years until i learned how to control it, at some point i was smoking and injecting up to 5 grams over course of 24 hours, on daily basis. and if abuse it hard you are heading for a big crash later, anyways, 100 to 300 mg over 24 hours is ok dose.

@MissApril: Also, everytime after you IV meth you probably have a little cough(feels like something stuck in your throat for a second that makes you cough) while rushing...

This cough is blockage of the main artery of the lung, daily IV meth users are likely to develop pulmonary embolism (P.E) 

(thats why i stopped injecting for awhile.. Now days i IV it once every week or so)

You've said you've only used 3 times - 2 grams over 3 days would be overkill unless you're injecting ridiculously low quality meth (in which case, it really shouldn't be going into your bloodstream). 0.5g of decent meth should be more than sufficient and if you have to redose, would recommend restricting it to a 24-48 hour session.  Space shots out at least 4-6 hours - you don't want to be sky high when trying to inject yourself.

When you rushing after injection it always happens. meth blocks one of arteries in your lungs (temporary) which makes you give one cough. if you wack meth few times a day over long period of time, it can turn into chronic PE, (Short painful breathing, always out of breath even without physical activity)


> from wiki:
> 
> "Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a blockage of the main artery in the lung or one of its branches by a substance that has traveled from elsewhere in the body through the bloodstream (embolism)usually this is due to embolism of a thrombus (blood clot) from the deep veins in the legs, a process termed venous thromboembolism. A small proportion is due to the embolization of air, fat, talc in drugs of intravenous drug abusers or amniotic fluid. The obstruction of the blood flow through the lungs and the resultant pressure on the right ventricle of the heart leads to the symptoms and signs of PE. The risk of PE is increased in various situations, such as cancer or prolonged bed rest.[1]"

Yeah I have some friends like that, it's crazy! Like I have one friend who, same as your friend, makes his own crystal and is healthy as can be. 

Another friend has been doing multiple grams of heroin, over 120mg oxymorphone, OC, dilaudid, for decades and he doesn't even get withdrawals when he stops using cold turkey. Literally he's a freak of nature!

That's weird that you say that..I just had my first IV last year (an actual hospital IV, I was getting my tonsils out) and I was coughing like crazy the second they put it in. I thought I was having some kind of allergic reaction but I ended up fine and the surgery went well,just very weird..I have always wondered why that happened and now I'm curious as to what exactly was in that IV lmao jk

Cuts, pill byproducts from poorly made meth. I think I heard some of the cotton filter gets into the bloodstream. It'd be best to use a micron filter, but cotton filters are still better than nothing, even if it looks clear and dissolves right away.


Also meth can sometimes cause pulmonary hypertension, not as commonly as fenfluramine, methylaminorex or aminorex.


Meth can also cause tics, sometimes the tic is coughing for no reason.

I have always felt that "cough" like reaction from IV methamphetamine, however I also tasted a really bitter taste for a flash of a second, I theorized this was similar to "tasting heroin" when IVing it.  

I didn't use IV methamphetamine frequently enough to cause a pulmonary embolism, nor do I plan on repeating the IV methamphetamine experience any time soon.

the cut that goes with meth is bad for health big time, but even 99.9% Pure pharmaceutical methamphetamine hydrochloride if injected intravenous in doses exceeding 25mg will cause temporary PE.

coguh is just a natural human body defense mechanism to unblock the blocked artery(PE) when artery or its venous branch gets blocked, subconsciously your lungs send signal to brain thats something is wrong..  brain receives that signal and makes you cough so the air will push out whatever blocks the artery. 

that happens in half second if not less

you right, it does cause pulmonary hypertension, but only from vaporizing amphetamines, and you need to smoke couple grams daily for many many years to give yourself PH that way, sooo IV meth causes Temporary PE that could turn into chronic one *with abuse*

Vaping Meth causes PH with *heavy abuse over long period*,

on other hand there are no evidence that oral intake of methamphetamine causes any of those ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

Micron filters are best for sure. The worse filter to use its cigarette filter.. ohhh man nasty nasty filters, it made mostly out of fibreglass and when its wet small particles detach and gets inside syringe. and you can#t see them. I dont think intravenous fibreglass injections are healthy.lol.

Sounds like you had tonsilectomy, i believe thats the name of surgery,

If you are not allergic to opiates, its most likely was fentanyl nitrate and propofol in saline solution. its not meth but you got good mix for sure ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Thats what they usually give in all hospitals over North America and most Europe during minor surgeries, fentanyl as pain-killer, propofol as anesthetic 

Propofol looks like milk, thats the stuff Michael Jackson overdosed on. causes temporary pulmonary embolism, so does fentanyl. Hence your cough and trouble breathing

 For a pulmonary embolism to form, there has to be something blocking the arteries, like a clot or foreign material, like talc. There is no temporary embolism induced by pure meth, though it is a vasoconstrictor. Tics are a common side effect of stimulants, coughing is a common tic. I've gotten the cough, it's more like a tic, rather than some blockage of the lungs, though I could imagine some may have cardiovascular/lung problems from abusing street meth that causes a cough.


Pulmonary hypertension can happen from any ROA, even oral. Meth's not as bad as fen-phen or the aminorex drugs, but it's still possible.

Whatsup guys, haven't been around in a while but a question I have has brought me back. BL is of course the best drug saftey/use discussion board on the net! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


So, I want to try IVing methamphetamine but I'm terrified of an abscess, I've had one before on my back (not from drug use, was a ruptured cyst) and it was very unpleasant, so I cannot imagine having one on my arm.


My question is this- The meth that I regularly purchase (and the ONLY meth I will pay for) is rather high quality, most people I know say its exceptional, one said its the best he has ever tried. It is indeed good but still not as good as pure d-meth. Anyways it comes in medium to large crystals, always completely transparent and smokes away to nothing if done right. Even when you overheat it the most it leaves behind is a small brownish deposit on the glass. 


So do is the risk of infection from a partial miss still significant? 


I know what I am doing, though its been a couple years since I've used a hypo, and even longer since I had a daily IV habit. But like riding a bike you never really forget, just get a little rusty.


The reason I ask is that when I used to shoot smack I would tend to miss a few drops right after registering, usually b/c my hands aren't as steady as they should be, especially if I get nervous about anything. Everyone always says never miss anything when IVing meth or you'll get an infection, but I do know that the meth I get is unfortunately not the norm for the majority of users in the usa.


Last thing I want to add is that I was never prone to abscesses or IV complications in my younger days, hell when I first started IVing smack years ago I (stupidly) didn't even filter my shot, and that was b-more scramble just dissolved, boiled and boosted. I also (again years ago before I knew anything) did a couple of IM shots when I had trouble hitting a vein and had nothing but a bruise for a few days (i'd never think to do that shit now). 


I just worry since I am getting older and stimulant use/abuse isn't the best for your immune system. I should be able to hit no problem now though as I lost a good amount of fat (best shape of my life right now actually!), so I can easily see veins popping out in my arms as I type![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)


Yes, I am high right now, and yes I apologize for the long ass post, you gotta admit though at least I use paragraphs, punctuation, and decent grammer ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


PS - This is the batch I got last weekend! Sorry for the huge size, took me forever to even get it posted since BL's attachment downloader or something isn't working properly

There is no temporary embolism induced by pure meth, though it is a vasoconstrictor. Tics are a common side effect of stimulants, coughing is a common tic. I've gotten the cough, it's more like a tic, rather than some blockage of the lungs, though I could imagine some may have cardiovascular/lung problems from abusing street meth that causes a cough.

meth is foreign material in your blood even if its pure.so is msm, or any chemicals that goes in your blood stream. 

I mean even IV of diazepam or lorazepam in the hospital give you cough in high doses.

you are right,usually its not meth itself causes it, rather meth circulating through your blood stream, it collects and transports cholesterol,usually, artery or even micro-vein gets clogged with minimal amount of cholesterol easily. you will have cough. i would say 80% of IV meth users will get cough due to chunks of cholesterol shit blocking the artery. and thats cause many speed users live off junk food

healthy food consumption is key to good health, much better than greasy junk like funions and doritos crap

Hello - quick question about meth, didn't see it in the info that was up at the top... me and my bf just smoked a little (we had $25 worth total, only smoked half so far) so how long will that be in our systems?


The fiancee's on probation, gotta check in in a couple of weeks and that's just about the worst thing that can turn up... little help please?

 Meth dissolves in blood, so it can't block the arteries. Not sure if MSM is that bad to IV, it is used medically for arthritis(even IV) and is water soluble. I think the cough from IV benzos comes from the solvents like propylene glycol and benzyl alcohol. These can even become toxic if high doses are used for prolong periods.


Brief chemical irritation is a possiblity for the cough from IV meth though. No need to scary people with talks of embolisms.


The meth in the pic looks good, maybe cut with some MSM though.


Meth should be out of your system in 4 days(not the word of god sure), hell maybe even 2, but it should be undetectable in a couple weeks.Drink plenty of orange juice/take vitamin C to flush out the meth metabolites.

dont get me wrong, i never said meth as substance blocks arteries and causes PE, i said meth transports cholesterol that clogs artery and causes temporary PE, from your veins to vital organs, things(like old cholesterol that been stuck to walls of veins somewhere in the leg) in a way meth *cleans your veins*, it drags cholesterol or other foreign materials from veins into blood circulation, crap that been stuck in arteries may be for years...im not sure if meth dissolves that crap, but i heard that meth makes human body to break down fats as first source of energy.. not proteins or carbohydrates, so may be it dose dissolve cholesterol, i know if you cough its a good thing.

MSM is not bad for IV at all, like you said, its used medically, has great water solubility. I heard that smoking MSM is bad though, melting point much lower than meth.

How much should one person do at a time ?

It depends on tolerance and experience , for a first time user a point , 0.1 of a gram would be sifficiant , but towards the end of my addiction I was using up to 3 points per shot , 0.3 of a gram . 


How often should you do a shot ?

For me I would basically use within 45 minutes to an hour if I had more , but this is not advised every 4-8 hours is a good time to wait . 


When is it time to up your dosage ?

Once you do not get a rush or relief of crash symptoms . 


What are the steps in preparing a shot of ice ?

For me I used about 20 units per point , simply because I find the less water the more intense the rush and the better the burn . For 2 points 30 units because it still works really fucking nicely . The steps are as follows . Put the shards in the spoon , add water , crush the shards until there is no shards left , draw into the syringe , I never used a filter for my meth as there was nothing to filter , but Im pretty sure it's still advised .

if they're hard it really sounds like you missed, but you'd know if you did.  so i dunno, but pain afterwards is usually pretty common for me anyways.  the meth itself stings sometimes towards the end of the shot/for a few minutes afterwards/.  there are lots of things that could be causing this.  how long ago did you do your shot?

You guys better be micron filtering your glass! Even the uncut pure methamp I get dissolves on contact with water, but there isn't a solution out there that I'd put in my veins without micron filtration.

i have bought a 30gauge syringe (the smallest needle point available) excuse me if the higher the number the wider the tip*, anyway i had the most trouble with this very thin needle!!!! i think it was so thin and easy to get in a vein, that it got clogged at the needle tip by a piece of skin and tricked me into thinking i didnt register a vein when i really was...i prefer the standard 28 gauge long tips

I would suggest you take some diphenhydramine to keep the histamine levels down, about 75mg and see if that helps at all. They also have topical diphenhydramine cream that you can apply directly to the skin. 


I have never used it for this purpose as what you are describing has never happened to me, but you smoked **500mg methamphetamine**. I wouldn't expect to get away with that without your body rejecting it in someway. You should really look into safer, less fiendish Routes of Administration, vaporized methamphetamine IMO is just as bad if not worse than IV methamphetamine. 


Safer routes include oral dosing, which has a smooth come up and a minor crash, and no insane urges to redose. Also, rectal dosing, 99% bioavailability offers significant advantage over IV and smoking in terms of reduced harm and increased absorbtion, rapid onset, extended duration. 


Ideally, you wouldn't consume methamphetamine at all, let alone **half a gram** in two days. You really need to pump the brakes your body won't put up with this kind of abuse forever.

500mg's is a ridiculous amount. Even with a high tolerance i'm guessing the stuff isn't that pure. A line that looks like 60mg's of good shards will send me to the moon. If I did half a gram of that I would die.

so last night night stops by where im staying this guy stops by and offers me an issue, so after finaly hitting, i push it in kind of slowly since it was pretty dark and i wanted to make sure it was in, a couple mins earlier i got a register but it fell out before i could push. Anyways i got  almost no euphoria, i tasted the shot kind of a few seconds, but i didnt get any rush. i was just wondering if pusing it slowly did that, i know shooting in foot it takes it a little longer to hit you but i was expecting more than just to wake up, i was a little drunk/stoned. any ideas?

Blast, i got excited to see a meth megathread and then realised its iv only. Would it be ok if i ask 1 iv question and then post my volumes of data after? Or do we have a meth megathread, though im guessing it may have been discontinued due to OT, abuse and general chaos. 2 many methheads spoil the cook i guess. Thanks.

I have done 3 months of meth almost every day and now i quit it 2 days ago. I'm anxious and little paranoid. When this will come over? I also have benzo addiction and stopped them in same time, can this be caused by benzos also?

Don't abruptly discontinue benzodiazepines!!! How severely are you addicted to benzodiazepines, that's much more important than the methamphetamine.


You could be putting yourself at risk for seizures, of course rebound anxiety and paranoia is caused by benzodiazepines, it's explicitly explained in the package inserts and by most competent doctors.

I've used 2mg clonazepam about 2 months so addiction may not be severe. Some days i've taken even 4-6mg, but mostly 2mg.

Would love to see informative page on this subject for sure. People who try this or ask advice need others advice for sure!! First line at 17 began smoking it and at 23 injected. Never have I ever exp anything like it. I loved it!! I took it to the ultimate extreme. Have many experiences that possibly could help others. I do not recommend this drug to anyone, ever! Ive been clean off meth for a lil over 2 yrs now. I'm almost 41 now. Its hard for me to see that this drug is not treated as others are on this site simply because of the devistation it has and is causing worldwide. Education by sharing with one another would definitely be beneficial. I myself have questions for those who happen to have stopped using simply because the rush was better than sex for me, does the dopamine return to normal and I'll have normal pleasures again...idk. Anyway this is my first response not sure how I've done, but definitely my subject...lol. I have shot all other opiates, but only get sick. Therefore no comparison for me!! It was an obvious choice for me!!

Whoa, Thanks Alot for good and extensive reply!![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Alright, so I guess I can scratch off IV meth of the list then..atleast unless I get a big tolerance from heavy smoking first or such.. and Im hoping not to ever get that far.

I guess Ill put it to it being too hardcore for me, and I got too much to lose for it to be worth that risc and its not a huge "new world" Im missing out on either if smoking already gets me as high as I can be (or very near)


And btw yeah I think Ive very much noticed this compulsive redosing urge, actually Every damn time I smoke- I plan "not smoke longer than 24hours".. but I ALWAYS end up smoking all I have, lol, or till Im strongly hallucination (after days),discolored limbs (freaks me out) and Im really wasted..

I dunno what, meth must be changing my way of thinking somehow as Im unaware/not in control of kinda like this too as I keep redosing as I (before starting) never thought Id do, and felt pretty "determined not to".. or maybe I just have too high thoughts of myself/mental abilities and am actually really weak this way and wouldnt manage to control myself enough when it really comes to it,lol


And thanks for comment on opiates, mostly just reinforces/backs up what Ive heard from other people I believe was nice/well-meaning with their advice (altho it wasnt what I wanted to hear when I wanted to try it lol (Ive still Never tried Heroin btw., or any opiates!)), when they too discouraged any use, and point at possible individual differences (like you said "being wired differently") that Could indeed make me lose the battle against opiates even if meth seems "easy" (so far)..  Guess I should really take a hint and stop asking this huh=P, Ive asked this before and get similar reply. So, maybe this was the last time I asked that then! ..and I just needa deal with not knowing how fantastic opiates possibly are, for sake of avoiding the (apparently..) far too likely miseries that can come with such addiction.


And thx for reply to those last ones! Ive mixed with MDMA before just wanted to hear it here too (again?-) to make sure, prolly read it somewhere before, but now I feel much safer and wont hesitate to add a lil MDMA some time then![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

And good to know about Viagra, just a "for-fun" thing I thought I might try once with meth ( ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) ), happy to hear it should be fairly safe.


You said theres "so many questions there and most of that post made absolutely no sense"-- think this is because of my poor english, or related to meth? Ive actually heard people saying this before when Ive been chatting on meth, ppl saying Im incoherent/messed up and dont undertand after Ive been up a few days atleast, but myself going over the lines it looks fine!! So I guess its meth doing something after I've been on it a while, something Im not noticing myself then.. unless its just my bad english??


Thx again for your reply btw., greatly apprecciated. Guess I should try end here or Ill keep going lol!


Have a good one, guys! l8rs :D

**Curious**


I've been a multiple drug user for many years but have only been doing meth regularly for a little over a year now. I enjoy smoking it (mostly the ritual) but find that it's wasteful. I usually plug it, which is very satisfying. When I get some particularly clean stuff (ice?) I sometimes IV it. 


Here's my question:

 With most IV drugs, I get a big rush followed by a short to moderate plateau and then a rapid comedown. With meth, the rush is good but not as intense as I'd expect. After the shot, I continue to get higher for 30 to 45 minutes. Sometimes I think "Jeezus! I'm glad I didn't do more!" (I never shoot more than 1/16 gram in one dose, usually less)...then I enjoy a plateau for 3 to 6 hours followed by a gradual comedown. 


Don't get me wrong-- I'm NOT complaining. I appreciate a long-lasting high over a quickie rush any time. I just don't understand the physiology of IV meth, and I'm curious about it.


What's up?

**Dextroamphetamine Bioavailability**


I have searched several times, even for regular Adderall, however I can't find I straight answer. The closest I came to an answer is one guy posted that it was 75% Intranasal and 25% oral.. Can I get some help guys? Obviously IV would be 100%, but would it have to be turned to a freebase?  That is what I heard. IDK.. I am lost with this stuff.. 


Thanks

Is this a meth question? No. You don't post a question about a drug that is not meth in the meth info megathread. Also those percentages are WAY off.

This happens to everyone as they use meth . It is inevitable that the high will gradually deteriorate.

Keep it that way, injecting meth will make it **worse**, not the first time... but the neurotoxic cascade IV meth triggers in the brain will make it impossible to get back to the fun times of meth.


DON'T IV!

I snorted half a gram meth in the past 24 hours. Didn't feel like that much.


Either the meth was cut with MSM (hardly felt the burn I felt from first time doing meth) or Meth is deceptively smooth.

I think it's a combination of both.

Rofl, just camed into post that.  To answer that OP's first question, the guide I used was the same as Afghan Heroin.  Drop however much water in it, use whatever filter(micron pref.), draw up, inject.  Methamphetamine is pretty water-soluble. But from what I gather of that post, Amphet. Sulphate (is this the same as Adderall or perhaps is it Meth but cooked with Pseudo instead of Ephedrine?) if it's like adderall, from my experience, is not worth IVing but if it's just meth cooked with pseudo then i've had that and it's worth it.


@tricomb, I do about .5-.6 in 24-48 hours between two people.

Just starred bangin dope about a week ago. Finally used up my left arm and had to hit to the right arm using my left hand. This after being fucked up for five days. Of course I missed and hit a big ass bubble under my skin.  Now I have done done stupid shit in my life, but not like this. It was my last hit and it was a thirty minute drive to my dealers house, so I decided to Get it back. I took a 23 gauge needle (not what I would normally use to shoot it up with) and spent about two hours digging around my forearm and trying to such that shit out. At one point I looked up at my buddies and they were silently looking at me in terror. I didn't care I just kept pulling out of my arm. Finally I had about a cup of fluid that included blood and a portion of the gram I had just slammed. Without hesitation I grabbed a clown and filled it to the to and slammed it in my left arm right through the old spots, after another 15 shots of clotted blood and dope, I had it back in my system. Immediately I headed to my dealers and got another ball. 


Thus is how fucked up I am after one week of doing meth. I fuckin love it. Good luck everyone who wants to try bangin it, you well never do it any other way

^dude, that's just really messed up!  you tried sucking back out a missed shot?  really?  it's not like some free radical floating around in your body; it absorbs into muscle tissue, etc around the area, depending whether it was a subcutaneous or intra-muscular miss.  apart from blood and probably plasma i don't know what the fuck you sucked out but it sure as fuck wasn't meth.  how is your arm after digging it out like that? ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)


i tawt a saw a tweaker @ bl.  i deed i deed.


you tweakers lol.  so glad i'm not addicted to IVing meth anymore.

dude,Seriously that is Very disgustingly disturbing to read. I'm not trying to preach but get some help...If you just said you sucked out a pus-filled math mass and reshot in the same area, check yourself in a rehab. That's really morbid and very very dangerous. Sticking a needle in your arm and sucking blood out sounds absolutely self destructive to the fullest. I guess I am preaching but fuck that's awful and makes me cringe.

Of course I missed and hit a big ass bubble under my skin.  Now I have done done stupid shit in my life, but not like this. It was my last hit and it was a thirty minute drive to my dealers house, so I decided to Get it back. I took a 23 gauge needle (not what I would normally use to shoot it up with) and spent about two hours digging around my forearm and trying to such that shit out. At one point I looked up at my buddies and they were silently looking at me in terror. I didn't care I just kept pulling out of my arm. Finally I had about a cup of fluid that included blood and a portion of the gram I had just slammed. Without hesitation I grabbed a clown and filled it to the to and slammed it in my left arm right through the old spots, after another 15 shots of clotted blood and dope, I had it back in my system. Immediately I headed to my dealers and got another ball.

Hope you're ok... As tentram said, it is totally useless to even try to 'suck out' a missed shot, you will never recover it anyway. Don't try this again.

The first time i injected meth, it was a feeling that I cannot explain. I felt extreme euphoria. Looking back, it's almost unreal how amazing it was. I have a chance to do it tonight. yet i'm scared, because I know how easy it is to get hooked. Im so excited yet scared. Ahhh, the exciting anxiety of drugs.

Hi guys, I'm in the UK and I've got some decent speed. It's the powder/Paste stuff. Is it worth having a hit? Also what would be the correct prep procedure? I tried making a thread but couldn't for some reason select a prefix on my phone.

When you shoot up make sure after you register that you keep the needle and ur arm steady so it doesn't slip out or slip through the other side. Then even when ur sure ONLY PUSH IN 1-5units, if you feel a burn at all take it out and go in a vain father up your arm. If no burn just push the rest in slowly... good luck. By the way I used to inject meth a lot and I prefer to smoke it out of a bubbler.

I was always one to have some sort of crutch... since sixteen it was mainly oxy and benzos.. meth just wasnt something that ever crossed my mind..never seen it, didnt know anyone who did it, didnt know where to find it.. and that was fine with me.. my best friend was living witj me and one night we was leaving work, and a co worker asked him if he had any of that "stuff"... got me to thinkin, hey I love drugs whats this guy not sharing with me.. we started home and he said lets stop by my uncles house.. ya know, that uncle, everyone has that one uncle and I'm starting to think... we roll up and get out and ive never been there before.. we walk in and I see a tv monitor with my car on it.. this is kinda crazy.. we go back to the room and he says what can I do you fellers for?.. my bud says ______ wants fifty, ill take a quarter.. he looks at me and says you want anything? I say "of?" And that man held up a bag of some shards that had a slight pink tint to it abd says "just in, and its good..


"ice. Crank. Shit. I went to never have even thinking about it, never seeing it, not knowing a thing about it.. to finding out my best friends uncle is the man and its good.. so I say ill take a half.. that night I got high as a mother fuckin hippie.. my friend said a quarter would last him about two three days.. I smoked my whole half that night and was blown away.. I was playing my guitar, racing on the playstation, looking up music, and looking through the blinds all at the same time.. finally, the house is clean.. skip ahead a month or two... I got the itch.. that only a needle can scratch.. 


I had never ivd anything, never seen it done, and had never thought about it.. but one night here it came.. my buddys gf was staying with us, and she was diabetic... I kept asking him to get me a needle and he refused over and over he said I know how yiu are and I'm not going to be the one to give you the key to your death.. and I would ask for a needle.. no.. ask.. no.. and one night I asked whike we were smoking in the tweaker room I asked and he said "god dammit I'm not gonna fuckin give you the worst possible thing you could have, its already terrible us sitting in this room sippin on the same mt dew for three days we are already in too deep I'm not gonna fucking kill you" and he went into the living room and laid down on the couch with his girl to crash.. I went to my bedroom and just sat on the bed...


 I couldn't crash yet, so I went back to our tweaker room... sitting on the middle of thw table was his girlfriends purse... and I knew what was inside.. he didbt want to give it to me but gave me the choice.. I took one 50 unit hypo and sat it back down beside the couch.. I whispered thanks but he was pretending tp be asleep... I took the already used insulin needle to my bath room, and like I said. I had basically no knowlage on how to do what was inevitable. I had a shard of high quality glass that weighed 0.8, two points short of a gram... I got the needle which still had insulin in it and rinsed it out a few times.. I had no clue about dosages so I broke off a little piece about .15 and put it in the spoon.  Barely covered it with water and it dissolved. Dropped ny cotton in, drew it up, tied off and couldn't even see a vein... after about 20 minutes of poking, finally a flash. I pushed it down and released the tie and was expecting everything but nothing happened... I either missed or was already high from smoking...


 I wanted to fuckin do it and feeling kike a champ I said fuck it and I dropped the whole rock that weighed .65, more than half a gram, in the spoon.. I put the water on it, sane process.. different results. It was over 50 thick and had .65 grams of glass in it and I registered immediantly..I pushed the plunger down and I thought I had died.. the burn, oh my god the burn.. the cough, the most intense head change ive ever experienced.. I fell to my knees, couldn't see a thing, my eyes were shaking back and forth in my head and my whole body is moving with it.. I'm on the floor.. I'm having a orgasm, ejaculated in my pants, it sounds like people are whispering all around me.. it looks like the lights are flickering... I lay there for about ten minutes, almost crying can't see, can't breath... fuck, can't even move but I'm in heaven.. finalky I come around and put my hands on top of the counter and pull myself up and then, when I seen myself in the mirror, it was supernatural... I was perfect.. my jaws were locked so hard I couldn't get them apart my eyes had no color, all pupil, they were shaking back and forth and I was trying with everything I had to just take breath after breath... and looking in the mirror at myself in this state of extacy ill never forget... I said oh my god.. oh my god.. this is real. I feel like I just died but I feel better than I ever have.. I just sat there with my knees on the floor and holding myself up by the counter looking at my own face for about thirty minutes... I finally realized itwitwasnt a dream, and I'm still alive.. walking was hard, but I made my way into where my friend was sleeping and I shook him.. I just nodded when he looked at me and he said whats up.. I just nodded again and went to the room... he had never touched a needle, so he hadnt a clue ... I sat down and he walked in and said whats up, you alright? Then I turned to look at him and his face changed.. he said oh shit whats up talk to me you ok??? I couldn't make out a single word I just looked with my face twitching, teeeth chattering, my pupils huge, bloodshot eyes, white as a ghost, shaking violently and just had my arms wrapped around myself... I knew what I was thinking but coukdnt get it across... I knew he just wouldnt , couldn't understand... he said your about to have a siezure or stroke out or something somethings wrongyour going to the er ill carry you to the car its gonna be alright and then the words just came out.. slow and easy, I said no, my brother... I wont.. I wont change a thing... my life just took a sharp turn and I love it.. I love this.. more than anything I want this...it was the best feeling ive ever experienced in my life..


with that being said, it was also the worst thing that ever happened to me.. I wont go into details but within five months from that day, I had lost everything I had worked for.. house bike family my kids my wife.    things that had been given to me from famiky members that meant more thab the world to me, no job I lost my morals and my religion.. that one needle I begged for cost me everything..I'm lucky to be alive.. I attended a 90 day rehab program and stayed the full 90.. thats thw longest clean time ive ever had.. not one week out of there with all ny life ahead of me I got that itch... I think about crystal meth every minute of every day, and probably always will...

^ That story gave me a massive craving for a thick shot!! :-D Nice descriptive writing tschevy44! Unfortunately (well....fortunately really) I'm off it for 6 months....even called the dealer and got him to cut me off until at least July. The stuff can take over pretty quickly, yet subtley....it can be quite an insidious habit

The only way I do Meth is by IVing. But I also only do it when I am positive that I have the extra money. So maybe 5-6 times a month at the absolute most. Now don't get me wrong, I love it when I get to go on days binges. ;-)

Fuck, just scanning this thread just gives me a REALLY BAD FEELING.  I don't want to sound preachy or judgmental -- far from it.  We all have our own personal worlds and reasons why we experiment with or use various drugs.


I have tried lots of drugs: street, prescription, RC's, or otherwise.  I've been experimenting with drugs on-and-off since the late 1980's.  Sometimes I try different drugs to 'escape', sometimes it's only out of curiosity.  I have somewhat of an addictive personality so I try to be aware of that and practice at least a bit of 'harm reduction'.


I'm a big fan of stimulants.  I also have thought the so-called 'War on Drugs' is filled with propaganda and mis-information.  So I thought trying meth first-hand would maybe open my eyes.


That being said, meth is the only drug that has literally scared the shit out of me.


I tried it twice on two consecutive days.  Both times orally.  Sure, I wasn't slamming it or vaping it, but whatever -- I was trying to be cautious.


The first time, I couldn't believe how incredible I felt.  It lasted for hours.  It was unlike anything I'd ever tried.  IT WAS INCREDIBLE.  God, what a feeling!


The second time, I fucking loved it all over again.  The tingly all-over body-gasm, the elation, the endless energy.  I loved everything about it!!!  I remember looking in my bathroom mirror and smiling at myself ... I remember staring into my own eyes and thinking "I FUCKING LOVE THIS!"


On the third day, I woke up in the morning.  I was lying in bed, I felt like a truck had run me over.  I lay there for an hour, head full of cement, staring at the wall.  My body felt used and fried.  My brain was clouded up.  My guts felt raw.  But despite all that, one single thought kept repeating through my head: Just go take another dose.  No big deal.  What are you waiting for?  You'll feel better and you'll have a fucking awesome day!!!


I dragged my ass out of bed.  Went to my stash and found the baggie of beautiful crystals.  I stared at them.  It was like being fucking Frodo from Lord of the Rings.  One Stim to Rule them All in and the Darkness Bind Them...


I stood there, staring at those innocent, beautiful little crystal shards in my hand.  I must have stood there for fifteen minutes, motionless.  Maybe longer.  They glinted in the light, like little diamonds...


It took a surge of willpower, but I slowly turned the baggie over and poured the whole damn thing into the toilet.  All of it.  Every last crystal.


I watched them slowly dissolve in the water.  To be honest, I was filled with a mixture of relief and regret.  Mostly regret, actually.


I have never been so transfixed by a drug before.  On top of it, I have never used a drug that just plain felt EVIL.


That was about 5 days ago.  The "more-ish" feelings have completely subsided and now I'm glad I tossed that baggie.  **I'm never doing meth again.

**

If there's any drug that I felt could seriously take my soul and destroy my life, it was meth.


Again, I'm not trying to be preachy.  Just sharing my personal experience.


I wrote a post last week on Bluelight about how I was going to try some meth.  One of the mods re-directed my post and sent me a PM.  They told me to be careful.  They couldn't have been more right.

Yeah Knoshuss, good to hear you will be staying away. The first few times I used meth it turned me into an anxious wreck and yet I continued to use and ended up an addict for a year later in life, if it can do that to some one doesn't enjoy the effects than the psychological addiction that could develop in some one that does enjoy the effects' mind is a very dangerous one.

Thank ya kindly ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

1) please don't do it.  Not for my sake but for yours.  I couldn't care if you're using or not, but eventually you will care and it'll be something you'll want to stop, and you might feel unable to stop even if you want to.  


2) if you are going to disregard the quality advice I gave you in step #1, then what you want to do is get a cooker, put your methamphetamine crystals in the cooker.  Add about 30-40 units of water.  Swirl it around, pull and push the water over the crystals until they all dissolve.  Should be very quick.  


3) filter, if you are going to, preferably with a micron filter.  


4) And then the rest of it is merely performing the injection, which there are plenty of posts about doing just that.

^ What the Captain said.  I second his advice completely.


Honest to God, if taking a modest dose of meth orally sent me spinning into rapture, I can't imagine how incredibly fucking awesome and life-destroying it would be to inject it.  I would probably never want to stop.


My cousin is addicted to meth -- he has been for about 12 years.  He smokes it and slams it.  His life story has become the oft-repeated cautionary tale of my extended family.  Maybe that's part of the reason why I was curious about it ... perhaps there was a lesson to be learned in there if I tried it out for myself.


I honestly can say I truly understand where he's coming from now ... why this stuff grabbed a hold of him and has never released its grip.  Needless to say, his life is filled with numerous chapters from the Big Book of Bad Life Choices.


He went from being a clean-cut college student to a scabby spaced-out thieving tweaker asshole who stole and then pawned his mother's wedding jewelry, beat up his own father, trashed numerous cars while high, and basically did whatever it would take to buy more meth.  He's been in trouble with the law more times than I can bother to repeat.  I'm amazed he's actually lived this long -- to age 32, after 12 years of heavy meth use.


Unless he's couch-surfing, he sleeps in transit shelters and cardboard boxes in parks.  I shit you not.


At least the next time I see him, I will be able to look at him in the eye and tell him on some level: "I understand."

Yo man, if you get a bad burn if you miss, its too acidic, a VERY common problem with cooks who take no pride in their work, just want the bucks![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)  The cough, and taste in throat etc.  is the SHIT in it!!! Good CLEAN gear, has NO smell, taste, cough, or burn, just a lovely warm rush, then a great 12 to 16 hours, and NO hangover of any sort. No aching kidneys etc!!   Make your own, its easy, and SO CLEAN![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  BTW, you dont need hard to get precursors. There is a way most know of that makes 90% dope, in a few hours, IF you get it down well. If you dont, ive seen people stuff up time after time, so it gets a bad rep!  For such a simple technique, it sure is hard to teach some people:/ Pm if your interested, you probably have it down anyway, but then you would not get bad stings from misses, so, who knows:/

If your talking ICE[4 methylaminorex], not meth, then for a very casual user like me, .35 of a point[35mg], is plenty, 50 at the most, a point of GOOD ICE would be very unpleasant, maybe even hospital!!

a catheter in this case is just a needle tip attached to a length of medical tube.  


is that how you'll be performing the injection?  as if to perform a drip over a length of time?  or instantly?  


from my perspective it would be wiser simply using a simple insulin syringe for safety factor unless you've got a professional setting it up.  it seems so unreasonable to set up a catheter if you're wanting to inject meth.

First time i've tried meth...  clear shards, melt, fume as expected. But not really speedy. IV'd 30mg in two doses (nervous, cautious) Vaped 100mg now. Not totally buggered / tweaked like i was expecting. 


Does anyone know about cross tolerance with MPA? [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methiopropamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methiopropamine) 


Started 6 months ago, 2g MPA lasted me a week. Lately I was up to 1g per day and iv'ing 130mg doses. I quit the stuff, no longer worked, can't be good for you either.


You think cross tolerance could be it or is there dodgy, mildly speedy shards about? Can you have bad clear glasslike shards? L isomer instead of the D? Racemic maybe?

Crystal methamphetamine can be cut with inactive ingredients, although it's generally one of the more pure drugs available in the drug scene these days.


And yes, if you look at the DEA micrograms, you'll see different ratios of isomers for huge quantities of seized methamphetamine; one seizure was almost 100% d-isomer, others were almost all l-isomer.  It's hard to gauge how quality your product is unless you're a seasoned user.

So, there's been a couple of posts up about missing a bit of a shot, and getting a big. hard lump.

I currently, am the proud owner of a big, hard lump. I missed the last 3 or so units from a BD 100. 

Im not mega concerned about it right now. It's not getting bigger, it's not warm or red. No bad smell, and it's HARD.  No squishy places to indicate pus formation.  No fever or aches or pains.  The lump is a bit tender to the touch, but that all. 

So, knowing that there is not currently a raging infection in there, the questions.


WHAT IS IT? My roommate and I discussed the notion of it being the bolus from the shot, plus some inflammation. Since meth is lipophobic, it would make sense that it wouldn't readily absorb into all of the surrounding tissue.  This may be a total twacked out fallacy. Input?

How long should I expect it to last?

Anything I can do to improve it or hasten the healing time?

I have been told that necrosis can be an issue.  What are the early signs, and what home care can be done to prevent it?

Well, after some experimentation I can report the depressing fact that consumption of the cheap, legal and mild stimulant methiopropamine gives rise to a huge cross tolerance with crystal meth. The meth turned out to be absolute rocket fuel when tested by someone else who had never used MPA. Whereas I was left with a pleasant, warm glow & little else the other test subject started out by suddenly leaping up and doing the dishes &, some 12 hours later, having totally cleaned, tidied, disinfected, polished his entire flat launched into that fateful, endless sentence any true speed freak loves / fears in equal measure... "It all started when I was four yeas old and......"


Hopefully it will be reversible and to this end i've stopped using MPA and will let you know how it goes.

I snort it on a regular basis --I've heard those "voices" konshuss was talking about the whole "just do another one you'll feel better"

Of course though after a first good hit off of a bong or a couple snorted lines the high isn't the same which I have discovered.


I've been using all together for 8 months but only consistently for 5mo. I don't think I'd ever have the balls to inject anything mainly because it doesn't "feel right" within my rational thinking.  For example; I hear those voices but most of the time especially at night when I know I have to get up the next day I find myself ignoring them.  As if there were different levels of thought within my brain--top most important would be my philosophical level and everything else haha


Anyone else feel that way in here?

Well SWIM is currently trying to come down off some fucking proper ice. But in regards to IV meth, ESP with ice, use little water, just enough for it to dissolve in the liquid (using your plunger to stir if need be), process should take around 15-20 seconds depending on quality. For example, newer users should use maybe 0.1g of ice for a shot, and maybe around 25-30 units of water. Do not cook your shot, it'll fuck your meth. Just cold shoot it after the methamphetamine dissolves. Use a cotton to filter, hit vein of choice, register, slam it on in there and enjoy the fucking show. Remember the less water and more concentrated the shot, the better the result you will get. I love it. SWIM also smokes, snorts occasionally and eat its. Entirely depends on what kind of experience you're am looking for. Generally the "oh fuck, I did too much" doesn't convey in the world of IV drug use. You can always hit again, rule of thumb, try a point, see how it hits yah, and go from there. 


Enjoy

No; this is too high of a dosage for a first timer.  I used to IV methamphetamine for 9 months (quit a long time ago), and even if I was to start up again, I would only use 25mg to test purity/quality; 100mg (which is the same as 0.1g) is a HUGE dosage, and this would render me vomiting/dry heaving for a long time. 


I don't want people to think 0.1g is a good first time IV dosage, because some people who are especially not in good health could have heart attacks or a stroke from IVing a point at the worst, but even at best, vomiting while on a stimulant is unpleasant.

Thank you for the clarification!


And yes, Capt Heroin is absolutely right I'm a case where my tolerance is pretty absurd, and I'm on day 3 so I'm little laggy so to speak at the moment. Apologize for the first dosage recommendation, I'd have to agree on the first time dosage being in neighborhood of around 25mgs. 


If the ice is really good I usually don't go beyond 250mgs in a single dose, but PLEASE DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS UNLESS YOU KNOW YOUR TOLERANCE WELL.

You can always do another shot with a new rig, but you can't do less once it's in your system.  And I can verify it's highly unpleasant to go through vomiting from doing too much in a shot.

One of the worst feelings is doing too much meth in a shot and thinking your going to seize or have a heart attack or stroke and maybe even die, is it really worth it? Seems people enjoy doing too much coke in a shot, ive never done IV coke and probably never will due to anxiety and damage surely already done by the meth. I have chronic anxiety too so it makes it sooo much worse. A few weeks ago I had a few shots of meth, a few MDMA pills and at the end of the night a few lines of coke and after I snorted the coke my friends were laughing at me because I had to take my shirt off as my heart pounding against it was driving me crazy and making me anxious. Ive been using a lot lately because im quitting heroin and opiates, coming down on my suboxone and really want to do well so ive been shooting meth to get that dopamine rush(smart logic hey :/ ) id usually get from heroin but I dont like it anywhere near as much as H and meth makes me so anxious and panicky. Benzos are a must for me for comedowns and sometimes even while im high. But now im addicted to xanax, fuck my problems just keep coming. Sticking to only xanax(which im reducing on before I have a fit from wd's) atm and I have some methadone for tomorrow so that will be my fun for awhile. Dont think ill ever do meth again, not that id like to I love it but its just too much for me these days and im only 22 :/

You should use the [drugs.com interactions checker](https://www.drugs.com/drug_interactions.html) in the future, for a quicker response. 


Still OK to post to ask about people's opinions/feedback on combos like this, but it's always good to do your own research off Bluelight as well.

Depending upon how long one has used or even the amount consumed during one's lifetime will damage these receptors which tell the brain to be "happy".  Some people are naturally born with a chemical imbalance or experience Depression.  Drug use will also, especially meth, have a huge affect on this.

Trying to figure out just why exactly doesn't resolve anything, it'll actually make it worse because then you're always thinking about the problem itself which can adhere one to "live in the moment".  The present is what counts.  Go talk to someone about your feelings and see what you can do to help your mind and thought process.

I've done it on and off for 10 years and I was using every single day 4-8 times a day shooting up 3-5 times a day because it would never be enough. And I was getting my dope from bikers it was p2p and it was almost always pure when the bikers didn't want to sell it to me. I know them and they wanted me to stay out of trouble so I had to find other drug dealers. Long story short.. I feel like nothing can help me but going back to Meth.. and that's an effed up way to think.. but that's honestly how I feel and I don't know what to do about it. I'm proud that I've been clean for 2 years.. but what's the point in life? Praising God? Yay! Having an awesome relationship with my fiance? Great! But me being unhappy and everyone feeding off my unhappiness and it being rubbed off on them and in turn they are miserable.. I would rather just leave everyone and go back to Meth and live on the streets to die in less than a year. So yeah I think I definitely need to figure out a way to get health insurance and go find me a therapist before I kill myself.

**Meth/amphetamine safe use guide - You Need to Read before you Speed**


A very important guide for all amp users


Alright, I dont know know if this is somewhere on this forum, i searched it and found nothing. This is taken from a drug based forum that is somewhat difficult to access. The OP tookall of this information from published studies and amassed this amazing post. So here it is:


1. First off, Methamphetamine is only psychologically addictive. Just like Cannabis, food, or the internet. Methamphetamine's addiction potential is equal to prescription dextroamphetamine (at similarly potent doses). If you are wondering why d-amph addicts are so much rarer, it's because d-amph is typically given out in prescription tablets only. People can still break it down and snort it, but the difference is that these prescriptions regulate their dosage every month and drastically lowers the chances of addiction. Just another reason why the drug war is such a failure really. European speed is so diluted and cut that I'd be surprised if you even got 10% dextro in your powder. No American dealer wants to sell dextroamph because it takes an extra step in synthesis and is less potent. If Europe had the availability to meth precursors like America did, absolutely NO dealer would be selling l- or d-amphetamine. Pharmaceutical companies have the incentive to use d- and l-amphetamine because meth carries such a stigma that patients won't want to take it. Big pharma has near free access to precursors and laboratories so making the slightly less potent d-amph costs almost nothing to them.  It is saddening that people who are "pro-drugs except for meth" are tricked by the same misinformation that they hate so much when it's against cannabis.  Hopefully by this point, you and I are on the same page and have moved past this "evil meth" label. Thus, I will refer to meth as amphetamine from now on.  


Significant withdrawal effects only occur when amph is continuously redosed in high dosages. Why? Because constant redosing causes neurotoxicity. The long half life of all amphetamine means that redosing will additively increase blood plasma levels and your brain will soak in that. Acute tolerance shuts out euphoria around the time you reach your first half life. Redosing = excitotoxicity and accumulation of oxidative reactive species in the absense of most of the euphoria. Daily usage is only safe at therapeutic dosages (UNDER ~0.5mg/kg). It seems like it is generally agreed upon that meth is  more potent weight by weight than dextro (about 1.3x). When the dosages are matched, they have the exact same safety profile. 


Chronic use at anything above therapeutic level causes persisting DA striatal depletion. As in, it comes back VERY slowly (think years) and it isn't 100%. You can withdraw from Heroin and get away without lasting physical damage. The same cannot be said for amphetamines. The striatal depletions go unnoticed by binge users until they stop dosing whereupon shit gets real. Quickly. These are the only people that get severe withdrawal effects and feel extremely addicted. Just like every other drug, binging is bad. Before you call therapeutic dosages too pussylike, read the rest of my post.


2. Pre-treatment. Holy fuck I was glad to find out about this before I started using. Pre-treatment takes only one week and it permanently boosts all your subsequent amphetamine effects. It is called sensitization or reverse-tolerance. When taken at sub neurotoxic dosages, the brain becomes supersensitized to all subsequent amphetamine dosages. This effect has been tested to last longer than 120 days and is probably permanent. Animals were intially given a single small amphetamine dosage. In 120 days, they received their second dosage and the effects were dramatically boosted. Tests in human subjects show that the subjective high is nearly doubled from baseline. More research has shown that the optimal pre-treatment schedule is 0.15mg/kg daily for 7 days. The longer the withdrawal period after that, the stronger the effects (up to 30 days when it levels out). Also, did I mention that pre-treatment significantly reduces neurotoxicity in subsequent binges and high dosages? If your first few amphetamine uses were high dosage, you shocked your brain. You most likely had neurotoxic hyperthermia which diminishes sensitization.


Source of pretreatment on sensitization and reverse tolerance: [http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/26144/1/0000221.pdf](http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/26144/1/0000221.pdf)

Source of pretreatment on neurotoxicity: [http://www.nature.com/?file=/npp/journal/v28/n10/abs/1300247a.html](http://www.nature.com/?file=/npp/journal/v28/n10/abs/1300247a.html)

Bonus source for one dosage causing lasting sensitization: [http://www.neuro.cjb.net/content/19/21/9579.short](http://www.neuro.cjb.net/content/19/21/9579.short)

(please keep in mind these dosages in the article are for rats and NOT for humans)


3. Any tolerance to amphetamines that last longer than 5 days is caused by neurotoxicity. The main reason for amphetamine's tolerance is its half life and how quickly the body adjusts to the presence of amphetamine in the blood. After only 3 days (approximately 5 half lives, i.e. ~97% of the drug is gone), this tolerance should be almost completely gone. Any persisting tolerance after 5 days was caused by striatal DA depletions as well as downregulation of D2 receptors. Again, if your tolerance lasts more than 5 days, reconsider your amount and frequency of dosage. Repeated high dosages without adequate time in between will fuck up your shit. The rewarding effects of sensitization is also severely diminished by this binge use.


Source: [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584602002579](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584602002579)

(I've seen several other sources but this is one I found with a quick search)


4. If you enjoy higher dosages, you must spread them out. This goes back to my last point. Moderately high dosages can actually be safe given that you washout the drugs (about 5 half lives) before redosing.


5. If you are female, the effects of amphetamine neurotoxicity are two folds stronger and psychosis along with addiction potential occur at half the dosage for males. The presence of certain male androgens are neuroprotective against amphetamine. Sorry, women.


6. Smoking and IV have the same safety profile as other ROA's when dosages are matched for bioavailibility and may actually be safer because of their shorter half lives. Rats can take single 25mg/kg injections with no neurotoxicity because their amphetamine half life is only one hour compared to the human time of 9-12 hours. Amphetamines are one of the rare drugs where these ROAs are safer because amphetamine neurotoxicity is primarily exacerbated by the time it stays in the body. Unfortunately, binge use with smoking or IV causes half life to be irrelevant and the safety profile becomes much more dangerous.


7. If you binge, STAY out places that are hotter than room temperature! Heat literally multiplies the tolerance and deficits you are causing to your brain. And, you must have already caused a lot of deficits if you are dumb enough to be a binge user.


To sum it up, DON'T FUCKING BINGE!


8. If you have suffered psychosis from amphetamine, I would consider stopping usage. Forever. And yes, even if it only happened once. The implications from psychosis are more than just some temporary effect because you didn't sleep. Amphetamine psychosis is actually caused by the repeated dosage - sleep deprivation only made your brain more vulnerable. The variables that play into psychosis are so wide that studies have yet to really be conclusive on them. Currently, it is believed that prolonged amphetamine blood plasma induces dopamine hyperreactivity. Guess how schizophrenics are diagnosed? Dopamine hyperactivity. Again, this probably causes lasting deficits.


Want to avoid psychosis? Don't. Binge. It is nearly impossible to induce psychosis if there are more than 5 hours of sleep between dosages unless you were already genetically predisposed.


Here's the schedule a beginner should follow for daily productive use and to prevent neurotoxicity (Assuming 99% bioavailability. Adjust dosages for your ROA bioavailability):


Days 1-7: 0.15mg/kg

Days 8-?: <0.5mg/kg for males, <0.25mg/kg for females 

No more than once a day


For recreational use:


Days 1-7:0.15mg/kg

Days 8-?: <1.0mg/kg for males, <0.5mg/kg for females

No more than once every 3-4 days 


After pretreatment and sensitization, 1.0mg/kg WILL bring a satisfying rush. On a 160 pound person, that would be about 72mg. If it sounds too little to you, than you have gone too far.


It's that simple. Moderation is key, what a surprise huh? If everybody took amphetamines responsibly with milligram scales, we would probably be exploring the universe by now.


P.S. As a bonus, take Vitamin C and E for antioxidants. Take Magnesium to slow down acute tolerance (NMDA antagonist = be higher for longer! YAY). Zinc supplementation was also found to be synergistic with amphetamine in ADHD patients. I don't know its effects on normal people, but I take it anyway. For further reading, look up "Robinson TE". He is by far my favorite researcher. Another goodie is Carl Hart. He is a forerunner on meth research and always talks about the exaggerated claims on meth. He himself said that scientists have known for a long time that methamphetamine is exactly like dextroamphetamine at a drug policy conference.

Nice post. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


The theory of pre-treatment for sensitisation is new to me, and I'm wondering how it applies to people who have used amphetamines in the past. For example, if I used meth at low recreational doses (orally mostly, smoked on occasion) twice a month for about a year, and that was 10 years ago. Until about a year ago I used mixed amphetamine salts at therapeutic doses, maybe 6 times a year, at most. Then last spring some 2-fma which I used every other day, roughly, for 3 months. I gained quite a tolerance and had to increase my dose to 4x my original starting dose. For that and other reasons I decided to take a break.


I haven't touched it since but I'm considering using it again, maybe twice a week, to boost my energy levels and productivity. I am female and my weight varies from 45-50kg, so I'm guessing effective doses for me will be borderline safe. I know with adderall I seem to have a permanent tolerance such that I need at least 30mg to get any useful effects. Meth is definitely my amphetamine of choice but I'm in Europe and all I've come across is super-cut d-amphetamine, which I dont like. Do you think pre-treatment would be worthwhile considering I haven't used any stimulants since last summer?


I'd love to read your reference regarding androgens being protective, if you have it available or can suggest search terms for pubmed. Maybe I can pretend my brain is male since I've never suffered from psychosis or addiction. ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Do you have a source for the bit on women? I've read of differential effects of neuroinflammation and sexes but not direct neurotoxicity. Also, check out some of my threads if you wanna get down dirty and technical (oh god PKCdelta why are you so evil?!?!)

Thanks for posting, this really helps for a dextro-methly user. I did experience some kind of physical and mental issue after taking adderall orally at 15mg, considering this was something I didn't know about at the time I ended up hospitalized for a week without taking it. Thankfully I was prescribed something different and my sister advised me to take only .5mg everyday which has been going great for me cause I need it once. No physical defects, no binges, and no tolerance ever since.

I have always wondered why I had always enjoyed and been able to manage my methamphetamine enjoyment, even when I had a fantastic supply of it. I administered all kinds of ways to.


But this makes sense.


My first experience with methamphetamine was with a woman I had just met who turned me on to smoke it with her. It was fucking amazing, but after that, I didn't know where to get it, and had since resigned it to a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Six months later I ran into a long-term supply and found myself using just as often as my cohorts, but maintained my conscience throughout, while I watched everyone change around me. Maybe it was the neurotoxicity.

Care to elaborate? This isn't really the kind of thing that you can have an opinion on, but everyones different. Please, do tell exactly what causes you to disagree. Also, to everyone asking about the links; I'm sorry, but again, im not the writer of this post. I took this from a forum that isn't normally accessible from the surface internet. It goes through a service that hides the ip of the website, so it wont come up in search results on a typical browser. Because of this, I decided it deserved to be posted here, where you don't have to be a computer wiz to view it. But sence its out there, i might as well give the link to the original post. There is information to be taken away from the discusion. http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=22378.0

That was extremely helpful about what I needed to know. I hope I never do this drug especially because my I know I could come across it when having ADD.

> 
> 1. First off, Methamphetamine is only psychologically addictive. Just like Cannabis, food, or the internet. Methamphetamine's addiction potential is equal to prescription dextroamphetamine (at similarly potent doses). If you are wondering why d-amph addicts are so much rarer, it's because d-amph is typically given out in prescription tablets only. People can still break it down and snort it, but the difference is that these prescriptions regulate their dosage every month and drastically lowers the chances of addiction. Just another reason why the drug war is such a failure really. European speed is so diluted and cut that I'd be surprised if you even got 10% dextro in your powder. No American dealer wants to sell dextroamph because it takes an extra step in synthesis and is less potent. If Europe had the availability to meth precursors like America did, absolutely NO dealer would be selling l- or d-amphetamine. Pharmaceutical companies have the incentive to use d- and l-amphetamine because meth carries such a stigma that patients won't want to take it. Big pharma has near free access to precursors and laboratories so making the slightly less potent d-amph costs almost nothing to them.  It is saddening that people who are "pro-drugs except for meth" are tricked by the same misinformation that they hate so much when it's against cannabis.  Hopefully by this point, you and I are on the same page and have moved past this "evil meth" label. Thus, I will refer to meth as amphetamine from now on.  
> 
> 
> 
> Significant withdrawal effects only occur when amph is continuously redosed in high dosages. Why? Because constant redosing causes neurotoxicity. The long half life of all amphetamine means that redosing will additively increase blood plasma levels and your brain will soak in that. Acute tolerance shuts out euphoria around the time you reach your first half life. Redosing = excitotoxicity and accumulation of oxidative reactive species in the absense of most of the euphoria. Daily usage is only safe at therapeutic dosages (UNDER ~0.5mg/kg). It seems like it is generally agreed upon that meth is  more potent weight by weight than dextro (about 1.3x). When the dosages are matched, they have the exact same safety profile. 
> 
> 
> 
> Chronic use at anything above therapeutic level causes persisting DA striatal depletion. As in, it comes back VERY slowly (think years) and it isn't 100%. You can withdraw from Heroin and get away without lasting physical damage. The same cannot be said for amphetamines. The striatal depletions go unnoticed by binge users until they stop dosing whereupon shit gets real. Quickly. These are the only people that get severe withdrawal effects and feel extremely addicted. Just like every other drug, binging is bad. Before you call therapeutic dosages too pussylike, read the rest of my post.
> 
> 
> 
> 2. Pre-treatment. Holy fuck I was glad to find out about this before I started using. Pre-treatment takes only one week and it permanently boosts all your subsequent amphetamine effects. It is called sensitization or reverse-tolerance. When taken at sub neurotoxic dosages, the brain becomes supersensitized to all subsequent amphetamine dosages. This effect has been tested to last longer than 120 days and is probably permanent. Animals were intially given a single small amphetamine dosage. In 120 days, they received their second dosage and the effects were dramatically boosted. Tests in human subjects show that the subjective high is nearly doubled from baseline. More research has shown that the optimal pre-treatment schedule is 0.15mg/kg daily for 7 days. The longer the withdrawal period after that, the stronger the effects (up to 30 days when it levels out). Also, did I mention that pre-treatment significantly reduces neurotoxicity in subsequent binges and high dosages? If your first few amphetamine uses were high dosage, you shocked your brain. You most likely had neurotoxic hyperthermia which diminishes sensitization.

> 3. Any tolerance to amphetamines that last longer than 5 days is caused by neurotoxicity. The main reason for amphetamine's tolerance is its half life and how quickly the body adjusts to the presence of amphetamine in the blood. After only 3 days (approximately 5 half lives, i.e. ~97% of the drug is gone), this tolerance should be almost completely gone. Any persisting tolerance after 5 days was caused by striatal DA depletions as well as downregulation of D2 receptors. Again, if your tolerance lasts more than 5 days, reconsider your amount and frequency of dosage. Repeated high dosages without adequate time in between will fuck up your shit. The rewarding effects of sensitization is also severely diminished by this binge use.

> 6. Smoking and IV have the same safety profile as other ROA's when dosages are matched for bioavailibility and may actually be safer because of their shorter half lives. Rats can take single 25mg/kg injections with no neurotoxicity because their amphetamine half life is only one hour compared to the human time of 9-12 hours. Amphetamines are one of the rare drugs where these ROAs are safer because amphetamine neurotoxicity is primarily exacerbated by the time it stays in the body. Unfortunately, binge use with smoking or IV causes half life to be irrelevant and the safety profile becomes much more dangerous.

> 8. If you have suffered psychosis from amphetamine, I would consider stopping usage. Forever. And yes, even if it only happened once. The implications from psychosis are more than just some temporary effect because you didn't sleep. Amphetamine psychosis is actually caused by the repeated dosage - sleep deprivation only made your brain more vulnerable. The variables that play into psychosis are so wide that studies have yet to really be conclusive on them. Currently, it is believed that prolonged amphetamine blood plasma induces dopamine hyperreactivity. Guess how schizophrenics are diagnosed? Dopamine hyperactivity. Again, this probably causes lasting deficits.

Zinc supplementation was also found to be synergistic with amphetamine in ADHD patients. I don't know its effects on normal people, but I take it anyway. For further reading, look up "Robinson TE". He is by far my favorite researcher. Another goodie is Carl Hart. He is a forerunner on meth research and always talks about the exaggerated claims on meth. He himself said that scientists have known for a long time that methamphetamine is exactly like dextroamphetamine at a drug policy conference.

**Help.. I dont understand!!**


I think i found the right place to ask this, if not please move it :-/ 

And i apologize but im kinda in a hurry for an answer.   


I have been hitting a particular spot, probably more often than i should but ive got few places to inject left as i was a heroin addict for years... Im aware of the dos and donts of iv drug use and i typically have no issues up and down this vein... But its been hard to register anywhere on me today (probably due to me not drinking enough water and layin down too much). And so ive gone back to old trusty..  Earlier, i did my routine, felt NO pain but too my suprise i drew back what i would call bright red in comparison to the deep red i get there most of the time.  Like i said, no pain and it just scared me so i decided id better research and wait... I did realize that the brachial arterty Does come together in the general area -below left inner elbow...  As ive said i have hit there a few hundred billion trillion times over the years and never recall noticing the color difference. 

This spot requires that i push the point in straight down at a slight angle and once i bottom out the needle i still have to push slightly to get that telltale "pop" into the vein. Sounds bad but its always dark blood and it doesnt hurt nor does it bleed much, if at all...  This time, it Did bleed more than normal but it was still hardly much and easy to stop... 

I waited until i was no longer freaked out, a couple hrs later and tried again and it went as smooth as could be... 

Nonetheless, ive tried again and it happened again.  Still no pain or excessively large amounts of bleeding.. 


Have i hit an artery? I dont have an unusual bruising, swelling and no knots and like i said, it doesnt hurt to insert either.  But something is different i assume or the blood would look the same, i think... 

If its unlikely to be an artery, are there reasons my blood would sometimes look brighter red? 

Id post a picture to show exact location but i cant due to... It seems triggery, so i dont know if its against the rules but if its not, and you have some info and need to see exactly where im hitting, inbox me and ill send you a picture. 

Thanks,

B![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)

It was fucking amazing, but after that, I didn't know where to get it, and had since resigned it to a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Maybe it was the neurotoxicity.

dextro-Methamphetamine is a lot more addictive than regular dextro-amphetamine.  This can be accounted for by the relatively stronger euphoria methamphetamine delivers, and is probably related to the 5-HT release that regular amphetamines don't deliver on equally.  


I think that most people with equal experience with meth and regular amphetamines can explain how much more addictive methamphetamine is.  


I'd be interested to see if it was just me, but I'd be shocked if that was the case.

I have myself, had many experiences with both drugs.  For me I find them to be quite similar with the physical effects of each amphetamine.  Amphetamines, Methamphetamines, etc., are all made up with very similar compounds and the structure of the drugs themselves are almost exactly the same.  Yes, Methamphetamines are stronger or more "pure" than regular amphetamines found in Adderall.  I've talked to many people about both drugs and those who use Adderall on a recreational basis and have tried a small dose of Crystal Meth find their physical effects to be the same.  Meth just has a large negative hype behind it--which personally frustrates me to no end because if used in moderation or along with practicing "harm reduction", a person can still live and be a positive attribute to society.


Does that mean amphetamines won't effect everyone differently?  No, they still will as each and every person is also genetically different--but we're all the same species so the physical outcomes are bound to effect everyone within a similar range physically.  Meth or amphetamines are addictive only psychologically,  NOT physically...compared to Heroin or OC etc. which is addictive physically.  No matter what one person chooses to do they're ultimately harming their body but as I've said before--"harm reduction" is a very useful practice and one must always be aware and educated, in my opinion, on those important factors while using any drug.

A good example of how meth might be more enjoyable and thus more addictive and dangerous is the compariosn to another famous drug. Cocaine as a milestone but meth makes it look like a cheap caffine high. Its similar when comparing it to other amps. While this might seem like an incentive to use it, the truth is that its the opposite.

Congradulations bro, you've felt what 99.999% of humans on this Earth will die without feeling. You've gained some advantage, just don't push it too much lol.


1. It's not heart burn it's the heart muscle being tired. It's all normal, just bare through it, it will hold just fine. Omega 3, rest, protein and lots vitamins to help it.

2. Do not do any kind of physical exercise while on a strong stimulant. Just sitting down while on meth is equivalent to jogging at moderate speed.

3. Do not smoke drugs.

4. You don't care how your eyes look.

5. Shoot carefully.

6. Don't eat cotton metal or wood.

It is. In fact, when your dick is limb, that's when you're in buisness. Like, if you try to fuck with it you'll fail at life ya but it's not like you got a wife to please. Bj...

**Added one more question to the OP**


I bet the number of people that have used IV meth is higher than .001%.  Definitely higher if you count people using meth in other ROAs.  But whatever, I'm an adventurous type and why not experience all life has to offer while you're here (including drugs.)  Now I know addiction can bring you down to dark places because I've been there with opiates.  I've also been much more careful with my drug use since I got off taking opiates and later Suboxone every day.  I don't require drugs every day any more and only occasionally dabble in opiates (last time was over a month ago.)  Trying meth was mostly about the novelty of trying something new.


1. Where do I get Omega 3?  Can I get it in a pill or certain foods or what?  I've been meaning to research what vitamins/supplements would help my body recovery from meth use but all I have around the house is some Centrum multivitamins (these are good and NOT expired) and some Vitamin B Complex (2 years past it's expiration date though) and some Vitamin B-12 (1 year past it's expiration date.)  Are any of those worth a damn and does the expiration date really matter?  I know most prescription medications will last long past their exp. date.  Same for these vitamins or no?  I did take a Centrum with my first meal the day after my last meth use... don't know if it helped or not though.  And you are supposed to take most vitamins with a meal to help the absorb properly right?


2. Yea, I figured.  I'll hold off on that till I'm sober heh.


3. And IVing is better? lol


4. Maybe *you* don't but *I* do (so it's not obvious I'm high.)


5. Will do.  I'm an experienced IV'er (mostly with opiates) so I know what I'm doing.  Regardless, this may be my last IV shot of this bag (can't promise anything though.)


6. Metal or wood?  Nigga you cray (I'm not racist... seriously lol)

Nothing harmful about sex right?  As long as you trust your partner and you're both STD free.  And the whole pregnancy thing... but fuck it I'm by myself today and I'm pretty sure I can't get anything from my hand lmfao.  When I'm sober I can usually get it up and finish in no time but on meth... my Johnson is pulling a scared turtle the likes of which I've never seen.  Like I said though, not really a problem, as I don't really feel the need to masturbate but I'm just wondering how common this is on a supposed "sex drug."

1. Cool.  Do you take them while you're high, afterwards to help recover, or both?  And can I just buy them at Walgreens or GNC?  (I'm guessing/hoping they're available without a prescription OTC)


2. No, I've had this weird "one eye dilated more than other other" for about 8 years now (or maybe my whole life and I just didn't notice it paramedics noticed it after I flipped my car about 8 years ago... not sure if it was like that before but apparently some people's eyes are naturally like that I think is what they told me.)  It happens ever when I'm stone cold sober and haven't had drugs in a long time.  And it's like that pretty much all the time.  Drugs have nothing to do with it.  I just posted that picture to show that my eyes aren't dilated more than normal.  They almost look a little pinned even.

Wait, is omega 3 found in fish oil pills?  Because I do have some of those (and I believe they're even good NOT expired).  Or is there a better source?  Would be awesome to not have to spend any more money though if the fish oil pills work.  I've just heard those things make you burp nasty fish taste afterwards lol but oh well I may give it a shot when I come down.

Stimulants, especially Meth, cause vasoconstriction (veins constrict). This causes less blood to your penis and makes it difficult to achieve an erection. The cialis/viagra route would work as they are vasodilators (I'm sure you can guess what they do).

Cocaine as a milestone but meth makes it look like a cheap caffine high. Its similar when comparing it to other amps. While this might seem like an incentive to use it, the truth is that its the opposite.

Talking to people a generation before myself using--many would say (at least in the Midwest) the only reason why many started even using Meth was because it's very hard to find Cocaine uncut(or at least a majority uncut) since many dealers themselves were cutting Cocaine with Meth as it was because it would keep people awake similar to Adderall so then they'd feel it was the Cocaine which isn't entirely true.

Back home when I smoked what we called meth pretty often, it was a white powder usually with some rocks in it.  We would take a little rock, put it on a foil "boat" and chase it up and down as it melted and got hard again leaving a trail behind it each time.  


When I moved to my current location, I was excited to find it here.  However, the stuff here was clear crystals.  Like the stuff you see on Breaking Bad.  It didn't run well on foil at all.  It would melt then slide really fast without producing much smoke (much unlike the stuff from back home) and would be gone.  Sucks because I wasted it by doing that and haven't been able to find it since. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)   I keep reading that "ice", which is what I always thought this was, is the best stuff for smoking, yet, that's my experience....


Anyway, am I correct that the stuff I had back home wasn't actually crystal meth, but crank?  Man would I love to be able to find THAT again!

WTF are you doing with my eyes? lmao  It's a little creepy now that I'm sober to come back here and have my tweaked out eyes staring back at me.


My eyes actually ended up getting more dilated on the comedown but not when I was tweaking really hard (strange?)


Anyway, I ended up taking those fish oil pills.  It said to take 1 pill 3 times daily with food so that's what I did today.  Also took a Centrum multivitamin.  Not sure how it's supposed to help but oh well can't hurt.  Couldn't sleep much last night but I think I may have dozed off for a little bit at least.  I have a job fair coming up so I'm gonna hold off on doing more until I know if I have to take a drug test.  And then... I'm not sure if I want to IV again.  I mean, it was really fucking awesome, but at the same time it was almost *too* awesome.  The rush scares me more than a heroin rush (which I had no problem IV'ing multiple times a day.)  Feels like it's probably really bad on my heart.

Damn I'm jealous.  I got a hell of an awesome rush but nothing sexual.  I've heard that girls can get that though heh.  No hallucinations this time but last time when I was up for 2 days I started having minor almost LSD-like visual hallucinations of still images moving on my computer screen but the weirdest part was audio hallucinations.  I swore I was hearing music coming from the next room so I got up and went over there and then it was coming from the room I was just in.  Couldn't even determine what song it was... it was just too quiet to make out but it was definitely music.  Never had anything like that happen to me before from LSD or anything else.


Haven't ever seen "shadow people" though... not sure if I want to....

using all caps like that will turn people away from your threads. maybe just say it normal.


70 mg of some solid shard was the right dose for me. I never took it up to 100mg, but depending on your gear you might need that much. with meth if you do a little more than necessary you wont straight up die like with cocaine, but thats not to say you wont be uncomfortable and tweaked out if you do too much. so try not to do too much, it's possible to die from it if say you have a bad heart or your physically weakened for some reason, so if that is the case then take it easy.

^the white powdery stuff with little chunks?  the description fits what is normally referred to as "crank".  though pure meth can come in nice big clear shards or more a crystalline "powder" which would give the whitish appearance with a few larger chunks of rocked meth.  the powdered substance can be a sign of impurities, ie - cutters.  and saying that, beautiful looking clear, large sized rocks can be just as impure, even fake in some instances, as the shitty of the shittiest shake n bake cut to smithereens.

I haven't found anything of the sort in years unfortunately.  I was just thinking about it as I've finally gotten around to watching Breaking Bad and everyone on their is smoking the meth that looks like the stuff I couldn't get to smoke hardly at all.  I also noticed that when they would smoke it, it would sizzle.  Now, I know it's TV but I know that you did NOT want to sizzle the stuff we used to smoke.  That would just burn it and give an awful taste that would choke you.  If you held the heat under it right, it would slowly slide down the foil leaving a trail while producing LOTS of yummy smoke.  Then when you removed the heat the rock and the trail would harden up and turn white (or if it was really good it would be a clear brownish color). Then you would turn the boat around and run it down the other way.  


Sometimes we would open the end of a light bulb, clear it out and dump it in there and spin it around leaving the trail going all around the bulb.  That was great because it would go on forever!  But, like I said, the stuff I got when I moved here that I assume was ice or glass (the clear crystals) wouldn't do that.  It was like it was only good for snorting or IVing....

naptown wicked, crank is just an oldschool word for meth, same chemicals, possibly better precursers or a different synth depending on the batch. it's more regional slang so the stuff you were getting that was called crank might have just been purer.


you got to work on your smoking technique. it sounds like the stuff you had was lower quality, or it could have just been crushed up more, either way get your hands on a meth pipe, that's the best way to smoke. if the ice you're getting where your at is really good you might have to change your techique, but you'll figure it out.

yes you should be fine to do some with dxm and guif in your system. if you took a lot of dxm it could get a little wierder than normal, but if you took a normal dose like 25-50 mg you will be fine.

Awesome thanks Down. I just did a shot and everything went just fine, more than just fine actually, perfect. I was worried because I heard that there was a chance of Serotonin Syndrome when combining meth and dxm.

yeah, the meth after the DXM is fine.  


personally, i would avoid dosing the methamphetamine after the DXM had fully cleared from my system, feeling no residual effects.

I myself have taken 30mg dxm tonight too before meth. I've had a similar situation with vyvanse go fine so I wasn't too concerned, especially at that regular dose. Was for potentiating my methadone...


Well, hi guys! First time with meth here. Delivered to my door at 4:30AM... only took them what, 9 hours? Looks like I got a bit less than what I paid for (dont want to discuss pricing or anything) -- was 280mg in the tiny bag. I'm hoping the bag's weight is minimal once I'm done. I've got a good bit of experience with all sorts of other stims, glad to have sourced some meth. It's 100% uncut too (unless they used a cutting agent that's water soluble and looks exactly like the white stuff in my bag). Crystal-y white powder. I have a bit of tolerance from 120mg methylphenidate rectal mini-binge 5 or so days ago.


Had no idea about where to begin dosing. Started out with tiny bits, like 5mg in a lightbulb vape, to get a guage for things. Obviously that was minimal... a few min later I made my way to the erowid dosage guideline page. Going to let the bit of a high I've built up dwindle down then begin experimenting with rectal administration (my preferred ROA next to oral). Might pick up a cheap pipe and try that some more, lightbulb vape is not ideal for loading a crystal/powder into.    And something about it seems kinda dirty.


Well, I'll head off back to my book. Have Fear and Loathing and The Naked Lunch for now. Might get out my old camera and post a pic of the stuff I have later. Peace, and safe stim-ing everyone!


Edit: So after some experimenting... For one, it seems like different ROAs produce somewhat different effects. Smoking felt more of a body high (also was on 15mg - non recreational - methadone). Didn't bother sniffing more than a bit, always seems like an inefficient ROA for me. Rectal, well it's second to IV I guess. 50mg plug didn't produce the rush I imagined, didn't want to push it given I'm exploring new territory. Plus, there was the plug earlier and all the vape hits. I managed to get the lightbulb vape to work perfectly. Needed an interesting tool to stick into the bulb to place my dose inside. 


I was hoping to keep some for another time, but I didn't quite get what I paid for. Oddly, I noticed meth didn't get me very horny or sexual -- even when I tried -- compared to other stims. Though that likely could be due to the fact I got off twice a hour or so before I started with the meth. All in all, a nice stim. I like it's legs so far... **note: took 350mg sodium bicarbonate prior to dosing this session.** I'm not into the right up, then right back down kinda compounds. Not sure if I have enough to try oral later, plus it's just kinda inferior to plugging. Specially with this stuff since rectal administration doesn't peak then come down within about a hour. I was expecting a bit more push and physical stimulation, but it's more like a concentrated d-amp or something. 


Want to really feel a initial rush from a plug though. 50mg didn't quite do it. We'll see where things go from here. Not gonna push my self much though. Maybe larger vaped doses?


Edit2: I don't like smoking it, doesn't feel good for the lungs/body. This stuff is hard on the body as it is, will pass on that. And forgot to add a important note to the beginning.

Just a friendly warning: Way back when, with plugging well-synthed uncut meth, I dealt with some serious pyschosis. Don't know how much I used, but it was a lot.


Worse than any bad trip you could imagine.

Well, the thing about meth is that its used in much higher doses. Lets say you had 1 point (100 mg)of meth.Twice as poten as dextroamphetamine, so it would take 200 mg of it to be equally addictive. Adderall is 3/4 dextroamp, but lets say 4/5 because of levo. So you would need 250 mg of adderall to equal the addictivness of one point of meth. Take that much adderall and tell me its not as addictive as meth.

More doesn't necessarily mean better.  Regular amphetamines don't release 5-HT in the same manner meth does; this makes meth more euphoric in itself.  If I took a huge dosage of Adderall I would really dislike the effects.  I don't even particularly care for methamphetamine anymore either and am  much happier not using it.  After having gotten accustomed to methamphetamine a while ago, I had lost all interest in using regular d-amp or d,l-amp.

Despite chasing the stem with a miniature blow torch, the stuff didn't burn which I find amazing; instead it dribbled down the stem meekly in one little clear gloop. Waited for it to recrystallise, heated it back up again, took one massive hit as it seemed to go on and on (nearly burned my lips from the still hit stem lmao, rookie twacked mistake), and exhaled the breath of a dragon!!!! Fucken rush was orgasmic. I'm twacked out of my head right now, so fucken high!!!!

**Problems in the vein**


I'm the type that even the most experienced IV users cringe and run away from.  My veins have always been a persisting issue in my life, even before my drug use. It would take skilled nurses and doctors no less than 45 minuets to find a spot for a blood draw. I've been going the IV way for 2 years now. Some days are good, others result in a three hour fight just to get a peek a boo. I'm aware of harm reduction, i use a tie, alcohol swabs and a new point each time. My problem is that I can find the vein I can get the register but than when i go to push its a miss, which results in me pulling out to got through the tiresome process all over again. This isn't just me but others who have attempted as well. Than I have a problem with the blood -when I do find a spot- gelling or clotting up quickly. Earlier I tried to "rig up" and everything was gravy, nice thick dark register, pushed plugger in a bit, everything good. Re register, and push again to have a burning sensation go all the way up my arm. It typically lasts 12-16 seconds, after this time however I noticed a small clot as I pushed the last in, too little too late.. After removing the point the injection sight started to hurt, burn a bit, but no swelling like a miss. It's really sore and tender now, and when I applied a hot rag the area under the skin that I am assuming to be the vein was like a white bubble. No air was in the point. Still no swelling and only slight redness at the sight. This is only the second time using this spot. I try to keep myself hydrated, but seein my doc loves electrolytes as much as me this too can be a constant battle. Another issue I have is you can not see my veins, and they are sometimes hard to feel... Any suggestion to make this process less of a hellish envision? And any ideas on why after I do a shot I can "feel" it move through my vein I that bitter burn?

^ it sounds like you need to work on taking a deep breath, relaxing, and not sliding out once you have registered.  This can be difficult, especially if you end up only barely aligning into the vein correctly.

I try that. I even get someone else to hit me, it makes it easier bit problems still persist. My partner hasn't as muches as missed but other weird stuff Happens. Big one is registering an Autry, which epically pisses me off but then I have instant blood clots and gelled up product. Which in the end gets trashed. I have done my fair share of research I was just kind of hoping someone else ha These experiences. I haven't gots any type of infection yet, but I do try my best to keep injection sites and misses clean

Yeah it helped. It took a little while to get the feel of positioning it right to find the veins, but yeah it for sure shows you veins that you can't see for whatever reason, deep veins, ones covered by scar tissue, etc.

I don't know where the hell you guys are from geographically, but it doesn't sound like Australia.


I've never had a cough (IV user), slight warmth into the throat and that's using 3 pts a hit and have only been using a month,


I wish we had good stuff here, it's so fucked!!!!!!

I'm in Melbourne


Been shooting meth on and off for 12 years. I only use every 2-4 weeks but still only have to shoot about a point to be rushing my tits off.


In my experience, even with good gear and a good hit, the cough doesn't always happen. It's an elusive one.


If I did a 3 point hit I would be seriously concerned whether I was going to live or not. Like, too concerned to enjoy the high and I would be puking everywhere and probably soil myself, haha.


You definitely shouldn't have to shoot 3 points to get off man.


Be careful if you get a new connect....don't go loading up a 3 point shot of stuff you haven't tried!!

May I ask a question of any of the users here who'd like to respond? I'd just like any volunteered examples of people's dosages and dosing schedule as it composes their habit. I myself binge pretty much every 2 weeks for about 2 weeks, and after the gram or two is gone the cycle completes itself and turns back around again whenever I deny that this shit has gotten me hooked. So I use about a point or more a day, but never go beyond 2 points a day, and have a rhythm with a mixture of sleeping pills that seems to keep me from pulling too many zombiethons (lapping two sunrises I consider to be the beginning of vampire territory and not worth the fun).


Now I have a friend who will binge on half a gram in about 12 hours, and if you give him a whole gram he'll somehow have that down in the same 12 hours, like it was food or something.


I know I'm fucking up my brain with this ridiculous habit, but what is the real statistical face of meth addiction and its damages on the people responsible enough to keep track of how much theyre using (such as you and us here on BL)? I don't deny it's a someone vain attempt at gauging the relativity of my own addiction, but I'd simply like to know how the lot of you are using out there, whether you're weekend bingers or maintenence tweakers, and how much it takes for you to put down til you pick up again?


Surely it's been asked, I just thought I'd post here since this is  the megathread and all. BTW I don't IV, but I plug like it's the next best thing (it totally is).

@Jtouch74

IV Vyvanse would not be worth it, minus the fact it's designed to have a time release because Lisdexamfetamine is just a pro-drug to d-amp. D-amp comes in the form of Dexedrine which is perfect oral. It's no crystal, MPH, or 4-MAR. 


I finally fucking found somebody who pushes shards; I don't want no shit, super-toxic shake n bake crank trash. This dude has the TRUE SHARDS! My old shard dealer got locked up, but now I'm good. His crys is wayyy cheaper and higher quality. I'm mad lucky I was sitting outside smoking a cig, casually shoot the breeze, and I got to talking about ice. And he went to the bathroom inside and broke off a $30 dollar *street value* for fucking free! 


I shot ~.15g and I'm hyped up, spun, and mad euphoria! I have an amazing tingly body high, it's nice and warm too. Unlike Adderall bullshit, high doses make me feel way tooo jittery with mild, I mean MILD, euphoria, because the l-amp side effects are obnoxious. I like sweet spot doses with pharms like benzos, opioids, stims- dl-amp, MPH, d-amp, sedatives or whatever. I like to take a dose of Adderall that's productive and provides a enthusiastic mood-lift. 


Sorry for rambling I'm tweaking and have no tolerance to crys meth right now. I might just shoot the other 0.15 so I don't do it too close to night, even though I won't sleep most likely and my "Ice Dude" wants to party with my friend I met at the MMT clinic and give us free shards because my dude will drive him around. He's tryna to persuade me to stat middle 

manning people and finding customers, which I can get via my friends even lol. 


He's plugged in with the Mexican Mafia and the Russian Mafia *I think he said Russian*, no joke this guys from Mexico with a heavy accent. He's got the CONNECTS for fucking real!

Ive never had this before,


honestly was pretty lazy about it this time around, and reused a syringe. powdered .4 g of methamphetamine, put in back of syringe pulled up 4 units of water shook syringe until it dissolved. i don't use tourniquets, got it in, pulled got a flash, started pushing slowly, eventually felt some pain, re flashed and finished. Did not miss because i got an insane rush, and were talking about a guy who usually wont fuck around with anything less than .6g of meth in a shot.


I usually do whole gram shots of 4-mec, it takes two syringes, and nothing smaller than a 29 guage needle. and really fucking good aim (by far the best euphoric clean rush i have ever had, better than powerballing dope and tar)


anygay


didn't notice till hours later that my arm was numb from elbow down, red not swollen. have heated with compress, soaked in Epsom solution, reheated with compress and cooled down with compress, taken ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, put neosporin and cortisone 10 cream on entire affected site. The tiny spot were i missed a smidgen is almost gone can hardly feel it , it is a tad bit tender, hardly noticeable, but the INSANE numbness down my forearm to my wrist is very noticeable and the redness. ive straight up MISSEd half a gram in my arm before and never had this issue, its been 24 hours and the most is the lump has gone away, just super super fucking numb.


did not hit an artery


Yes im aware of the thickness of the shot, the fat i didnt draw it up pre mixed, and the re-used syringe. I just read so many posts I cant reall ypeace it together. any suggestions before i stroll down to the er?


Im not worried, just confused.

I just cannot imagine anyone shooting up that much meth.  I have a friend who has shot shard for 23 years, since he was 14, and just no.  


At any rate, meth seems to be incredibly caustic when missed, they get RIGHT on antibiotics when they miss shots, whether or not they actually go to the doctor.  If you are having that much trouble, yeah go for sure, I'd think.

Shieet im high as a mutha fuckin kite right now. Who fucking even knows how long i have been trolling around on this thread for. 

Anyways, i just iv'ed probably .3 and im pretty high. Everytime i shoot meth i get this crazy feeling in my chest more than anything else. 

Its as if someone has poured a pitcher of ice cold water on my chest, im sure this is normal seeing as its happend to me everytime ive shot dope. anyone else feel that intense cold chest rush?

I have to switch back and forth between smoking and shooting the shit. Slamming meth makes my body just scream for help, health wise. Everything seems to deteriorate at a way faster rate than smoking it, my veins get all restricted and the skin all over my body turns red and purplish. My sweat seems to crystalize on the outside of my skin. i get all these weird body aches. I only shoot it for the intensity of the high, i mean who wants to shoot a bunch of tar and fall asleep? i'd rather shoot a bunch of shards and go catch a fuckin fish or something. 

well i am satisfied now that i have wasted hours of my life reading about shooting meth and being able to throw my pointless banter into the mix.


Oh and just to throw it out there, i dont know who some of you are kidding but i didnt learn how to shoot meth at a fucking doctors office, so all this microfiber, serile jesus water and fresh rigs everytime you do a shot? That must be the responsible drug addicts in you...no.

My boyfriend and I both IV and smoke.  I wish a gram would last us more than 6 hours.  as far as schedule... We do it when we want to but with IV its different... always chasing.  Smoking doesn't work anymore.  We only use our bitch when we need to get it into our system so the comedown doesn't suck


I always thought i wouldn't let myself get addicted.  The comedown gets better after a few days but the shit takes over your head.  it takes over your reality and changes your perceptions.  Even tho I hate myself for doing it, I love it and cant get away.  its not even that fun at least not anymore.  Shoot... get stuck... have sex   repeat

Hey I'm sorry nobody got back to you very quickly, and hope you're OK.


If it's not an allergic reaction, or damage to a nerve, it might be accelerated hypertension. Hope you did what you said, and saw a doc. Even better, I hope it all went away right after you typed it, and didn't have to go. Please update when you can.

Only issue I have with coming down off crystal is the sweaty, anxious, and annoying residual stimulation. I'm also on 70mg of methadone and when I use crystal, it pushes the methadone out of my system too fast and can definitely cause opioid WDs. My friends on MMT that IV shards have the same issue.

The sweaty, anxious, annoying residual stimulation sucks.  However I'm putting up with it in lieu of using CNS depressants or other drugs like shatter/hash oil/wax.   


Earlier I had a shot that was so potent I had the inital "cough" then I had a violent cough and there was a brief moment where I involuntarily was shaking my head side to side like a dog that just got out of water; it was something else.  I was really careful to not vomit (had to sit still for many minutes).


The best advice I can give you is to embrace how you feel and to take a deep breath, stretch a bit, and enable the way you feel to be perceived as good.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

QUESTION for all the users...


1) have you ever done "too much" , i.e. to the point of dysphoria

2) and if you have, how long did the dysphoria last?


I ask due to the seeming inconsistencies for the #2 value.

1. Yes. Probably would have been diagnosed as stimulant psychosis. Very bad.

2. About 12 hours, until I calmed the 'eff down, and was able to sleep. For like a week, if memory serves...

I've done a week without having that happen tbph... six days twice in two separate years before that.  


Thanks for informing me - was asking for a friend ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)


I was wondering why I hadn't ever seen a buddy ever have this happen to them for hours on end - I can ONLY IMAGINE 12 hours of it!


What was your dosage?  0.05g?  0.5g?  0.5g is an abusive, near-fatal (for some) dosage, and I don't recommend it, but it's the "higher end" of the spectrum of doses that users have done around me without dying (and they actually hit euphoria only)

...it was bad. I never had the worms crawling on my skin kind of thing, but something close: I swear I could see smoke wisping out of my hair follicles. It was terrible. The radio was on, talk radio, news. And then they started talking about me. And were saying exactly what was happening to me as I was doing it. I lost my perception. Couldn't see anything closer than arm's length...or was it that I couldn't see anything further? Can't really remember now. And then I started trying to figure it all out...like, why it was happening. Rationalizing it. I thought the shower I'd taken had somehow reacted with hydrochloric acid that I must have absorbed through my skin earlier that day and was producing hydrogen gas beneath my skin. The more I thought about it, the more obvious is was. This ended up with me naked in front of a mirror, and an X-acto knife, freaking out, and putting tiny punctures into my skin where the gas was building up painfully. I'd poke, and POP, and a wisp of smoke would escape. I ended up slicing all of the joints on my fingers, and every time I'd squeeze my hand into a fist, smoke would puff out. Finally, some friends who were (of course) hours late, finally showed up, and tried to convince me none of it was real... Bad shit. Will never go back.


And, this happened a second time, too... but even though it was just as real, I predicted it would happen before I took the shower that "set it off." Don't miss that at ALL.


(I ended up wearing army coveralls afterward, so I wouldn't react w/ the air outside at too quickly a rate. You know the craziness that goes with amphetamine psychosis.)


It's been more than ten years since I messed w/ meth.


...OH yeah - I splashed water on my face, because my face felt like it was starched, and I it was like I was electrocuted, I went into convulsions, and even ejaculated. (TMI?) Then after I shaved, I could see an oil crystallizing on my skin where I'd just shaved, and I scraped it off and smoked it, and got even higher.


I mean, I'm laughing out loud now, but what a pathetic piece of work I was back then.

One time I thought my family and friends were all conspiring to frame me for some incredibly heinous crime that would put me away for life.  The paranoia was out of this world and I was hearing and seeing things that were indistinguishable from reality.  I was hiding, careful to stay away from windows because I was sure there was a sniper across the street.  I needed to cross the room so I ran quickly past the window and POP a bottle flew off the table as if it had been struck by a bullet and hit the floor.  I reset the bottle on the table and when I went past the table again the same thing happened.  That shit was 730 yo!! I still have no idea if some of the crazy shit really happened or not but it was indistinguishable from reality.  There were a few strange occurrances that were confirmed by someone else in the same room and they experienced the same thing.


I no longer use meth but I suggest not pushing it too far.

I experienced a lot of strange stuff on meth as well. Strange things that were also verified by others who were not under the influence. I've been clean for 6 or 7 months and still have no explanation for the things I experienced.


Methamphetamine can push the mind to extreme limits. Be mindful. 


My advice for anyone considering IV'ing meth for the first time is don't. The hell I personally underwent is indescribable. I've done multiple drugs regularly, but meth was the only drug I had a problem with. Its effects on life are deceiving; regaining/maintaining control is a strong illusion that even the strong willed fail to realize.


I struggle with sobriety every month; that rig and that rush will stay with you forever. There is no escaping that memory, and it is tortuous


. This is not my first attempt at staying clean; I've been trying to kick meth permanently every year I used. Next thing I know a decade has passed and I have 6 months again. 


I can say every serious downfall in my life was indirectly or directly caused by meth.

I've recently gotten into IV meth. I've been away from it for a couple of months. I wish i never got into in the first place. I want it everyday. And i think because i've been abusing my dopamine system. I woke up today after sleeping after a binge. got a head/chest rush, but not that good of a high. It should've been better. but then again, so then i did another shot and got more of a taste in the back of my throat. But yeah, If anyone is interested in IV meth, just DONT! Stick to snorting or smoking. That buzz is unreal....I just hate how much more the prices are here in NYC compared to the midwest and the west coast.

Agreed. I've been off for 7 months, and that high HAUNTS me everyday. I think about it every fucking day. I hate it. I always want it. People don't understand that, although they may be able to quit using, that you never lose a taste for it.

Congrats man. I think since i've been IV'ing it for about 2 months, I should try my hardest to quit while i'm still ahead. I'm not new to meth, between 17-23, I used to abuse it, but i smoked it. It was still hell. Thought all kinds of weird shit happened to me because towards the end, the paranoia was just too much. I was able to stop and just get super drunk when i really wanted it. and around that time i started doing heroin. so it went from something that almost drove me nuts, to something that gave me bliss and helped settled my nerves. I don't suggest stopping one drug by picking up another one. But a lot of people stop meth or harder drugs by starting to smoke weed, and i think that's ok. weed helps a lot of people deal with the paranoia associated with the after effects paranoia. maybe use it for a couple of months and then get off, perhaps?

damn, i keep getting a "The server is too busy at the moment. Please try again later." error message on most of the msgs i try and post. grrrrr.

This post is quite interesting to me because of the dosages that are being discussed. It's entirely possible I misread Erowid's dosage chart a while back but I could've sworn it was dealing in dosages regardless of ROA in the 30-50mg range for good buzzes for the regularly tolerant user. Above though I see nothing short of people shooting up points and it's alarming because unless the majority of folks here are purchasing the soil that someone once dropped their meth pipe on and are snorting that or have a wicked tolerance y'all are seriously over-killin with respect to some of the newer users.

30-50mg insufflated, 50mg smoked, 50-80mg Orally ingested, seem to be far more reasonable with ice of some respectable quality. And honestly if you can't procure some quality product you may as well be reading a website of optimistic bullshit because low quality ice will indefinitely leave you in the worst possible outcome side of things.

 But peace!

Tolerance is a powerful thing. Frequent users can use doses 10, 20, 30x, what a normal person can.. that goes for any drug really.

I've been insufflating off and on for a couple of years and still keep within a dosage range of about 50-80mg per 24 hour period. I can't stay awake for more than 1 night anyway (I feel utterly atrocious if I try) and this helps prevent a session (and intake) going any further than this.

Ive been IVing .5-1.5gs a day for a atleast 3 months now, i had quit for a year due to no connections but now i have all the connections in the world and basically get it for free via slanging or just hanging out with my dude. I never thought id be back even worse than before but here i am another 5am, another gram i hustled for free shot throughout the night, its so ridiculously available and cheap to me its hard to pass up, especially since i chase the cough rush like an idiot.


The rush for me can be quite intense depending on dosage and quality.  .1will make me euphoric mild rush .25 will get the rush i enjoy, coughing, brain explosion    .5 is intense i have to catch my breath and its different everytime. The only reason i ever smoke it is due to pipes being passed around and I enjoy taking massive hits(and more free dope), which seems to cause little effect after iving.


I atleast eat/sleep regulary due to insane tolerance, and im cutting back significantly on opiates due to constantly shooting large shots of meth. Non the less the negatives FAR outweigh the positive effects of iv meth. I basically become retarded cuz of the shot sizes I consistantly do so i never get anything done besides hustle more free dope. My main dude lives across the road and stops by with every new batch, which is everyday. He throws me huge shots all the time and trusts me to a degree that surprises me. 


Meth is hard to quit if its readily available and cheap, but i find that if i have no connects its easy to quit. Soon ill have to stop shoveling meth into my veins and get level headed, but in the meantime i guess ill just watch as by some type of evo; magic free dope will emerge.. curse having a great connect. Why cant i have a great oxy connect noooooo has to be this shit again. 


I don't want to shoot more meth but i do..:/

I'm sure many people will say, what a lucky b*tch(sorry). but wow, if you're shooting 1.5gs a  day, that's a lot. be careful and take it easy. also take breaks. i go through 1/4 in like 2 days IVing because i try to save the shots. but i can't get those huge rushes. but oh well. i still get tweeked anyways...

If you don't get desired effects then why don't you use a far less harmful ROA like the rectal ROA. It's just as good as mainlining it in my opinion.

Yes. It was oral, however. I ate around 3 grams out of pure hysteria / paranoia. I was out of my mind for 4 days (yes, I was high and awake for 4 days from one dose) and was terrified the entire time. 


At my peak, I was positive I would die. I lost control of my legs and arms. My legs, jaw and arms all shook furiously for hours. My eyes involuntarily darted from side to side and at times "vibrated". I was in a cold sweat and my vision shook and blurred. The hallucinations were also very vivid and terrifying. My mind justified and substantiated the implausible, leading me to believe and act out the distortions of my reality. For example (this is fictional, but based off of the kinds of things I experienced that night), I would hallucinate an apparition of a man leading me away from the dark energy into a spiritual clearance, but instead of passively watching the hallucination, I would believe and justify its appearance with a racing mind, and so would actually walk in the direction he leads me to and reply to any questions or remarks by apparition. 


roughly 18 hours. After that, I felt better. I was in a bad situation at the time, so the entire trip was pretty bad.

Right. I wasn't doing so hot at the time.  I was homeless and on a good one daily. Because I was living out of my car, I often carried my product around in public. My insanity and paranoia led me to swallow the bag. In reality, I wasn't at risk of being arrested until AFTER I swallowed the bag haha.

My mind justified and substantiated the implausible, leading me to believe and act out the distortions of my reality. For example (this is fictional, but based off of the kinds of things I experienced that night), I would hallucinate an apparition of a man leading me away from the dark energy into a spiritual clearance, but instead of passively watching the hallucination, I would believe and justify its appearance with a racing mind, and so would actually walk in the direction he leads me to and reply to any questions or remarks by apparition.

You must have had a pretty killer tolerance!!!


Were there any enjoyable parts of the experience? I can't even imagine....I would imagine it would feel almost like a different drug at that dose, is that right?


I've had to lay down and focus on breathing after a 0.15 shot of Aussie ice, haha


Well done on getting through that one intact. How long afterwards were you shattered for?

WOW! That's crazy man. Swallowing 3grams at once. I'm pretty sure you were close to OD, sorry to sound so morbid. But i think you were. I'm glad you didn't have 4 grams, otherwise only god knows what would've happened...You'd probably be knocking at his door.

i think so


i'm actually in the UK at the moment from australia to try & deal with my meth issues, but the night before & days leading upto me leaving i would have smoked at least 2g by myself (around others), monster hits. the last 4 pipes i packed were 3 points each, & if i remember correctly i smoked them all in the last 6-8 hours before i left home...


then i did a 25 hour flight across the world, with my mother!


i cant describe the experience properly or accuratley because i was eating valium like candy for the whole flight too, but i remember before i left i was just trying to get higher & higher but the meth had almost opposite-like effects, way more like a munted-pill feeling & way too overpowering to handle

There were many euphoric moments during that "trip", but I was in such a bad position at the time, none of it could be enjoyed. And yes, at that dose, methamphetamine is MUCH more similar to a psychadelic than a stimulant. 


To answer your second question, I was out of my mind for 4 days, and awake for that long. After a full night's rest, I was out of it for another 14 days or so, but more so (I believe) because I was coming off of a 3 month hardcore bender than because of the large dose, but who knows...


At the time, I was injecting as much as I could get my hands on daily, or every other day. My tolerance was still not as high as you may have thoughts; 200mg injected would still get me good and high for 8 hours or so.


 I was injecting anywhere from .3 - .5g at a time, daily, if I could afford it, so take that into consideratioin

Again, I was positive I was going to die. I had little control over my extremities and my eyes were "vibrating" for hours. I was just kind of waiting for the end. Looking back, a very extreme dose of this drug is needed to OD on meth. None the less, don't try this shit, it's NOT fun.

I just recently came off a 7 month clean streak. I relapsed, and as expected, I'm not exactly in the business of putting it down right now. Already, I want at least a .3 shot (i  use only once a week). Not sure if it's quality of meth since I've moved or a retroactive tolerance, but it is what is. It must be an expectation sort of thing because when I initially began using again, I smoked 100mg and was good and euphoric. If I could go back, I would have never started injecting again, but that's 1/2 of my addiction - the needle.

I agree that meth, at extreme doses, is sedating, but also psychadelic.

This. That really goes with any drug, especially via IV. It really depends on the quality of the product and ones tolerance. You can always do more, so it's not really appropriate to say any dose under a certain amount "isn't worth it", because there are a lot of variables in play, and everyone is different.

I was doing shots that were around 70-90mg. i think my guy got an upgrade because they gave me the nicest rushes. not too intense.

but i wouldn't have liked it to be too intense. and i only needed to redose every 12hrs. last time he gave me a bag that every 5-6hrs, i wanted another shot.

Got a question for you guys, I have been iving meth on and off for 5 years, with the longest laspe in time when I was clean was probably about 5 or 6 months.  So anyways I used to be a daily user, and would do anywhere from 25cc to 75cc at a time, sometimes with no effect, because my tolerance was so high. Now I am only iving maybe 3-4 times a month. I no longer get that motor mouth thing like i used to and I kinda miss it, I also feel like when I get high and even when I'm not I've become just emotionally shut-off , where I feel no emotions, I can't remember the last time I cried. I also no longer enjoy sex, or even want it even after iving meth, what is my problem and how can i fix it?

He must have meant 25-75 *units*. 1cc=1ml, or one full syringe full.. so 25cc's would be massive. Makes no sense.

be careful when using 30gauge or + needle tips, especially if using the same needle over and over, the needle being so thin can snap off and get stuck in ur vein...also small tip needles sometimes get skin stuck in the tip, so when ur hitting a vein, you get confused and think your not in ur vein cause no blood drew back. When you really are, it leads to problems, i only reccommend 30G+ for new users with great veins

If you're not reusing your needles, which you shouldn't be doing anyway no matter what size you use, then you don't have to worry about it.

I've done shots before, but it would be another person administering to me, but I'm set on trying to myself. I'm wondering how much water to mix with it filled to right under 30 units(ml) and it's not entirely crushed just packed a bit with the plunger. I don't have any other way to measure it.

Wait you're filling the syringe with the meth, before you add the water? You're not drawing it up through a filter? Who the hell told you to do that?

using excel 1cc syringe and 1/2 in 30 ga. works better than insulin syringes, IMO, would like feedback. bruisy with insulin syringes. started with 25 ga, it was handy. liked the bigger syringes with the 25 ga. like having 1 needle to draw with, then can put on new one. thoughts???

Been sober for 2 years off Meth and the thought of it still makes me horny and go crazy lmaooo will my cravings for it ever go away? I try to occupy my time by doing chores, reading, working out ( lifting heavy weights and shit ton of cardio ) and I'm happily married so that occupies my time but when my wife and I argue it's about me talking about Meth a couple of times a day. Anytime she asks what's wrong and I tell her how drained I am and how I wish I had uppers she knows I'm suggesting I wish I was still using Meth. Does it get better I mean it's been 2 friggin' years! Meth was just something I got accustomed to using it heavily for 5 straight years I'm 27 at the moment going to be 28 in July. Was just wondering if I can try other things to help.

Today at around 4:30pm a friend from work came over and he brought his glass  pipe which I took two  pretty big hits from. I wanted to only try it oral but this was all he had. Being I had to go back to work in a half hour I didn't want to do more since I didn't know how it would affect me. As expected I was talkative which is unlike me  and I had a ton of energy however I had almost no euphoria.  Was it that I didn't do enough or perhaps just low quality stuff? I'm 5'9 and  weigh 135lbs and   my  only stim experience is 300-500mg of caffeine when I wake up and semi-daily use of  once a day  kratom (2-3 grams). The caffeine has zero affect on me other than keeping the headache away and even when mixing with kratom I never feel overly jittery. 


I take 15mg of temazepam and  200mg of pregabalin at night.  Last night I took the benzo at 11:00pm and the lyrica at midnight. Could either of these that may be still lingering in my system be responsible for the lack of euphoria? While at work I had no trouble drinking water although I still haven't eaten anything other  than a few prunes a couple hours  ago. It is now 2:45am and  I'm curious if I'm going to feel  much of a  comedown, I haven't taken my benzo or lyrica for over 24 hours and while I have some anxiety it certainly isn't all that bad or unexpected.

It could be that you didn't take enough hits. I know for me the first time smoking out of a pipe I took two hits but the guy was shiesty and I told him I didn't feel any different. He told me to go home and look at porn and jerk off.. I laughed.. went home and smoked my grits and they tasted better than usual and I was chain smoking it up before I went home and ended up jerking off all night.. didn't even notice a comedown I was just tired but ended up sleeping it off. For me I have a high tolerance to stims especially Meth. I've been clean for 2 years so if I did a shot of some pure shit I would get high but I would be able to drive on it and if a cop pulled me over I wouldn't be paranoid.. I'd strike up a conversation with a cop no problem.. but that's just me. Some people make it obvious they're on the stuff and others can get away with it. Over time though for me everyone knew because of how angry I got.. felt like everyone wanted to see me go down in flames but that could just be paranoia just be careful with the stuff. I miss it man I hate being tired and I loved working out on the stuff lol shit got me shredded! But whatever you do just be careful.. it's definitely addicting!

Thanks for the response. I really enjoyed the experience and will give it another go in month at a higher dose but I know unlike opiates I could never be able to keep any  in my possession because with I know I would   end up doing at least a hit in the  morning before work. I didn't notice any side effects and as someone who has bad social anxiety this completely took all of that away and made me feel like I was on top of the world. I'm sure people at work probably  knew I was on something  because I'm someone who hardly ever talks and while on it I was the complete opposite, all I wanted to do was socialize. It's a shame the shit is so toxic. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


 I ended  being up for 24 hours and   felt  no comedown just a little bit of anxiety here and there.   I was planning to see how long I could stay awake but at the 22 hour mark I started getting a headache and took 2 Tylenol PM and an 45min  after that took 200mg pregabalin and fell asleep about an hour after,  I never even had  to use a benzo.  I ended up sleeping for  five hours and while I drank around a gallon of water during the experience  I didn't eat (other than the prunes) until around 10pm the following night.

HR: Opinons? 

2 Things, while shooting Meth:

1: I never in my life licked the needle, idiocy, but when my rig is ready, the last thing I do is dip it in my water supply to rinse off any Meth off the needle. 

2: I have considered this, but not implemented it-I am considering pulling a tiny amount of blood back into the needle a tick or two post completion, then withdrawing, purpose being not allowing any meth leakage outside the vein during removal. Thoughts?

I doubt you need to rinse the tip of the syringe, flicking it would probably do the job just fine.


If you're using good IV technique you probably don't have much to worry about.  Release the tourniquet prior to shooting, don't withdraw the needle immediately, wait a few seconds, and withdraw slowly, then apply slight pressure on the site of the shot, it should prevent meth leaking into your tissue as long as you didn't poke through the other end of the vein when inserting the needle.

Thank you, Nicholai. I am developing good technique. I (re)started with some 1.5in 25ga, with which i had surprising success for the most part. i tried insulin needles, now I am using excel 1cc syringes and .30 Ga .5 in needles. I may try shorter needles. If i fail to register 2x, i change needles. Usually the first shot of the session goes fine. over the last week i have been able to hit the inside elbow vein on the right easily (no tie). i tend to chew my arms up on subsequent shots however. I am getting better. I am weighing my dosage, and actually lowering it, so I'm less apprihensive and not shaking so much. I also noted that going quickly and decisevly instead of mucking around has a much better success rate. 

Thank you for your advice. I will stop yanking the needle out right away. I "drag"the needle, too, scratching the skin. i do use copious amounts of triple antibiotic and vitamin e, fortunatly, for I tend to get good at an area, chew it up, then find another site. both outside crook veins are healing, lumpy...

Yikes, yeah be careful with that!  Make sure you extract the needle at the exact same angle as you stick it in or you're going to damage your veins more than is necessary.  I use the short tips, personally, and find that they work just great, I haven't used the long tips in ages.

Always start off with a minute amounts, few crumbs, and work your way up very gradually. Never ever increase your dose significantly or you'll fuck up. Just know that IV is way more intense than smoking, so don't assume you need more than a very tiny amount your first shot.

It's lazy, but quick. I haven't done that is quite some time now. I use detachable needles, so drawing up is a piece of cake without having to risk damage to the needle.

I dissolve in some water (like coke, there is no need to heat meth before shooting it), always micron filter my shots, then I shoot it. It was a great experience for myself when I did it. If you are prone to missing a shot DO NOT do meth via IV!!!! I've seen horrible experiences from missed meth shots.

Ummmm wow? How didyou go backwards? For me, I enjoy the needle and the rush too much to ever ingest any other way. That's good for you since you wanted to revert. I only slam and that's it.

Every time I come on these. Forums it's to a of meth. Threads....here in western ny, buffalo there is virtually  no market for it unless your in a biker gang or traveling, Fedex etc.and  I get so jealous....I have one kid who gets it but I can't trust him, the first time I smoked I was up for 3 days. Making a .2 last all night ...it was great smoking and snorting, of course the last time i decided to ever talk to him again I got a nice bag of crystals I was so excited to  bang it, smoke It, since all I use it adderall.  To my disgust the crystals didn't. Melt and dropped out of pipe...salt!! And I banged a. Nice line before...he claims his guy did it...bull...u know what ur giving someone and u know if ur connect burned u...ugh.I CANT EVEN GET METH and IV. It without. Worrying if it's something toxic and I die...it's just not prevalent around here .....I smoked tonight, after each hit I just wanted more and was carpet crawling. 


  I thought the guy did it to me personally, so a friend got some and shared...blah bath salts cut with salt...I doubt the Meth will be pure crystals f it's rare around here.... We'll back to adderall tomorrow on my refill..l.

Trust me, you wouldn't be jealous of being able to get unlimited amounts of meth if you lived in the american southwest and fucking grew up with a bunch of tweakers.  Stick with your addies at least they're not so fucking neurotoxic.

I live in north east US, and meth is NOT prevalent here in NY, sure it's around , but if you ask people in the drug scene they never tried it or heard of it here . Just weed, crack/cocaine and heroin are the primary street drugs readily available 24/7 . Unless you were using sarcastic humor ? Lol my gay friend lived in Boston and had his fair share , so maybe it's my area, than again the gay scene is known for meth..idk..i rather spend 50 bucks that will last me days verse 40mins if it were coke or crack ...wow strikes me odd why there is no demand yet it's so damn popular

There is no way to tell without doing a test in a lab.. nobody online can tell you what you have. It'd be pure speculation.


We can't say if it's safe to IV or not, as we have no clue what it is. "Bath salts" could be a lot of things. If you don't know what it is, don't do it.

Do bath salts taste like meth? I know the taste of meth very well and this has that same taste. It's a whole G the tweaker in me can't throw money away like that that would kill me before the dope lol. Do any stores sell drug test kits like the cops have?

Yeah, simple reagent kits online. Just pull out the needle and plug (rectal) half of it. Safer than shooting some unknown. But as Mr.Scagnattie said, safest of all, just don't do it.

I shot it and I'm not dead I'm not sure if it's meth though. I was also wondering a year ago I got shot and am paralyzed due to that for some reason I just don't get the same high I use to at first I thought it was because I was smoking but then I shot up again and still not the same high. I remember the first time I shot a thick 30 my ears were ringing I thought I was gonna die lol. Idk maybe the ice I been getting just ain't that good... Time for a new connect.

I dont understand you guys always use so much. I read a story about a guy having a 2.5 point shot for his first shot!  and ive often heard this is the end all, be all rush for someone not fully addicted in the US. A full quarter shot which I think would have me in another world completely.  Anyway at first I used 50mg of aussie ice and that blew my head off. Now I have full point shots which is the standard amount used by people in Australia. Im just interested because surely you guys are just supermen when it comes to meth. A lot of it is in the gay community but still, thats one big fricken shot! And I used to use speed! (You guys prob get it as crank, like powder meth not crystal) ten years ago. Had ice/crystal every few months, then every few years and then eventually as it always would it took over my town and in the last year its been a part of my daily activities in the last few months. 


Can anyone tell me more?

Here, in Texas I've never seen powder speed, just crystal... I assume it's like that in most places here due to the cartels in Mexico and home labs. 


I never really cared for getting my bell rung on IV uppers, unless the opiate supply is dry. I'm sure I'm not alone when I say that a full point shot would knock me out. I've done a .05 and zoom. I don't know what I'd get outta anything higher.


Be safe y'all, no matter what part of the world you're in... Get those wheel filters and don't go over... There are truly some vile chemicals that may or may not have been fully recovered from the cook.

My first time using meth ever was a 250mg shot. Damn near blew my head off.  That was in Brisbane back in 2006 as well so it was damn good quality. 


These days if I use I hover around a point per shot

[QUmeth444;12244188]HR: Opinons? 

2 Things, while shooting Meth:

1: I never in my life licked the needle, idiocy, but when my rig is ready, the last thing I do is dip it in my water supply to rinse off any Meth off the needle. 

2: I have considered this, but not implemented it-I am considering pulling a tiny amount of blood back into the needle a tick or two post completion, then withdrawing, purpose being not allowing any meth leakage outside the vein during removal. Thoughts?[/QUOTE]


I totally agree with you about licking the end of a  spike way to much bacteria in the mouth. .. can you say infection. ... as fr pulling bak a bit of blood to withdraw without leakage miss  I think dnt do it personally its just more movement inside the vein causing unnecessary scarring.apply pressure either by the alcohol swab or cotton wool ball, toilet paper etc. On withdrawal and inject slowly decreases chances of blowback.

Release the tourniquet prior to shooting, don't withdraw the needle immediately, wait a few seconds, and withdraw slowly, then apply slight pressure on the site of the shot, it should prevent meth leaking into your tissue as long as you didn't poke through the other end of the vein when inserting the needle.

Im not sure how exact the amount was I had first time I used. we had a g gram of speed between 3 ppl mixed with 80 units of water they had 30 units each I had twenty...its the first time I ever tried speed was like this .iv. I have tried other ways but its not the same I was left wanting.  First time I used ice was only 0.05 so 1 20th of a gram  to 20 units water gave me slight rush. you kno proceed with caution your first time. Wasn't enough of a hit so waited til I had a sleep  than hit a full point with 35 units water . Now I got the rush I had heard about an expected the warm fluffy tingle from your toes to your hair on your head a little houghing  an slight dry retching the cloudy muggy feeling of floating in bliss comes over you..

good idea mate, the info out there about blasting meth is a bit rare still. I stick to a few "rules" I learnt from friends or through trial and error. Dosage is a lot more forgiving than H but a point is a good start, mixed with about 5 units of cold cold water and always filtered. The general rule is if you have to cook it to dissolve it you shouldn't be putting it up your arm, Its just cut or leftovers from a dirty cook. Meth re-crystalises in your veins and and can be caustic as fuck so rotate your veins regularly and look after em. most boosters I know find a Cpl of pipes after a shot brings it on nicely and extends the buzz. As for how often you should shoot, well that comes down to the individual. Now I no longer use everyday I usually boot up twice in a day if im having a bender as opposed to 4 times daily just to maintain a habit. Because meth shrinks your veins it can be hard to get one up and if you have to tie off really tight to find a vein make sure you loosen your tournie before you finish plunging that shot otherwise it can feel pretty similar to a missed shot and bruises you up. The best thing to do is keep your fluids up between shots and (I know it sounds stupid but it works) do a few push ups or something to get your blood pumping and your veins where you want em. In the event of a miss which yeah is pure pain I find that if I run the injection site and surrounding area under very hot water whilst massaging the "speed bump" it will disappear after a few mins, leave no bruising and it works that missed shot into your system more quickly.

I totally agree with you about licking the end of a  spike way to much bacteria in the mouth. .. can you say infection. ... as fr pulling bak a bit of blood to withdraw without leakage miss  I think dnt do it personally its just more movement inside the vein causing unnecessary scarring.apply pressure either by the alcohol swab or cotton wool ball, toilet paper etc. On withdrawal and inject slowly decreases chances of blowback.[/QUOTE]


When I shoot it, I always use a 0.2um micron filter first to filter the solution, and then I dip the tip of my 29ga 1cc in some isopropyl alcohol 99% USP grade, flick it, and assume it's evaporated by the time I'm breaking skin, and if there's any burning, I can attribute it to the sanitizing / antibiotic effects induced by the trace amounts of isopropyl alcohol. 


 I always register, but it only takes me a couple of seconds to hit a vein, and I hold the syringe very still and minimize any movement, register once, then one-two-three iso-swab, needle in biohazard box, *cough cough* methamphetamine rushing hard. Then apply a Q-Tip dipped in isopropyl and hydrogen peroxide (I like feeling the bubbles and know that it's killing germs, nor do I find the mild sting of alcohol to be 'too much') and apply pressure for 60 seconds. Then I put on some triple anti-biotic topical cream over the IV-site, and keep pressure on it for a few more minutes.

Not necessarily no. Lots of times, you'll think everything went fine, and then hours later or even the next day or so, a complication will arise. So it's not a sure thing that just because nothing noticeably happened instantly, that everything is all good.

I snorted meth about 6 hrs ago. I'm wondering about combining anything with the meth. Weed, alcohol? (Some threads lead me to believe these would not be good combinations.) Is there anything that makes a nice combination with meth? TY

Yes! Then re-register and finish it off. Sometimes the vein is stuffed and a simple register will be sufficient and open the vein to finish it all.

One thing I will say for meth is that it does make being high on marijuana a lot more intense, at least for me. Found that out the "hard way"...I remember being pretty spun out on meth once during one of my misadventures, snorting it & smoking it, had been up for a couple days, when I decided to go over to one of the local weed dealer's house and throw a little THC on the mix. I figured that, hey, I'm high on meth right now, and that's a more powerful drug than weed right? Plus I have a pretty high tolerance because I've been smoking marijuana every day for, what, at least five years now?


Whoa. I couldn't have been more wrong. I got super, uncomfortably stoned and then had to drive back to my place all messed up. I was paranoid as all hell that the police were going to pull me over at any moment and arrest me, even though the only drug in my possession at that point was marijuana, and the amount (an eighth) would've only netted me a citation where I live. Definitely an experience I regret.

^^


It's generally not a good idea, as a lot of bacteria and unpleasant shit can build up over time. 


I mean, is making a shot and IV'ing every dose really that much of an inconvenience..? 


Having something like that installed, is also dangerous in the way that it makes you do way way more than you normally would. Having it be that easy to just stick a shot right in there, without having to hit and whatnot, can make it just too tempting because of the ease, to do a lot more shots than you normally would.


It's just one of those things that sounds good in theory.. but doesn't really work well in practice.

Probably get more replies here about meth than anywhere else.


Meth and nitrous?  No clue.


I love a shot or snort of meth, going out for drinks and smoking pot, it's brilliant :D  Has about the same effect on me as rolling, time to go dance!  LOL

I recently iv'd for the first time, smoking in glass had always been how it was done. I don't really like iv-ing as much as smoking. I even had a friend of mine, a very seasoned user,  make my shot and it still felt weak when I told her to make it a good one. It's not that I am not getting it but tit doesn't seem as intense and I don't want to over do it. What should I do? AND I can't hit myself. First try I not only missed but it looks like my arm was hit by a truck.

Yes it's totally normal for some people to experience a "crash" more than others. Some people are just completely variable. I usually just slept hard and with a little bit of etizolam/benzos the next day I felt fine. Some stims have made me a horrible person the next day, completely out of my mind with negativity. Meth hasn't really ever done that to me though, but YMMV.

I know this threads about IV meth use, but between IV and smoking it, you should just smoke it. The next safest is plugging it (rectal ROA which still has a nice rush, just not as quick as smoking) followed by orally taking it, which still has a rush if you take enough, and it has the longest duration. Personally I'd take it orally or plug it first, and redose by smoking or plugging more of it.


I've done IV meth one time, and it was a shot mixed with heroin, holy fuck. It was far far far too intense, my thoughts scrambled, people could have walked into my apartment and stolen everything and I would have been helping them and smiling. I was a bit less educated about why IVing stimulants/vascoconstrictors and such is a bad idea, hell shooting H (BTH) was a bad idea, luckily I learned it quick enough that all my veins are perfect.

Forgive me because I'm sure this has been covered, but the keywords I can think of to search for are too common so the search doesn't bring up the right results.


I snorted meth about 6 hrs ago. I'm wondering about combining anything with the meth. Weed, alcohol? (Some threads lead me to believe these would not be good combinations.) Is there anything that makes a nice combination with meth? TY


I drank three bottles of red wine and shot up a couple of points of meth and don't remember ANYTHING apparently I was angry and hallucinating.

3 bottles of wine, at about 12% alcohol by volume, is equivalent to about 30 1.5oz shots of 40% abv liquor.


That's a recipe for some very serious problems if you keep that up.

**Have I overdosed?**


Hello peeps. Just recently started doing methamphetamine IV and holy shit, its a whole different ballgame. Now I'm a daily IV heroin user . Been that way since 15. I'm 22 now.   So I'm physically not too healthy for. 22. Anyways last night grabbed about .35 of heroin and maybe .2 ofspeed. I did my usual shot of h around 6. It was about .2. Then about ten pm is when I did .1 of h then of h mixed with a few shards. Then an hour later smoked some more speed. Then another IV of shard at 1 am and then the rest in another shot at 5 am. My symptoms were as follows.....I had one of the most pain full headaches ever experienced for a good 3 hours. Istarted having mild chest pains and my chest felt very tight. Now my vision was very spotted like I had extremely high blood pressure. Also my right arm and right leg started to go numb every 20 min or so. Also my right side of my face were the worst of the headache was started to lose feelling too. As if someone used a topical anesthetic on it. Also had a lot of shortness of breath even to the point where I had to consciously take deep breathes. And lasti started to get a strange metallic taste in my mouthe. I really couldn't tell if it was blood from dry gums or if it was coming from my throat or lungs. Oh one more thing. Lots and lots of muscle cramps.I made sure to drink lots of water. Stay relatively inactive and stay out of the heat. But I just burned right through the water as fast as I could drink. Now its been 24 hours about and still have a faster heartbeat. Small headache and feel some numbness in my hand but not as bad as earlier. Hasanyone experienced this bforee. Did they go to the hospital? Mos t importantly did they have any permanent effects as a result. II'm especially worried  about heart problems. And possibly brain or nerve damage due to I possibly had a very small stroke. I am eager to hear your insight or experiences with these same symptoms. Gracias.

question why does meth cause testical pain? I have fired Ice (meth) several time but about two days ago i IVed about 3/10ths and afew hours later the dull constant pain set it. I ended but just lay back and trying to wait it out. Day and a half later pain still there said fuck it and ended up getting a box and shaken cause i could not find any more Ice. So here i am still with sore nads and a great bake to keep me where i want to be. My question is Has anyone had this side effect. And i am curious home nake batchs dont seem to ever rush like Ice is this ya'lls exper.

Every person is different. Just bc you got hooked to the needle for a while (btw congrats on your sobriety) doesn't mean the needle will destroy everyone. I've used the needle the last 2 weeks or so, and I.can go a week if not more without even thinking about it

No offense but you have no idea how addicting IV meth is from 2 weeks of experience.  Keep it up and I promise you will be a junkie in a year.  How can you give advice like that with 2 weeks of IV experience lol, every single addict ever has said what you just said.

I have a n00b question  about the comedown. I'm not in a bad mood at all, but physically I am just dragging. I can't quite get my eyes to focus. Is there anything that will help with that? People say to take benzos for the comedown but I think that would just make me feel more out of it.

It requires a lot of discipline but it is possible to remain functional as long as you are prepared to discover a whole new world. The needle is extreme for me as some already know here. My fascination turned into a strong fetish as I go at it. Recording and showing it is also my pleasure. I started recording when I literally went through every injection video online. Well, that only added to my pleasure. I would be rich if I could sell me needle porn to IV users. 


Okay, I'm just rambling on now.

Yeah! It's called blue balls. Men can get that if they are aroused for a period of time without releasing. My hubby someitms gets that way when he tweaks at times. Just get off if it gets to that point. That's about all I can suggest.

While I'm not trying to suggest one slam meth, I must comment on this. IV method is far superior once it's learned. You couldn't hang and that's fine, but I like extreme and injecting is very pleasurable for me. Why single out the method you didn't care for? I am very educated and learned the needle and everything on my own will. I have very nice veins because I am very good at injecting and am onlyh trying understand why people will ssay it's okay to smoke, ass ram, dope, but NO NEEDLE? How about - no meth? That's like me saying slam, snort, but NO SMOKING. It's the needle that people can't tolerate. I clearly demonstarte injection in the finest manner unlike the media showing street users and shit. Now, the needle is dangerous if one isn't educated about it, but it is clean and by far the most rewarding method for those who are without shame or regret. 


I do's way out of injecting. Now, I sure as hell don't blast that.

I embrace my needle fetish and enjoy it. I also manage to keep my use seperate from work. It is fucking intense to crave it, but common sense keeps me on track. Nothing wrong with needle lovin' as it is just as pleasurable as the rush as I fill my vein every last drop. Gratifying in the sickest way.

... How is rectal administration "the pussies way out of injecting?" That makes no sense. You could say that about snorting, and it would sound less asinine, but saying it about rectal doesn't make any sense. Rectal administration results in a slow absorption with an extended half-life. It's just not comparable.


And to say you are not encouraging IV use, while glamorizing it is a cowards way of pushing you're vice. Apperantly life was boring enough you get done strange obsession with a needle; for truly responsible users it is merely a means to an ends. The same reasons IV/IM is used medically is the reason I use it.


I don't car what you do, and if recording yourself performing an extremely simple medical procedure impresses you, fine, but calling other people cowards for not embracing you're fucking obsession is beyond ridiculous, especially when you Apperantly don't understand the pharmacodynamics of the various MOA's. And then attempting the disclaimer of "I don't encourage this, but it's awesome and you're a pussy if you don't"... Well, I think that speaks for itself. 


Keep your love of needles to yourself please, otherwise "man up" and just admit you think the world would be a better place if everybody was slamming drugs.


Seriously, you're not cool, hun.

Okay, kick back nut sack. I was spun the fuck out and will delete some of the shit I posted. I don't think I'm "cool" and you got me all fucked up. I never implied I was "elite" and yes, injecting is cewry easy and I demonstrate that. Perhaps it's my wording, but my tweak posts come off wrong at times. My comment was shallow, but my point was clear  about singling out IV use rather than the drug iteslf if one wants to go there. I only dislpay my needle fixation when it's called upon via IV posts, etc. I actually do understand to an extent how the other ROA's work and how they work. I just came off wrong with my comment. I was spun and can see where you're coming from. But my point was clear and true about IV method. 


I did not say those who don't slam are cowards, I was referring to those who want to slam but won't just because of the stigma. So my "fucking obsession" is what you are focused on rather than being more civil without the bullshit attack there. You need to hold the 'tude until you hear from me before assming shit about me. If you are so bothered with my other posts, then ignore them because I sure as hell won't pussy foot around when the topic involves something you don't understand. So rather than tell me to keep to myself, you need to take that advice and overlook my posts that do not involve you. I have no problem admitting that my comment was childish and I explained myself. But your other comments are rude and suggesting your disapproval of my needle love. I will post what I want when it's within the conteext, you or anyone else has the right to tell me I can't express myself and my fucking obsession for fucking the needle. You act as if I'm the only one who enjoys my needle use. I happen to have no shame in my game, but I also meant what I said about not condoning what I do. Just because I enjoy what i do does not mean I am telling anyone to do that. I come off this way to many people, des[ite the fact I explain myself. I understand why you had a bone to pick with me about my comment, but when you thinkg you can tell me to hush up about my shit, then that is bullshit. Needle fixation is my right to endulge in when it's addressed. Oh, and you don't know shit about my life, and it sure as fuck wasn't boring. What you see as a strange obsession is fucking common amonsgt a lot of IV users. You need to google up this shit and educate yourself because you sure as hell don't get it. You say the needle is a user's merit to an ends? That's because YOU can't think outside the box. Some users, not ALL. I can enjoy it all I want, you have no goddamn right to speak like you know all. 


Maybe for you, bro, but you cannot speak for everyone. You are biased now that I've fully read your post. I didn't realize what a cocky asshole you were until now. You called me a fucking coward for glamorizing the needle? You don't get it, I speak on my own behalf of my fetish. Your slander was not even valid. Who the fuck are you to play your psycho analysis of me when you are clearly displaying your dislike and making shit up as you go along. You need to sit the fuck down because I will hand you your own ass when you decide to take it upon yourself and basically talk shit that was clearly wrong. One comment did not warrant such childish and biased opinions about my life and fetish. You are the one who is in the dark thinking I have such a strange obsession. Needle obsession is quite common and ragardless of one's life, it is something you just don't fucking understand. Don't ever act like you know shit about shit until you school yourlself, because I will glady "point" out your own vice. Get over yourself and your dislike for me. You sit there and make me out to be such a bad person, yet talk shit to me? I fed you you your own shit. I don't give a fuck if you are bothered by my posts, your life must lack if you are so bothered by me. Get over it! It's called NEEDLE FIXATION. Google it!

You said rectal administration was a "pussies way out". Whatever you meant, you provided no context so we're left with that lovely view. You also said you weren't encouraging IV use, but then you're telling people they can't hang, and clearly glamorizing it. IMHO, that is far more cowardly than rectal administration, which is infinitely safer than IV.


I did go overboard now that I am reading my comment, which was hardly necessary, and I should have restrained myself. And yes, clearly I cannot stop you from doing anything.


And clearly I understand needle fixation. But guess what? THIS IS A HARM REDUCTION FORUM. This is not the forum to display you're fetish. I fucking love shooting up too,(not as much as you though, fuck) but this is not at all the forum for you're personal views/obsession WTF ever. Anyone here with a brain will agree that calling people who don't shoot up pussies is literally the fucking opposite of harm reduction. 


You demonstrate the "finest" example(PQ) of IV, good for you, so do I. But 99% of users, don't. By no other route do you risk HIV, by no other route can you die INSTANTLY, by no other route do you lose limbs. And generally, by no other route do you end up sucking cock in the ATL.(well, that's not exactly true, but the majority who don't smoke crack are IV drug users). By no other route do you have pulmonary embolism, etc.


You can't even begin to tell uneducated people you've never met that IV is at all comparable to other routes. It is an order of magnitude more dangerous.

And calling anyone a pussy is beyond ridiculous.

But what I think, and you think, at least in this, does not matter. This is a harm reduction forum, and glamorizing IV use cannot be tolerated. I ask you to respect that. 


But I am done with this, everyone here will agree that those comments are in spite of the very purpose of this site(but especially this sub-forum).


Yours truly, one cocky asshole fucknut ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I was ticked ealier, but I will admit I tend to get a bit overboard at times in my moments for this forum. Youtube is my playground.. I respect your post since it's straight to the poont without offending me. I made an ass outta myself with that comment and I do not think people that don't shoot up are pussies. I was just heated at the time, but lacked a filter from my brain to my fingers. One thing though, Drug users in all themethods have sucked a fat dick for it. Primarily Heroin because of the horrible withdrawals. Definitely not just IV users. Seriously, I do not think of anyone as a pussy, nor do I think I'm the bad ass that can slam with glam. I like it a lot, but when I'm spun, I literally do not realize at times that I go overboard with my posts. But again, thart comment was a very poor choice of words in a spur of the moment post. A pussy to me is when those who hate without a second thought to explain further. 


While I do speak often about my fixztion, it is not for attention, it gives me a kick just type about it. At least we can admit it and move forward. You read into my comment too much, but it's my fault for making my ass look bad. I have no problem admirtting the cons of IV use, but also the pros. The good and the bad. I personally, come off as glamorizing IV use, when it's my own injections I enjoy watching. I am fully aware this is harm reduction, and that is why I am careful where I post my intense shit. I just tend to no realize at times that when mad, I should refrain from typing shit because I fucked up at another forum and embarrassed my ass. So, I do not at all think I'm superior nor those who don't slam as inferior. I am blunt and graphic, but in no way have I ever tried to encourage anyone to slam. If they choose to, then I can sure as hell help them with my knowledge. Good and bad. But I do not tolerate those who stigmatize my ROA just because they don't understand it. Stating harm reduction is perfectly acceptable regarding the needle, but when I'm labeled or judged, then I will tear a new ass. IV use is dangerous and risky, more addictive, and I will not deny that. But those who educate themselves and choose to inject are the one's who will defy the stimatic junkie on th estreets imgane of IV users. Heroin with its awful withdrawals is the culprit for the disgusting shit like sex or suckin' Big Truckin's dick. It's the person who will stoop that low, not ROA.


One cocky fuck nut....now that was pretty funny. 


"Anyone here with a brain will agree that calling people who don't shoot up pussies is literally the fucking opposite of harm reduction." I woul admit if I really felt that way, but that is not at all the case. I repect everyone and do not think on those terms. I may be very into my work, but I am not narcisstic. I make those for my own pleasure, but get a kick when I'm watched on YT. Like or hate, I just thrive on the perverse thought process, etc. It's the mere act I perform that I love to re-live and upload. Those who choose to watch are my feeds. I will stick to YT for my sick love of the prick. Also, I age restrict so I don't have to worry about kids seeing it. Haters who watch and talk shit just feed my warped mind. 


Thanks for at least explaining yourself, I am content and the last statement was funny shit. All I can do is explain myself as best as I can because I do come off egocentric and like a tough ass at times.

shit I just had a tad bit of a fright. I just had a point of excellent crystal(though I got a taste which I get with h & other forms of speed but not usually crystal) got a medium rush & effect then blasted the last 1.5 points and it hit like a ton of bricks. I'm sweating like a waterfall and for a sec my heart was palpitation like with coke(why I don't do coke) and it's how I know whether it's anxiety or my heart really is saying fuck you. I'm glad I had benzos.


but I'm off to my boyfriends & I'm sure we'll be having some intimate fun with a little roughness and domination ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I love having a bf that is just as happy to be thrashed and enjoy the hell out of it but also when I'm in the mood (not as often as him) he does an excellent job at showing me who's boss ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

no there's much more chance of OD iv coke scares me. I'd start with 50mg. I've had stuff where I'd snort 1/2g and feel shit but last time I had 0.2g snorted & had to call the Ambo. I've had great times IV coke but if you havetoo much which you will if you don't die it will be the scariest experience you'll ever have

Well, it sounds like you're not doing something right. Try to adjust your dose very gradually. My first shot was just So little I didn't feel anything but a come up. Second shot was still weak. Now, with just a bit more in the spoon my third time, THAT was IT! Rush and voila, I was now in the game. Oh, and as for smoking in conjunction with the needle, I have Never ever desired a smoke hit since IV is so strong and even when I'm ready to redose, smoking would only ruin the rush and would probably make you gag. I can't stand smoking anymore since I'm strictly prickly. Be careful and add a minute amount to your next shot. I mean a tiny bit. Good luck!

If you don't use enough water, the shit will be tough to inject. I tend to skimp on water at times because my dose is large to begin with. I can literally feel the shit travel up my veins at times, but it sucks when it's too slow and the rush is weak. 50/50 ratio is ideal for me, and even stronger than syrup.

Okay i am posting to update my pervious question (sore nuts) after shot. I have through my reasearch figured out the source of my groin pain. "MSM" is used to cut ice and can be directly linked to pain in testicals. Also for get my vivance question to much work for a small yeild. Dont bother shooting them. As for the question about the shot vs pipe smoking provides a certain buzz and shooting provides a much different tweak. Its all about mood and setting. But i also dont get a great rush from iv meth idk why its not like an opana shot (my doc) but lets all stay postive and help each other and not have the back and fourth. No drug or method is any better. So use as you do and dont be so quick to put down others. Just my thoughts.

Well, it will clog the point pretty fast if left out. You will need to draw up some water and re liquefy the mix a bit. If you don't then you will waste it.

Okay, so you didn't even hit the mainline so your shot must have been very weak. I get more fucked up and rush unlike the pipe. Did you even rush? You didn't IV meth, honey. Meth is thick and should be shot in the crook vein since it's large and damn good. I think you're either joking or you haven't truly shot dope. You are supposed to use enough water to enable an easy injection and it will hit quicker, just don't overdo the water. Your hand was a poor choice to slam. The crook veins are IT people. No way did you shoot more than you smoke if you haven't truly experienced it.

I've seen this before the girl that would inject me would have the hardest time injecting herself and she would not let me help.  I always got her to do it because i always mess up drawing back.  I plug meth now its not as good as IV but its safer and has more of a rush than snorting or eating

^Definitely, if I had meth that's how I'd be doing it. Plugging is the way to go, quick onset and rush and you don't have to shove a pointy fucking needle into your arm. Infinitely safer, you'll never accidentally hit an artery, you'll never inadvertently create a thrombus in your pretty little veins, and you don't have to poke holes in them! I know this is the IV mega-thread, but I'll just put in a plug for plugging. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Pun intended. 


CVS gives me a bunch of 1ml oral syringes for free, check it out.

I know my drugs, and I know I had crystal meth. I have been an on and off IV user for 15yrs, don't tell me what I have and don't have. if it looks like meth, tastes like meth, smells like meth, feels like amphetamines and a lot more of a half life and cleaner, its meth. im having IV issues, that's all, not drug ID questions, Honey.

at this point, I was already smoking out of a pipe/lightbulb, all my shots did was give me the satisfaction of not wanting to smoke or snort any for a few hours...smoking 3 hits had me tweaked beyond words, snorting a bump had me tweaked for hours on end and more euphoric and less fiendish than smoking..ive been an amphetamine user for 15yrs as well, so don't tell me I didn't have crystal meth. I never IVed it in a sitting, I always IVed after smoking sessions and already high..i know it was methamphetamine anyways not cause im smart and been in the game for along time, because I found a left over Instant drug test, and for shits and giggles did it, and Meth-Amp sure indeed come up positive..i cant stress how many hits I could get out of a shard of ice the size of a matchhead, the oil just kept rolling and smoking with head..plenty for 3 people for a nice high each..so don't patronize me

oops bump. im in an obnoxious mood and on meth , unfortunately, do to my IV use, I have to use my neck If I want to get a nice fat vein, and when I use less water, its syrupy and thick, and I refuse to do that. too much water is more of a risk for me to miss during the injection, so I tried my best to gauge it, the only drug I been Iving in my neck is heroin, and that's only if I have to, I refuse to IV any stimulant in the neck, shouldn't even be Iving in the neck to begin with. im satisfied with smoking,  I love how a tiny little shard just fills the lightbulb continuously giving several hits if heated and rolled right...I do enjoy days when I can snort a tiny bump and feel very euphoric without and fiendish smoking effect..

I would really stop if you're hitting your neck vein


It's really not worth the added risks ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)


Have you tried looking for other viable veins in the forearms? You would be surprised how many good veins your arms might have (not everyone is blessed in this way though)

It's funny now that I think about meth... I used to think getting a point (1gm pt) and using it in 15 minutes was normal.. My last experience yesterday was 5 points in like 9 hours aha, all to myself (except for 500gms for my mate). I'm regretting it now, hearts a wee bit sore, muscles ache and had the slowest come down :/ thank god for cannabutter

Well I do put some space in there like 9 or so hours and I have been eating sleeping drinking but is it  bad if you tack smaller bumps every few hours don't really get the rush but the alertness can fell the come down after a few hours them tack a few little bumps like the size of your pinky nail?

**Random Good Advice**


I didn't think it was necessary to start a new thread for one piece of general advice (although invaluable, keeping a drug diary could save your life, I do the same) so I picked one at random, this one in particular because I'm an IV user of dextroamphetamine. I also take benzos (orally) as needed.

I would and often do inlcude notes on how I'm feeling (emotionally, mentally and physically) prior to dosing, any out-of-the-ordinary-effects noticed, mood / state of mind, if and what I've eaten, heart rate, what activity I'm engaged in etc. I'm not suggesting write a book every time you use but it's worth keeping a pencil and notepad handy, especially if you're using alone. I've found it helpful when say example I experience an unexpected reaction, I can look back over my notes and 99% of the time it's been worth it.

I literally just joined this page and tried meth for the first time this weekend and loved it.. I definitely have a bunch of questions.. I guess I was lucky because we had crystal that was really strong and barely needed anything to be blasted for my first.. I did inject it and I'm also a heroin IV user as well so it's time to put the two together here soon.. My friend tells me that snorting meth gets u much higher then shooting it and I'm curious to do it that way but don't know if maybe I'd have a better experience and time with speed balling instead and would like somebody's opinion on which one to do that has experience with both.. Also in don't know how much He to use in a speedball either and I do on average 3 to 6 bag shots depending on how good a day it's looking for me lol.. Feel free to comment and I apologize ahead of time if I pass anyone off because I've never been apart of these forums before..

I can't imagine snorting meth would get someone higher than slammin it even though I've never slammed it before. Snorting it is good though. When you snort it takes about 15-20 minutes for you to reach the peak high. It hurts too (the donkey kick) but you get to love that feeling after a while. I like to start my all my binges by snorting a fat line. For me there's nothing like gradually going from completely sober to being spun over the course of 20 minutes. After my first line I'll sit down and have a cigarette and watch youtube videos while I climbing a ladder to euphoria. Also, when you snort it the high lasts longer. At least I know it lasts longer than when you just smoke it. One time I saw a transexual on TV talking about the difference between having sex as a man and as a woman. He said that when he had sex as a man the raw pleasure was more intense but when he, or she, has sex as a woman the pleasure is less intense but way more sensual. That's how I like to think of the difference between snorting and smoking meth. Smoking is way more intense but snorting has it's unique benefits. Anyway, if you really want to experience meth you really have to try smoking it. You can really get into it. There's nothing more satisfying that chasing a puddle around and blowing out a HUGE cloud. I've heard that a lot of people who IV it also smoke just as much.

Hello! Recently after a shot of meth my heart rate will raise during the rush like usual but shortly after, for some reason while sitting my heart rate will be around 72 BPM.. Pretty damn low for someone who just shot meth, my heart doesn't even get that low after slamming heroin! 

But whenever I stand up to go do anything, even just standing in general, my heart spikes up to around 170 BPM! Really really fast.. Could this be a blood pressure issue? It's gotten to the point where I avoid standing up all together. I've even tried getting up reeeeeally slow to see if that made a difference! Didn't do shiz. If I stand up too long I'll get almost lightheaded.. 

What do you guys think?

My heart rate rarely ever seems to go up at all when I use meth. I've never measured it though and I only snort and smoke. Another weird thing with meth is my pupils never dilate. Ecstasy will dilate my pupils but meth never does it for some reason no matter how spun I get. After snorting a line I always immediately light a cigarette then pace the room back and fourth for for the next ten minutes. Then after that I'll be sitting down at my computer chair for the next fourteen hours beating off to porn and periodically taking hits from my pipe. During that time I rarely stand up at all. I always keep a huge empty water jug beside my computer chair to piss in whenever I binge.

It is very crazy.. I remember how much my heart used to race from any ROA with meth. 

     As for the cigarette I do EXACTLY the same thing! I love chain smoking when I'm real spun. 

     When I smoked crystal I would smoke allll day.. Which became difficult after moving in with someone whom would probably attack me if they found out. I recently started injecting meth and I love the fact that I can take a fat hit and not crave anymore for a good  6-7  hours. Plus the rush is just wow! Blows my head off. Definitely not for the faint of heart.. Pun intended. 

    I would never endorse anyone to inject however, as I found that once one gets into the habit of shooting they will not only shoot meth(or whatever drug they started slamming), I use it as an excuse to slam anything for a rush. The needle seems appropriate for anything now, like it's become an addiction itself. Noooo good that's for sure.. 


Sorry for the long post! Just my two cents

It would help me a lot if I could get a quick answer to this, I got work in 8 hours :/


Ok so,  I live in Perth, AU, I have obtained a half weight (500mgs) of ~80% purity, I know a mate and that was what he told me. Although nothing is an exact science with this stuff.


Long story short, I slammed 100mgs for my first time at 9pm yesterday (I've been smoking in a glass pipe for a little under a year) and I had a booster shot which really didn't do much, about 3 hours ago.


Haven't got my pipe on me at the mo. But I am up for the option to plug it (look past the gay Shit, were all adults here) I'm talking bang for your buck, at 98% BO it is probably the closest I'm gonna get to IV. So in saying that, anyone who is a lot more experienced with all these ROA's (Believe me I know about them too just unsure is all.) A little bit about me. I am 180cm tall and weigh around 70 kilos give or take a few kilos. I just turned 19 and my mate let me in on my first IV, it was amazing but I can't be shattered for work so if there's any advice about how much I should take rectally after my initial IV dose of 100mgs about 5 hours ago and my booster which was 10mgs about 3.5 hours ago.


Any help at all to help me get through 12 hours of being a chef tomorrow and possibly sleep tonight as I've been up for 24 hours now. Cheers in advance.

   Well, I can only share my personal experiences - That being said, I am an occasional user (1 - 4 times a month) and at this point I prefer to IV my highest tolerable dose that is still FUN!! (I'm not into fearing for my life!) With this route, I get an awesome rush, the warmth, the tingles everywhere - and then enjoy the energy and feeling up, etc - and coast down.  I very seldom take two shots on the same day!  Reading that you have re-dosed makes my personal experiences a little different, but I can say this - I started using by plugging, and it's my experience that I can plug the same amount as I can IV.  (first time I IVed I used 25% less though, just to be safe)  If you are looking to sleep tonight, I'd recommend using less, maybe even half??  Be very careful should you use this ROA.  The area is tender and scratches and nicks can become infected easily and quickly!  Use a lubricant and be sure your syringe doesn't have sharp edges.  Try to stay still and perhaps lay on your left side after administering for a few minutes.  I need to say congratulations on your open mindedness.  I have read countless threads of people trying to IV and really harming themselves because they are too close minded to try this ROA.  Hope this helps!  Enjoy! 8(

Well then bluelight, I have finally acquired meth. As a regular speed user and person with above average experience with drugs in general, what would be a good dosage? I was thinking of trying 40-50mg insulfated first and about that same dosage smoked another time, depending on how I liked it snorted. 


Erowid states a duration of 7 hours or so, but shouldn't meth take way longer than regular speed? That's what I thought. 


Last question: How is meth regarding serotonin release? Since I try to have long brakes between strong serotonergic drugs since I abused MDMA.

Dunno about serotonin, 50mg sounds like a good starting place for a single 8-10 hour dose for sure. Don't IV it.

I'm never IVing anything. I'm not an addict, nor do I want to become one. IV greatly increases that risk.

I just tried meth for the first time a few weeks ago and have done it a few times since then snorting, eating and smoking it ( I will never slam anything unless I live past 90, then fuck it) I have found that snorting and eating get me completely twacked out of my fucking mind after only using a little bit of it, which is I enjoy doing as long as I do not have to go anywhere for a 6 hours or so. However I really enjoy smoking it as well and have been just as folded in half from doing blasts out of my mookie. I enjoy smoking it much more because I feel like I can better control how high I am and I enjoy the whole process of carefully melting it and getting the temp just right so it doesn't burn and BLAST! Next thing you know you are MOOKIED THE FUCK OUT!

So I use to smoke meth 2 years ago, quit after I had a baby. Stupid decision that I did it again 3 months ago in November. I hit the pipe about 6 times and that was the last time I want to touch it. Ever since I did it that day I CANT sleep the same like I use to. I close my eyes and they keep twitching, I'll lie in bed for hours to fall asleep. I get about 5 hours of sleep because of it. I'm so tired but my eyes won't stop moving. Has anyone experienced this? Will it ever go away?? I tried smoking weed to help bit it does not help, I take benzos and everything I can think of to knock out but my eyes still mess with me.

I've tried it, snorted and I did not find it that much different from regular speed. It was a warmer, more natural feeling and I couldn't sleep for the next 24 hours. I don't get what all the hype is about. 


However, I am becoming ill now, so it did destroy my immune system. Yay!

Okay, so I've smoked meth for the first time and my throat now hurts. It feels as if it's either really dry or slightly burnt. What could've caused this? Heating too much? Inhaling too fast? (Drinking works for only one second or so)

Quite likely to be not hydrating yourself enough. Meth reduces saliva production and tends to dehydrate you in general. Add to this inhaling the chemical's vapor and it's pretty easy to irritate your throat. Try drinking water, juice, etc on the regular next time (if you didn't this time). 


Whenever I'm smoking it and I forget to drink enough fluids I always end up with a sore throat for a few days afterwards.

I'm in the NE and while I don't use meth, or any drugs, meth is here, and there is a demand for it but I think that there's more of a demand for opiates and cocaine.


Meth was all over here in the 70s, 80s, 90s, and very early 00s, and same with PCP; but I think there's just always been a demand for coke and heroin over both meth and PCP; but basically in the NE you can hypothetically find any drug you want.

True, adderall/dexedrine are not neurotoxic and you can control the dosage with them.  I never used meth since 5-15mg of dexedrine or adderall was enough, and I would fall asleep on it but I was prescribed it for ADD and haven't taken it for more than a decade.  I took it orally as prescribed, ate food while on it, stayed hydrated, and I never snorted it, IV'd it, plugged it, or vaporized it like people do.

Ive heard of shake n bake being made by a few people in certain rural areas of the NE. I was in rehab with a guy who was doing that he told me, and charging way too much for and he had people buying it up happily, he told me.

but i am rather certain that mexican methamphetamine isnt widely available in the NE.

and if someone had the cali connect and was bringing kilos and shit i bet you the price would be higher than what it goes for in the southwest/california, by a large margin, which kinda takes away from one of the characteristics that make it so popular out west-its very cheap.

i think i saw the price for a gram in nyc somewhere and iirc, if it was what i remember, you can buy an 8ball out west for the price of 1g in nyc.

the pcp comparison i dont understand. As far as i know, PCP/"wet" is available and sold in open air drug markets in a few large cities.

Ive met people from coatesville who used to smoke and they told me you gotts go to philly to get the good PCP, and it is sold similar to the way crack/heroin is sold on street corners.

PCP is a ghetto drug exclusively for the most part.

Crystal isnt really. I mean its sold by mexican gangs but it is most popular in suburban/rural areas allegedly.

PCP seems to be a regional thing. Like theres certain cities that have a PCP scene, but outside of those cities it isnt available.

or at least thats what ive been told.

It hits within 10 seconds. Best high ever. Your "stuck" for 1-2 minutes though. Meaning you can't really move or talk but you feel amazing.

Yeah you hear about people making it here in their houses, motel/hotel rooms, trailers, or in the woods, and getting caught.  You also hear about bikers selling it or some that make it and get busted.  I have no idea if it's "shake and bake" type or what type it is?


I do know people who tried meth that was called methedrine/crank in the late 60s, and through the 70s and early 80s who are on the west coast and they said how it was meth but not as strong or potent as the crystal meth they used in the 90s or 00s, but that people would take the lower grade crank orally, IV it, or sniff it, and not sniff, vaporize, or IV it like people do with meth.  Or if they took methedrine in pill form it was quasi-legal or available via prescription decades ago.

Nkay so ya just fucked up and left the tie on while shooting and 80% of a 3 point meth shot just leaked out into your fleshy flesh and all that caustic shit they make meth out of is totally fucking up your arm, now its swollen to the size of a huge egg, you have lost feeling to parts of your arm, it fucking hurts, and shit, no more dope.. or ya do who cares at this point you have become a health professional, GOT IT! I don't care if you just spent 2 grand on the fuckomator 6000 fucking machine and you were gonna see if you could take being gang raped for days after the shoot, its now just a memory, you are a doctor a nurse and the guy that roams the halls of the hospital. Point is if you will not go to the emergency room then YOU MUST now put all else aside and spend the next 24 hours caring for YOURSELF! You can mitigate the circumstance, it can be handled but understand this is serious you are now a doctor. It fucking sucks yes, but not nearly as much as loosing a limb, which IS a very real possibility. You will NOT shoot again to prove you can do it, NO MORE DOPE for you... party is OVER ! First we are going to try to dissipate the area with heat, soak the arm or area in warm water 20 minutes then a 10 min break, then 10 min ice pack.. or frozen peas whatever, then 20 min with area elevated no temperate conditioning. and REPEAT for the next 12 hours or so and hopefully in a few days it will just be a small hard lump the size of a pea, conversely if you do nothing , no fucking arm at all ~ and look if you think you may be somewhat intellectually incapacitated or deficient in any regard then forget IV drug use, do a search here on PLUGGING ! The effects are similar and you cannot get your ass amputated.//// i hope.

Leaving a tie on shouldnt make it somehow exit your vein and be a missed shot.

I dont understand how that would even happen.

I have seen people shoot heroin with the tie still tight many times and ive never heard of a shot that you hit correctly like leaking out of a vein.

i think whoever just doesnt know how to hit?

Sounds more like you hit an artery or something.

**Smoked a foil on my own the 1st time & have questions**


Just tried to smoke on my own for the first time, emulating what I've seen others do with foil, straw, & bic. 


I think I did okay, I got it smoking by gently waving the lighter under the bottom of the foil where the stuff was, and inhaled most of the smoke. And it did get me high, but here's what I'm asking:


1. I got less hits from the same amount I've seen others get more from. Why would that be?

2.  My stuff never rolled, only stayed in one place. Just sat there and smoked, turning from powder into liquid and burning up there... Again, why is that? 


Did I waste? Some quick tips would be great, wanna make the most outta the last I've got!

Too much heat, boiling it. You need to put the foil off its axis and change directions every so often to allow it to vaporize efficiently.

does anyone know if antibiotics which you shouldn't mix with alcohol is ok to mix with meth? would antibiotics affect meth use at all?


i have no idea how serious it is to not drink when on antibiotics with those warnings, but i always abide by it any way, it doesn't bother me that i can't drink for over a week, yeah it's enjoyable but not high on my list of fun activities. i'd miss my weeklyish meth binge though, but would forfeit that too (and not do other drugs either obviously) if there is a reason to abstain. i've heard many reasons why not to drink, biggest concern is it stops the antibiotics from working. or you get drunk quickly (hahahaha if this works with meth then it's a massive bonus), on the other hand if antibiotics decrease the effects of meth which it may well do since they can make you drowsy then i would stay the hell away rather than waste money, or the mix can cause serious problems which i don't quite remember but possibly liver damage or erratic breathing (but i dunno if that's just a very rare thing that may occur or a serious warning). any knowledge would be greatly appreciated.

There are all kinds of antibiotics, but to my knowledge typical antibiotics don't interact directly with methampetamine and vice versa. Although prudence and the tone of your post suggests you already know that avoiding methamphetamine while infected (the reason for the antibiotics) is a bad idea, since methamphetamine suppresses the immune system further.

thanks. the specific antibiotic is metronidazole. i've just been backpaid something i've been waiting for. if i wait i'll have lots to spend next week. i just dunno if i can wait. which has opened my eyes to the slippery slope of possible addiction again. i should refuse to buy any then and get on top of that.

People prep stimulants, meth in particular, much, much thicker than heroin. My shit creeps up the barrel. Have a tight tourni and be shooting gel, and that vein can blow. I've had a vein blow, but I've never had it all soak subcut.

Did you ever experience a sharp pain while injecting? I know my dog didn't miss. But when I began to push in it started stinging really bad. Any ideas? Clean equipment was used. Had been iv'ing days ahead too.

Sounds like you missed a little bit, i know it makes the spot sore as a mother fucker for afew. The pain and missing the shot will cause a lot of tweekers to clog their rig and for the next 15mins-?? watch them keep trying to stick them selves.


Or he hit an artery.


I cant fuck with the needle like i was did. People ask to many damn questions about trackmarks,and the whole wearing long tees in 100degree weather.

Damn that's one big crystal in the baggie. IME the size of the crystal doesn't necessarily indicate quality of product, though, as people have given me pretty big crystals before and they didn't quite do it like I thought they'd do. I don't know, meth is a funny thing to try and gauge just by looking at it, I've been underwhelmed by some really nice looking meth but other stuff I've gotten, thought "eh just another bag o' meth, who cares", and then afterwards thought "well I'll be darned, that's sum good meth right thar pardner!" Usually it seems to be smaller, clear crystals? But I dunno. Once someone gave me "powdery" meth, like crank-style shit I guess...ugh. That was bad meth. Don't do the powdery meth, kids.

**Question about IV Meth**


I have noticed that my upper arm muscle on the same arm that i inject on gets swollen I guess, like i have my muscle flexed but I dont. Its up above the injection site. Any guesses why this is happening? Could I be injecting into a blocked or collapsed vein?

^dude, there's no telling.  I.V. meth does some pretty weird things to your body and nervous system.

maybe you're flexing and not even realizing it?


maybe someone with more experience will be able to give you better advice.

My first IV experience was done by myself without ever seeing it done, just having it briefly explained by a coworker.. The first time I had no idea and feeling the get high or die mentality,  I put .7 grams of meth in the spoon... I had to try for a vein several times because like I said I had never done it before but once I hit it,, it MELTED MY FACE OFF.... coughed had to lie down cross eyed everything turned yellow then blue... it was ungodly and I've been chasing that for several years now.. don't get me wrong, I've caught it many times since then even flown way past it to the point of throwing up and thinking"yep, this is how they're gonna find me" at the same time heaven on earth/feeling like God himself for several hours.. and I agree sometimes the good clear big shards aren't how you think they'd be.. lots of times I've chosen the bags of shake and little pieces of glass over the bigger crystals.. just my 2cents

300mg of methamphetamine ingested is going to keep you high for a long time, 5 - 6 hours feeling good, and you'll come down for 3 or 4 hours, and want more.

taken orally, 8-12 hours at least, the "comedown" can be easily managed and if no further doses are taken, natual sleep and rest, as well as rehydriation etc is all that is needed.

after this time period, one needs to accept the fact that it is over for now.

any further doses would be a completely different issue, thread and shouldn't be discussed in a thread as this one.


the mediaction lasts that long (when taken orally in a single dose) end of story, rest and rejuvination should be the only thing on ones mind and it is a positive mindset to boot.


Hope this helps.


PS.. the snorting before taking it orally puts a whole different dilemma into the mix and my response is purely for a single oral dose.

**Meth price fluctuation question**


I have a question and I'm sorry if I'm not posting this exactly where I'm suppose to. I've been using bluelight for info for years but I've never posted. I've been using meth shard on and off for five years. I have a few people I do business with and I usually purchase 3.5g at a time. The price has always been pretty close to the same from 180 to 210. I have recently met someone new and he told me his goes for 80 for 3.5. Immediately I took that as a red flag and just figured he was full of it or was going to rip me off. A month went by and I couldn't take it anymore I had to see if he was legit. So I handed over my 80 that I was sure I would never see again. My jaw hit the floor when he came back with a tied bag full of large clear shard. It was 3.6 on the scale w/bag. I was at work so I snorted a little at lunch and it burned like hell. When I got home I smoked some. I don't know a lot about potency and cut but it was legit and felt pretty decent. Pupils were huge and had to take some allergy medicine to get to sleep maybe not the best sleep but somehow I've come to learn to be able to make myself sleep even though I'm wide awake. Has anyone else seen a huge drop in meth prices I'm just trying to understand how this person is selling it that low. Did a huge shipment get in and supply is much higher then demand. Or did I just get extremely lucky. I'm just trying to figure out why it was that price. If it helps I purchased in ga and the people this guy gets it from are Mexican. Not trying to stereotype lol but I was thinking that it had to be close to the source at those prices then I was like if it was I would think they would be wanting you to get more quantity then 3.5. Or should I stay away from this person. I would appreciate any thoughts you have.

Hi Im new here and believe I've read all the guidelines and have a question...I have a lump that is not a miss (not surface type swelling and there was no pain or burn, plus regestered several times) ...within a few minutes of the shot I felt a traveling pain go thru my shoulder (which has happened before) I took asprin and have been alternating heat/ice for a few hours which has not helped, there has been overall swelling that has occured since in my forearm....please keep in mind shot was administered in elbow the pain was above and now additional swelling is below....i also do have other prexsisting health issues that may complicate things....thank you

I haven't been shooting very long and I still mostly snort because I have a hard time with what several people who have hit me call "very weird veins". I can do a shot today and then 3 days from now try again and I might as well not even try. Take today, I wanted a shot to really get me started with all my last minute stuff and I cannot hit a vein to save my life. Just wondering about this, most of what I know is from a very unreliable source and I thought you guys would know much better.

Are your veins just difficult to see?


Some people are difficult to hit, girls especially because their arms tend to be less defined/veins less pronounced than a guy's arm. Luckily my own veins practically bulge out of my forearm and I can register instantly most of the time without using a tourniquet. If that wasn't the case I don't think I'd even IV because I hate going "exploring" with a rig, it's painful and I'm too impatient.

Hi guys, I might be able to get some "cold" as its called here quite soon and I have a simple question.


I'm open minded in trying new things, however, I HATE stimulant comedowns. I can't stand them, and the comedown is the real reason I don't do them (besides availability and other factors.)


If I have a line for my first time, how long can I expect it to last and will the re-dose temptation be high? Also - how bad might the comedown be? I'm trying to avoid benzos however I do have a mild opiate addiction which I'll need to feed (most likely when I'm coming down.)


Cheers

A line for a first timer? The actual high will probably last a few hours...2-3 hours, I'd estimate. The residual stimulation can often last quite a bit longer than that, though, esp. for people who are new to speed.


Meth isn't like cocaine...you can ride a line out for an hour (AT LEAST) without the desire to snort another line, IME. Which is good because lines of shard burn like the fire of Satan and enhanced productivity. It's much less fiendish as an ROA than smoking and was probably my favorite method of consuming the drug. IVing is awesome too but obviously I wouldn't recommend slamming that shit unless you're already on the needle. With that being said, the rush from IV shard is insane and I remember just whispering "HOLY SHIT" under my breath when I first tried it.


As far as comedowns go, couldn't tell you how bad it'll be because I don't think stimulant comedowns are that bad honestly, not even after I'd been up for days. If anything they're a relief because I can finally get some sleep (if I'm not too turnt up still). If you've got some heroin (or other opiate) around that'll definitely take the edge off it.

I just tried meth for the first time on the 1st, hell of a way to start my new years off, but yeah that's what it did to me I still got the body high. Finally got a couple hours sleep last night. I did shards they had a blue tint to them. 1/4 grm. But there's one thing I didn't get everyone that I know that uses it says that when they on it they have sex for hours. That it's the best feeling n so on. But when I tried to have sex with my wife like soon as I put it in it let off, if u get what I'm saying? Then we started again it did the same thing like not even 5 mind later. So we figured hell that's twice so it shouldn't happen again, then she gets it back right the best way she knows how n it goes off in her mouth. I wasn't expecting this at all. I figured I was Goin to go forever, like heroine does me, but with a way more intense feeling. Have you heard anything like this?

Hey man, being a user of over 30 years I can give you this much info. First, the best rush, by far, when your ears ring, your eyeballs literally vibrate in your head, the most intense body high imaginable, your joystick standing full tilt and discharging repeatedly all by itself (females often experience a female version of same) and this go's on for a good 25-45 minutes followed by some 12-18 hours of euphoria and energy to no end. Sex like never before. Clean house, fix cars, paint walls...whatever, your on it. Time is of no concern, and if you do the dope and don't let it do you, it's quite possible to get a lot of enjoyment out of it. Unfortunately the majority of people get in too deep and can't control it.


As a rule, I match the product to water, 1/4g in the spoon, add 25 units of water. Average quality product will increase in the spoon after mixed up. That 25 units will draw back up 35-50 units. Real good stuff will double, and had some P2P cranked that .01g with 10 units mixed up into 75 units of thick syrup that was bell running enough for 2.


I always try making sure I have a sex partner or a good project available when getting loaded and avoid public places. No way to hide being spun out. It's one of them things you can't stop once started so learn how to moderate and be safe. Once a week is a good area for me...Friday night lights.


On another note, missed shots can cause abscesses, smoking it has huge ill effects on teeth, always force yourself to eat and stay hydrated. If you can moderate yourself you may have a lifetime of high speed enjoyment ahead of you.

If it's pure stuff start with something around 10-20mg,if that's not enough try 30mg the next time and titrate yourself up till you find your sweet spot.

I was never in to doing gigantic shots of meth, I'd maybe backload crushed up crystals up to the 30cc mark and mix it with my black tar heroin. The thing about this drug is unless your using big veins you are are going to blow out your vascular system in no time. If you know how to hit your deep brachial that one will be able to tolerate the meth as long as you just don't overdo it and switch from side to side. I'd do the same thing with my deep femoral vein but I can't condone that on a harm reduction forum. Theres nothing as painful as missing a goofball into your femoral artery.

Really?? I've always noticed just the opposite about meth IV.  All the tweaks I know who've been shooting up for 15+ years - for the most part - still hit in the same places as a decade and a half ago.  I've never blown or collapsed or done anything more than (a doctor would probably call it serious) nerve damage where I hit almost every time, sometimes near a dozen times every 24 hours until I crashed - at that time I would go back to that spot around every 4-5 shots, or at least that's what I recall of the time...a lot of blurred memories..  So, back to my point, out of all the Heroin users I know, they ALL have fucked their vascular system to no bitter end and now some of them HAVE to hit in their femoral!  All the users I've known IV'ing both have as much damage as the H users.  


Now I know meth specifically causes vascular issues, and, yes, it's best to find the largest, most easily accessed, and most sure-fire location to not miss, as vasoconstriction (is that correct term?) is quite real, and very apparent.  Even more so when up for 8 days trying to hit - with at least god only knows how much still left un-metabolized in you - outside wondering why it's so god damned hot in the middle of the desert at 4AM?  It was probably the meth, cause it gets very cold out there at night.  


Anyways, I'm not saying it's not damaging and can't have SERIOUS/FATAL complications especially when attempting whilst uninformed.  I've just rarely seen a tweak who can't hit cause they collapsed their shit: the shakes, yes (quite often actually hah); the psychosis, yes; the vasoconstriction, absolutely!  That's all the tar users around here though, for sure (I should have been clear about that earlier - the Heroin users I spoke of used black tar exclusively).  I wouldn't suggest anyone attempt to hit ANY DEEP VEINS unless they have no other places to do so, being as they've already blown out every usable and sensible other place on their body.


I mean unless you really want to, then do what you'll do but research it first and I'd really avoid the femoral..  


Znegative, it sounds like you have experience and I'm not trying to sway you or bash your post or anything.  I just think in terms of Harm Reduction advising people to burrow (for me) an inch and a half or so into your flesh to barrel a gooey paste of future abscess within you, especially due to the artery right next to it, even if you don't get an abscess and miss the artery you can block that artery with a missed shot really fast!  I caused deep vein thrombosis (spelling?) in an ex of mine when I tried to hit next to an artery in her shoulder/chest area.  Her arms and neck and face were so big I thought she was gonna pop!  We were homeless at the time, no phone, in the middle of nowhere with a walk to the hospital at well over 10 miles.  We started walking and barely got a mile before the swelling went down and she was okay but I felt so god damned bad!  Which is another thing I noticed with meth, it seems to absorb real fast when I've missed, am I just really close to the vein with what was missed or is it like that for everyone?


There's a small book, almost like a pocketbook, that they used to give out at several needle exchanges out here and I have it somewhere but for the life of me can't remember where... it's called "Getting Off Right."  I've never personally checked google for it but it might be out there and it's VERY informative and EXTREMELY ACCURATE INFORMATION.  I was trained properly (after quite a long time of improper use) by a (ex) medical professional turned heroin addict for 9 years, had one maybe two bad veins, but overall in good shape when I knew her, other than the heavy H addiction.

no I wasn't advising it, I was just saying that IME and this could have been due to the quality of the methamphetamine or the cut they were using in oakland but many IV meth users were down to there jugular vein, and I actually think it's safer to use your femoral vein *IF* you know how to do so, I've only missed there or shot into the artery a handful of times (now granted that could kill you) and this was because I was being overly arrogant and shooting up in the dark ( I know very dumb, but 90% of the time I could hit with almost no light). Then again I'm 6 feet tall and 140lb now, and back then I was probably closer to 130 lb, what I'm getting at is I'm so thin I can hit my femoral vein with your standard insulin 28-29g insulin syringe, so it might be easier for me then for others. 


My whole view on the matter is that it's safer if you know how to do it (because once you know how to correctly hit your femoral which, like I said IMO easier than either the jugular or the brachial) when it comes to meth it's better to use larger veins (and I'm not just talking about deep veins, if you still have your ditch or veins in your arms and hands definitely go for those, I'm talking to people who like me were down to shooting up into the bottom of their feet or the little veins on top of their toes, or the ones that ride up your ribcage that blow before you even get a register) because you have less chance of slipping out and missing, which with meth is always painful and often can cause an abscess. That being said it's not something you try to teach yourself because the results could be incredibly damaging and even fatal, and you always use a new point, and if you have the capability (which I didn't) use a micron filter, or at least use a cotton, I know a lot of tweakers who backloaded the crystals which I am guilty of but it is an incredibly stupid and harmful thing to do.

You can IV anywhere you have a substantial enough vein to do the deed.. That being said I've heard a lot of people hide by hitting in hands (which i have no idea how they hide the tracks there but I've seen people do it with no readily visible marks), feet, crotch (VERY DANGEROUS AREA), chest/shoulders/armpit (more VERY DANGEROUS AREA'S) and in the thighs (as discussed in the previous posts, that's not somewhere people typically start - it's just too hard to find with no experience/a serious knowledge of vascular system. Also extremely dangerous..). Meth isn't usually skin popped or muscled due to its chemical makeup/cooking process(byproducts)/and the destructive nature of the drug (not to mention the excruciating pain associated with it entering anything other than directly into the blood stream) but, sadly, I've known people to do it.


If he has started i suggest you get the truth out of him and research research research as much as you can WITH him to help create "safe conditions" before some form of mishap. IV is an MOA that is NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART! OD is VERY REAL with this administration especially in comparison to smoking. As well as complications that result from missed shots, damaged veins (do NOT poke THROUGH the vein...soooo bad..), accidentally injecting into arteries can be a MAJOR issue ( the only time i did it was iv oxycontin into backside of forearm. I remember watching it automatically fill with frothy orange blood without having to pull back but i shot anyway and luckily all i had was a tingly hand for an hour or two. YOU CAN LOSE YOUR LIMBS LIKE THIS ON TOP OF MANY OTHER PROBLEMS - SOME FATAL), nerve damage, ( more) rapid kidney damage and lung damage (filters through lungs and heart before brain), risk of blood clots, stroke, abscesses (can become gangerous(spelling?) as well as when abscesses pop it floods the bacteria in them through the blood stream and to the brain which can kill you instantly (according to my Dr)), as well as cosmetic problems like scar tissue, bruising, "stretched" looking skin or "bumpy discolored rash" near injection sites (got a permanent rash like thing on my shoulder/upper arm from iv meth).


About the only positive aspect of IV meth, health-wise, is through a filter (a cotton - ordering micron filters is advised) it helps to clean the dope before it enters you. Street meth is still quite caustic and exceptionally bad for you no matter how pure or clean it is (can't comment on pharmaceutical grade). As far as a neutral aspect of IV meth, it's a 100% bioavailability - no waste. But that requires good knowledge of your body and your needs for dosage to utilize to its fullest.


My #1 advice would be to convince him to be honest if he's not already, and to not start doing it this way yourself. The needle is an addiction all in itself and I've found it's a much worse addiction to deal with than the drug. If you do start, maintain your body as best you can as it's really easy to go "overboard" like hitting more than you need to in a given amount of time. Also the stigma behind it could have even your dope fiend friends looking at you funny.


Just be careful and i hope for the best for both you and your husband. Chances are if he's doing it anywhere other than his arms he's been doing it a while, or whoever "trained" him began there. It's highly unusual for people with easily accessible locations in their arms to go anywhere else, especially considering the explosive pain that comes with missing this drug..

I started meth abt 3 months ago. I usually eat it or snort it. I have tried to smoke it but could see good enough to do it right. The first few times were fun. I had energy and motor mouth. If I had it I would eat a little every day. Then no more 2 weeks. Now have more still doing the same. Big deal, nothing,  is this tolerance?  If so how much should I go up on the amount. If I had any sense I would quit. Ps. I never had the euphoria. Thx

I never got any sort of  euphoria from eating it or drinking it.  With smoking it, it would sort a creep up on me and it was never really a rush but just sort of a warm sense of well-being . I also get so paranoid about burning it up, wasting it, or  wasting it, or  spilling it that I have trouble relaxing and enjoying it. Hot railing it gives you the combination of snorting and smoking it. That's pretty awesome. But hard to do in a pinch and on the go.

Meth-amphetamine is close to non-existing in Denmark. And the quality of amphetamines suck - in the last 10 years the average purity of seized amphetamine have been 5%.


I have never really understood the meth crisis you have in the state with all the cocaine flowing in from Mexico. You should think that cocaine would be more pure and cheaper in the US so close to the source compare to the distance cocaine has to travel to reach Denmark. And when it have been so popular and profiting product for drug-kingpins I do not understand why they haven't introduced it the to European market.  


As I have never tried meth, I would like some descriptions about its effects. I am thinking about trying to smoke it instead of crack cocaine. But from what I can understand, it is far more addictive than even crack. What is the reason for this? Is the euphoria so much better than crack? Is the high lasting longer? Is the long-term negative impacts of smoking meth smaller than for crack?


From what I can gather of information, meth is actually more expensive than crack in Europe when you compare one gram to one gram and also in larger quantities. Do you require less meth than crack to get high as the price is higher? I mean if 1 gram of meth could last an addict a day and 1 gram of crack only half a day I could understand the price difference. But it might just be in Europe that meth is more expensive? Is meth cheaper than crack in the US?

^ where I'm from, the amount of money you'd need to spend in order to stay high on methamphetamine for 2-3 days straight (with little to no tolerance, of course...) costs about as much as dinner for two at a medium-priced restaurant ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I've never smoked crack (which is almost non-existent where I live), but from what I understand, that same amount of money spent on crack would keep you high for...an hour or two maybe? lol. 


Meth is stronger and less expensive than crack. If you are new to methamphetamine and just snort 1 small line of some good shard, you will EASILY be high as a kite hours later...which is definitely not the case with cocaine.

My friends and I used to tease people who would use a drug and then say, "I got too high". "Wait a second, 'too high'? What does that even mean? That combination of words doesn't even make sense to me!" 


But if any drug has the potential to get you "too high", it has to be meth. Meth is so awesome that I can't do it anymore...fucking meth, it beat me at my own game!

Bo meth being stronger and worker longer can account for the high price in Europe. But how can meth be so expensive in Europe while it costs nothing in USA while the prices for cocaine is quite similar?

Here on Canada's west coast, meth - good crystal, not powder - is WAY cheaper, and *better quality *than any cocaine available here <snip>for a point (0.1 gram). Enough for rec users / novices to party all night (snorting), might need two points if smoking. Whereas a 40 bag of cocaine would last me *maybe *an hour.  But, like I said coke quality is awful here gen speaking. Probably b/c coke must be smuggled, while meth is probably being cooked right now just down the street from me, lol. Also (personal theory) cocaine is the DOC of the Rich & Famous (or was traditionally anyway), so maybe *t*has inflated price / kept quality down. Also, 1/10 gram of coke ain't gonna get ur *cat *high, but a point of meth, or down - BAM! Strange tho that no-one seems to Cooking in Copenhagen

For *me *crack has more addiction potential than meth, but only b/c the crash from crack is SO faaakin dismal, whereas I don't really get much of a meth crash (from smoking, which I find to have a mellower effect). Also, the crack crash comes on SO quickly - like what? 20 mins *maybe - *that all you're really doin is hitting that pipe - no conversation, no enjoyment of tunes. I find smoking meth with a group of people FAR more social, congenial, etc. Or, if I'm by myself, I'll smoke a couple bowls then go work, or write, or play guitar for a couple hours. **However, **I do have ADHD, so stims seem to affect me differently than others.

hot railing = heating a glass tube (usually a shattered oil burner/tweak pipe) with a blowtorch, then using the heated tube to snort a massive line of crystal meth. The heated end of the glass tube vaporizes the meth, so essentially you're inhaling methamphetamine vapor through your nose. Makes the insufflation process basically painless

**Severe PAIN after iv meth**


About 9 days ago did a shot and it was fine for 24 hrs then it got painful but there  wasn't any swelling or signs of infection as far as it being read are having drainage or fluid under it or even coming too ahead so I don't think it's an abscess and it still isn't swollen or have any of the symptoms but it hurts really bad after a few days of the pain I start noticing a crackling and popping sound and could even feel it when I slightly put pressure on the area did some research and so far I feel like it could be crepitus or a slight or minimal case of the process gas gangrene  which is fluid or gas for air under the subcutaneous soft tissue or muscle because it is it infected or have any infestations or anything other than those two symptoms I haven't went I've been trying to wait it out but it hasn't gotten worse and it hasn't gotten better has anyone ever had anything like this and if so what did you do 


Also  when I am not moving my arm in anyway or when I'm sleeping at night or not straining the muscles it doesn't hurt at all so like by the time I wake up so long as I'm not moving at all night it's not painful but the more I move it obviously the more it hurts

I just did meth for my first time today. My first bowl (right terminology?) was at like six o'clock this morning. And my second bowl (?) was at about eleven o'clock. 


My first impression is that it isn't as bad as people make it seem when they try to "warn" you. I like it so far, personally. I feel really like, well, I don't know how to explain it. It's like life is suddenly 4k Ultra rather than 720p. High def. Lmao lame metaphor, I know. Anyway. I also feel lighter on my feet. I haven't eaten all day which kind of surprised me. I'm not even hungry! And I feel like I can do anything I want and will be phenomenal at it. Though I'm positive that's the meth because my self confidence when I'm sober is nearly nonexistent. My heart is kinda going a bit fast and that's one thing I definitely don't like. I have heart issues so I'm going to have to take it easy in the future. 


My face is kinda red, too. And I feel hot. But my tower fan here in my bedroom makes it practically unnoticeable. ^_^


All in all? I don't see why some people (not here, of course) lose their shit over meth being the damned antichrist. Lol anywho, I can see myself doing this every couple months just for kicks. Next time I won't get so much. Besides, I'll have my oxy script to keep me preoccupied come Sunday. Oh, hey. That's tomorrow!


If anyone wants to give me tips or advice or wants to correct my terminology, that would be sweet. :*

I haven't been able to exactly find the answer to my question. What are the differing rushes, feelings, and effects from IVing meth. From small, medium , large, borderline overdose, and when someone should seek medical attention. Thanks!

I eat meth (no re-dose)  no more than once a week and the one time I tried snorting I didn't feel shit. Maybe I just  have bad technique since I'm not a snorter. I'd like to try plugging sometime but I'm usually constipated. I think my ideal would be eat my normal dose and smoke to kick start it.

^ have you ever freebased it? Just out of pure curiosity?


If not, you could try placing a small amount on some foil (emphasis on "small amount" if all you're looking for is a "kick start") after you already eaten the majority of it


I quit meth but there really is no substitute for the needle IMO. Horrible, I know. Although I've never tried plugging and have heard high praise regarding that ROA...something like 99% bioavailability or something like that? IDK. All of the ROAs for methamphetamine have high BAs except for oral consumption, IIRC.

You should think that cocaine would be more pure and cheaper in the US so close to the source compare to the distance cocaine has to travel to reach Denmark.

Pardon my noobness but what do you mean by freebase it? I've smoked meth (my first time) only once just over 3 years ago so I know the effects are more pleasurable but far shorter lasting. I've plugged Adderall before and found it stronger and more enjoyable than oral but I couldn't do it before work because for the next 45-60 minutes I'm clinching my butt cheeks together to keep from shitting myself and wasting it. lol


I don't do needles but if I were to go down that road it would be for morphine  and/or the morphones not meth. Seeing what meth is made with  I don't think I could. I would feel more comfortable shooting properly prepped pills which is bad enough.

"Chase" it on an aluminum foil with a lighter and straw. Essentially the same way that heroin is smoked.


It's just an easy way to smoke meth without using a sketchy piece of drug paraphernalia (an oil burner/"meth pipe"...the mere possession of which constitutes a felony where I'm from...)

Exactly! But I don't know about this anymore. Am I coming down already? It's been roughly 6 hours almost 7. But all of a sudden I'm just really sore and I'm actually hungry. Not starving, but like..mildly peckish? And a lady shouldn't say this, but it's for science! I have to use the bathroom a lot suddenly. 


I don't want to crash yet. I don't have my 20mg oxys til tomorrow... And I read that coming down off this hurts if you don't have opiates or maybe even Xanax or something?

Does it run like heroin or mostly stay in one place? 


Yeah it's a felony here as well  or at least that's what the guy that picks up mine has told me. After watching  many COPS episodes I wonder if the felony charge  is  from the meth residue in the pipe?

^ yeah, the "crackback" in the pipe I guess. Technically constitutes possession of a controlled substance. Learned that from an episode of "Alaska State Troopers" 8)![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


It does run...it becomes a clear liquid, though, so it's difficult to see on foil. It recrystallizes immediately on the foil once heat is withdrawn, though, unlike smoking out of a pipe in which the product will sometimes continue to burn even after heat has been withdrawn (there are a million tweaker theories about the "proper way" to smoke a meth pipe, which I will mercifully not go into in this post). You have to be careful with keeping the foil level, though, as meth doesn't "tack" to foil like heroin does and will sometimes fall off the surface if jarred...and trust me, you don't want to go surfing for a piece of half-melted meth on the floor ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Now what about Mucana Pruriens.. the supplement that helps restore dopamine. If I relapsed and binged for a month and a half and I've been clean for almost 2 and a half weeks but still lethargic due to only being able to sleep 5-7 hours of sleep sometimes less because of working full time.. what can you do to speed things up as far as recovery and lethargy! I didn't do it everyday for a month but almost.. maybe 4-5 times a week for a month and a half. I just want to know what I can do to speed things up and I heard about Mucana Pruriens helping restore that lost dopamine from the meth use. I can't stay lethargic like this I'll get fired! And I won't go back to that shit.. it was a mistake relapsing in the first place! Coffee sucks.. Modafinil sucks.. being employed is great but not when you can't sleep this shit off for a whole month and then some lol what should I do?

yeah throw up crocodile.  it sucks, but feeling like your going to throw up is because your body wants something out of it that you put in it aka meth.  If your body needs some of it out let it out, its not doing it for shits n gigs.

I  ended up getting a glass pipe and switched over but what I don't understand why I don't get high from it? I get all the other amphetamine effects but no euphoria, possible undiagnosed ADD? Or do you think it's possible that my kratom/opioid use over the last few years along with daily weed, benzos and pregabalin have downgraded my  brain to the point of no return? I don't binge when I do it and have 7 days in between use.

To start with - my thanks to all of you who have participated in this  mega-thread.  This is a priceless resource that you have all come  together to create.  I have read a lot about missed shots, abscess,  hitting nerves, etc.  I have seen many people asking for help with  bruising, discoloration, pain etc.  Something that has always helped me  is Arnica cream or gel, applied liberally to the area about 3 or 4 times  a day.  I usually buy it at a local health food store but recently saw  it being sold at Target.  Med spas tend to recommend it for use after  injectable cosmetics  and fillers to shorten the healing time as well as  lessen the bruising, swelling and pain. I've had great success with it  for bruises, pain and also with a slightly missed shot  -* but please,  take it seriously when I say always use hygienic practices and Arnica  gel / cream should NEVER EVER be used as a substitute for medical care  for abscesses or any suspected infection or injury.* I hope this may  prove helpful.  Stay safe!

Hi, Thank you for sharing about your experience with meth. I could move your post if you like to a specific drug section. I used meth for a long time... but long ago. 


Anyways, great to have you aboard - welcome to the site!  I bet you will have a lot to contribute.


Best,

> 			ok so Im new here and im not sure where to post this so let me know. ill go ahead and make the post to save time and move it later. I have looked on this site numerous times when I had questions about drugs particularly about injecting crystal meth. its uselessly a question about the dangers of doing something really stupid like a syringe mixed with your blood and a full hit of meth can sit before you shouldn't use it. normally the answers are people laughing at the idea or acting like they themselves would never do something so low and stupid. while these answers are correct they dont really help the people that are seriously thinking about doing it. so I have shot meth for about 3 years doing .20 -.40 a day 2 injections a day give or take. I have done every stupid thing you can think of except shearing needs. answer to the question referenced above extremely dangerous the blood in syringe is now cloted and could easily clot ur vein and kill u. but I am very healthy no blood vein issues in past plus im abnormally resistant to a number of things that would easily harm most. I did it without a problem. I've used the same insulin syringe for over a month, used huge Gage 20 needles, ive missed shots and had huge lump then shot through the lump from lack of finding another vein successfuly, put water into pipe with smoked meth drawn it up and shot it successfully you name it. I have NEVER had an infection,mind you like I said im abnormally resistant to these things. you could sow up a dead cat in me and I'd be fine. now im ready to endure countless replys say a-to-z about how stupid I am and you would be right. but we have to realize is a fiend is going to get high one way or another no mater what. harm prevention is my angle and its hard to argue that shooting cloted blood and pipe residue in ur vein is harm prevention but I did it all anyway. if anyone has questions about iv meth message me. ill tell you how incredibly dangerous it is but not hype it over the top. if your still thinking about doing it ill help u do an unsafe thing as safely as possible. harm prevention. thank you.

ok cool cuz I did that a few times when I shot up oxy but I didnt filter it so when I went to the hospital the anaesthesia guy wanted to give me an injection couldn't find a damn vein on my arm. He was like "WHERE ARE UR VEINS???" Well it took him a couple mins to find one. Lol. 


Did u burst a lot of veins?


Does anyone know if veins can grow back?

well I've heard busting a vein is really painful so im not sure if I have. I really don't understand how it pops, if u miss its not in vein its in muscle tissue or under skin which burns pretty good. if you are in vein ur good seems like you'd have to smash the plunger down extremely hard and fast to pop vein am I right?? but a collapsed vein/ popped vein will never grow back.

No it's not unless the needle is real dull and you hook it that is give it a little pull


Veins don't grow back but other veins take over vascular function and swell this will make it seem like new veins pop up...

Some people say it has more to do with the dental hygeine of the user than the methamp itself. Although some cuts/different synthesis(especially improper synthesis leaving behind nasty shit) used in different batches could definitely make some product alot worse than others.

this will probably sound like bs but it will work for you. I shoot meth every day I can but sometimes im out its Tuesday and I have 4 more 12 hour days at work. I mow lawns id sleep in the truck between stops sometimes as little as 4 - 5 min which makes for a terrible day and all week sux. my boss gave me a pill one day and I knew it was some kind of thing for either energy or vitamins. ive tryed energy drinks /shots, caffeine pills, nodoze, vitamins nothing has ever effected me in the least,even years before drugs they did nothing. this worked I wasn't wired I wasn't jittery I was just... normal. good mood energy, its great. they are xm extreme morning caps. daytime weight management brand zija there meal supplement pills. now if I had read this post in the past id laugh at it, there's no way a meal supplement could work all day great with no side effects. just give it a try. I thoght as long as I use meth when im out ill be calling in once a week and hating work forever but im good now

If I relapsed and binged for a month and a half and I've been clean for almost 2 and a half weeks but still lethargic due to only being able to sleep 5-7 hours of sleep sometimes less because of working full time.. what can you do to speed things up as far as recovery and lethargy! I didn't do it everyday for a month but almost.. maybe 4-5 times a week for a month and a half. I just want to know what I can do to speed things up and I heard about Mucana Pruriens helping restore that lost dopamine from the meth use. I can't stay lethargic like this I'll get fired! And I won't go back to that shit.. it was a mistake relapsing in the first place! Coffee sucks.. Modafinil sucks.. being employed is great but not when you can't sleep this shit off for a whole month and then some lol what should I do?

I have looked on this site numerous times when I had questions about drugs particularly about injecting crystal meth. its uselessly a question about the dangers of doing something really stupid like a syringe mixed with your blood and a full hit of meth can sit before you shouldn't use it. normally the answers are people laughing at the idea or acting like they themselves would never do something so low and stupid. while these answers are correct they dont really help the people that are seriously thinking about doing it. so I have shot meth for about 3 years doing .20 -.40 a day 2 injections a day give or take. I have done every stupid thing you can think of except shearing needs. answer to the question referenced above extremely dangerous the blood in syringe is now cloted and could easily clot ur vein and kill u. but I am very healthy no blood vein issues in past plus im abnormally resistant to a number of things that would easily harm most. I did it without a problem. I've used the same insulin syringe for over a month, used huge Gage 20 needles, ive missed shots and had huge lump then shot through the lump from lack of finding another vein successfuly, put water into pipe with smoked meth drawn it up and shot it successfully you name it. I have NEVER had an infection,mind you like I said im abnormally resistant to these things. you could sow up a dead cat in me and I'd be fine. now im ready to endure countless replys say a-to-z about how stupid I am and you would be right. but we have to realize is a fiend is going to get high one way or another no mater what. harm prevention is my angle and its hard to argue that shooting cloted blood and pipe residue in ur vein is harm prevention but I did it all anyway. if anyone has questions about iv meth message me. ill tell you how incredibly dangerous it is but not hype it over the top. if your still thinking about doing it ill help u do an unsafe thing as safely as possible. harm prevention. thank you.

If you give a good reason to your immune system to protect you, it will. I'm like that, I really believe the immune system is greatly increased by pleasure, or at least following pleasure sessions. Depressed people who are always in a bad mood always tend to be the weakest prey to infections and disease. They got all kinds of disease I've never even heard of! I'm like jees, I take Dexedrine and don't give a fuck, that's the attitude, didn't get a cold in 3 years.

^yes I should be dead from everything but shame and guilt will be the things that kill an empathetic meth user.


To those trying to deal with track marks and what not - fellas, you're not a real meth head until you carry a make up kit, namely concealer..... Once you know your colour you are at the top of the bottom rung.

The way people your family is disappointed in you and start crying when they look at your meth face has many features in common with mental retardation, because it is in mental retards that we observe overwhelming emotional response for no good reason. Then they say that they care about you and they hate to see you like that. Their problem is, the "*you*" that they want, you don't want it, and the "*like that*" that they notice is actually the real you. So they've been caring about the wrong person all along. They're so scared by who you really are, that they want the fake you to take over again. You can only experience true pleasure when you are your pure self 100%, being somebody else is not rewarding even if others like you.


The way we act in society, our good manners, our gestures and polite facial expressions, are all acquired or learned, it is not an expression from within. Sometimes we imitate an actor we saw in a movie, sometimes we use a cool expression our friend used, and when we piece it all together, we get the "sober" you, who is not you, in fact it's someone that has nothing to do with you. The only thing that has to do with you it's the pleasure you feel when you're truly you. Truly you means not smiling, not looking in the eye, not talking to anyone, and being obsessed with that which fuels the fire within. Can you imagine? 20 years of your life you dedicated towards learning not to be yourself. Then you take meth and you forget how not to be yourself. Big problem. Lol.


There is no solution to this, if it's your family, care about them and don't see then when you're on meth, others, just tell them to go fuck themselves seriously. They ask you why you don't smile, if you're ok...fuck you! Give them some pornographic insults. Suck my dick. Tell them all about it. You shouldn't waste time with them, they're not worth it.

Well, if a baby is left in the forest immediately after being born, is taken care of and grows around a pack of wolves, and grows into an adult with the animals, then you take that human and place him in society he will never adapt. He will always be an animal and will be no different from a dog or a cat. It's a funny trip this life I admit it. I always regard amphetamine trips as an awakening to what truly is, as opposed to what we were told or shown. The habits go away because they were induced that's why meth users have a wild appearance, to people who don't understand meth.


Now, everyone has something different in their nucleus accumbens. When you pay a trip in that region, what you find varies from person to person, for example, pedophiles find children, foot fetishists find feet, etc. So it does change. But what you find there is TRUTH. It's so true that we can't even put "the" in front of it and say it's the truth, no, it's TRUTH. It's more true that 2 + 2 = 4, because it feels true, it feels really good, truth feels amazing. When you write 2 + 2 = 4 on a paper, you feel a small reward but nothing much, so it will always be a lesser truth than the real TRUTH within.


It's always like that, the more true it is the more amazing it feels. If it makes you feel bad, it will never be the truth no matter what it is and how logical it might seem. Humans are experts at uplifting banalities to a rank greater than themselves. They will say "I fight for this cause because it's greater than myself" even if doing so brings them trouble. That is because they are copy cats, they saw their parents fight and so they fight, did they come up with it...no, what's their merit...zero, is it their truth...no, is it yours or mine...no, It's nobody's truth. They are simply idiotic. Truth can only be found within, and if you find it you will know it because you will feel great pleasure, so you won't have to wonder "huh...what? did I find it..hmm...I did...wait..did I?" It's not like that, it's super obvious because it feels amazing. 


You know, idiots climbing mount Everest to fight for a cause or become an example of perseverance to inspire young generations (to become as idiotic as they are). That mountain...is a tomb. You find dead bodies everywhere. Mount Everest is a symbol of humanity's inability to find inner truth. They go there seeking truth and they die without finding it, because truth is not on mount Everest, it's not on Mars, it's close-by, it's in the brain. It's such a simple concept and yet no one understands it.

^That's another popular misconception, that there is something wrong with dying. We're so hung up on it that we made suicide a crime, having some control over your own death is surely a great freedom. Because we fear it, it has to be wrong.


My father never got to climb Everest but he and his mates pioneered many of the climbs available today in Australia back in the late 60's and 70's - if you are climbing especially ice climbing and it's Everest - you probably will die if you are doing it for anyone else other than yourself. I think climbing Everest has become normalized in many folks minds and their inexperience and attitude towards it is killing them....how many times have I heard or read Sherpa's saying they were ignored, the guy wouldn't listen to the warnings we gave them. Many Sherpa's have died trying to save the idiotic would be climbers who probably are climbing for a perceived glory and lost sight of the basics like gravity, the cold and altitude which all effect the untrained mind. It's not something you rush, it's not for everybody. Solo climbing (sans rope) especially, will make you a better climber with rope, will make you know what and who you are. You don't focus your mind on anything other than that next hand hold or foot position.


Big wave and/or "tow-in" surfing is much the same your just looking at the nose of your board making sure it doesn't bite, maximum concentration. All extreme sports - the definition being - a mistake could kill you. Drug use is an extreme sport. However, in all these sports including drug use (high dose IV use mostly) you can train yourself, you must gain experience, practise makes perfect and harm reduction is the only way to have even medium term longevity in any of these games we play.....to those who don't play we appear crazy or insane because they do not truly know the risks whereas those that do play and have done so for a while, they have become "Risk Technicians". You can die on your first try but you don't have to, a death under those circumstances seems senseless and unnecessary but people should have the right to die anyway they do and be buried or burnt for free.


Decriminalisation, legalisation of drugs are steps in the right direction if we want harm reduction and self responsibility to be common sense, common sense and rationality become victims when we use irrationality and nonsensical laws to combat our issues. But one thing I have learned over the years is we must allow each other to find ourselves even if you have the absolute truth in our hands, forcing someone to accept it as truth is as fascist as any other ideal......you don't want people agreeing with you cos everyone else does or because of any other reason than they do. I hope to teach my son to think, not how to think, but to think and become his own man. Our actions do affect those around us, we are emotional beings which at times means we will be irrational act like we have a death wish or appear to be idiots. I've done everything the hard way in my life, gosh knows why, I don't like being in pain or sad but I sure have become an expert. What was the question again?lol

Humans are experts at uplifting banalities to a rank greater than themselves. They will say "I fight for this cause because it's greater than myself" even if doing so brings them trouble. That is because they are copy cats, they saw their parents fight and so they fight, did they come up with it...no, what's their merit...zero, is it their truth...no, is it yours or mine...no, It's nobody's truth. They are simply idiotic. Truth can only be found within, and if you find it you will know it because you will feel great pleasure, so you won't have to wonder "huh...what? did I find it..hmm...I did...wait..did I?" It's not like that, it's super obvious because it feels amazing.

It's such a simple concept and yet no one understands it.

If truth is merely an individual's subjective interpretation of their own mental state (and, specifically, the positive mental state they receive when they're enjoying a pleasurable experience), then I don't see why climbing Everest or any other activity you care to name, including indulging in the most base and mundane aspects of mainstream culture & society, is not also "truth". It makes you happy? OK, that's the truth then. Everything from climbing Everest to sitting on your ass eating Fritos and watching reality television to pleasuring yourself while looking at foot fetish porn (if that's your thing) If you're a pedophile then sexually abusing children is your truth. Et cetera.


That seems like a somewhat loose interpretation of the word "truth", which tends to have a more objective character IMO, but that seems to be how I'm understanding your argument. 


There are certain aspects of what you're saying that I do somewhat agree with, such as a person's loved ones being concerned about their drug use. There is an element of selfishness involved in that. even if it comes from a place of love and caring. But I'd rather it be that way then everyone just be totally aloof in regards to my choices, because sometimes I make poor decisions, you know?

Last Night was the fourth time I have ever been injected with meth, or anything other drug for that matter. My veins have always been tricky to find, even by phlebotomists and nurses. A fellow user (who used to be a nurse tried injecting my arms several times last night, to no success. She then went in the vein which rests right below where my thumb and my first finger meet. I was wearing a ring on that thumb when this happened. She was only able to inject a little but I don't think she missed the shot. She just could not register and my thumb went numb. Knowing that my hands were swelling I took the ring off immediately which was on that dumb. Today, the vein which goes right under wear that ring used to be hurts if I barely touch it and appears to be more swollen than before. I have only ever let her inject my arms and hands but after last night, I got in the shower, looked down and found what appears to be internal bleeding right under the skin of my mons pubis. Again, I have never injected in my groin or anywhere near there and have no idea where this huge dark bruise has come from; it appears like there is a line of blood bleeding under my skin. I am new to blue light so excuse me if I'm not using the proper protocol but I'm scared shitless that this bruise has something to do with her methods last night. The other time she stuck me before last night, she always registered and things went great. Last night, when she had that needle in the place below my thumb, she kept digging and then flicking the rig over and over. I'm sure that the thumb going numb means she hit a nerve. My question I guess is what the fuck is happening to me? This new bruise on my mons is not hot to the touch and barely sore but it appeared literally out of nowhere. Is it possible to be injected in the hand and then have a bruise appear somewhere totally different? What should I do? Please, The quicker y'all can get back to me the better because I have school first thing in the morning. My username on blue light is cydiachick. Add an @gmail.com and please someone email me quickly; I'm freaking out. I flushed the rest of my shit down the toilet last night and I'm never putting or letting someone put a needle in my skin again. I can't believe I was so stupid. One thing I do want to add is that all of the proper harm reduction techniques were employed during administration of injections. The only thing i shouldn't have done was to reuse an old needle. Why am I bruising down by my groin if I haven't bumped it on anything and certainly never injected down there? HELP

hi I wouldn't be to worried about the groin bruise. the chances of injecting on ur hand and the groin bruise being related are very small. yes you probably hit a nerve or possibly Injected into an artery by mistake. as long as the swelling/ numbness go's away in a couple days you should be fine.

I have a question. Im unable to easily access insulin syringes, I live in texas, strict strict strict, and no exchange programs period. so im using a 3 cc syringe with a 22 gage needle smallest tractor supply carries. my wife is attached to my hip 24/7  and knows I've used before so I've been using the same syringe and needle for 3-4 weeks. suddenly I cant seem to register in any location lower arm upper arm hand foot, and as a result have missed several shots. however I've now discovered it's not from me not being able to find a vein but a cloged needle/ worn out equipment of some sort.  I.just finished a shot and surprisingly had a fat vein bulging and most obviously was in it. when I pushed on plunger, no register, there was no burn no pain and after shot absolutely no bump and I got my regular great rush. the syringe is one of those twist on kind. I seem to.have good suction because drawing up water is very easy but can not get a register from vein. I've filled it up with water several times and blasted it out, I've sucked up rubbing alcohol and blasted it out even got sewing needle and stuck it in back side of needle to open hole still nothing what can I do to get it to register. I know I need to just get a new one but until then im gonna do meth and possibly miss help

here is a trick I used to use when I couldn't inject and register one handed. id always pull or slip out of the vein when trying to register. get a key ring loop by it's self and before mixing shot put the end of the plunger in it like a key but leave it wedged inside the ring now you can sick ur self holding the syringe beetween ur thumb and middle/ring finger, and have pointer finger inside loop easily pulling back and pushing in easily

How long does the dry mouth last after usage? Throat is extremely dry even when chewing gum, and hard to swallow. 1st time using in over a year, 2nd time this week. Scared the dry mouth might be permanent because nothing is helping and it's been hours.

You' all have dry mouth the entire time you're high, although it'll be alleviated some if you make sure to drink plenty of water.  So 12 hrs, plus if you don't keep hydrated while high, you're mouth will stay dry afterwards until you drink enough to rehydrate.


It's not something that can become permanent though, so no worries there.

My rule of thumb has always been that if you can't properly register / IV then you're too high and don't need another shot yet anyway

I can tolerate the effect of methamphetamine way easier then my last addiction to MDPV. its way harder to psychosis on meth. I still to this day believe MDPV is magickal or sentient in some way, but I cannot do mdpv any more and no longer have access to it. 


I find MDPV was alot more interesting then methamphetamine. I truely miss it even though one single dose will instantly bring back the dreaded psychosis i lost 4 years of my life to.

**Best kept secret!! (vaping meth)**


howdy,


so I've been vaping meth with my kanger tech drip mod for a few months now and I can honestly say this is a GAME CHANGER


I pretty much crush it up, put in in my e-juice, shake it up and let it sit until its completely diffused. I then soak the cotton with the juice & vape like normal. If I'm in a rush or just wanna vape a bit, I drop the meth directly on the coil and vape like normal :]

I definitely get a rush similar to when using the pipe, with a calming effect from the nicotine. The meth vapor is definitely more thick & dense but remains odorless ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

*

I find this ROA to be very efficient & discreet but VERY uncommon even though its quite impressive.*


Is vaping meth some sort of "best kept secret"? After discovering this way of usage I threw out my pipe and have been vaping ever since. Its so discreet its scary (increased potential for addiction?).


There are few threads on vaping meth and even within those threads their are conflicting opinions on the effectiveness.

What are your opinions on vaping meth? Experiences?

 Meth is always vaped, even through a pipe or on foil, it's vaporization that takes place, so it's really no different through a vaporizer.

Obviously vaping with a pipe is the same as vaping with a drip mod so the effect will be the same if not similar, but the INCEASED amount of stealth and discretion by vaping is pretty intriguing & I wonder if it"ll lead to increased need to unecessarily redosing. Therefore being more unhealthy in the long run...

Drop a little piece in the bulb..do not APPLY flame under bulb, the trick is heat so it vaporizes, as it's melting,  till the bulb to spread it out as it oils up, you will see smoke form in bulb, I usually put a straw at the top and suck in smoke,  you don't need constant heat under it as it snokes pretty fast....practice makes perfect

First off don't use it, if u are I would recommend a ucaliptice water inhaler (5-10$ most smoke shops have them) if you can't find that....Get a viks methol vapor wall plug in, take it apart and the middle glass piece will work good. Whatever your using be sure to remove heat once it becomes a liquid and slowly spin your apparatus  (so as not to burn your product) a wet cloth will help this too, after you take a hit cool the apparatus will help save product.

**The biggest mistakes I made when starting (how to smoke)**


Okay not really trying to start this whole thing again, but there's two super important things I never got right when it comes to getting good hits with as little burn as possible when starting. No one personally ever told me any of it (with enough nuance to let it really sink in), nor did I ever see anyone really mention the importance of these things on any 'how to burn the oil' threads. I'm going to skip through all of what I see as the more simple, and easy tasks of burning the oil- because again, most of that has been thoroughly gone through.


  The first is rolling the pipe, no one ever seems to add enough detail here. I was always told to chase the oil, which is true. But when you're smoking it can be rather difficult to note how fast it's moving, especially considering not everyone's oil is always consistent. I noticed it's better to find a set speed . Assuming you are smoking at least decent oil, roll it quickly! Preferably to the middle of each side of the bulb, with just slight improvisation depending on the size of the load and bulb. Everyone always said to roll it, but never said how fast. The second I started rolling it fast when it was fully melted, I finally started noticing the massive cloud build ups, I just never knew why I would get them sometimes, and sometimes not. Before, I wasn't chasing it well enough, so the vapor coming off the oil was (my guess here, not a damn scientist) going poof due not to too much heat on the bulb, but too much heat on the bulb too close to the oil. But I never knew this was a problem of how I was smoking, because hey, roll it they said! And I did...


  Lastly, sucking the oil vapor. Again, a little dependent on the size of the load. If you have a fairly small bowl, and are seeing absolutely giant clouds, you're sucking in too lightly- suck in a little harder for a better hit, the super tiny particles of vapor shouldn't be living in such a hot environment with so little room to breathe. If you have a large load, and are seeing tiny clouds, then you can suck in more lightly to get a better hit. 


  Anywho, in my experience, these were the two biggest mistakes I made, and never seemed to get a detailed explanation of from anyone. Not sure how it is for anyone else when it comes to what they had trouble with learning at the start, I do wonder if anyone else had this issue when starting, everyone I came across seemed so dull and rushed in their teachings.

A thread about smoking methamphetamine that doesn't read like it was obviously written while tweaking. Neat... Kind of a rare treat I suppose.


I doubt this thread can survive here on its own considering our focus is solely on harm reduction and smoking tips don't really fit the bill. Maybe it can be moved to the methamphetamine megathread.

A little (funny?) story, not sure if it belongs here?


snorted some meth, ate some opium. Went to cinema. Felt a bit funny on transport, monitoring my pulse and my left foot and arm a bit numb/tingly as well as a tight chest. 


got to cinema - told them "I've been suffering vertigo and dizzyness, in case something happens just need to let you know"


sat down to watch the film. 


3 dudes at the back keep whispering. This is probably my number one hate in the world ever, it will make me angry for days afterwards if it doesn't stop (1st world problems). I'm a film guy, studied it, love it, critique it, etc. 


For the first time in my life I stood up and asked them to stop whispering - ASKED them. No confrontation. In some ways, that was a major breakthrough for me, except....


My heart rate went so sky high I felt like I was gonna have a heart attack, chest pain, left leg and arm felt more weird. Hot, sweaty, disoriented. The guys didn't stop talking either. I realised I had to get out, couldn't even bring myself to say anything to them on the way out in case it pushed my heart over the edge. Almost wanted to collapse in front of them, just to punish them ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Told the cinema staff, sat down did some deep breathing, got a refund, left. 


Called up drugs helpline, then was forwarded to non emergency services for a chat, then was persuaded to get picked up in an ambulance. I did ask them to just give me some advice and let me sit with it for a bit. 


Get to A&E - get ECG, blood pressure, all the works. The meth wore off, the opium still going strong, the chest pain goes and all I want to do is fall asleep. To literally take a bed for the sake of comfort in a hospital where people are on the edge of death and in desperate need.


ECG normal, everything normal, chest pain gone..... blank faced nurse gets me to sign myself out before the doctor came, she was very unimpressed.


Turns out I was just having a panic attack cos I was so scared to confront those dudes in the cinema. 


EDIT: and I will never even know if they were actually talking over the film or I was imagining it....


True story


Don't do meth kids (or just don't go cinema)

Basically when you have to explain to people who are experienced in this field that "those people don't exist." and go the fuck asleep after everytime they do it, you realize the only answer is just say no.

I may have an infection or blockage in my hand. It's painful and swollen. I've been applying cold/warm, elevating , taken anti inflammatory and begun a course of antibiotics now that it appears to be related to my meth use. I thought it was a sprain initially.

    I am mortified at the thought of going in/being exposed. I only have my imagination being fairly new to this and never having an encounter with law enforcement. 

    Do they involve the police?

Don't take antibiotics on your own, that's a really bad idea, as you don't know if there's a bacterial infection, if the antibiotic kills the bacteria and fucking up your dosage regime can lead to the bacteria becoming resistant to the antibiotic

So, needing some advice 

Yesterday I did a shot in my left arm, just below the bend. Everything was going great until I started rushing. Hands shaky, went too deep and missed about ten units. Knowingly, it's not my first rodeo, I immediately got into a hot shower and stayed for twenty minutes. I fell asleep a few hours later, and when I woke my arm was red, warm, swollen, and very tender. Not only to the touch but to move or even hold small items in my left hand. When I powered through and did manage to hold heavier items such as a glass of water, my hand would be nearly shake uncontrollably. I placed not compress twenty minutes on, and twenty minutes off. It's now been just over 24 hours. I'm now at work and my stages are strained, so much so I'm about to take my first Norco. Anyway I'm concerned because even though

 The swelling and redness have been showing improvement, it's still just as painful as when I woke up. Should I go to the hospital, or just wait this out?

Just wait, it should get better by this evening. Norco should be fine, but don't take any more shots in that specific spot perhaps. If it gets more irritated/swollen/inflamed within the next 24hours or sooner then go to A&E. I would probably just chill out on it and not take any other shots period, maybe have some good hearty food and I dont think hydrocodone, would hurt, and things like this tend to sort themselves out *unless the shot was dirty/contaminated with something or something like that* which is pretty unlikely with meth depending what area your in, but especially if its already being sold pre-bagged for purchase, its unlikely to be dirty to the point of giving you an abcess.

Ive missed shots before. It hurts like hell and the pain lingers but eventually goes away. Ive never had an injection-related complication/abcess during my entire using career (years). A lot of times i think that bad complications arise from re-used rigs, poor hygiene/technique or REALLY messing up, rather than just a simple partial miss.


If you experience persistent swelling I'd seek medical attention, though.

Thats just a thing with ice, imo. Happens to me every time and past a certain dosage it truly gets unbearable. I think its a combination of things and not something that could be avoided. Perhaps has something to do with the gear or an allergic reaction to the ice itself (the lungs is the first place an IV shot reaches and then goes to your heart, then pumped outward to your brain/rest of your body)

Alright, so...

The other day I posted asking about a miss I had. I want to show everyone what exactly I'm trying to describe. 


![c7AT5MWMjxN2Pof87](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gl%2Fphotos%2Fc7AT5MWMjxN2Pof87&hash=f5fac71bf533ede044f1cbf0ea628ee2)


Day 2 (Soft tissue swelling is making the area appear normal, it's just my whole arm is inflamed instead of centralized).


![HfcpdmwyYAE5R4Rj8](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gl%2Fphotos%2FHfcpdmwyYAE5R4Rj8&hash=cf0ab41bd892ff0439027dc59a6f8292)


Day 3


![oaUb5xdcVL8NiAFW8](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gl%2Fphotos%2FoaUb5xdcVL8NiAFW8&hash=a995843c9086b53687074f5888ac2953)


Day 4


But yeah, I have no clue what the hell is going on here. It's not painful, especially compared to how excruciating the pain was during day 1 and 2. It's just raised, with some pressure, and just still there.

Was this today? I think you should go to A&E, that looks like an abcess, not necessarily badly infected but if it gets infected (which it very well may) it would be a really bad time. Pls go and check with a dr, sad to say but it's not just gonna go away they might drain it. Not trying to scare you or anything just that looks very worrying.

Hey does anyone have any idea about if meth getting absorbed into walls of houses or into fabric on furniture etc and causing harm to people who my enter the exposed area. Only been smoked in, no cooking or anything like that. I heard a story about  house having to cleaned by specialised cleaning service to remove the drugs that had absorbed into the paint or whatever and found it to be fairly unlikely. However not sure of the details and was probably a lab in there but this just got me thinking.

No it doesn't, haha... unless you have been smoking in the exact same room for the past 1-5 years.. which is I guess what alot of these ppl doing... Umm just would let them clean your house instead of questioning it bro =] LMAO. But if you've only been huffing and puffing that for a year or so then please just clease all your furniture, maybe have a seperate person clean your carpets, WASH your walls, etc... and I hope you were at least trying to conserve your use indoors. Nothing wrong with smoking outside, pipe lights up like a fucking candle outdoors lol

Yer i would only do it outside in the garage 90% of the time i wasnt real concerned as it seems fairly unlikely unless done heavily in one room or something as you said. But seriously that was a real story i read on a website saying something in the tens of thousands to clean up house free from meth

Yea I think youre good i think that the heavy contamination that would require that type of cleaning is more like someone using that room as a meth lab over and over again or somethin

Hello. This ones been on my mind for a long time... Seems unanimous. Most people report shadows, hearing voices, etc.... Science says its just not sleeping and chemically induced or straight up insanity.... But ive come to strongly believe Crystal Meth in particular [I know all drugs do, but Krystal is a wicked little witch...] is definitely able to be catergorized as Pharmkei... Theres just something evil about it... Like its Sin itself.... Or it is the Prince of all lies. Ive become so much more spiritual.. Because the demons as I call the shadows and voices terrorize me...... And beat me down with oppression and fear.... This isnt a fight anymore.... Of our world.... Its a battle for our souls literally...  Meths a special kind of Hell.... Its so additictive most people let go eventually and submit til they are dead. Its a slow... Painful... LONG suicide!! I dont know what category this is... Or if it even belongs here.... But ever since i touched meth.... Im obsessed with demons and Satan.... They take over.... Can see them literally. And the voices.... They scream at me.... They dance in my body.... They dont own my flesh... But they are inside me.... Im scared.... These demons.... They are all myself..... I noticed im so much more darker these days.....  So crude.... And.... Starting to fall into my obsession with the occult again...  


Anyone else feeling this kinda creepy tonight?. Pharmkei old school magic.... Meths the only drug thats done this to me besides Psychdelics... But for sure the other drugs... Didnt make me fall into the darkness...  Like Meth. Anyone got input?

I am new to this site, so please bear with me if I am not using it correctly. I am learning. I am a 90 pound girl and have IV'd meth before occasionally. However, I've never gotten "the perfect hit" or so to speak. Based on my weight and assuming I have little to no tolerance to meth, what dosage should I IV for that "perfect rush/high" feeling I have been searching for?

Happy birthday Maxxx, hope you have a great day or night or whenever. I should read back. Everything will depend on quality and tolerance at least with IV you know when you'll feel it (which if it's the high grade halfway through your shot will make you smile).  Gear like that can be in the high 60's to 70's percentage wise. My best cooks had the gear at 0.20 so just less than a quarter of a point was a hard heads limit lol wasn't till day three were you going near anything like a point (100mgs).


I note these days that if at 50-100mgs gets you high then ya guys alright. I've found the good is generally clearer to clear glass but that's not to say I haven't been beautifully slaughtered by a frosty lil snowman. 


I miss certain precursors and methods that always delivered a soft finely powdered but dampish white gear.,....that gak smell, perfectly smokable, no waiting for bloody xtals to dissolve water hits it it's gone and ready for shooting. Ears used to scream or have a booming swishing waterfall sound and your eye sight would be reduced to barely a light down a tunnel and you really were 'speeding/rushing)!!


I find a big shot of today's "ice" feels more like shooting mdma ..... more wobbly vision and wobbling in general minus the rush of old. It all helps me concentrate for a few days straight.


Always loved a female friend who was like a guy on the gear. She'd ask me to IV her and before I could cap the pick and draw a tasty one for myself she so or claw and my cloths that girl using her mouth and tongue could undo a pants belt buttons or zip all while keeping perfect eye contact that says please don't go easy on me and my mind is saying "thank you universe thankyo"


It was rare to have a woman react like us guys do with respect to an insatiable sex appetite made 1000000 times worth with gear. Swinging and Meth/pills tub etc in my 20's were the best days.?"Festivals and free love no fight but fucks.


I found watching my wife being fucked doggy while playing guess how far She can get the other ones cock down her throat to be extremely satisfying as (don't look in those eyes though guys cos you won't last long......NEXT.... we weren't sluts just promiscuous, the rules were "we only cheat in front of each other" no separate room shit and if both partners couldn't agree on the terms never break the rules. No kids home either (so irresponsible to us) but the best swingers were families, couples with kids were most supportive to each other but they had to be (the kids) at grandmas all long weekend.


Christ sorry Maxxxx creepy SKR had to make the thread go sideways or methways. Take Care

Having the train rushing through your head is amazing. Dosing is hard. This is because it is different batches, sellers cut, types(go anhydrous). When i start out i go small amount more water. Test the product. Then start increasing dope and reduce water. I like them thick and pasty. You use less dope and the less water the harder it hits. Coke the same way. 

I hear sounds and voices while my headis bursting. My eyes sometimes shake and i tend to have to fight throwing up as well as the fear. Thats a good shot! I dont know if i'd call that euphoria but it is awesome!

If you miss because you're shaking or digging. Stop and apply a heating pad or hot towel to the area. It gets blood to that area and reduces chance of infection. You'll know if it abcesses. It will just keep getting bigger, painful and irritated. 

I learned the hard way, alone. But please do yourself a favor and each blast use a new needle. Your veins will last longer.

Meth to lose weight?

I used to smoke meth in my twenties. Now I am in my thirties and I want to have energy and lose weight. I acquired some crystal meth (darknet, good seller and pure) and have been smoking it for a few days (foil and pen). But all it is doing is make me want to smoke more, and surf the web. It isnt giving me physical energy. And the comedown is a bitch. Am I missing something?

Start as low as possible for IV, you can always do more. Be safe filter your dope, rotate your veins, try not to redose IV for at least 6 hours if possible, 2 hours is better than one after the other. Hope it's not too late!!!

^ Yeah, it's a symptom of CNS overstimulation most likely...I've had my feet go "cold" before, for example, after a multi-day speed binge. The anxiogenic effect of strong amphetamines makes any neuropathic symptoms much worse, too.


IME it tends to go away with enough hydration, time away from speed, rest, tending to your body's needs etc.


----------------


Anyway, I have a question. Has anyone ever had success putting meth in an allergy spray bottle? (Like Flonase, for instance) Meth is highly water soluble so this seems like it could be a good & stealthy way to get some use out of the drug, with minimal damage to the user's body...

This isn't quite the cold feet or tingling feeling. This is, as far as I can tell, some actual nerve damage. I'm not so sure it was actually caused by the meth or by something (?) I did during the binge, but it definitely began happening on night two of the binge and hasn't gone away a month later with no further usage. 


All the carpal tunnel and joint pains have gone, as well as the chest pains. This is all that remains. 


If I point my leg straight, bend my foot at the ankle, and then bend my big toe, this incredible electrical shock pain and numbness shoots up the toe. If I trace it up my foot, there's a trigger point I can press and induce the pain to a lesser degree. It's all on the lateral side and the top. 


I see it on various podiatry websites as a neuropathy sports players get after kicking things for years - I don't play any sports like that. 


Maybe it was there from running or whatever and the meth binge just brought it out. Anyway, just throwing it out there.

Science says its just not sleeping and chemically induced or straight up insanity.... But ive come to strongly believe Crystal Meth in particular [I know all drugs do, but Krystal is a wicked little witch...] is definitely able to be catergorized as Pharmkei... Theres just something evil about it... Like its Sin itself.... Or it is the Prince of all lies. Ive become so much more spiritual.. Because the demons as I call the shadows and voices terrorize me...... And beat me down with oppression and fear.... This isnt a fight anymore.... Of our world.... Its a battle for our souls literally...  Meths a special kind of Hell.... Its so additictive most people let go eventually and submit til they are dead. Its a slow... Painful... LONG suicide!! I dont know what category this is... Or if it even belongs here.... But ever since i touched meth.... Im obsessed with demons and Satan.... They take over.... Can see them literally. And the voices.... They scream at me.... They dance in my body.... They dont own my flesh... But they are inside me.... Im scared.... These demons.... They are all myself..... I noticed im so much more darker these days.....  So crude.... And.... Starting to fall into my obsession with the occult again...

Sounds like you overextended your femoral nerve. Are there places of numbness?

**JBrandon**, for peripheral neuralgia try extracts of Lion's Mane mushroom (up to 2g a day), Sulbutiamine (up to 500mg a day) and Noopept (up to 60mg a day) - it did help my friend with her meth-induced neuropathic pain and helped me with my physically damaged nerves in my feet. I was very relieved on the third day of taking those supplements. I have also heard Pregabalin is effective in such cases.

**By how much should swim increase their dosage each time?**


Hey, so swim normally IV's around .2 of methamphetamine in one go, but swim doesn't get the rush, in which increments should swim increase their dosage until they get the desired "rush"?

Depends on the purity of what you're getting, and please don't say "it's uncut 100%", there is no way to know. 


If you're not rushing off 200mg IV then you're probably not gonna rush off anything short of a massive dose unless you take a tolerance break.

You didn't answer my question? I know everything that you just said, I'm asking what is a safe amount to increase dosage by? You don't have to give me a solid answer just an estimate.

I did give you an answer - no one knows! Any "answer" you get is just a total guess based on someone else's pharmacokinetics. 


For me personally, once I was using meth daily I was able to double, triple, quadruple my dosage and couldn't get a rush.

Okay but I only use once every week/fortnight, how much would you have increased by given your experience? Sorry just looking for a answer that has a bit of experience around it, would be greatly appreciated if you could make an educated guess, would you say increase by 0.05pt's or 0.025 for example? I just don't want to increase by too much for harm reduction purposes

I agree with JB no one can really answer it everyone is different and i agree with him bigger doesnt mean better either because it creates its own set of dramas. You spoke about harm minimization You are better off staying the same on the dose side of things while leaving it longer between shots. Instead of two weeks try three and then four. It allows your body and mind more time to recover. 2 points a shot is not exactly small but in my opinion its far more safer than 3 is every 2 weeks. Once you increase it you will find that if the rush does happen it is only temporary and wont be long and up to 4 it goes. The more frequently you use the less the rush happens and eventually it goes completely. its a huge release of dopamine and other feel good chemicals in the brain that create what youre after read about it. I have used for 10 years and at my worst i was a full blown addict using 1/2 a gram a shot. I use that once a month now in 3 shots and its easier to manage I get more high than i did years ago and im not doing so much damage.

Thank you so much, just wanted to hear someone's thought on the subject as I wasn't sure what would be appropriate, I understand what you are saying to keep more distance in time between doses, but I can't do that ATM, I already reduced from 1 week to two weeks in between, slowly cutting back, last time I used 30 units of water to 1.8, might try the 20 units to 2.25, will report back on outcome!

Having a similar experience as i type this. Not as fun as it was an hour ago. Thats what my dumb- ass gets for redosing too soon before the high peaked. I smoked and have no tolerance to mention. Took 800mg ibuprofin and fought down a huge glass of water. Gonna go brush my teeth to rid my mouth of the sweet chemical taste then wait a couple hours to hit another rip or two. Im sure ill be fine by then, as i have no other negative side effects . Im a lucky man to have a responsible wife that trusts me to do hard drugs and even partakes with me more often than not.. I love not having to hide my symptoms. Shes also a great trip-sitter and keeps my ass in line with how much stash I have left. We do this only while the kids are gone and she keeps a keen eye on my habits, and I hers. Works well to keep me accountable and not addicted.

So, Swim upped dosage to .225 and was perfect! Mixed the .225 with 25 units of water, mixed, put cotton filter in drew up and blasted off, was great ? thanks for the tips and opinions guys. To be honest I am contemplating taking a .3 shot but have mixed judgments and emotions towards that, you know what they say! Better be safe than sorry!

Hello, everyone. I'm an active IV meth user, always having the white powder form when I do it. Since I've started, my veins have been destroyed. I got locked up, got healthy, and was released 3 days ago. I did 3 shots last night, and every time my needle comes out of the vein, not allowing me to get the full shot. After the first 2 or even 1, my veins are shot. I've tried chugging water before I start to be 'prehydrated', but that didn't work. My arms were healed, and popping up good, but it was the same thing. I never get the full shot, always miss a few units or blow the vein, and then they shrink so bad that a needle just isn't going into them. I dosed a small tester, and with the knowledge that I had nowhere near the tolerance I did, I did a second larger dose. I got most of it, but had to pull out early. I'll describe my symptoms, and anyone with the right knowledge can inform me if I almost overdosed. Dizziness, trouble standing and walking, the instant need to piss, extremely shaky hands, severe nausea but no vomiting, and of course, panic. I could still think, no hallucinations, not much pain. Chest tightness and labored breathing. I need to know exactly what the point is where overdose occurs so I can enjoy my rush without freaking out. And please, for the love of god, someone please tell me what to do about my veins. All I do is bruise and butcher myself. I need all the knowledge I can get so I can not kill myself and make my entire arms swollen and bruised. Stay safe everyone...

Yeah, you did too much with those symptoms. As for the veins, at a certain point it's just time to stop before you're shooting into your neck.

I figured, but if there was a way to know ahead of time if you'll live or not, it might make it more enjoyable. Then again, maybe not. I shake worse and worse nowadays. I waited almost 5 hours between doses, ate, and hydrated. I was able to find a vein easily, but I was shaking so bad just from the anticipation of it that I could get the whole shot it. I still had plenty enough to have a decent bump, but I'm trying to research what has started my hand tremors. I shot ice for 6 months, few vein problems, never had hands shake, but going to the white powder anyone can make, my hands shake worse and worse with each shot. Thanks for the reply, funding that very delicate balance of dying or not is what I chase, even though I don't want to die.

I am currently in the throes of the worst geek session I've ever been in. I pride myself on being able to ignore most of the side effects of geeking. Rarely do I do it at all, but right now, I'm so far gone I had to get in my closet to finish writing this. The point of it being harm reduction is that I need to know if this will wear off and how long it'll take. I'm having vivid and believing hallucinations, sounds and otherwise, blurred vision, pupils the size of dinner plates. My last dose was a good one, a tad more than the one before, but had little rush.It hit me good though, felt good, but buzz is long gone and I'm freaking the fuck out. I've never had it this bad. What can I do? I can't distinguish what I see and hear from fake or reality. Been hours now. Flahes of light are constantly appearing. If anything, it's getting worse. I have no access to any downers. Hospital?

Hello T been waiting to hear how you went 1st of all im glad you're ok... 2nd Awesome news on the shot and hope it did what you wanted it too by the sounds of things you had a good time. 25 with 2.25 is probably nicer than my recommendation of 20 delivery wise due it being less thick in the gun (Needle). You should read my original post to you I did mention although in a roundabout way the desire to up the dose. 


The higher you go with dose dosent always mean a better high remember that....


 if 2.25 did it for you then stay with it until it dosent. The thing is 3 points is still .75 away from where you are now which for me is too bigger jump to say yeah you will be ok because it might rock your world and be amazing or go the other way and fuck you up so I say not yet. As i said previously go up slow try .25 increases because it gives you more of a feel for things. Like i said before you have to be comfortable it makes a huge difference to your high. If you have doubt you aren't ready in my opinion as you said better safe than sorry so don't get over confident or greedy because the drug will humble you eventually. I am happy to help you anytime its no problem. Stay safe

Professortweak we've all been there man so use it as a learning curve for the future. Although you felt good coming up somewhere along the line something clearly peaked your anxiety and you mentioned pupil size so you looked in a mirror I bet it only freaked you more. 


It doesnt take much time to spiral out of control either once something unfamiliar happens or a feeling  we havent felt before in our body goes off. Its in first stages you have two options embrace it or fear it in my experience. Ive done both and fear only creates anxiety which speeds your body and mind up even more which is unpleasant and you feel you're powerless to stop things even more. 


Example 1st you may feel like somethings wrong then that sends signals through the body you start to worry about what it could be. You havent any clue its all new and welcome.....FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN... You tell someone you dont feel good most the time they google shit which gives 55 things that maybe causing the way you feel which only again adds to the clusterfuck in your head. It may start from a noise or paranoia  either way FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN its all in your head. 


In regards to the visual and auditory hallucinations over stimulated...Next time remember you're high as fuck and don't fear them. Laugh have fun with it all just ride the wave next time brother stay calm no matter whats thrown your way find a way to enjoy it. Easier said than done i know it takes practice but every time ive lost my shit and worried i may die right after the shot or just been paranoid as fuck its landed me in a hospital but im still alive and every time ive freaked out its been over nothing  a few times i swore i was having a heart attack for instance get to hospital find out hearts going just fine... its been years since i felt like you did but it was common for me to freak out regularly as a youngster on meth. You know that hospital means you are safe too if something is wrong so your anxiety starts to leave pretty quickly in there.


My advice if it happens again is dont worry laugh it off or distract yourself whatever you do don't feed it. You can calm yourself with breathing techniques at anytime. Sit down put your elbows on your knees lean forward deep breathes that position is going to naturally slow your heart rate down breathing deep but steady helps with oxygen. You can also put a cold washer on the top part of your neck over certain viens Google it man. Last is pills 10 or 15 mg of Valium will slow you down reasonably quick as im sure you know already. 


The shaking in your hands is central nervous system related from what i have read and been told if its long term then see a dr.

If it only happens when you inject its something ive seen many times in pretty inexperienced iv users. As soon as the blood hits they shake like leaves or people with issues hitting viens are the same. Again relax take your time dude.


You mentioned blowing out viens and missing shots. Ill be honest your technique maybe the issue because to me it sounds like you're relatively new to the steel. I say this due to the questions you've asked also. If you are new you need to fucking relax before anything else. If you are using a torniquet release it after registering and before you inject. It doesn't have to be all that tight if it is you will find you may cut the blood flow too much making it impossible to register at times.


 Use your arms if they are still good before anywhere else in the crook of your elbow you should have 3 viens easily accessible always go up the river which means shoot infront or above your last hit saves your viens. If your arms are gone in the crook go toward your hand and find the same viens and if they're mia... Hands are next but  be gentle and inject slowly and you'll be fine. 


I also suggest to inject slower than you seem to be as the slower you go the more calm you'll be. The faster you inject the more chance of blowing a vein because its under more pressure than it can take. The rule is the smaller it is the slower you go. If you go slower you have more control and should be checking half way down you're still in the vein. Slow and steady wins the race. Fresh rigs help with vein longevity too. Rotaion use a different vein each time if you can even if its only two you rotate better than none... When you register too let the needle sit flat against your arm if possible... Stops you having to focus on supporting so much and will be easier to shoot.


 Lastly symptoms of an od arent pretty Ive bit the dust a few times and have been lucky.. You lose your vision and hearing and shake like a mother fucker all the while your heart is beating eraticly and you are gasping for breath if your oding you will know because its instant and will scare you or kill you. There's no real indicator as to how much is too much before its in you and its too late. You said you were inside on a vacation so id say your tolerance is non existent to low right now just take it slow be safe crawl then walk. You seem like you pushed it pretty fucking far and as a result look at where you ended up bro. Use the other day as a guide to what you could handle and go from there.


 If you're using powder and not crystal its usually less forgiving on veins and the kidneys due to it having as high as 10 times the amount of chemicals and shit in it than crystal. It results in a dirtier less pure cheaper product. So filter it vigilantly.


Sorry for the post length man and hope its helpful stay safe...

**Curious about people using small daily doses**


Are there people out there that manage to use daily in small doses? If so, can you share your experience? I am curious what regimines you follow to optimize health. 


What I know about daily self care:


Body -

Sleep everyday at least 6 hours. 

Drink quality protein shakes 

Drink green drinks to boost iron

Drink water all day

Take multivitamin, calcium, B complex, D3 + dandelion, probiotic, 5-HTP

Consume healthy fat if digestion slows

Avoid candy and sugar to optimize oral health

Brush 2x daily and use mouth rinse to kill germs. Floss daily. 


Mind - 

Organize do to list daily and follow it

Set small reminders to stay on task if chasing rabbit holes is tempting 

Paranoia is a side effect best treated with rational self response

Remember that self worth is not defined by choices - both good and bad. 


I'm looking forward to learning others lessons learned.

I've done daily meth use in the past for productivity purposes, and as we speak I currently am once again. First time I tried it I was eventually hospitalized and ruined my life. Hoping to cut it off this time before I get close to that again. 


My honest advice, 100% don't do it. Way better to underperform, miss out on things, disappoint people, get fired, whatever - than follow the path that the meth *can* lead you down. 


Now I emphasized the word "can" because someone is gonna pop in here and say it's totally doable and they've done it for 50 years with absolutely no problems and so on. That's fine. 


But that person is statistically about the same as someone becoming an astronaut or a professional athlete. Millions try for it, maybe 0.00000001% is able to do it - and when your brain sees that sentence I just wrote and goes full-on Jim Carrey saying "So you're telling me the there's a chance!" - don't fucking listen to it.

What were you hospitalized for if I may ask? I need to research dosing but use has been consistent. It takes about a month to use a quarter. Not sure how that breaks down.

@K02


I had what was either a severe hypoglycemic shock, cardiovascular collapse, or a straight up mini-stroke. 


I never found out because I came to in the hospital and immediately demanded release AMA, because I feared for my career - which got fucked by the incident in the end anyway.


I was using approximately 40-70mg every day, FWIW. Took me about two months to look like something was slightly wrong with me (skin tone) and about 3 weeks after that, boom - out cold on the bathroom floor.  I washed and recrystallized it, but that doesn't mean it couldn't have been 80% ISO, 19% PSEUDO, 1% meth still.

A little anecdotal bit of advice I'd like to toss out there in case it helps someone out. 


After my initial relapse on meth a month and a half ago I was having quite a bit of (very mild, random) chest pain.


 I am 99% sure it was from over-vigorous masturbation, but it persisted for a long time and seemed like it could have been ischemic angina. 


I threw some capsaicin 1% cream on my ribs and it's been gone ever since.

 RHCP, I edited your quote length for space, but I wanted you to know I seen your message and wanted to reply to it. I'm open minded, and any advice I can get is welcomed and heard. Surprisingly, I've been injecting drugs, on and off, since 2007. I've just always had that honey hole that never went out on me until about 6 months ago. So, when it comes to other veins and all it entails, I am kind of new. Like you said, I was sure I was just really fucking high and tripping balls, so last night, my first use since that incident, everything went so fine that I didn't even shake. I know that, as cautious as I am, most likely I'll live through the shot. I kept myself from panicking, and I didn't even have chest discomfort. I shook on my first shot because I was so anxious to get it, but after that, it was great. Your advice is spot on, I can tell, so I'll be trying other things you say as well. I've located another good vein I can hit with no tourniquet, and I hate going to a different area because I'm comfortable with how easy I can hit the one, but I will force myself next time. It is powder, as I cannot find or afford crystal, and although it's more trashy, I still like it. A lot of times I can add water and it be completely clear. Other times its obviously dirty, but I take precautions. Anyway, thanks for the advice, sharing your experience so I know more, and taking the time to actually tell me all of that. Really appreciate it. Be safe and have fun!

Professor no worries anytime knowledge is power or so they say.


 I understand completely how difficult it is to leave the honey hole as you called it. 


IV use is not as simple as the guides indicate or some would have you believe. 


Starting out I was absolutely fucking hopeless with a needle so when I managed to hit that one vein in my consistently it became the easiest least painful way for me to use. In reality it was the only place I could register... so for a long time it got abused. I was always aware that it was crucial to rotate sites and I didn't want to be a one trick pony so to speak. I eventually moved to the same vein on the other arm the angle on entry fucked me until i found hitting it side on was easier and it felt as natural as my usual spot. As a result I still have my favorite spot and used it tonight but its just as easy these days to hit anywhere else also. It just takes practice and confidence which eventually develops in time. Stay with it and take it slowly because its not a race. Dont force yourself because it will only create pressure and more anxiety than usual..


. My advice  just get some fresh rigs load them up with water and practice registering in new parts of town with no pressure if you cant hit so be it its only fucking water. Im sure eventually you'll be making honey sandwiches again with a new supplier..


Tourniquet or no tourniquet is the question some people swear by them and I did myself once upon a time but I only ever got better through not having it. My veins are difficult to find so I learnt to find them through touch more so than sight. I suggest you go searching without a tourni as it is only another hassle to contend with. If you can hit without using  one you can hit with one. 


You stepped back into the ring again so to speak and im glad it went smooth for you... It can only benefit you because while you had a fucked up time its now in the history books its done you survived and next time you will be more prepared to cope with such an event. 


The anxiety before the first one is normal and even affects me if I go on a break but as you said it went well and thats what you want. 


You seem naturally anxious i could be wrong but I am myself and I relate with some things you've mentioned. The only thing that cured my apprehension towards using stimulants was time and as its passed you become more comfortable in general. You will find that those bad experiences may happen but they build character and teach you. You can't take the good without the bad.


You said you are only using powder and in my experience you can get away with higher doses than crystal due in part to the purity. Also the highs differ a little.As you said powder is all you can find and its better than nothing. I have many friends who prefer it over crystal. As you said sometimes its clean and other times its a mystery thats why i don't miss it. 


Sorry again for the length of my post. I would rather write too much than not enough. If it helps you in anyway its worth writing. I wouldn't know the things i do if others didnt look out for me and guide me so im at a point where i feel comfortable and confident enough in what i know to help others. As i said it's no trouble and anytime i can help out i will.

**30 days in!**


Started crystal aka ice, about a month ago. Love it! First of all I only snort. But I have two questions.1, is it odd to love the burn, I mean actually to look forward to it? 2, is it normal to be able to just walk away for a week and not even think about it until the next weekend, or as I use more and more will it start to call to me? Just some advice from the more experienced users would be helpful!!!

Thanks again for all of the advice. Yes, I have anxiety when I'm "normal", but I've learned to live with it and fight it. I've discovered that if I can keep my fear and anxiety down, I will not tweak, only have a great time. As soon as something triggers me into having fear of a possible bad event to come, I lose my mind. I much prefer no tourniquet, but with dull rigs, a tie off is absolutely necessary. Rigs can be ordered online, I know, as they won't sell them to you at a pharmacy in my area, but I can barely afford my occasional drug use, let alone a box of needles. I'm in the process of moving and relocating, which means a job and easier access to things, so I'm hopeful some of these problems go away.

**Questions about tolerance and days binged**


I've experienced before, I think, that the longer I stay awake,  the less potent the rush of my shot is. I say 'I think', because there are so many other variables. My question is, has anyone else experienced injecting an obviously large dose, only to feel nothing of a rush? Especially, has anyone noticed this happening more the longer they stay awake, regardless of amounts done in total? It confuses me, because other people partaking  of they same bag will say they feel a great rush. I'm putting every bit of a quarter gram into my shots, and getting no rush. A very subtle anyone low high, but decent. Nothing like the overwhelming intensity I crave. With the powdered, "shake", meth, I always get a killer rush and always at least at decent high. The quality never seems to fall below a certain percentage. But, since I've started using the shake meth, every single time I acquire ice, like tonight, I'm left very disappointed. It's my experience that the shake is doing meth much better than the ice. Can anyone shed some light on this?

Resistance builds up fast.. And the longer you go, the more it takes just to bring you back to normal, let alone get you high. If I start shooting I usually start doubling the dose after 2-3 shots and barely feel it    *I DONT RECOMMEND DOING THIS*

Anyone have any idea what can cause immediate vomiting after IVing a small shot of ice. Rare and recreational user.  Makes me vomit every time.  High opiate tolerance which is probably irrelevant to thus subject.

I rarely feel like I have to vomit unless I do a shot so big that it's scary all the way around. People's tolerances are different, but it's just where you don't do it much. Also, be careful about having opiates in your system at all all doing ice. High opiate tolerance means you could have amounts that would kill me in your body days after you've done any. Wouldn't worry too much about the vomiting, as long as no other negative symptoms come up.

Always happened to me. It's because your body is trying to void itself of whatever is causing the severe surge in BP, heart rate, and so on. Plus anticipation and reward sensation being so great, " anxiety " leading up to the dose, etc.


If you don't want to puke, try 10-20mg per shot, tops. 


I would start my day off with 50 to 100 mg shot and would puke and dry heave for 10-20 minutes.

I really need here. It sounds like I'm desperate because I am. I'd prefer some info from someone who's actually done it, but any advice will help. After I've smoked meth on foil, let it recrystalize, and worked it up as normal, is it 

safe to inject? It's major liquefied now, so there is no just smoking it, but it's a dark brown color, even after being diluted.  I've put all kinds of crazy colors in my body, even ones like this, so that's not an issue, but is it possible when you smoke it it's burning up only the meth and leaving the additives behind? Any help? Thanks

Both the additives and the meth can be burnt up to a brown color. If its turning a dark brown quickly on the foil, its most likely mostly additives. Probably not the best idea to shoot it, makes it that much worse for you injecting all that burnt shit. Its kinda a myth that going a few times back and forth on the foil will cleanse it of additives- this only happens with one specific cut i can think of (MSM) depending if its melted/glued together with the meth or if its crystallized together. (No way to tell except the shards will be much denser). Either way, not a good idea!!

Well, I did most of it. When I was smoking it, it didn't turn brown quick, but I guess where I had too much on the foil it turned think and a little more concentrated. Couldn't really judge the amount, so I just pushed slowly until I was at my limit. Seemed fine, no adverse side effects that I don't normally get anyway. It's not ice, it's powdered form. Thanks for your response, maybe this will help someone in the future. It's somewhat safe, doesn't seem worse than doing it in the first place.

Can I ask is smoking meth less bodily visualising meaning when I snort you can obviously note my reddening in the face and that you are obviously on something or off the rocks. I have smoked meth before but I was in a time and place that I was not working so could not give two shits how I looked but I am working again so I want to ask by smoking and IVing does it show in the face ? Which one is more incognito or subtle if you want to put it. Snorting makes it obvious in the face like it reddens not to mention the pupils but I dont mind the mind the pupils it's more the face.


Which offers the best way of way being incognito or in the shadows. I want to be able to do it without it raising alarms and the last time I went into work was too muh but that was my own fault so anyones knowledge on the subject and their own personal experience is vey much welcomed. Cheers and thanks in advance.

Your face turns red when you snort meth? ![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)


It's probably a better idea to do smaller dosages, that way it's less obvious.

I would've probably said sniffing it is the most incognito. Quick and easy, just give it a few minutes and your face should go back to normal color. Smoking it creates... smoke. Shooting creates track marks and if you shoot too much you're not doing any kind of work. Plus, takes way longer to work up a shot or smoke a bowl than it does to just sniff a line. Second best would be smoking it. Should be no obvious signs other than the dilated pupils.

I have noticed when I have snorted the gear that when I'm staring  into the mirror I notice say an inflammatory colour in the face say for  example when people are completely drunk you noticed the facial  colouring do you not. 


My face does'nt exactly goe red but I notice my pale complexion is lot more reddened in colour not outright red.


I  did think maybe do smaller doses in the future cause  I usually go for a  dry patch without the gear and then I like to do a good line or two  like so your probably right captain.heroin. Body need to re-adapt.

Some get the red in the face effect, some dont. Id usually get it with some high grade stuff. Other times id be left extremely pale. Not sure if this is due to tolerance, overall nutrition etc. I presume its due to paradoxical vasodilation caused by some agonism/antagonism of a certain subset of adrenergic receptors.


Alcohol effects me the same way, sometimes a bright red face (usually after a few with just straight vodka after a meal) other times extremely pale (bender with mixed sugary drinks and no food)

You know what I mean, like I find now when I'm doing some gear that its very hard not to be noticeable to others like it's really annoying. It must be a bodily reaction to the chemicals in the stuff like I've had different batches and I would not say they were of the strongest suit. Decent I suppose but I dont know would I rank it as high grade stuff but then I'm not exactly too sure.

In my opinion its something that occurs progressively as a matter of tolerance i.e need larger doses to feel that same euphoria and as a result look more fucked up, and even with a pretty long tolerance break(in my case 10 days at first but upto 3 months between use) it seems to me that lower doses that again start producing that euphoria, leave me looking fucked up just like higher doses used to. I used to be able to sniff or smoke and be able to hide it to a certain extent (other than the pupils), last time i used not only was my heartrate jacked up but profuse sweating, psychosis etc every time which makes it totally not worth it, catch 22 when its the only way i could make it thru my day without being suicidally depressed


Low or high grade is really more of a guessing game but with actual good it seemed much more cerebral, long lasting and potent point-for-point. More of a nausea inducing almost scary rush rather than just a blissful flash. Then again, i think thats moreso due to tolerance on my end. Because in the beginning of my usage the dosages that would leave me nauseated and euphoric for an hour would wear off into a comfortable spunness, now thats not the case evenn after a long break. Thoroughly uncomfortable, yet just typing this message leads to butterflys in my stomach/nearly fiending. This shit really is horrid when one is chasing that high dose euphoria and imo dosing low only extends the period of functional use but the deleterious effects eventually will wear down even the most happy go lucky tinkerer.

"Stem dope" is literally washing out a heavily used pipe, and perhaps letting the resulting liquid dry before again dissolving it in water. Its mostly cut, not to mention disgusting contaminants like dried saliva/food particles/little pieces of pocket lint/dust that you are injecting into your body.


You say it didnt burn and no rush, i found that unless i hit a perfect vein i hadnt used in a long time, id miss a tiny bit every single time as i pulled the needle out. You can feel it unless you draw up blood multiple times after the shots done, and even then.


Ive tried this method once or twice when fiending really bad. No rush, no high to speak of, perhaps temporarily reduced cravings. Not to mention its dirty as fuck.


Whoever gave you this stuff is either A) a moron with no clue about what could be harmful since 'hey its meth anyway (common excuse of the ignorant) B) taking advantage of your cravings or C) purposefully abusing your trust knowing youll hang out with them for a shot. Probably all of the above. Im not kidding! Sometimes meth can take people places where they stop caring for the safety of others, so how can you trust a person like that. This is one of the reasons people have extreme distrust of tweakers  (and for good reason).


In regards to the swelling it should go away on its own but if it starts growing into a lump, pain increases then you should seek a drs opinion asap. Theres a slim slim chance of something *really* bad happening from a shot like this (any shot really) like a insoluble particle clogging your lungs and wrecking your shit (pulmonary embolism) but its very very unlikely in an otherwise healthy person.  Still if you feel like something might be wrong pls seek a doctor!


Be careful...

Thanks. That's kind of what I was afraid of. It's my own fault, I just wanted a shot. She told me she uses it so she didn't think it would be a problem for me. I just thought it was really strange that like you said when I've missed tiny bit it hurts likehell but it didn't start hurting or swelling til quite a few minutes after... I appreciate your quick reply. Any ideas on weather or not it's going to continue to release and keep me in ythis "blah state" is the only way I can think to put it. Lol

I used to be able to sniff or smoke and be able to hide it to a certain extent (other than the pupils), last time i used not only was my heartrate jacked up but profuse sweating, psychosis etc every time which makes it totally not worth it, catch 22 when its the only way i could make it thru my day without being suicidally depressed

> Low or high grade is really more of a guessing game but with actual good it seemed much more cerebral, long lasting and potent point-for-point. More of a nausea inducing almost scary rush rather than just a blissful flash. Then again, i think thats moreso due to tolerance on my end. Because in the beginning of my usage the dosages that would leave me nauseated and euphoric for an hour would wear off into a comfortable spunness, now thats not the case evenn after a long break. Thoroughly uncomfortable, yet just typing this message leads to butterflys in my stomach/nearly fiending. This shit really is horrid when one is chasing that high dose euphoria and imo dosing low only extends the period of functional use but the deleterious effects eventually will wear down even the most happy go lucky tinkerer.

Well, been wondering if it was just me or if this was normal. Apparently it's normal, and it fucking sucks. The only thing I lived for was to find that scary-euphoric rush, but have never gotten again. The amount I have to do now, for a small rush, very small high, then a few hours of "normalcy", is more than my body can handle, but not enough for my brains craving. Plus, my veins are so used up and burned up from injecting so much shake meth, that I can't even do it without a new syringe and lots of patience in a quiet room. Not fun anymore, but without it i can't get put of bed. What does a person do? Maintain until a new opportunity presents itself or die or become incarcerated. Bleak options...

**I need details on a new ROA, please!**


Okay, I'll keep this short. Injecting for me is no longer an option until my arms heal. Smoking doesn't help near as much, and all I have is aluminum foil and I hate that. I have become open to the idea of a rectal ROA. I have removed the needle from an old syringe and created a plunger that will work great. What now? Can anyone give me detailed instructions so I don't fuck it up? Will my constipation be a problem for absorption? Help!

Yes constipation would be a potential problem. 


Ever consider dabbing it - or snorting bumps/ a line?

What's dabbing, exactly? And I have sniffed it, but I hate the burn and I'm trying to maxiMize my bioavailabilty since my tolerance is so high.

Dabbing means pressing your finger against some powder and licking it.. what i like to do is get a small square of a single layer of tp and dump some powder in, wrap it up best as you can and wash it down with some water..(called bombing) this way actually hits pretty hard on an empty stomach, almost like plugging but a bit less intense, way easier method tho. Ppl are so into smoking and sniffing this stuff but eating it really does work. Be careful tho eating too much and it hits 20min later like a ton of bricks.. kinda like certain extasy pills but those methbomb e's usually only have 10,20,30mg max in them... if u bomb a whole lot it will send u flyin. Back in the day i used to like bombing a pt or two, hitting a small toothpick sized line 5min-10min or so after and then as its all kicking in around t+20min take out the old oil burner and huff down a few big puffs... gives iv a run for its money lol bu the comedown is fucking terrible

I finally gave up on a vein. Plugged what I had drawn up on my homemade plunger, sniffed a fat line, then went to smoking. Feel pretty good, but o don't 

get that rush I'm always after. Fuck it though, I feel fine. Remember, I'm doing shake, not ice, and I don't weigh it or anything, but I'm guessing I put at least a quarter gram into a shot. Theoretically, shouldn't that be 250mg if it was 100% meth? Surely to god there's more than 50mg in there, right? And god damn I hate sniffing it. It burns so bad it's all I can do to stay standing. The stuff looks and tastes pretty clean. No doubt it's still loaded with impurities, but I ould safely say it's 70-80% meth. Wonder how I could test it.

I wouldn't mess with it its a waste imo. Then again i am loyal to the foil =]


Not sure how one would go about dabbing meth. Perhaps if its a gooey form that would work. Or sticking a shard onto the end of some tar already globbed on. Its basically using a torch-heated glass or metal nail bong/bubbler attachment that you then place the globbed shard onto once its heated up and inhale it quickly much like one would do with hash oil.

How does the IV rush compare to that of MDMA? Looking at the posts here it sounds very similar. If inally decided it's time to get some, just to get it off the bucket list. Alas my city is the only German city where crack is all the fuzz while meth is practically non-existant so it's gonna take some time.


EDIT: Please only reply to my question if you have IV'ed large doses of each on separate occasions.  My question is about the IV rush, not the plateau or after effects. I have a good idea of what to expect from the plateau since I have taken a very large number of centrally stimulating and/or empathogenic drugs on countless occasions.

Its not really like mdma, id go so far as to say a big iv dose of it the rush is like crack x10.. all encompassing euphoria but its strongly physical.. its the most addictive drug/roa combo possible imo. And chasing that rush guaruntees you will be up for at least 72hrs or more. Its not worth it in my opinion

The IV rush is so powerful My body has this cough/ sneeze reflex to it.  A pure psychomotor reaction to the chemical. IV 'molly' is more psychedelic, more pronounced tracers and trails. IV meth is way more compulsive. If I have plenty of meth and clean needles I'd just keep on shooting, like compulsively smoking crack

IV methamphetamine is very euphoric, much more stimulating to the heart.  Hard to put into words.

Yeah I would just put it in some BHO and dab it.  Would vaporize in one inhalation, would have a much quicker onset than tiny puffs off a bowl.

That's a good idea. I usually fix myself a decent shot (.1 to.2) and break off the needle after I'm done. That helps me just enjoy the rush and not succumb to the temptation to redose, so I have a snow balls chance in hell to sleep 48 hours after. Be safe

How in the fuck do some of you redose IV meth like you would coke or something? Back to back to back... if I do a large enough shot, there's no way I could redose for the next 2 hours, at least. Wouldn't want to firstly, and even if I did i physically couldn't for the shakes and vein constriction. But I'm so high, I don't want it for a while. Again, this is a dose that's large enough. If you do one you're not satisfied with, you'll instantly want more, so I'm just wondering if some of you are doing enough?

I have really solid veins.  I could whack a way at them if I really wanted to.  


After a few shots of methamphetamine I'm already too high though.  I can't do one big shot.  Way too dysphoric, too much vomitting, etc.  Honestly 1 to 2 small shots is enough for a long time.  I'd rather snort it now because I gave needles up.  


I never had a problem making a vein, and don't shake too much from it (probably because I don't do huuuuuge shots).

I mean this way it can all get vaporized in one inhalation (most people take tiny puffs repeatedly with a small tweak pipe).  I don't do it that way but I have seen others do it.  Seems to work just fine for them.

I want your veins.  Mine are stupid.


As for shot size,  I have no statistical proof just have a lot of past aquaintances all shaoes and sizes male frmale.  The bigger blokes oreferred about .2 and women .1 tops.


Shots too big are very uncomfortable and ruins it. Can also just put too much stress on heart and Ive had to sit under a cool shower a couple times to get over that "too much" feeling.


So a decent poont is a decent rush and better than a shot of mdma ino.


As for pipes its just economical and less waste to not burn a puddle that will last the length of your seasion without too many melting solidifying repetitions. It makes it go dark and not enjoyable at the end.

Yeah, generally just the typical oil burner here. But the tiny dosage administered through each puff does leave an unsatisfying feeling, and would like for a more efficient method of vaporization. If in a group, larger hits are usually taken, but have found smaller ones to be much more conservative and better in general if alone- but of course, it's more fiendish..even the bigger hits tend to leave me unsatisfied though- always been this way, unfortunately.


It would be great to be able to do large amounts through one inhalation, but I would assume this method to be quite wasteful, am I right?

I guess the dark and less enjoyable near end makes sense, but more economical and less waste? I swear, within my (probably limited compared to yours) experience, I've found it more economical to take short little draws than fat ones (especially in solo sessions)......cuz I personally prefer go big anyway considering I receive so little benefit through this ROA and method as it is.....always have preferred massive rips, but have recently transitioned to lots of small ones instead due to my personal perceptions....the big ones always leave my piece with vapor sadly flowing out endlessly and my puddles seem to be gone so much faster in relation to not only time, but also effects produced....plus, I can more easily cap the carb on short draws....maybe I'm overthinking all of this and getting it all backwards?


QUOTE=zephyr;14122604]^ This might sound stupid but if you have a too large hit and cant pass it on to a mate, keep a balloon handy and exhale in it. It works. Lol[/QUOTE]

I've actually wondered about something like this, and have even heard it anecdotally.....been unsure of it though (partially why it hasn't been attempted) since it's not really something that humans seem to find worth investigating and recording of information in evidence-based terms on any official/credited level.....though, I suppose I haven't looked very hard on this one, perhaps it's worth it to peek around...that is, if it's actually of noticeable benefit.


I've never even been witness to anyone in my circles doing this either....nor even mentioned. But could be several reasons for this.


I would logically assume it recrystalizes within the balloon, then is required to be extracted from balloon, correct?


Would it be possible to blow hit, hold inside balloon until believed to have been recrystalized, release air from balloon (WITHOUT RELEASING THE GOODS) in order to follow up with another hit blown into balloon, and so on? Or would releasing the air be unviable or impossible without releasing crystal....?


Also, after you've blown however much into balloon, you have to cut it open and scrape it....or what?


I wonder if there might actually be a more efficient and convenient way of applying this concept than with balloons? Just first thought off top of head......gallon ziplocks? I'm sure I could come up with better though....preferably something where air pressure is of no concern, something that would release the air- which zip obviously wouldn't do unless open (but perhaps no problem anyway?), but it'd be much easier to scrape a zip than a balloon, I imagine.....


OR do you mean simply to exhale into balloon and immediately re-inhale the contents, hopeful to still be in vapor form?


Sorry for such detailed inquiries, bored heh. Seems like always something new to learn in this particular hobby hahaha.

Speaking of, and on another note, I mainly came back into this thread today to get some opinions on cleaning (tweak pipe/pizzle/oil burner/bubble- just the typical piece no matter your name preference).....I'm curious about both the thin glass, but more presently important, thick pyrex.....anyone have good recommendations or preferences for this chore required on rare occasion when circumstances prohibit purchase of a new piece temporarily some other circumstance requires?

Preferably multiple options for different situations with AND without a decent supply of tools at disposal, etc....


I've got my own preferred tools and techniques but they have been proven either unviable or inadequate at inopportune moments, too many times to be acceptable....so some time-tested methods from within the community would certainly be nice.


One thing I've pondered just recently is whether a cleansing solution designed for weed pipes (sold at head/smoke shops-a liquid with some sort of sandy substance in it, basically just put in weed pipe, shake, presto clean- ya know) would be of any use in this application....but my main concern being that it could very well be too rough for use in a tweak pipe....thoughts? Or god forbid, some of the cleaning agent resides within your piece without your knowledge and gives ya a nice, possibly poisonous, treat next time you go for a spin.....hmm any thoughts, opinions, experience on this at all?


There's some crafty motherfuckers around my way, folks that know every which way to fix even the most seemingly unfixable of broken pipes, but cleaning.....heh. I haven't seen much to really impress me. Guess availability might contribute to this apparent lack of skill, but then why the unmatched repair skills.....? Hmm.

Regardless, best, highly regarded, proven cleaning preferences and tips, GO.

Much appreciated all.


***********************************************************************


One more thing I've wondered for a little while is whether any of you have actually seen recrystalized puddle outside the confines of glass or what have you as your vaping apparatus?


I never have actually attempted to intentionally try, though I may have seen some spilled on the ground before....but can't be certain with that obviously, coulda been anything even though it seemed very likely.


I'm simply curious as to the appearance, maybe even feel of it? Sounds weird question I know, but who knows if it could come in handy someday in an event that a sizeable bit took a leap and escaped lol or something.


I'm obviously aware it's going to change its perceivable qualities progressively as you progress through your session and the current puddle gets used up, but maybe someone has seen enough of its transformation forms to describe enough of them, or at least has a very good general description applicable to almost any of its possible forms?

Seeing it through glass simply does it absolutely no justice, at least not to my eyes. It looks far different that way if you all never noticed lol.

A detailed description would be cool if not too much trouble for someone.


I do have some concern with this possibly bordering substance id......but since I'm not attempting to ascertain any notions in regards to purity or authenticity of a substance, hopefully this is judged to be within acceptability by mods? If not, no hard feelings if removal is deemed necessary. I can see how such an inquiry could possibly hold some minimal chance of having problematic/troublesome repercussions for some folks (though shouldn't to a non-HR level of repercussion to my mind).....but seems far too unlikely, and overreaching, but maybe I'll stand corrected and gladly accept.


Otherwise, appreciate all input to whichever question to which you may have valuable knowledge, thanks as always everyone.

If I understand your lost correctly , I live in the east coast (NY) and we have crystal meth, however the purity seems pretty bad, however when i smoke it, it recrusyallizes right. back into crystal and it very clean with barely an odor. I noticed extreme psychosis and scary hallucintions. Which I passed off as lack of sleep perhaps.

Ppl are so into smoking and sniffing this stuff but eating it really does work. Be careful tho eating too much and it hits 20min later like a ton of bricks.. kinda like certain extasy pills but those methbomb e's usually only have 10,20,30mg max in them... if u bomb a whole lot it will send u flyin. Back in the day i used to like bombing a pt or two, hitting a small toothpick sized line 5min-10min or so after and then as its all kicking in around t+20min take out the old oil burner and huff down a few big puffs... gives iv a run for its money lol bu the comedown is fucking terrible

You want to avoid first-pass metabolism because of tolerance from the interaction between the active metabolite and it, so you will need more and more if you eat it and so on because of cross-tolerance that does not occur with IV or whatever...I just read a weird post here about someone missing a vein, but you can sub-q subcutaneously, away from the torso because of veins that will send it into your stomach, so in your arm somewhere fore or leg.  There is a risk but it is a result of (police) deterrent and not a result of the drug or drug purity.  Try mica, for deterrent (anyone who says eating it IMO a 'cop').-

Have not read a lot of these posts but there are two kinds, the shake is probably 'as salt' the other one is 'anhydrous prep' the stuff that knocks you out if you have had too much of the other one, otherwise it increases focus and concentration but not ADHD or Oppositional, it is the freebase...If you can take the real L-form first, then the freebase, that one, then the D-shake, the deterrent cannot distinguish between the molecules, and if you keep taking it, it never can (but u have to keep using!) sp.

I don't feel like reading all the posts right now, but I've given up the steel until my arms heal enough that I can use them without so much fuss. Yes, through experience now, I realize that swallowing it is an absolute decent ROA. Naturally, it takes more than it would with a shot, but it's easier on my body, and theoretically, I'll never lose my "supplier." Whoever it was that said eating it tells them, in their opinion, that they're a cop, that's just an ignorant statement that holds no kind of weight. Not even getting into all of it, but I've given over 5 years of my life, so far, to the United states government, in the form of incarceration. I normally wouldn't even acknowledge the statement, but that's just as offensive to me as if you called my mother a cum guzzling whore. Anyway, been swallowing it, 3 or 4 times a day, and actually doing pretty good, so it's worked out for now. Be safe kiddies!

With ADHD and a small stint in rehab a few years back for something unrelated, its almost impossible to get a prescription. I tend to need more than an average user, but Im not so sure its as dangerous as a lot ofthese posts and statements say. 


Im more angry and cant eat when i dont have it than when im able to get it. My sleep schedule usually starts to change when im able to get it, though. Always takes adjustments when youre moving frequently and dont have reliable medicine sources. 


Lifes tough, I just mean it isnt as harmful as some want you to beieve. Factual education is usually more affective than scare tactics.

After having a full-blown [tonic clonic seizure (report)](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/831298-(Cocaine-250mg-IV)-Experienced-Seizures-hallucinations-I-am-a-disgrace)on IV cocaine I decided against injecting meth. Real shame, but I am worried this could happen again. :/


No more IV MDMA or other stimulants for me either, probably not even psychedelics. All that is left is the occasional dissociative dose now. I suppose that is a good thing.

My two cents....I was looking on here for a post along this theme actually, due to recent events.

Nothing under the sun is new.

That being said, nothing that can be made by man, especially from materials gathered/produced on this planet, are "unnatural", not really.

We are made in His image. He is a creator. Things on earth are a reflection of the state of things in the Heavens, or spiritual realm. But because Satan is lord of the Earth, they are often a severely distorted reflection.

I believe that IV'ing meth over the course of a year, opened a conduit to the Divine in myself. Strange things started happening that I could not explain. And I knew they were not psychosis. Others could observe the things themselves, but frustratingly (enraging, actually, over time) denied their significance or failed to validate my experience as concerning, and would because scared of me, scream at me, kick me out (no matter how I modified my attempts to ask for help or explain what was going on).

Then God flat out talked to me one night. I used to be a born again Christian. I had left the faith, had been somewhere between agnostic/atheist for years. More recently, without realizing it, I had begun to basically commit idolatry of material possessions, and in general had allowed that feeling of letting life batter me around, rather than taking any control of my own circumstances. To give myself some credit, though, I was also letting my intuition guide me. My work was making me more unhappy than I realized, and though the financial situation I allowed to develop was by no means a "good" idea, or responsible, I decided, "fuck it". I don't want to work right now. Therefore, no. I'm just not going to apply to three jobs a week to get unemployment, because....I don't want to.

After God talked to me (we had the most amazing, true communication, combination of words and powerful powerful love feelings. And light. God seems able to get my attention through LED's). He did seem to be a male presence to me, hence why I oddly just naturally express the presence as Him, our Father. The most surprising and amazing miracle of all, to me, was just the simple realization that He was saying, once I just "knew" WHO it was producing these new thoughts in my head that night, in front of that light in a random apartment complex I was walking through on the way to my car, yes, Holly. It's me. THAT me. YES. I'm real. Yes, it was me you were talking to all those years ago when you were a faithful Christian. Yes. It's all true. All of it. Yes, you are right. I would not be talking to you unless there were some very important reasons. You are called, you are chosen. me: why me, God? (0h, my gosh, everybody you talk to must say that, right? holy wow). Him: Yes, of course they do. You have faith like a child. You always have. It's gotten you hurt; I'm sorry. Don't worry about anything. I'm always with you.


After that, a lot of terrifying things began to happen. But magnificent things, too. I realized after a few weeks, the terrifying things primarily, that I thought at first were human caused (so I kept looking for logical explanations, which actually made the possibilities MORE terrifying, because the only entity I could come up with powerful enough to effect the things I was experiencing was a vast network of coordinated persecution, such as the mafia or a Russian/Chinese conglomerate and I'd been thrown under the bus by someone). But the thing is, I WAS NOT in psychosis. I KNEW I was not important enough to warrant being singled out that way, so it just didn't make sense. But it was basically ruining my (so called) life. Or at least, the life I had built for myself. The one I'd been taught is "right" (i.e. having a smart phone, having credit cards, a place to live, any music or movie I wanted to watch or enjoy at a moment's notice, being able to drown out the unpleasant intrusions of the world with headphones instead of dealing with them. Not talking to "strangers". Drinking/smoking myself to sleep. Not ever having to ask others for help because by golly, I'm independent and I don't have to/want to. Having to accept others limitations and inadequacies, especially when asking for their help. I guess that would be, learning to be kind and patient. In the face of never having a moment's peace or quiet, none of the privacy or solitude that I had previously enjoyed and valued and created for myself. That was all taken away practically in an instant. And I never saw it coming.

Even when I realized that God is real, all that "stuff" in the Bible is, actually, REAL! BELIEVE IT IT'S IMPORTANT! I didn't know Satan and demons had this actual kind of power. Shoot, or were ACTUALLY real beings/characters/"people", or even semi-gods if you will. They can read my mind, because noises and things in the environment will respond INSTANTLY to my thoughts. As in, it's comical. THAT is what made me realize it could not be human caused. I've had others try to convince me that there is some sort of human technology which could achieve this. (again why would I be THAT important?) I've also contemplated, and at times even been convinced or very scared that, I'm in a coma and this is all a dream, and the coma is the reason I can't wake up from the dream. That maybe once my brain heals there is a chance for me to wake up. I've screamed out loud to the night from a sidewalk in front of a closed dry cleaner's business, "get me out! don't pull the plug! I'm still heeeeeere!" Then, I thought that maybe I'm in some kind of purgatory, or a second-chance, testing-center kind of place. In which case, when did I die? What the heck happened to me and why don't I remember what happened? Well, I know now that that's not true in the way that I thought. But really, we did all die. When Adam and Eve sinned. That is actually what the Bible says. And Earth, this "so called" life? Well, actually....it is our testing ground. Do we love our Creator and want to live with Him forever, as He intended when He created us? Because He by no means does not want to force us, that was never His intention. It has to be a choice. So we have the time that we have, and Satan unfortunately will fuck with you all the harder if you are on a spiritual path, because that likely means that God is using you for a divine purpose (I believe He can do this even with those vessels/people who don't necessarily believe in Him, if they are true and good people, perhaps also if he is trying to get THEIR attention because He knows they are lost and seeking, or need to be seeking, Him). Because many many in this world do not believe in the unseen anymore. Science is not BAD, it's cool that we have learned how to explore and explain the mechanisms by which God created this world and universe, the laws of physics that govern things (USUALLY), those very same laws that, at times, God can manipulate to our shock and awe and wonder (parting the ocean for thousands of former slaves to escape their torment, for example; raising the dead, for another). He does those things because he knows that it is difficult for us to feel and have faith in the unseen, especially when so many of us are so traumatized by the machinations of the evil one walking the earth. 

So try shifting your obsession away from the demons and Satan (but I wanted to validate your experience as very, very, real. Just realize that if you are hip to those beings, then don't forget the flip side of that coin, because WOW! It's amazing!) Put your faith in Jesus Christ, who won the ultimate victory over him on the Cross. Truly. I would not say it, unless I knew it to be true. I threw all three of my Bibles away when I was 18. Now I'm 36. And I intend to walk with Him every day as long as He sees fit to keep me here. Do not confuse this with me saying, that it means I have to be "clean" to do so. (God makes us all clean when He forgives our sins...you just have to ask Him for the gift that was given when Jesus gave His life as a sacrifice for that purpose). But God does want us to take care of ourselves and be careful. So moderate use of the substances that help us, I believe, may be within the realm of not sinning against him, per se, but yes, it's a slippery slope. Obviously the Bible commands against "drunkenness", but Jesus turned water to wine and it is consumed routinely in the Bible and not prohibited per se. Many questions exist for Christians as well as non-Christians regarding what is ok and what is not. Hence, part of the reason for so many Christian denominations, so much confusion and apparently contradiction between the message that reaches the world, especially to non-believers. No wonder people get frustrated and want nothing to do with it. But that is not GOD. That is HUMAN, poor understanding, and sometimes well-intentioned witnessing that actually misleads or pushes people away from God and the Church. There are true believers in many good congregations, many good pastors who are good shepherds, if you look. But it only takes one bad experience, sometimes, to convince someone that all Christianity is a farce. "Christians are just a bunch of close-minded hippocrits". Well, Christians are just people. You know some good ones, you know some bad ones. You know some people who honestly make an about face in their life, you know others who say they have, who really haven't. Some are out for themselves, some are manipulators. Some do things that hurt others, that even they themselves don't understand why. Many of us do things that hurt OURSELVES and we don't understand why. And some people are selfless and stop to help a stranger and ask for nothing in return. Both Christians/believers as well as non-believers act out these characteristics every day. But God is not inconsistent or flakey. He is not iffy. And he doesn't want to hurt us or punish us. It is Satan and His dominion that accomplishes that. Granted, since this all happens in the unseen realm, we only see the effects, and Satan is the master imitator. So understandably, many attribute the cruelties of Satan to God, or use them as proof that God doesn't exist (why would a loving God allow x, y, z to happen....well, read the Book! It talks ALL about JUST THAT VERY THING. That's why he gave us the Word!!!! Yet we keep going, why why why, without ever even thinking to crack the cover. Isn't that funny, when you stop to think about it? or what I call, #funny/notfunny).

There's no god, and you are hallucinating. 


Allegedly religious delusions may be from VMAT2 activation.

Others could observe the things themselves, but frustratingly (enraging, actually, over time) denied their significance or failed to validate my experience as concerning, and would because scared of me, scream at me, kick me out (no matter how I modified my attempts to ask for help or explain what was going on).
> 
> Then God flat out talked to me one night. I used to be a born again Christian. I had left the faith, had been somewhere between agnostic/atheist for years. More recently, without realizing it, I had begun to basically commit idolatry of material possessions, and in general had allowed that feeling of letting life batter me around, rather than taking any control of my own circumstances. To give myself some credit, though, I was also letting my intuition guide me. My work was making me more unhappy than I realized, and though the financial situation I allowed to develop was by no means a "good" idea, or responsible, I decided, "fuck it". I don't want to work right now. Therefore, no. I'm just not going to apply to three jobs a week to get unemployment, because....I don't want to.
> 
> After God talked to me (we had the most amazing, true communication, combination of words and powerful powerful love feelings. And light. God seems able to get my attention through LED's). He did seem to be a male presence to me, hence why I oddly just naturally express the presence as Him, our Father. The most surprising and amazing miracle of all, to me, was just the simple realization that He was saying, once I just "knew" WHO it was producing these new thoughts in my head that night, in front of that light in a random apartment complex I was walking through on the way to my car, yes, Holly. It's me. THAT me. YES. I'm real. Yes, it was me you were talking to all those years ago when you were a faithful Christian. Yes. It's all true. All of it. Yes, you are right. I would not be talking to you unless there were some very important reasons. You are called, you are chosen. me: why me, God? (0h, my gosh, everybody you talk to must say that, right? holy wow). Him: Yes, of course they do. You have faith like a child. You always have. It's gotten you hurt; I'm sorry. Don't worry about anything. I'm always with you.

> After that, a lot of terrifying things began to happen. But magnificent things, too. I realized after a few weeks, the terrifying things primarily, that I thought at first were human caused (so I kept looking for logical explanations, which actually made the possibilities MORE terrifying, because the only entity I could come up with powerful enough to effect the things I was experiencing was a vast network of coordinated persecution, such as the mafia or a Russian/Chinese conglomerate and I'd been thrown under the bus by someone). But the thing is, I WAS NOT in psychosis. I KNEW I was not important enough to warrant being singled out that way, so it just didn't make sense. But it was basically ruining my (so called) life. Or at least, the life I had built for myself. The one I'd been taught is "right" (i.e. having a smart phone, having credit cards, a place to live, any music or movie I wanted to watch or enjoy at a moment's notice, being able to drown out the unpleasant intrusions of the world with headphones instead of dealing with them. Not talking to "strangers". Drinking/smoking myself to sleep. Not ever having to ask others for help because by golly, I'm independent and I don't have to/want to. Having to accept others limitations and inadequacies, especially when asking for their help. I guess that would be, learning to be kind and patient. In the face of never having a moment's peace or quiet, none of the privacy or solitude that I had previously enjoyed and valued and created for myself. That was all taken away practically in an instant. And I never saw it coming.
> 
> Even when I realized that God is real, all that "stuff" in the Bible is, actually, REAL! BELIEVE IT IT'S IMPORTANT! I didn't know Satan and demons had this actual kind of power. Shoot, or were ACTUALLY real beings/characters/"people", or even semi-gods if you will. They can read my mind, because noises and things in the environment will respond INSTANTLY to my thoughts. As in, it's comical. THAT is what made me realize it could not be human caused. I've had others try to convince me that there is some sort of human technology which could achieve this. (again why would I be THAT important?) I've also contemplated, and at times even been convinced or very scared that, I'm in a coma and this is all a dream, and the coma is the reason I can't wake up from the dream. That maybe once my brain heals there is a chance for me to wake up. I've screamed out loud to the night from a sidewalk in front of a closed dry cleaner's business, "get me out! don't pull the plug! I'm still heeeeeere!" Then, I thought that maybe I'm in some kind of purgatory, or a second-chance, testing-center kind of place. In which case, when did I die? What the heck happened to me and why don't I remember what happened? Well, I know now that that's not true in the way that I thought. But really, we did all die. When Adam and Eve sinned.

Lul. I have read that extended post, on three separate occasions now, once buzzing and stoned and then just extremely stoned, and now as i read it drunker then a skunk, it finally makes sense. There's something to this. I can understand why he is talking like that and where it coming from and why hes being so intense about it. But it jut doesnt make sense. He has probably come down by now (hopefully). Nothin wrong with being so passionate about a religion (err...) but wow just wow. I forgot meth could get a person so high to think like that. Its not even about the religion - just the intensity of the thoughts and how they are interlaced / dispersed amongst each other. If that makes sense. Because this can happen with anything the user considers "important - life or death" type of thing, not just religion. Seems interesting enough though. It cant be "haha - crazies ranting on about religion again". If I'm not mistaken, TAAR1 receptor modulates religious experiences in some individuals, not to mention downstream effects by serotonin et. al. Its a switch that can be flicked on and off, not anything more than that.

I'm curious Mr. 704, why'd you decide the stuff in the Bible was real, but not the Bhagavad Gita?


When I'm really high I tend to just see pure horror everywhere, and the emptiness that is the real Truth.  Oblivion awaits us all.


ETA: I didn't mean that to sound so dramatic.

God the emails I've written. I remember one occasion when I was gonna tell a fellow med student that I'd bring a USB stick to uni the next day and ended up writing pages over pages of cryptic gibberish. Looking through that email, some of the wording was actually pretty clever. That poor guy had never seen a joint in his life and barely knew me. Fortunately I was able to blame mania and he kept it a secret.


Yeah, I tend to write emails. Not just to random friends and acquaintances, but also to my dad, lawyers, scientists or gouvernment institutions - even to the police on one occasion. I've also written what must have been the most absurd job applications the world has ever seen in that state.

Mod, please move this as appropriate!

2 things, same meth dealer. Got half an amount fronted, balance of product remitted with payment the following day. Started to pay the price for the whole amont, realized etiquette might best be served by paying total of two half amounts. Made friend.

10 days later, stranded, no gas. 

Dealer now friend came with beverage and $12.75. 

Faith in humanity restored!

I'm having difficulty locating the previous forum I was on, and after 30 attempts I successfully joined, so I'm a bit new to this...

I'm seeking information regarding a possible arterial injection in the bend of the elbow of my left arm...

It happened quite some time ago, and it was my only injection site at the time as I'm cursed with bad veins to start with and my hands are quite unsteady, so I didn't yet feel comfortable injecting with my left hand.

Anyway, I had been using this spot for several weeks, with no injury or worry, and I'm not a frequent injector, or I wasn't at the time, perhaps 3-5 times a week. I always practice safe and sterile injection as well, though none of my friends seem to practice caution in that department. 

On this fateful day, however, I injected in my familiar area, the inside bend of my left arm, right at the elbow, and it felt as if I stabbed myself in the flesh with a sword and tore through every muscle on the way to the other side..

I continued to inject as I was reassured I had not punctured an artery, and because it was methamphetamine we were injecting, I was put at ease by being informed it was just some dope on the bell of the point and that was the cause for my pain. Reluctantly, I continued...and immediately regretted the decision...

The pain was astounding, I hardly felt the shot at all, and pretty much instantly my arm began to swell and turn red, and I began to lose feeling at the site of injection. I immediately grew concerned and began massaging the growth and alternating hot/cool wet rags accompanied with pressure;To no avail. The next morning I could not move my arm. At all. Without being in excruciating pain. I was too embarrassed to go to the E.R., but knew if my condition worsened it would be inevitable, so I rested the entire day. The next day, my condition began to ease, and show signs of improvement. My question is, why did this happen when I had been injecting in this same spot with no incident, did nothing differently, but had such a horrible reaction? I'm fairly certain I either punctured and injected an artery, or perhaps I collapsed a vein?? It's been 4 months since the incident and I still can not refer to this injection site. Thoughts??? I apologize this was so long. I'm new, have mercy on me!?

Hello, I'm new on here and just wanted to add what knowledge I may have, perhaps it will help someone.

Meth has never been my DOC. I prefer opiates and benzodiazepines. However, meth is cheap and readily available where I reside, all of my friends divulged, so it was inevitable I would try it as well. I snorted it, got sick to my stomach. I smoked it, got a sore throat. So then I had my friend, who is a CNA and has easy access to clean needles, supply me with equipment. The IV method has since been what I favor, and it's ALWAYS done properly, in a cleanly manner, and I take my time sterilizing. This is not the case with my brother and some others I know...

They are completely junked out and will spend their last 5 dollars on a shot, even do what they call a "rinse" constantly, where they just filter through old cotton and residue on spoons and other paraphernalia, which I find completely disgusting and pathetic. It also suggests they are addicted to the needle; not the drug. I'm not a frequent user, and I can manage without it just fine. I do enjoy the high and extra energy on occasion also, but I maintain control. I've watched people lose everything they have. It's difficult to fathom for me... but it happens. If you're hellbent on banging this drug, there are a few things you should know; if the drug does not easily dissolve in cold water and after drawing up the mix you are left with a large amount of questionable residue in the spoon, and you don't draw up anywhere near what you mixed, PLEASE THROW. IT. OUT. It's bad dope. What you are seeing left behind is God knows what, used as a filler to add weight without losing drug for the dealer. Twice the amount of money and to hell with who it harms, even kills. Greed is deadly. ALWAYS know your supplier. Furthermore, never inject into an artery. If the vein has a pulse DO NOT PROCEED. It's very dangerous. If you pull back the plunger and notice the blood is bright red and is rushing into the chamber you are in an artery. Also, and this is common sense, NEVER use ANYTHING twice, and NEVER EVER share equipment. Take the time to sterilize, do NOT let some moron convince you "one time won't hurt" because it never stops at just "one time" I've seen it turn out very tragically for some I know...well....KNEW...

And lastly, ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS dispose of your syringes in a responsible manner after ONE use. Simply because you choose to inject your drug does NOT mean innocent bystanders should suffer. Used needles can end up in the clutches of children, or ANYONE for that matter. Please be responsible.

There's one last bit of advice I can leave you with; if you are someone who would easily lose control over this drug or method of use, PLEASE, don't ever do it. Clean equipment is not provided via pharmacy no questions asked everywhere you go. It most certainly isn't where I'm from. You must have a prescription vial for insulin in order to receive syringes where I'm from by pharmacies, they can even call the police if they suspect you are an IV drug user, which I feel is completely WRONG and promotes diseases. I had a good friend. Knew him for 16 years. He couldn't control himself on the drug, or the needle. He WAS a rich guy well respected from a prestigious city. He now has nothing, no one, and lives at a homeless shelter and his mind is completely gone. NOTHING is worth that life! Be safe, be healthy. Much love to you all.

Hey all, so this dog my neighbor walks uses a water pipe to smoke some of that ice. Now, recently that dog added essential oils to the water in the setup (one drop peppermint & one drop of eucalyptus). Now, using the water for that zooty zump, is that super bad due to the highly concentrated nature of the essential oils? Also when inhaling through the water pipe, does the essential oil interact with the ice at all?

Please drop the dog thing, it's obvious you're talking about yourself, and offers no legal protection. Is it bad/does it interact with the meth vapor that's being filtered through the water? I really don't know anything about essential oils, but I really can't imagine why anyone would add it to their meth bong water.

No SWIMing and no dogs allowed, except for actual meth-bonging, essential-oil huffing ones, which, though you may scoff, do exist; one of them behind me right now.  All the shards on my fingers and floor and desk and bathroom and kitchen, it's no wonder the cat is jumping at random spots on the wall at 3:30am and my dog seems to be talking to her self.  


Then again, I'm pretty high too, so it might be just me.  Anyway, adding oils seems really weird to me.  I still can't get the stale-toothpaste minty taste out of my mouth after using old nicotine gum to seal the holes in the plastic peanut cannister I used for my DIY mark 1 meth bong.


BUT, the meth molecule isn't very reactive by itself, it's fairly inert and stable.  Essential oils are, y'know, oils.  Meth-HCl, being charged, would stay with the water phase and never interact with the water-fearing oils.


BUT BUT, sorry "dog", you bring up a great and, in fact, timely mystery around vaping meth.  An open question that a real chemist could answer real fast: what is the protonation state of the meth when it leaves your bowl?  Sure, it's the acid salt you put in your bowl, not the base.  But there's some issues with vaping a salt, and the possibility of meth ***base*** actually vaporizing along with tooth-rotting **HCl gas**.  These would possibly recombine on the way down the pipe and into your lungs.​

This makes the feasibility and yields of drawing the vapor through water questionable.  If the meth is the protonated, acid form, it's water soluble.  You're leaving all your drugs behind in the bong water.  If it's in fact predominately in the base form, it would not dissolve in the water.  At a different time months ago while high, I proposed an experiment wherein the pH change of the water after a long session could be used to answer this question.  And a multimeter could be used as a pH meter.


Well, I tried to DIY the vapor in my bong to actually pass through water, but there were multiple issues with my designs, and I barely escaped with only one reflux explosion.


So I don't know if it would interact with the water or the oils.  But, even if it was in the oil phase, I doubt either inert compound will react.  Personally, I wouldn't want to huff that much essential oil.  Keep in mind this is 400F gas hitting it, too.  There are anecdotes of kids and pets getting sick from concentrated tea tree oil.  I'd stick to one toxic vapor at a time, mainly the one that gets you high.


---
☼


**EDIT:** to those who say, why are you bonging if your bong has no (actually a tiny bit) water?  How is it a bong?  Well, it's just a chamber so that 200C jet of vapor doesn't keep searing a hole in my tongue.  I have a broken pipe bowl with a bend going into a mason jar, with a plastic straw to draw from.  Tiny puddle of water on the bottom, keeps things moist and lets me get the full lung-full massive draws and subsequent fog banks I deserve.  Yes I'm proud of my new arts&crafts baby.


Also, as stated, the question of how much you'd leave behind in the water is an open question (for me).  In a weed bong, it's actually filtering particulates; the oily THC goes right through.  Not necessarily the case with meth, which (should) have no particulates to filter.

I can't help but think that the oils in the bong make for a horrible taste on the inhale. Does it, OP?

I'm not an IV user but have suffered headaches after dosing other routes before. Was usually due to being dehydrated and/or malnurished from neglecting to eat. Or sometimes I had just been on a run for too long and the doses needed were just getting too high, so the headaches meant I needed a break for a few days.

Awful headaches right after any ROA is a sign something's wrong, unless it's trepanning, in which case, probably right method, but not an ROA I'd recommend.  


I'd try to stick with smoking for a bit, see if it still happens.

For what it's worth. I'm gonna write this to help anyone considering coming off of meth. I used to do meth for about 5 years. It completely ruined my mind. Turned me into a paranoid wreck. 

It made me have bizarre delusions and I had many embarrassing hospitals visits as a result of it. Meth psychosis lasts much longer after you quit doing meth. 

I was smoking and switched to IV when I picked it up again because of a roomate that was staying with me. It will def ruin you brain guys. Please get out of it and stop doing it as soon as you can. Meth will make you crazy.

^I hear you bro been thru the same damn thing, clean for about 6 months and haven't been a daily user for two years but still struggle. I turned to alcohol after realizing I could never possibly touch meth again if I wanted to retain any shred of sanity, and gave myself some type of anxiety disorder. Along with an intense paranoia that strikes out of nowhere. Not in the stereotypical schitzo hearing voices hallucinating etc but sometimes I become 100% convinced that something terrible out of my control is about to happen. Kinda like panic attacks with an element of residual meth psychosis I guess. Nowadays I mostly smoke weed and it has helped alot. I can no longer touch coffee it sends me into a panic attack. I used to be a speed freak and never thought i would get off it but the anxiety and paranoia did my head in until I had some sober time and decided enough is enough. Still have drug dreams and cravings but slowly going back to normal.

**End your methamphetamine addiction with ibogaine**


The first and most important requirement is that you have to be 100%   ready to be done with drugs — that you are mentally, emotionally,   spiritually and physically ready to fully surrender yourself and accept plant medicine healing in your life. You have to   know what you want and mean it. Ibogaine will work for you only if you   are ready. **


If you are not ready to take full responsibility over your life and choices, then ibogaine treatment is not for you. **


Methamphetamine is a poison that acts as a stimulant but then begins to   systematically destroy the body. Meth releases high levels of dopamine   when ingested and then blocks the normal

flow of dopamine in the absence  of the drug. This involves the reward   system that regulates pleasure, happiness, motivation, energy, and   functional ability. Meth changes the way the brain functions; and the   brain becomes dependent on the drug to survive. Prolonged meth  abuse  brings with it serious health conditions including memory  loss,  aggression, psychotic behavior and potential heart and brain  damage  depleting the bodys resources, The physical effects start to   deteriorate the body from the inside out, creating a devastating   dependence that can only be relieved by taking more of the drug.**


Ibogaine methamphetamine detox therapy: What to expect**


At the heart of all addictions, it first began on a spiritual and   emotional level. This is the also why many rehabilitation programs such   as the twelve-step program have proven unsuccessful 

in the long term  because traditional detox therapies only work to heal  the physical  level, where the current rate of success is about 1% - 7%.  Too many  people who have been through these expensive and ineffective  programs  end up with a sense of despair, and even a sense of personal  failure.   Most rehabilitation centers and western society in general,  are not  aware that humans exist in 3 worlds: physical, mental &  spiritual.  While there are on-going support groups for addicts trying  to kick their  habit, symptoms of withdrawal can be so overwhelming that  attempts to  discontinue the drug often end in failure.


Physically ibogaine works to relieve symptoms of withdrawal such as   sweating, itchy skin, shakes, and twitches that users of meth often feel   after the drug has worn off.  Patients that have used ibogaine for  treating meth addiction report a complete absence of physical  symptoms  once treatment is over. Ibogaine works by resetting neurotransmitters in  the brain. It also works as 

a psycho-spiritual tool  that helps the person look deeply into his /  her past to find the root  problem of their addiction. Addicts are  usually victims  of deep emotional traumas who are seeking to find an  escape of this through  their drug of choice. The key to breaking your  addiction to meth is understanding this:**


Ibogaine takes you on a deep introspective  psychological journey  that allows you to forgive others who have hurt you as well as forgive  yourself for things you have done that you  regret and continue to carry  with you. **


Ibogaine therapy can  provide individuals with critical insights into  the origins of their  addiction. This is the key  to full recovery:  digging up and reviewing the roots of addiction. These  profound  realizations contribute to full recovery and a deep new found   appreciation for ones life. Once the iboga has broken your addiction,   the next step is to rebuild the body and mind with nutritional  medicine  and supplements. It is this extra step that can increase the  chances  of a lifelong recovery from addiction. While ibogaine is not  successful  100% of the time, estimates from the various clinics range  between 70%  to 80% in terms of the number of people who successfully use  iboga to  get off drugs permanently, which, let's face it, is amazing.


The difference between your success or  failure will depend on whether you are


1. Committed to the  process of recovery 

2. Committed to removing yourself from your previous  environment

I appreciate the sincerity in this thread, meth is ultimately the the worst dead end street that won't take your life with the convenience of an overdose like other drugs do, and that I suppose is a good thing because it has kept us all here. 


headaches from meth, and I would imagine shooting would make this instantaneous, are sometimes directly related to the tension in certain muscles around the neck and head. take some benzos and you might notice it go away. this has happened to me many many times. 


also thanks for the lecture on Ibogaine and recovery but I think we're aware of it by now. It got William S. Burroughs off of heroin, but he went back to the needle life in maybe ten more years. It's not entirely safe either; I knew of a guy trying it at a clinic in Mexico to get off heroin and the Ibogaine caused a heart attach of sorts, and he died right then and there. Suppose his intention was where it ought have been tho....

Hi everyone, 

ive a question. I’m a heroin addict who is on suboxone maintenance. I’ve been back to meth after many years, always IV. I have never had the “rush” people talk about, and I wouldn’t particularly describe it as euphoric. I’m certainly wired and chatty (if not alone), I’m wondering if the suboxone is blocking some of the euphoria. Anyway, I’ve never had the cough either. I do have needle fever, a fascination with the ritual of shooting up. I try not to redose but I always do, even if there’s barely any dope and mostly water. I keep redosing to seek that euphoric feeling I know I won’t get, partly just to do it. I get a rush from seeing the register in my rig once I’m in a vein. Often I end up doing WAY, WAY more than I can handle. Instead of cleaning the house as planned, I spend hours combing forums for reassurance I’m not going to have a heart attack. any thoughts?

well, i'm sure a lot of us can certainly relate to these behaviors of yours, but if your question is whether or not suboxone is keeping you from getting that rush you expecting (had you experienced before, pre-suboxone? cuz you say then that you have never had "the rush").....some people just don't get the same rush from meth as others, or else it's your own brain that 's too depleted of dopamine to provide you with one. I never felt much of one when I tried IV, but ten again I didn't try very hard (low doses). i had a friend once whose drug of choice was crack, but after he moved back home he switched to meth, and after years of meth smoking he got into the needle thru heroin, and the needle when it came to meth he said it just wasnt that good. this could have been because he was most used to the rush of crack and heroin that had gotten him axquainted with those rushes. I def recall him saying that shooting up a syprup of a gram pf meth only produced the sensation similar to what you describe, instant inpleasant heart attack feeling. but seriously, try replenishing dopamine first. get some sleep and eat a few meals and do a bit of exercise. you'll have more brain to rush you...


also its pretty common to start out thinking you're becoming a productive human while on speed, then find yourself combing the forums looking up the keys to a success life,every morning....then missing out on it in the process

Does anyone know about the effects on the body when iving meth while you have walking pneumonia and an infected root canal? Im on strong antibiotics. But i just used and now (of course (not before)) im thinking about if its safe with what im going through or what i might be faceing for the next day or two while i come down. Any information would be extremely helpful if even just to eaze my high mind tonight. Thank you ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Ive had that happen a few times it came happen for a few different reasons. Either its cut with something that makes that batch seem to make you experience that reaction or it can also happen if your on a binge and been up for more then even only 24hrs. Which sounds funny because when im on shitm up for days but the longer u are awake and the more often the binges are the more of a chance for a random shoot like this. Or its could also be you just need food and lots of fluids. I know for me some shoots more then others cause me to be more dehydrated and once i get the water i need the headache goes away but also try to make sure u eat if u dont feel like it due to being high because in the long run the come down will feel so much better and your high will probably even improve suprisingly because you wont come down as fast.

You should be fine, man. The comedown though is where your immune system is lowered.. and the meth/active cuts may mess somewhat with antibiotics (or vice versa) because alot of antibiotics tend to be hard on the liver. This affects ppl differently though, like one person could have an adverse reaction another can be fine. Kinda like playing with fire, which is what meth already is.


To whoever mentioned bupe/meth combos, the only time this has been good was when i was still taking bupe to get high. Would crush up 1/8 of a 8mg and put it in a line with some meth. The effect was somewhat nice but blunted... i.e. i couldn't really feel anything and would end up staring at the wall/zoning out for hours. Once I was actually dependent on the bupe to feel "alright" shortly after waking up, it mostly served to blunt my meth high. I was a really raw type of user though and very irresponsible, hard to describe it, but my 2-3 day iv benders would only be curtailed by how tired/terrible I felt, I'd be cottonmouthed like crazy and spun out of my damn mind, unable to even take a sip of water without forcing it down until 24 hours after my last hit simply because how much I was doing and how strongly it was affecting me.. and I would be able to recover over the next week or two. So when I really couldn't feel shit due to high daily amounts of bupe, I felt free to smoke as much as I pleased "for real", which was terrible because I ended up frying my brain ten times over.


The most euphoric rush I've ever had was IV meth + quality black tar h. You dont really need that much meth at all, perhaps 1/3 of what you put for the h. Rushes were insane. But insanely dirty as well. Still not sure how I recovered from that, because I kept bouncing back but eventually when I stopped for some time it was like all hell crashed down and from then on I was unable to enjoy myself (and I kept using for another 2-3 years so.. yeah I was a fucked up individual and in many regards still am.)

I started shooting a few months ago. I?m not the greatest. Where?s a place to look that is always under clothes. I do construction so it?s jeans n a T-shirt. I got a feeling I?m gonna get fired soon too. I miss a lot. Like I?m having problems registering. But I don?t wanna waste it. Usually I?ll keep pokin around til I get it. Like last week Me n a friend were hangin out. Shooting the shit. Lol. He wouldn?t hit me. So he told me where to go. Like from the side in the crook of my arm. N I hit it perfect. First try  wound up hittin every time that night. Prolly 3 or 4 more times. Then I ended up gettin another friend some so I got half a g too. I tried the same spot same thing n everything. I hit one time. I got that one. I think I kept tryin to tho. So I wound up takin it with me to my buddy?s place. I got 2 beans sat night. So I was gonna bring the shot with me so I?d have it either at work or stop somewhere on the way home. Didn?t get a feeling from the beans. So I went to do tha shot I made on Saturday when I got home. N it like hardened up can?t think of the word. So mixed it with some water n refiltered. Mixed water so I could see if I register. Missed a bunch. I?ve got a like an ace bandage. Wrapped around my arm. Ii need to find a spot people can?t see. Cuz my shit bout looked like the first time I tried shooting muself. But. My friend said it looked lol le I blew it out. So I tried on other veins on my arm. Eventually got one. But I jus don?t wanna waste good drugs. So I keep tryin. N yeah. Like. I need somewhere on my legs. I guess it could be that the rigs are jus gettin dull. Idk.

Ok so after injecting ice, i got this pounding migraine and began vomiting profusely. I used a new cotton and a new rig, I didn?t miss the shot at all, I had eaten earlier today and I am well hydrated. This has happened like twice before, all within the same circumstances, does anyone know why tf this keeps happening to me? It?s really taking away the rush making the high wayyyy less enjoyable.

1. your meth is badly cut and forget about it cuz it could be godknows what 

2. your brain needs sleep and all kinds of things to return its supplies,and your sense of tolerance, to baseline. dopamine depletion is a big deal. give it three days no tweak and see what happens.

3. you're experiencing hypertension instantaneously. preload with a downer and you might not feel so bad. i get that shit from every ROA i've used meth on, as soon as the high starts. 

4. how much water per shot? you can fit several points into a 1mlL shot, but i'd prolly go with bigger volumes myse.,f

Unlike others, I dont find redosing nor skipping a nights sleep to hugely impact the dosage needed.

I've jabbed myself a few times recently. Two different shots from the same bag gave very different results - am I best off crushing it all to get a more consistent potency? Or should I just crush it as necessary?

I love vaping it and I've noticed whoever cut this did an awful job of mixing/freezing it again.

I thought my entire hb was shit but it may have just been the first shot I had.

I'm going to experiment with viscosity/ratio of water, but I feel like 1:1 would be too thick to register and such a tiny amount to press down.

I do think slowing down/stopping the plunger diminishes the rush compared to continuous depression. I'm not sure how fast I can go but half a ml is a tiny amount of fluid. I imagine I'd know if pressure was building up.

define "fat shots", please


I never exceeded 50mg, I believe.  I was always eyeballing but if I went much higher I'd experience visuals (not eye wiggles like MDMA though), OBE like psychedelic experience, PROFUSE vomitting and then dry heaving for like 20 mins, extreme pounding heart (probably 150-190 bpm), euphoria and even dysphoria at the "peak" if I shot too much.


I actually really dislike eye wiggles from MDMA, because I get blepharospasms from stress (even in multiple years abstinence from benzos) and I prefer seeing correctly.  I wouldn't have gone on with meth in the way I did if it did that to me.  Quite annoying.

You don't have to crush it up.  If it's all dissolved you'll see a clear shot.  You'll kind of see it swirly like ice water.  It's hard to describe.  But it'll be dissolved.  It so quickly dissolves I'd just toss the crystal chunk in and keep spraying it with water, hearing it clink around in the metal cooker (NEVER APPLY HEAT though; they just hand out clean cookers at the exchange) until ti was all disolved.  Sometimes if there was just a tiny bit elft I'd get impatient and leave it for the next crystal and shot. 


Haven't shot meth in like, what, 4 years now.  Something like that.

**[b][u]need harm reduction help please!![/u][/b]**


I'm assuming the prefix stood for Harm Reduction, but if I'm wrong please overlook it. I'm by no means a newbie when it comes to doing dope, especially by injecting. However,o we the past year or so, I've ran into problem after problem. I still have many,plainly visible veins, but anything from an inch below my elbow to my hands will blow, for sure, every single time. 


Now, having said that, I'm sure I'm probably breaking some rules by doing this, but there just isn't any help in my area and I have no friends where I just recently moved 6 hours away. With no names ever being given, only me showing my face, or any other stipulations that would make someone feel comfortable, I need someone to face time and guide me through the best possible way to do this. I'm very analytical and over think things, but I've butchered 3 different areas over the years to where they collasped, and right now, honestly, the only damn thing in the world is to get this shot in, ya know... Someone please pm me if you can do this. I'm the only person doing something on camera I could get in trouble for, I just need help, ASAP, please!!!

Was new to meth..... 3months ago, now I'm a daily user! Tried to quit once and was able to get about 21/2 weeks or so and Bam here I am with another 3-4 week run that's still in process. I actually do manage to sleep about 3hrs every other night and eat breakfast and dinner but my eyes still look sunken and dark, lately mainly at work I've been getting a wierd head feeling almost like I'm about to pass out but with more of a tingly feeling, I've reduced the size of lines I do so hopefully that'll help. I was an opiate/benzo addict and know everything about those...... But stims... Not Soo much! Lol

Ok, throughout the day I?ve probably snorted .2 or .3g of crystal and hit the pipe twice, two rips each time, no tolerance. Throughout the work day there was anxiety but I was moving around and doing things. Now, what I hope is anxiety has culminated in some different body aches, what feels like constant hyperventilation, semi-blurred vision, tingling on and off randomly throughout my body.

What is going on?!

The rush doesn't hit you like coke, but it lasts a hell of a lot longer.

Have a benzo if possible. Eat. Drink. Check out some grounding breathing techniques. Do NOT do any more! Sleep.

I think that people say that because when you're on a stimulant you're less likely to feel sedation/euphoria from the Benzos but they fuck you up just as much if not more in terms of decision making, erratic behavior. Especially if you take too many Benzos. Or if you black out and decide to keep redosing both. There's many ways that it can go wrong, even if you do it perfectly "the right way" i.e. doing as much meth as you know to be your personal limit, taking Benzos for sleep and then waking up from the stupor with more meth, etc. is actually the surefire way to build a massive dependence to both drugs in record time.

This might be a silly question but can anyone say how it is automatically routed to the brain? They say 100% bioavailability but that only matters if it gets to the right place... in other words what's keeping the circulatory system from routing it to I dunno, the feet?

Lot more circulation to the head, hence why a head wound bleeds so much. Something like 20% of the blood from the heart flows to the brain.

It actually is circulating through the whole body and of course there's things like Volume of Distribution and plasma binding but while on this "Subway" it's stop is always the brain and the "Subway Doors" are the Blood Brain Barrier.

Well thats what everyone says before it turns into a habit. Take the fact that you liked it so much as a warning sign of what's to come (possible addiction). Meth isn't really something to be fucked around with, even if you're not already an 'addict' it'll quite possibly turn you into one by how it rewires your brain and it's hell on Earth to quit for good. I know I sound preachy but am just speaking from experience. Who knows you might be the 1% that likes meth from the first try, has ample amounts available and never gets addicted to it. Slim chance though.

I have been a shooter for 20 plus years of meth. And the one guy said it right it is a personal thing.. you have tofigure out what works for you. Thatsthe beautybof shooting meth is you control what high you want. Itsthe safest and best way to do meth. It just has a stigma that if you use needles than your luge is over and you must be a loser.  So far frkm the truth. If you do a drugthan do it and do it well just be safe and talk to a shooter for your advuce and jnohow dont talk to hospitals notnothing lkke rhat you wont get the info needed.  I have a questionthough. How much air can be jnjected before bad.

The stigma isn't that they're losers, just more heavy addicts.


I too am curious about air in veins, because sometimes I hit blood on my way out and get air in there.

Dude I don't know it wasn't weighed but I made 2 lines from one bag for my friend and I and I'm still fucking wired like a slut.  Hallucinating now also and have been on bluelight for 7 hours without moving off my chair, commenting on fucking every forum I click on.  Think I must take a break hey?  My milkshake is still next to me without one sip being taken.  Jesus I'm going to kill myself.  Not really but someday I don't know.  Feeling this pain in my top right of my chest as well.  Heart don't give up on me yet there is a monster orgasm waiting at the end of this morning.  Will probably cum the paint off the walls.  Sorry I have no filter and say whatever pops into my fried mind.


Thank you for the concerning message dude, it is because off people like you that others stay safe.

Shit. I took clonodine to assuming that it would help with side effects and maybe even reduce methamphetamine damage, but apparantly

That don't make no sense to me.


So I IV'd like 20-40mg. How much damage did I do?

Dude can you perhaps tell me what's going on here.  Okay so over last weekend that 1 x 20cm line kept me up throughout the night.  But now I've gone through 2 bags in 2 days and I hardly feel a thing?  Is it a low quality batch as I bought it from a different guy or is this tolerance?

You are probably taking a cathinone which is meant to mimic a similar effect.


It could be one of the following below:


Mephedrone: Short-acting, moderate stimulation and extremely addictive. (More so than meth for me. Most addictive drug I've tried). Not intensely euphoric, but enough to keep you dosing until you have picked every white crumb that looks like meph out of the carpet. HORRIBLE comedown. 70% cocaine-like; 30% MDMA-like.


Methylone: Short-acting, stimulating and extremely euphoric. More like what I imagined "ecstasy" to be than MDMA was. Could re-dose for days and still get high. Little-to-no comedown. Like a shorter acting, less toxic feeling MDMA. Very high therapeutic value IMO.


4-EMC: The most similar thing to mephedrone I've found, but far less fiendish and not as stimulating. Moderately euphoric and mixes well with "straight" stimulants like 2-FA (in low doses of course).


4-MEC: Nothing like 4-MMC or 4-EMC. Moderately sedating and stoning, but without any real euphoria. Also combines well with other stimulants. Heart palpitations were mild but noticeable, especially on the comedown.


3-FMC: Mild, stimulating caffeine-like compound. No empathogenic effects or euphoria, but a decent functional stim.


Ethylone: Smells/tastes identical to methylone but lacks the "magic". Not stimulating enough for my taste and slightly dysphoric. Not bad when taken with another stim like 2-FMA.


5ME: EXTREMELY sedating and drowsy. Zero euphoria until the comedown when I got my energy and brain function back. Eyes rolling back in the head, but not in a pleasant way. Far too heavy for my taste.


Benzedrone (4-MBC): No noticeable psychoactive effect whatsoever.

I hate this mixed bag bullshit I've been getting. Some shards do something others don't. When you take the one's that don't, you think you need to up the dosage the following day and then it hits you and you can't sleep. 


Not fun at all and a great reason to quit.

Hi all,


Hopefully someone might be able to help? 


Hands are Blue, Toes are Blue, face and eyes are bright red, and i'm freezing cold. 


I know there's obvious dangers with meth, but if someone consumed 1G of Meth and 50 mls of GBL in the last 3-4 days and has spent today trying to curb a comedown with more meth(which is now finished) and some alcohol, but now they're multicoloured and they look ill.


Should they drink more alcohol to help, or would that make things worse. There's also Valium, but think that would be best when the meth has fully worn off - plus shouldn't mix it with alcohol if I'm going to drink .


So, I ask again - why is this person changing colour, freezing cold (even though its fairly hot inside).

- What, given the available substances above would be best to take in order to calm their anxiety and restore their colour?


Many thanks for your help ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

You don't need more alcohol, no. You need to eat food, drink plenty of fluids, wean yourself off everything you've been taking and get plenty of rest. If anything, take the valium, assuming you've stopped drinking alcohol or using GBL. But food, fluids and rest would be more beneficial for restoring normal blood flow and metabolism.

It's hard to appreciate sometimes just how much the essentials have an effect on your buzz. There's few stim situations that can't be solved with Food, Fluids, Shower and a Valium. You're in real trouble if the holy trifecta plus a vally doesn't have you back on course eventually.

Yep first time my ex decided to let me have some to lose weight he made me promise I would never slam it like he did. We split 16 years ago and I have held that promise. 10 years ago I caught up with him on Facebook he was near death needed surgery but wouldn't stop slamming. Preferred to die. I always will wonder about the high burr I won't do it.

Not that I'm replying two years later, but one time I had a huge shot of ice and decided to only to half of it after I'd already registered, so of course blood got mixed in with the half I didn't do. I didn't touch it for 4-5 days, squirted the bloody shot out into a cap, filtered it, and did it. Didn't hurt me any. And I always find shots that have had blood in them for any amount of time hite differently. I know that it technically wouldn't be enough "extra" blood to cause a blood rush to your head, but that's almost what it feels like.

Okayyyy so I'm new here, forgive me if I don't quite follow all the rules correctly.

I read almost this entire forum, as well as a couple of the other meth forums, and didn't find so much as a vaguely similar question. 

Can anyone tell me what exactly causes you to get that burn in your throat (we call it dragonbreath where I'm from haha) after IV'ing meth? Curious because not every batch illicits this reaction, and some burn worse than others.

Hey, welcome to Bluelight linrae!


Not *sure *about your question, but is probably a cutting agent. Especially if you coined a term for it and you all buy from the same plug?

Cutting agent or it could possibly be a spike in BP. Also could be contaminants such as hexane etc. Most likely it's a combination of all three.

Dragon breath is a pretty popular term in the US as far as I've noticed. It's a result of what the chemical does to your lungs before (after?) it passes through the heart. I'm not sure why sometimes it's more intense but it probably is related to tolerance.

The first drug I ever used, first time I altered my consciousness, was MDMA. I didn't think drunk or stoned people behaved in a way I would enjoy, which I absolutely confirmed later. I loved MDMA but despite using it max 4x a year, at least 3mo between uses, 1 pill per roll, by the 12th time I took it, I only experienced negative effects. Unfortunately I do tend to build tolerances to stims & stimulating psychiatric meds (Prozac, Effexor, etc), often permanent tolerance.


About a year later I encountered meth which I have always preferred to take orally (which to me feels quite similar to MDMA but highly, wonderfully sexual for me) & quickly became my new fave especially as I find it to be very functional at lower doses & I was in university. Then I decided to try IVing it; it was the first drug I ever shot. I have tiny veins, low blood pressure, poor circulation & am chronically cold (plus female & very much not well muscled in my upper body). My felllw BL friends the night I shot were too freaked to even babysit let alone assist me in any way, but the injection was flawless (still can't believe I hit that tiny vein in my wrist 1st go) & almost instantly I felt an incomparable, euphoric sensation in my brain, that sort of felt like little bubbles fizzing or popping. I've never felt that sensation since, & I was pissed at the time that I hadn't IVed more (too concerned to do more than a tiny dose), bc it was definitely nowhere near a recreational dose. 


Other than the initial rush, I wasn't impressed by the effects or lack thereof. A few years later I IVed a much bigger dose, too much in fact, as I dislike feeling extremely high (control freak obsessed with mental clarity). And not a hint of that special little rush from my first time; I definitely still prefer oral. I've smoked quite a bit mostly as a social thing & snorted it 1-2x; both ways I find are much less euphoric, more jittery & unpleasant, especially snorting. Haven't tried plugging but I've been unimpressed by the effects of all the other drugs I've plugged, though it is certainly better than snorting when it comes to stims. But oral stims are just best for me.


I probably won't use it again bc of the overall toxicity, but I will forever wonder about that initial fizzy bubble rush. Was it due to IVing, & would I have experienced it no matter what I'd IVed first? Or at least with any stim? Was it dose dependent; maybe the overwhelming nature of my 2nd time prevented me from feeling it then? Or what? Btw, it was definitely meth both times, but perhaps the ratio of dl isomers had something to do with it? I've IVed coke a few times & while I found it very pleasurable unlike all other coke ROAs, & moreso than IV meth though definitely not worth the duration, that too failed to produce the special sensation.


I had large quantities on hand for long times & I never had the desire to use it more than at most 2x a month, and even that was not common, so it can certainly be used, even IVed, without leading to addiction. I've observed both personally & generally that the common non-oral ROAs, especially smoking & IV, are the most addictive aspect of meth use, rather than the drug itself. Likewise for coke particularly. Rituals are incredibly powerful.

@fairnymph: I've come to accept that the first time IVing anything is as good as it's going to get with that particular drug, save for some psychedelics. I've never done meth, but my experience with opiates mirrors yours. I've even had clean time of varying length in between my IV stints, but never got that first rush back. I think part of it is the novelty of that route of administration. We often hear that IV anything is the best, but no amount of story from others can possibly prepare us adequately for it. Then, when we sit down to try it, everything is new, and it really is the best in terms of effects. The next time, we have a realistic experience to form expectations around it, and that notion somehow alters our experience of it.

Yeah I definitely do think it could be that. However, I'd like to note that IV coke feels the same all 3-4x I've done it,  the first time wasn't special beyond it being novel. I've never noticed a real difference between my first h shot & my last one or any in between; I've only IVed a few psychs 1x each so can't comment there. And I really don't enjoy IV meth anywhere as much as oral. I honestly wonder if it was purely psychosomatic? I don't tend to be prone to placebo etc, almost never, but there are surely exceptions. Btw I was born in Canada...where are you living now? Curious if you're near me. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Not true...ketamine & meth go beautifully together. Though IME, ketamine goes well with everything. Especially stims & psychs though. I also know people who love meth + MDMA but that sounds way too toxic, dangerous & overwhelming to me.

So I recently threw a whole bag away (which is a big deal, I don't know any meth user that would just up and throw a bag away). I was suspect of it ever since I gotten it home and actually looked at it. It was flat in appearance... I licked it, it tasted pretty bitter. I did half of what I normally would (I IV so just to be safe...) And I did not get any kind of rush or euphoria that comes along with IVing meth. I didn't feel energized or focused. I thought maybe it was a weak shot so I made up another. Nothing, and I know I didn't miss or slip, both injection sites looked like shit. I've read from other sources that cartels have been using n-iso crystals to not just cut meth but have just been selling it to poor, unsuspecting users... Which is lame. 


I researched what I could. I don't have any reagent kits but I tried smoking it... Takeaway from smoking it, it tasted like it could have been real... It melted fine, it recrystallized fine, it was cloudy though... No rush from smoking. 


I tried snorting it... Noticed that it crumbled into smaller pieces easier than actual meth... It burnt like hell but still no rush. Just a good awful drip that nearly made me puke a few times. 


I felt nothing but a panic kind of anxious which kept me up worrying about what the hell I injected, smoked and snorted. Decided to try a bleach test... Poured some bleach in a cup and dropped some of it in .. some of it was consistent with how meth should react. It jumped around and left an oily residue on the top, but most of it sunk and this milky white cloud showed up... 


That's when I threw it out. A bag with maybe a little bit of meth in it but mostly garbage.


Has any one else gotten a bad batch that's suspect? I just recently started IVing again after not using at all for 2 years... Is this just the way it is nowadays? I'm worried it can cause a lot of harm to those who IV.

**Meth and diabetes, how bad is this?**


I'm new and this is my first post. Really needing advice. A brief history: I've used meth off and on for the past 4 years or so, a few weeks on then a few months off, smoking only until recently. I'd get burned out and no real desire to continue... no problem. A little over a year ago I IV'd for the first time after being sober for 6 months. Just had a bad breakup, loss of a job, and my car dying all in the same week... I was in a bad place and a friend introduced me to the idea, said it would help... I was reluctant to try it from the start mostly due to being a type 1 diabetic and the impact on my heath IV would have. He assured me it wasn't any worse than smoking so I agreed to a small amount. The rush was intense andI felt amazing! But that shot led to almost a 2 week bender with barely any sleep, forget to eat, forget to hydrate... at the end i remember my chest hurting, felt my heart beating out of my chest, blood was thick and hard to register at that point, paranoia and anxiety, guilt, depression, constant worry and hyper aware of the way my body felt. My buddies were all doing these huge monster shots and mine were a fraction of that but still I felt like I was more likely to have a heart attack because of my diabetes. In hindsight it was only an intense panic attack. But in that moment it was real and to "save myself" I insisted he dose me a shot of H to counter and level out. I'd swore that H was something I'd never do and I haven't again since. But it opened my eyes how outta control it had become. That 2 weeks was the longest day of my life and the events that went on just blur together. I quit everything and moved home with family...


Fast forward to now. I had been clean for 10 months. 3 month's ago i started a new job, got a place, began a new relationship, and recently a car with the overtime. She enjoyed meth on occasion so I told her my story and the lessons I learned. I told myself that now I knew what bottom looks like so I can prevent a downward spiral. I'm in control. Wasn't long before I'm using the needle again primarily. Eating, hydrating, and sleeping fairly regular, adulting. We became close and then she left me a month ago and im back in my feelings. I have no social and now i work 12 hours a day 6 days a week. Ive been shooting at least 4 times a day almost everyday since early October. It's become routine. I've checked myself into the ER twice since then thinking I'd done too much. Both times they said I was fine, gave me benzos and sent me on. Even with all that I still continue to push the limits, I tell myself now that I need the overtime. My family is rooting for me and far as they know I'm on the right track. Fact is I've relapsed. I'm keeping the doses relatively small but my tolerance is building and I don't see an end in sight now. I want to know how bad I'm hurting myself with my condition and prolonged use? I'm afraid but also very curious of what a "monster shot" might do to me. I've read so many post about people doing half gram shots and it being great where my half gram lasts me 3 or 4 days only to stay awake. My biggest fear is to be found dead by my mom when she's done all she can to help me and thinks im making good choices. Shes proud of all the progress I've made but she doesn't know I'm still in the fight... no one does. I need to quit or at least know where the limit is. How long can i keep this up? What symptoms are real and dangerous as opposed to just panic and anxiety? How or if it is more harmful to someone with diabetes? What will happen and what to expect as normal if i continue mild to moderate daily use? These are my thoughts and Any input is appreciated.

Bro what you described is what I had been experiencing. Granted it could of been tolerance for me since I was using everyday but trust me I know what a good shot feels like and I remember when I IVd the shit I was getting.. it was very different. It felt like I was going to have a heart attack, the rush came on quickly to the point of being terrifying but it wasn't a pleasurable rush.. it just felt like I had overdosed on niacin. My face was flushed and stained red and I just felt like total complete crap afterwards. My pupils didn't even dilate but I was sketchy and tired. The old stuff fucked me off my tree and kept me twacked for days and days but this shit that's coming in from Mexico is garbage. There's very little meth in it.. and the rest is cut with Iso or whatever crap the cartels use.. either way I'm glad I haven't gone back. I've got a month and some couple days clean.. fuck it.. I'm keeping my sobriety and my peace of mind and health in order cuz it just ain't worth the risk. The side effects from these cuts are fucking brutal too.. I mean meth in general is a fucked up drug if one isn't careful but I was taking all sorts of precautions and getting my food intake, rest, proper hygiene.. but this shit you just can't keep up with! It's poison! It's garbage! And if you ain't feeling good then there's no point even bothering with it. The good ole days of decent meth is gone and I've come to terms with that! Good luck bro and stay safe!

It's sis* not bro ?? but SERIOUSLY! The first time I ever tried it it was the good shit... the shit where you couldn't even finish a bowl without staying up for a week! It's garbage whatever it is now. It has just enough to keep you craving but damn it I just can't catch a good rush like I did when I first started IV-ing. I relapsed at the beginning of the year after 2 years clean time and have been using a bit most days... The days I don't use I feel pretty depleted. It sucks... I'm looking for this rush that I don't think I'll ever be able to find again. I want to feel my whole body tingle bwahahaha! I sleep every night (even if it's a couple hours), I eat every day, I drink plenty of water. But that's mostly so my friends and family don't catch on... I've been doing this for 6 weeks and so far no one has questioned me. Blessing? Curse? Idk anymore. I'm planning on slowly dosing down to nothing (fingers crossed) I'm scared with all the cut and adulterants... A friend of mine told me there are some batches with fent cut in it. How do you know if it's yours? When you OD I guess. SMH. Hope you stay safe as well friend.

Hi OP,


I've been a type 1 diabetic since the age of 6 (diagnosed in 1989) and I am now 35. I've been an invtravenous meth user for 17 years now, usage has fluxtuated from a few points once every couple of weeks to a gram a day (yes very bad, I know) and everywhere in between. 


I am in good health. I have regular bloods and physical checkups done, my most recent being done by a corporate health provider I was working for and BP, Cholesterol etc were all good. My last HbA1c was 6.1 (I think that on the NGSP scale) which is not too bad. Would be a bit high for a non-diabetic but decent for a T1 DM. 


Anyway whilst none of this is any sort of proof that I haven't done horrible things to my insides and am sure to die a swift and brutal death in the very near future - it does show that by paying attention to the fact that you ARE different to the poeple you're using with and you DO need to do additional things that they will not - you can definitely keep yourself a lot safer. 


People without a chronic illness may not be aware of what you or I go through on the daily, I understand that T1 Diabetes is a burden and personally, there is almost not a single fucking minute that passes in a day where my brain does not wonder what my blood sugar is doing at that exact time and then ponde the consequences/how to improve it/how the current level will affect me in the short and long term. It is fucking exhausting and it's the kind of exhaustion that bubble below the surface and you may not notice. 


The hedonistic "throwing caution to the wind" feeling that meth gave me felt like it came straight from god themselves (I'm not religious, just a crude analogy) as I finally felt free and normal for a blissful 8-10 hours. 


But when I came back down the diabetes was still there, lying in wait with a nice side of guilt and paranoia about how this binge and temporary lack of care had affected me.


I'm not for a second going to tell you not to do meth - meth is fucking wonderful and has been responsible for some of the best and most enlightening/beautiful experiences of my life. I hold a reverance for meth the way a lot of peole hold a reverance for psychedelics. But the absolute fucking worst thing you can do is pretend you're normal and that you dont have diabetes.


Accept it, embrace it, overcome the hurdles. Set alarms on your phone to test your BSL and inject (insulin lol) or eat food. Speak to a doctor, if you don't have an understanding one then perhaps have a scout around and see if you can find one. 


Also I cannot recommend enough speaking to a counsellor or psych or Alcohol & other Drugs worker - they will all have invaluable input. Above all, remember you have to do things slightly differently than other people and that's just the way it is. I know it sucks but if you ever need to chat you're welcome to message me. 


Hope I didn't get the wrong end of the stick with your post, be careful with monster shots too - as you may well be fine after a monster shot, but it is very hard to go back to 0.5 or 1 pointers when you've just done a 4 point screamer the day before. Amphet tolerance is an absolute motherfucker.


Take care ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

It's garbage whatever it is now. It has just enough to keep you craving but damn it I just can't catch a good rush like I did when I first started IV-ing. I relapsed at the beginning of the year after 2 years clean time and have been using a bit most days... The days I don't use I feel pretty depleted. It sucks... I'm looking for this rush that I don't think I'll ever be able to find again. I want to feel my whole body tingle bwahahaha! I sleep every night (even if it's a couple hours), I eat every day, I drink plenty of water. But that's mostly so my friends and family don't catch on... I've been doing this for 6 weeks and so far no one has questioned me. Blessing? Curse? Idk anymore. I'm planning on slowly dosing down to nothing (fingers crossed) I'm scared with all the cut and adulterants... A friend of mine told me there are some batches with fent cut in it. How do you know if it's yours? When you OD I guess. SMH. Hope you stay safe as well friend.

I'll have to look into that! That's the thing with meth.. when you're using that kind of drug sometimes it's a real bitch to use over the counter stuff and even when I was getting prescription of Retinal and Doxycycline and Clindamaycin it just dried my skin and the meth made my acne worse along with the acne medication.. but when you use everyday it doesn't matter what vitamins you take or how healthy you eat or how many showers you take that shit is filled with so much crap that isn't supposed to be used for human consumption so I shouldn't really be upset at anyone but myself but it'd be nice to take off my shirt if I ever went to the beach

Meth causes vasoconstriction of the veins. Less blood flow = no hard on (even if you really REALLY want it to).


Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate! Low dose aspirin, and Viagra is cool but look up BLUE FUSION male enhancement online. There are many "sex enhancement" pills out there but blue fusion works amazingly and works for up to 72 hours (you won't have a perma-boner for that long don't worry, you'll just be able to preform when you want to), makes you harder, gives you more stamina, works for my man every time.

I imagine racemic would be worse than d-isomer.

I would really like some other people?s opinions on this topic. There has to be others that have encountered this before. 

It?s just really weird cause the time I did it before I had a bigger shot and could get a bonner but this last time it was totally impossible. Other times all good then other times nothing.

I've had effects that were on both sides of the spectrum. Heavy vasoconstriction like cold hands and feet usually went hand in hand with not being "fully functional". [Allure's suggestions](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/519111-Methamphetamine-Info-amp-IV-Megathread?p=14490942&viewfull=1#post14490942) are sound, as well as things like hot showers and Jacuzzis. Those seemed to fix things rather quickly if other stimuli just wasn't cutting it. The issues also dissipated after the peak for me as well which also seemed to correlate with a reduction in vasoconstriction.

Correct me if I?m wrong, but a lot of the male performance supplements out there deal with the cholinergic systems in the  brain. Word of cation: this is not a system you wanna over stimulate in any way. Think intoxication via night shade family of plants: the farthest thing from fun.

Combine them with a powerful stimulant like meth and who really knows the consequences.

Just be careful with these supplements, don?t over do it

Yeah cocaine is a vasoconstrictor so you?ll have issues finding and hitting Veins as well as performance problems down below.

Of course it?s dose dependent. But if you?re IV?ing coke, sex is the last thing on your mind IMO

I had a buddy of mine telling me the other day how he hated his meth use and his relationship he had with his girlfriend. She was aware that he had issues getting and maintaining an erection and both were telling me about it and comfortable telling me about their situation and I guess because he had issues she would let him watch porn because when he watched porn he would get an erection... though it would take him a few hours.. so by the time he got the erection then they'd get to the sex part and he'd just wear a cock ring. Thought that was interesting lol I feel like porn ruins a lot of relationships because most guys tell me they'd rather just watch porn when they're high then have sex with a beautiful woman. Don't get me wrong. I've had a great fap sessions when high on meth but I'd rather be intimate with a woman and give her pleasure because there's nothing better than watching a woman's cum face.. but I also aim to please and I love being please but I feel like chronic masturbation and getting used to that.. after a while it's gotta make a person feel so fucking lonely! We know a guy who's girlfriend got him a sex doll while she was going to Japan for a month and ever since then he hasn't had sex with her as much and she's fucking crushed.. and me and the other guys don't know what to fucking do and we've talked about getting him help but he's shunned all of us thinking that there's no issue and that he needs better friends. Lol but really it's him and that fucking sex doll and he treats her like she's more human than his girl.. like wtf man that's scary shit how comfortable you can get used to your sex toy and ignore your actual spouse! Really fucked up shit man!

Hey guys just wanna check in with yall. Was a IV heroin/opiate (downers in general) addict for most my using, but in the last 2-3 years have switched over to meth. Mainly because it's all I can find where I live. Opiates got so hard to come by. Anyways, I kinda just go on 2-3 day binges every 1-2 weeks, which is just kinda how it's been going lately. I have a girlfriend who tries to kill me every time I use because she's so pissed. Eventually she convinces me to go to detox or something and come down, it's kinda fucked up. Probably not the healthiest relationship, but there are definitely still good times between when I'm using....


Anyways, just wanted to check in with my peeps and say hey.

That sounds horrible ans really unhealthy for both of you bro. Have you thought about ending the relationship? I mean, if you're invested in continuing to use, which is fine if that's what you wanna do. Sounds like it would take a heavy toll emotionally on both of you. And that's how you waste years. 


I've only ever had a handful or partners that were okay with my meth use...whilst it's popular here in Australia, there's still a huge stigma, a lot of negative media-driven hype and of course the extra stigma one gets for being an IV user.


I've been using for 18 years now (I'm 35) and have led a relatively productive and fulfilling life, I think the secret is sleeping and eating every day you possibly can. 


I've just moved states and having some chill time in South Australia atm, went from everyday use in Melbourne (around 1-2 points a day, sometimes more sometimes less) for 6 months to nothing for 8 weeks. Have decided to treat myelf for having 2 months off and ordered some from my friend over there, just a small serve. Absolutely hanging for it to arrive haha but keeping the fiend at bay by working on assignments.


Do you enjoy your using time more than your downtime with your girlfriend? What do you get up to when you're high? It can be a very lonely experience when you're using and you have to hide it from your partner.

Thanks for the words man I appreciate the comment. Yeah we've talked seriously about ending it and decided it's for the better to stay together at the very least for the 3 kids (2 are hers, 1 ours). IT does get very lonely and scary for both of us at times. She is a nurse, the caretaker type of girl who wants to bring people back to health and I'm more of a taker I guess.


I enjoy my family time much more than my using time and your right I need to get my priorities straight, it's just so fucking hard when that shit has ahold of you, you know?


That's, funny I have a package on it's way to me too and the mail just came and went and I died a little inside because it wasn't there. lol good luck and thanks

> 			I'm new and this is my first post. Really needing advice. A brief history: I've used meth off and on for the past 4 years or so, a few weeks on then a few months off, smoking only until recently. I'd get burned out and no real desire to continue... no problem. A little over a year ago I IV'd for the first time after being sober for 6 months. Just had a bad breakup, loss of a job, and my car dying all in the same week... I was in a bad place and a friend introduced me to the idea, said it would help... I was reluctant to try it from the start mostly due to being a type 1 diabetic and the impact on my heath IV would have. He assured me it wasn't any worse than smoking so I agreed to a small amount. The rush was intense andI felt amazing! But that shot led to almost a 2 week bender with barely any sleep, forget to eat, forget to hydrate... at the end i remember my chest hurting, felt my heart beating out of my chest, blood was thick and hard to register at that point, paranoia and anxiety, guilt, depression, constant worry and hyper aware of the way my body felt. My buddies were all doing these huge monster shots and mine were a fraction of that but still I felt like I was more likely to have a heart attack because of my diabetes. In hindsight it was only an intense panic attack. But in that moment it was real and to "save myself" I insisted he dose me a shot of H to counter and level out. I'd swore that H was something I'd never do and I haven't again since. But it opened my eyes how outta control it had become. That 2 weeks was the longest day of my life and the events that went on just blur together. I quit everything and moved home with family...
> 
> 
> 
> Fast forward to now. I had been clean for 10 months. 3 month's ago i started a new job, got a place, began a new relationship, and recently a car with the overtime. She enjoyed meth on occasion so I told her my story and the lessons I learned. I told myself that now I knew what bottom looks like so I can prevent a downward spiral. I'm in control. Wasn't long before I'm using the needle again primarily. Eating, hydrating, and sleeping fairly regular, adulting. We became close and then she left me a month ago and im back in my feelings. I have no social and now i work 12 hours a day 6 days a week. Ive been shooting at least 4 times a day almost everyday since early October. It's become routine. I've checked myself into the ER twice since then thinking I'd done too much. Both times they said I was fine, gave me benzos and sent me on. Even with all that I still continue to push the limits, I tell myself now that I need the overtime. My family is rooting for me and far as they know I'm on the right track. Fact is I've relapsed. I'm keeping the doses relatively small but my tolerance is building and I don't see an end in sight now. I want to know how bad I'm hurting myself with my condition and prolonged use? I'm afraid but also very curious of what a "monster shot" might do to me. I've read so many post about people doing half gram shots and it being great where my half gram lasts me 3 or 4 days only to stay awake. My biggest fear is to be found dead by my mom when she's done all she can to help me and thinks im making good choices. Shes proud of all the progress I've made but she doesn't know I'm still in the fight... no one does. I need to quit or at least know where the limit is. How long can i keep this up? What symptoms are real and dangerous as opposed to just panic and anxiety? How or if it is more harmful to someone with diabetes? What will happen and what to expect as normal if i continue mild to moderate daily use? These are my thoughts and Any input is appreciated.

There is no end and there is no limit except death. If you take the time to research and read (a lot) about meth, you'll find it's the worst drug out there for your mind and body. It does permanent damage, and the way it affects your body is contraindicated with a lot of ways type 1 diabetes affects you. You're correct in fearing that it's worse on you than a normal person, and you really are flirting with death bro, but at the same time try to stop worrying so much and allowing fucked up images to come into your mind. Don't feed the beast. 


Trust me dude, I mean really trust me and listen to words, IVing meth will only lead you down a bad road. The people on here who say they lead normal lives while doing it are downplaying it and most likely flat out lying about some of it. It only gets worse and worse, and there's scientific research to back up what my experience is trying to tell you.

Wanted to ask if anyone who have tried both smoked or IV meth, could compare it to (smoke/IV ?) use of Heroin in terms of addiction


aiiight...whelp...I shot dope on the streets of Philadelphia for two years.  Went thru some fucked up shit (to say the least)

went to treatment...havnt touched an opiate in 2.5 yrs. (brushes off both shoulders)

i moved out west 2 years ago and occasionally fuck with some really good crystal.  And let me tell ya...IV is the way to be...shit is amazing.  So after my first shot what did I do?...go on a 3 week meth fueled run...duh.  It was pretty fun...staying up...bangin diff chicks like a fuckin pornstar...sleeping a little...eating a little...IV 3 shots a day...each .25...all while working construction 55hrs a week.  The problem with meth is, no matter how conscious I was about eating, drinking and sleeping, my body just started to fall apart.  Losing weight, skin tone, and just general well being started to decrease.  And ya get to the point where even a thick shot of that shit just doesn?t do much.  Tolerance is a bitch right!?!

example...my very first shot was prob .07 and it fuckin rocked me, ain?t gonna lie, my dick just moved a little thinkin about it.  3 months later is when my 3 week run started...and I could go they a gram in a day preparing 4 syrupy shots per day, and my dick didn?t move at all, not even a little.  Now...I operate a little smarter these days...I take 2-3 months off and then get down for 2 days.  I?m feelin pretty good about that...it allows me to keep up sleep, nutrition and all around health.  And I get high...so that?s fun too.

as far as your question about addiction to both these substances imma go ahead and say the drugs are a variable and the addict is the constant.  Like if ur fuckin with these two substances ROA IV...u prob have issues with addiction, not to say that prevents responsible use, but for an addict it?s a tricky line to walk.  Who knows...I could stop meth forever, and still get addicted to anything that makes me feel good, gym and nutrition are my go to sober addiction.  I know this post is long and I hope it answered ur question.  You are obviously interested in IV ROA of both these drugs...I say go for it...try it out, but respect tha drug, cuz u will get got.  Best of luck to ya!...if ya got any questions let em rip...

I have been using meth to get off of Roxie's for the last 4 days . Very little food or rest..I've at least tried every common street drug, but after ODing on H in February, I decide that I deserve to at least try living the best life I possibly can.   And I want to be the father I never had.  Even after OD it took me 2 more weeks before putting the H down.  I went to 5 Roxy blues a day.  That got expensive and I didn't have an end game, so on Friday I got some crystal.  First night I did .25 grams and basically spent the entire night in the garage smoking the pipe.  When left alone, my main tweak is on that fucking pipe.  Saturday picked up .5 g, snorted and smoked while I read this entire thread. Sunday got another .5, but I smoked/Vaped the first .25, and then when everyone was asleep, I IVed for the first time in my life.  It was amazing.  I redosed at 3 am with the remainder and it was even more intense.  Today, my last day of meth bc I should be over opiates, I got another .25 and hit it in one shot.  This wouldn't be my doc if I was able to pick something, I really liked H, but I have enjoyed IVing Ice so much that it scares me.  I'm a true drug addict/alcoholic through and through.  I remember hearing about IVing meth when I was in rehab and always had the desire in the back of my mind.  This thread served its purpose to the fullest: I shot safely and cleanly, and I have read enough people warn others to run from meth if they can.  Thank you BL!

This might sound odd, but try to keep a cool head. Methamphetamie neurotoxicity correlates strongly with brain temperature iirc.

I'll never fucking learn.  


A few hours ago I did a shot of meth in the thumb side of my wrist that was too much and too thick. It burned a good bit but I registered a couple times so I don't think it was a miss. Anyway immediately after my veins on that side start throbbing, burning, and doing this awful tightening/pulling thing, so I put a hot rag on it for a few minutes then switched microwavable pad, and for some reason every time I put even a little pressure on the pad, it felt like stinging lava under my skin until I moved it. Now the spot is very tender to the touch and it's swollen randomly from my thumb to the injection spot, and theres a major tightening across the whole top of my arm. ALSO I just remembered that when the pain was really weird and at its worst, my right arm kept having shooting tightening spots, like it was some kind of radiating pain. 


My question: it registered so it was definitely in my vein. Could it have just been totally caused by the thickness of the shot combined with me being too dehydrated for it to move thru my veins?

I think you missed. It will burn a good bit when you miss, like it did in your case. And thickness of the liquid/dehydration I don't think would case that giant chain reaction of discomfort. Hitting the thumb is hard - the slightest movement will screw you up, even after you register.


Did you even feel the rush?

So I picked up a batch of shards tonight, id say 0.4 grams or so, and already tested the waters @ 0.1g (low tolerance) just to be sure it wasn't some b.s. (definitely is not!). Well so it's been 2 hours and I'm still quite spun ...so how long should I wait before I prepare an even bigger shot for use? Will tolerance already need to be accounted for? Should I sleep some of it off first? Basically I still want the biggest, best rush I can achieve with what I've got left . Willing to wait a little extra longer than normal if that would mean getting a better rush, what do you guys think ?

Yeah he's cleaned up his act long ago. Site was still there last I checked but it's basically a food blog now.

Think he's made a career of writing out of it.


He made an impression on a geeky English kid though. I may check in on him.

The longer you wait the easier it will be to shoot it up properly. Meth causes the veins to constrict, I’ve missed numerous shots not being patient enough.

8-10 hours should be ok. You definitely want to come down a bit, maybe eat a little something. Gotta build up those spent dopamine reserves

I ended but just lay back and trying to wait it out. Day and a half later pain still there said fuck it and ended up getting a box and shaken cause i could not find any more Ice. So here i am still with sore nads and a great bake to keep me where i want to be. My question is Has anyone had this side effect.

When I try to max out a stimulant rush I prepare the shot and go to sleep, setting my alarm 90min ahead so I'll wake up really tired. 300mg meth were really pushing it for me (had only taken it twice before , don't think I'll ever do that again. Not planning to anyway. BP nearly doubled within seconds.

This thread keeps me sane ![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png)


I gotta stop going back to the needle.

I don’t know what the hells wrong with my pussy ass veins, I can wait a month or more between shots, eating well and looking after my body, get the most skilled professional to do me up and STILL I blow out a vein.


This round went off beautifully, not the best gear, and clearly it was some caustic shit (but it usually always is) perfect shot, neat and tidy.

Not a mark on me.


15 minutes later I look down because my arms stinging, and my fucking veins blown out! 

It was FINE THE ENTIRE SHOT.


I’m thinking there’s either a clot in there that stopped the meth in the vein? Or just really dirty shit? 

Now I have a big fucking bruise and a swollen damned vein ![😢](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f622.png)

I got this one hit venous abscess on my left arm like 7 or 8 years ago. Before that the vein was almost impossible to hit despite being very very large. It would hurt like a motherfucker since there is a cutaneous nerve running along its path and would also roll away whichever way I tried to hit it. It would do all kinds of crazy even after I was in, ruining every rush.


Fast forward a year. All the good veins on my forearms are gone (there weren't many to begin with).


So I started hitting the one that had the abscess on it again. To my surprise the scar tissue attached it firmly to the skin. It won't move at all. There's also more resistance so I immediately feel when I penetrate it.


So these days I've come to refer to this vein as 'old trusty'. I don't even need a tourniquet anymore. Spray, wipe, poke, shoot and done in a matter of seconds. A gift from heaven.


Fortunately I haven't shot up on a regular basis since 2015 (else I probably wouldn't be writing this). In fact I've started taking a liking in oral use again, don't ask me how that happened. I'm well aware the monster is merely pacified for the time being.

Do you remove the tourniquet before shooting? It may sound obvious, but I've seen people not doing it lol.


There's a chance you do have a clot I suppose if you regularly experience this with the same vein. There are plenty of other possibilities though. Does this happen with all drugs or just meth?


Next time you manage to get a good shot, put pressure on the injection site. I put pressure both on the site and on the area directly distal to it (distal: towards fingers, not heart).


There is a pressure gradient in your veins. The closer you come to the heart, the lower the intravenous pressure. This means the blood gets sucked towards the heart. If you poke an artery, the blood will shoot out.

If you poke a vein, there should only be slight leakage, unless the pressure inside the vein is too high. If you shoot into an obstructed vein the pressure gradient will reverse. This could cause leakage. However if all your veins look dilated this will NOT be due to a cc of spilled liquid.


What's the concentration of your solution? What you are seeing might just be a reaction to the damage the solution caused. Hyperosmolar solutions are highly cytotoxic, even miniscule amounts will act cytotoxic.


Try 100mg/ml,never ever ever go past 300mg/ml (I didn't do the math again right now, but I am relatively sure about that figure in respect to meth). Also, don't use NaCl solution. Use distilled water instead of you want to keep the concentration high so you can get a faster shot and stronger rush.


EDIT: Plus, let's not forget stimulants are vasoconstrictive and if there is a lot of meth in perivenous connective tissue it will cause ischemic necrosis to some cells. Nerves need oxygen, too, so this would explain the tingling, especially if it lasts past the experience when you keep shooting up this way. 3F-P was by far the worst in this respect. I just mentioned it in the big and dandy that I used to have the most agonizing neurogenic pain back when I shot it on a regular basis. 


If you apply the pressure correctly, no meth will leave the vein. By the time you remove the finger the home should be sealed unless you spray disinfectant on it after the shot (or you've had boooze, aspirin and the like beforehand). 

Unless you poked through the vein of course or you use a very large needle (I use 26G or 27G). 


Another thing that could happen if your solution is indeed hyperosmolar is that some meth enters your connective tissue before penetrating into the lumen or while pulling out. To prevent this: Make sure there is no meth solution on the tip of the needle and also wait at least two or three seconds before you pull out. Make sure to pull out swiftly and immediately apply pressure.

I don’t use a tourniquet, my veins are still pretty fresh as I haven’t used for long or often and they’re always very visible on the surface. Generally just hold my arm to pop them out til I get a register then let go. 


It’s definitely one thrombosed vein, i think it’s gone forever too. I have no doubt at all.  

And now you mention the blood flow, I think it was rather rapid that shot, I just didn’t think anything of it. Ill keep it in mind and not shoot if I see that again. And I’ll try what you mentioned re after care too next time cheers!


I usually do 1.5 points in 30 mls of water but I’m not entirely sure what this particular mix was as a friend did it. Possibly 40 mls, but it wasn’t as little as 20. 

My veins are a bit strange in general too I think, I only shoot meth but I’ve always had strange effects that no regular user has ever seen before. 

I’ve had meth pour right back out of a perfect vein as I injected it and end up on the damned floor. Occasionally I’ll go thru periods where I just can’t get a register. I’m in, I know I am because I can see it, but no bloods coming into the barrel, on a perfectly healthy vein It’s like some days they just go nope, not having this today.

You can usually inject pretty fast unless you inject more than a couple of cc. 

10 units = 1cc = 1ml


You're telling me you're injecting 150mg in 0.3ml water?? I don't you're talking about 3ml, let alone 30ml. 


Dude, that is WAY too much. I would recommend 1.5ml for that amount, but at least use a full ml. One full ovations syringe. 

The meth is eating away at your tissue. Some people seem to be more resistant to this, but I ain't. You don't seem to be either. 


Just reduce the concentration and you'll be fine I think. Let me know how it went next time you use. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

You’re the second person to mention this to me.

I’m not an experienced user by any means and just trust a couple of close mates to handle the business end for me a lot of the time, but they definitely do 30 ml per point roughly, or is it .3 and I’m just confused?  Don’t have any freshies here to check the gauge lol 


That said they’re all long time users who shoot a lot more in a single hit than my pissy little 1.5, several times a day.

And they’re veins are all blown the fuck out too ![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png)![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png)![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png)

Ah shit. I’m gonna have to start doing this myself if I want to keep my veins aren’t I?

My entire thumb has a volume of 30ml. That's almost 1/100th of a gallon.


They are probably using 1ml insulin syringes. These can carry 1ml. That is:

1ml

1cm x 1cm volume

0.25" x 0.25"


The scale on the syringe is in 'units' because they are usually used for insulin injections.


So you may be thinking of units. Do they inject 150mg at a time? If a syringe only carries 50mg, then they are using 30 units for 150mg.


How much liquid is in the syringe? One third full? That's be roughly 0.3ml. If that amount carries 150mg,it is way too much.


I've heard of lots of people doing this, probably for the sake of a more intense rush. That's one of many reasons why so many IV users have completely fucked arms.


By the way, that is a fool proof way to get thrombophlebitis. The veins will not take this shit.

Yep, you are right it’s 30 units, I’m just blonde lol

And I’ve always done the entire 1.5 in one shot, where most around me are using 2.5 minimum. 

So how much would you recommend?

I fear I may not be able to go back to a lesser amount of either water or meth as I’m accustomed to the rush I get at this level.


My ex husband used to make me have 60 (units) per point and I just thought he was a kill joy who didn’t want me to have fun lol


Oops

Before I start, something to read for you:


> Normal osmolarity of blood/serum is about 300-310 mOsm/L. The tonicity of an IV fluid dictates whether the solution should be delivered via the peripheral or central venous route. Hypotonic and hypertonic solutions may be infused in small volumes and into large vessels, where dilution and distribution are rapid.
> 
> 
> 
> Solutions differing greatly from the normal range may cause tissue irritation, pain on injection, and electrolyte shifts. When solutions with extremes of tonicity are infused, fluids shift into or out of cells, including endothelial cells of the tunica intima near the catheter tip and blood cells. The resulting changes in the cell size of the vein wall causes the inflammatory and clotting processes to occur, leading to phlebitis and thrombophlebitis.
> 
> 
> 
> The generally accepted upper limit for a peripheral IV is 900 mOsm/L. When the osmolarity exceeds 900 mOsm/L, the ability of the peripheral veins to dilute parenteral infusions sufficiently is compromised, and chemical irritation of the vein intima occurs. Admixtures greater than 600 to 900 mOsm/L are associated with a dramatic increase in phlebitis and should be administered via a central line.
> 
> 
> 
> In a brief review of the literature, I couldn't find a 'magic' number regarding the lowest acceptable osmolarity or tonicity of an IV solution. Most people have been taught 0.45% sodium chloride, at 154 mOsm/L, is the lowest osmolarity that should be used via any IV route. Very hypotonic IV solutions such as 1/4 NS (NaCl 0.2%) cause red blood cells to swell and burst. If a sufficient number of RBC's are so affected, the patient may develop anemia. This condition is usually referred to as hemolytic anemia
> 		
> Click to expand...


So, 150-900mOsm/L is where it's at. Keep that in mind while you read on.


If your syringe only carries 40 units per ml this entire math is off. It's confusing isn't it? Units are not a measure of volume, but of the insuline contained inside that volume. If you use a vial with 100 units insuline per ml, you use a syringe that is labeled 0-100 units, but carries 1ml. If your insuline vial is concentrated at 40 units per ml, one should use syringes labelled 0-40 units. They both carry 1ml though (1ml=1cc).


Just to be certain, can 60 units fit into one of your syringes? There are insulin syringes that can carry 100 units per ml (pretty sure that's the standard in the US). Neither the 60 units your ex hubby drew up, nor the 30 you usually receive would fill the syringe all the way.

Is that correct?


In that case, just to give you an idea what you are doing to your body... A physiological osmolarity is 300mOsm/L.


If you inject a solution with, say 3000mOsm/L, the solution will draw liquid towards it. Both from inside and outside your cells. This will kill cells. That is what you are doing now. 3000 motherfucking milliOsmoles per Liter.


56mg/ml is the physiological concentration of meth. LOL I mean at that concentration, no water will have to move anywhere when the solution comes in contact with your cells. So that's a **healthy **concentration I guess. :D


Now, the stuff your friends inject you with has **TEN TIMES** that osmolarity. If you really had a clot and that shit would leak out, you will find a nice big hole where the liquid entered unless the body manages to clear it very fast. That's the only reason why you are not seeing holes in your arms. Most of the liquid you inject enters the vein and gets diluted rapidly. Every miniscule amount that does not end up in your veins will kill the surrounding cells. KEEL THEM DEAD!


So... You want a rush. What you want is the highest possible osmolarity that won't ruin your veins. I would not dare to go past 700, even if it says 900 in that text. Me, whenever I shoot up, I go for 300mOsm/L. If I miss, big fucking deal. I don't have to worry (depends on solvent and substance ofc).


Let's figure out how much water you need for 1.5 points of Methamphetamine HCl. No wait. Since I doubt your friends will buy different syringes because some internet whackjob said so, let's see where you land when you put the 1.5 points into a full syringe.


I will assume your syringe is said to carry **100 UNITS total at a volume of 1ml. **They usually easily fit 1.1cc. So:


**1.5 points in 1.1cc -> 730mOsm/L


I would not go higher than that. Just use as much liquid as the syringe will fit for your 150mg meth.**


That's about 4 times as much liquid as you are used to. In my experience it will not have any significant effect on the rush. Make sure you're in that vein, inject relatively fast. You'll get the same rush. Your arms will thank you for it.


If you didn't understand this, read it again. And again. You've got time for 100 hour meth sessions, you'll have time for this. For your health.

The syringes go to 100 I’m pretty certain.

100? 

Really?

Jesus. If I were to do that to myself I WOULD miss, every time, because of how long it would take to get all that in to me ![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png)![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png)![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png) 


Trying to work out now if you people are all just super cautious, or the people I know are mother fucking insane. 


So I’m going to give this a shot. Only one. (Probably won’t get on again for a month or two now, my poor body needs to heal) and if you are correct and it doesn’t impact my rush negatively then you just saved a girls veins lol

If it does fuck up my rush, I’m gonna be mighty pissed off, because you’ve now scared the life out of me too.

Every time I look at my arm I see NECROSIS. And certain death ![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png) damn you. 


Let’s not tell my ex husband about this ok?

I hate when he’s right.

You know, I wasn't entirely honest. 700 is way too much already. Just get those people to buy 2ml syringes. I'm not a cautious individual at all. I've found myself flushing out syringes from piles of trash (much more than once). I've... I'm not gonna start telling more stories, just take my word for it.

I did dozens of trials with a combo of MDMA+psychedelic+disssociative (my goto combo for a rush!!!!). That's not cautious. The lower osmolarity will NOT compromise your rush, don't worry. It will just save some cells from certain death.

When I first learned how to do this myself I had very little knowledge of the quality of my meth or the difference each batch would make. I learned a lot here.

And started to experiment with different mixes to see what had the best effect while not compromising my veins. Inexperience meant I felt I needed less total liquid, both for the rush and also due to the fact I’d shake like a mother fucker and if I had too much liquid I’d nearly always slip through my vein before I could finish the shot. My veins are ridiculously shallow.

Doing it myself I’d always sit around 30 to 40 to avoid missing and get it all in.


I had NO CLUE that the amount I was using was so dangerous til tonight when you explained and it all makes so much more sense to me now. 

No wonder my veins are freaking the fuck out and collapsing! 

I’ve lost 2 now in 5 years of once or twice a month use! I KNEW there was something not right but seeing everyone else do it just made me think I have pathetic veins ![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png)

Abscesses usually occur due to a mix of poor hygiene and bad luck.


Tap water is fine.

I’ve tried them. And backloading once too.

Guess which dickhead lost around 6 points down the sink trying to be pro with zero fucking clue? ![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png) 


I’ll never forget the night I stood at my sink and watched $100 worth of gear drain down the plug hole because I couldn’t work out what I was doing when trying to transfer to a freshie ![😳](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f633.png)


Same with the filters. I always felt like half my hit was left behind.


And this kids is why I chose the name novice when I joined. And why I try to leave the business end to the pros.

Some of my mates are anal retentive about hygiene, one in particular taught me loads about safe injecting because he’d contracted hep c as a kid.

Others are just too far gone in their addictions now I’m coming to realise.

Very glad to hear that. Stick to that guy. 

Don't let people tell you "it doesn't matter", "it's not that important", "i've been doing it for years and am still here" etc. 


You can get away with that shit a thousand times and then one day you don't. I've had an abscess turn into a sepsis before. Got plenty of saliva under the skin. Don't even ask!! 

Another time, after roughly 300 pokes with a completely dull needle (I actually sharpened it on the metal kitchen sink) I found 10-15ml air under he skin. That crackling sound scared the living shit out of me. 


What I'm saying is you'll usually be fine drawing water from public toilets. When you're not you lose an arm or even your life. Check out the IV complications mega thread. It doesn't seem you need to judging by how you reacted to my explanations yesterday, but it's still a good read.

Oh I’ve read them all.

Had a few scary (one similar to your skin popping incident actually lol) experiences that turned me into the most paranoid, hypochondriac fucker to ever walk the earth on meth. I actually piss myself off royally sometimes.  


One mate has this stupid myth about blowing on the area before inserting a needle, lost count of how many times I’ve had to remind him not to fucking spit on me ![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png)![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png)![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png)![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png)


I was super lucky to meet my mate with the hep c very early on, I doubt I’d be alive today without him as I was on a road to fucking hell around that time and would literally try anything if someone said it was fun.

Hahaha that's the most moronic thing I've heard in a while - blowing saliva onto the injection site. Don't mean to insult your buddy there, hope he doesn't read this. Absolutely brilliant. 


I've become very paranoid myself when it comes to hygiene.


Then again, bit over half a year ago I IV'ed ketamine with 5-MeO-MIPT, because I was out of 2-Oxo-PCE and 2C-E. Some dissociative/psychedelic combos don't work very well. This one had no spiritual value at all and I didn't remember much either.

What I do remember is sitting on the couch IM'ing more ketamine while my feet were standing in a very very large puddle of vomit. I just kept going. We are actually pretty anal about cleanliness. No idea what I was thinking


Drugs can bring out some extremely bizarre behaviors sometimes, especially stimulants and dissociatives.


Here's another one. I don't have a blood fetish. Blood and dead people don't bother me, but I don't have any fascination or obsession to them. I'm pretty indifferent when it comes to dead tissue, unless it smells.


So there I am missing a shot. Ugly bruise. I try to suck the liquid back out which doesn't work in case you've never tried it. Fast forward two days. I am sitting in a pile of trash, north of hundred needles and butterflies around me. I ended up drawing 500ml of blood which took a very long time with 27G needles and being completely dehydrated.


I used the blood to paint on canvas. When I woke up it all seemed like a horrible nightmare. Some major Dr Jekyll ll and Mr Hyde shit. The experience made me so much more empathetic towards people with self destructive behavior, especially when it's drug induced.


Nobody ever plans to end up in these situations. There are so many better options than being homeless and selling ones ass for more coke to mainline. People who have never been there will never understand this. Very few do anyway. Being bipolar taught me the same lessons. Those who assume free will knows no limits are just lucky they never found out. 


Tempted to tell more Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde stories, but this is not the place. :D

It's garbage whatever it is now. It has just enough to keep you craving but damn it I just can't catch a good rush like I did when I first started IV-ing. I relapsed at the beginning of the year after 2 years clean time and have been using a bit most days... The days I don't use I feel pretty depleted. It sucks... I'm looking for this rush that I don't think I'll ever be able to find again. I want to feel my whole body tingle bwahahaha! I sleep every night (even if it's a couple hours), I eat every day, I drink plenty of water. But that's mostly so my friends and family don't catch on... I've been doing this for 6 weeks and so far no one has questioned me. Blessing? Curse? Idk anymore. I'm planning on slowly dosing down to nothing (fingers crossed) I'm scared with all the cut and adulterants... A friend of mine told me there are some batches with fent cut in it. How do you know if it's yours? When you OD I guess. SMH. Hope you stay safe as well friend.

Holy shit Allure you and me both! I stopped cold turkey for two years, got bored and relapsed, and have been banging meth again since a little before xmas. I don't f*ck with big dosage and tbh just a little bit gives me a nice rush then keeps me awake for at least 24 hours straight. For the past 2 years I've been an exercising machine and eating super healthy, etc. Now I'm like naw screw it, I'll just blast this shot and go on this bender. What I find stupid is somehow I equate staying awake on Meth like a version of intermittent fasting. Damn, damn, damn.

I’m in Australia started IV meth when I was 14 but didn’t use often at all. Went on a 8 month bender when I was 19 was using about a 0.1 at a time. Since then now 30 I only use about 2 times a year if that. With 3 short benders in 11 years. These days when I do it I’ll IV 0.25-0.3g at a time and get Absolutely paraletic. Sometimes it’s a bit scary but i love being in that inhebriated state. I’m the only person Iin my current circle  that IV’s the rest smoke. I hate smoking, it just frustrates me and I feel like it doesn’t work. I’m not a large woman so realise I’m provably doing too much land freak people out when I do it but that’s the only reason I’ll get on this shit! ![😬](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f62c.png) I’m an infrequent user generally but been on it for a month. Won’t have a problem getting off it if I cut everyone out who uses. That’s my 2 cents.

It puzzles me why osmolarity is practically never discussed on these forums, when knowledge about it can significantly reduce the strain on the body, regardless of the injected substance.

10cc water per ".10" (one point). It very easy to wind up with a rig filled to 80 by just using 40cc water for .4 for example

I have been a lurker on these various forums from the age of 16. I am 36 now. I have learned lot of very useful information here, but the thing i really like a lot is the different perspective  and experience you can get from people going through the same thing. You can see the good, the bad and the ugly. People being honest, people in denial, and people probably not in the right state of mind. All of this creates a great picture of the possibilities and consequences of substance use.


Personally i would consider myself a drug addict. I have a good job, keep myself fit and active, but I use cocaine a couple of times a month, as well as MDMA a few times a year. I had to take a certification exam for work and decided to take some Adderall to help me study. Naturally i liked it a lot, and it worked great. I studied my ass off and passed the test.


I got more on a few occasions, but its hard to get real Adderall, and its expensive as hell. I got this bright idea to buy Crystal Meth and just do little bumps to see if i can replicate the affects of the Adderall. I got my hands on some what i presume to be very good product from a reliable source. It was definitely NOT the same. I don't know if its the difference in manufacturing, or the act of sniffing it, but it just makes you want to do more. I was able to control myself and still be productive but it was clear that this was not going to end well. Needless to say i never got it again. I got over the desire for both in a few months and can now be productive naturally.


I have never used Opiates, but Meth is bounds more dangerous than Cocaine in my opinion.


Thank you all for your contributions here and cheers!

This is so true. There is a thread somewhere about a guy who reckons meth is the perfect cure for ADHD but I take prescribed dexamfetamine as well as using meth recreationally. They seem to me to be completely different drugs even though some effects similar.


I never feel compelled to abuse dex but meth is just so moreish plus dex allows me to construct and work with complex ideas while meth is more about jumping from one simple bullet point to the next or just getting obsessively focussed on one simple idea for hours / it is the most unproductive drug I’ve ever tried besides heroin. I get more stuff done on benzos than I ever do on meth. Still, I love it though!

Dude...you totally answered a post from like six years ago. That dude is long gone. But, I think he was referring to some dope has a tendency to make the tendons that support your nuts contract and get sore after a while, causing a dull persistent ball-ache that lasts for a couple days after you stop. I only had it a couple times, but it fucking sucked.

Unsure if I’m posting in the correct area, I searched around a moment but this is as close as I can find to what I may want. 

Anyway, I made up a shot for myself in a rig I recently cleaned out with bleach.I hadn’t rinsed the bleach out of the cap completely when I mixed my shot into it.There can’t be more than a droplet or two of bleach mixed into my 80cc shot. I’m wondering if it’s safe to continue with the procedure or if I should just trash it altogether? When I was brand new I had been given a bleach water shot by mistake and I don’t remember getting cotton fever, or anything happening aside from being able to taste the bleach in my mouth after it was injected. So I assume I will be fine? I just wanted a second opinion.

I was able to control myself and still be productive but it was clear that this was not going to end well. Needless to say i never got it again. I got over the desire for both in a few months and can now be productive naturally.

You gotta remember the therapeutic dose of Meth is 5-10mgs. If you have a sensitive enough scale you could measure out small doses and just swallow it in water. Eating meth is better than shooting or snorting it.

This is true. I accidentally shot half a gram of very excellent meth thinking it was the shitty Covid meth I had previously been not enjoying. Totally blew my brains out for a day or two. Now I wash my meth and quit shooting.

I’ve smoked a gram over 18 hours and feel kind of tired (I did take 50 mg of seroquel after 12 hours because I got very bored and thought I might want to sleep instead but it didn’t knock me out). It’s only 11 AM now and I don’t know whether to start into the next gram (have 2 left) or just gradually decline into sleep whenever it comes. It may well be a waste to take any more.

It has a slight effect in first 24 hours but it will put me out like a light around the 48 hour mark no matter how meth I’ve consumed. 50 mg works like a charm then.


i prefer to use seroquel for sleep to save any benzos i have for subsequent evening heebie jeebies as withdrawal kicks in for a day or two.

That makes sense, since Seroquel is a dopamine antagonist

I believe the sleep effect at low doses is caused by its anti-histamine properties.

After reading on this thread I have a few questions. Backstory: I've been using meth pretty solid for about a year an a half. Smoking up till august last year.. switched to IV bc I just didnt feel it from smoking anymore. I read up on here about water:meth ratio and I use around 30 water: .4 meth. (That's what I do now per shot). I literally feel a "rush" for about 15-20mins then nothing. No euphoria,  no obsessive tasks, no needless talking, no staying up for how ever long.. I sleep every night. I have shot .4 multiple times per day just to feel that initial feeling. I kno my tolerance has alot to do with it. But after reading this thread I'm wondering about if my meds hav an affect on the "high" as well. I take 200mg diphenhydramine, 2mg risperidone,  400mg seroqeul, 45mg buspar an 20mg melatonin every night. I used to sleep like a rock but have gotten used to these meds as well. Could these meds be causing me to not feel the meth as much? I hav only 2 suppliers.. 1 is down rite now, the other has multiple sources of where they get it. The same stuff used to get me going pretty good so not sure if it's only caused by "shitty meth". Sorry if I've repeated some details I've posted in other threads i just want to cover all bases.

Most likely so. Best thing one can do is eat sleep, jerk off, and rest. You have to rebuild those spent neurons. Feed you body good stuff. The hardcore LA speed seen as all about juicing and vitamin dumping

Then even when ur sure ONLY PUSH IN 1-5units, if you feel a burn at all take it out and go in a vain father up your arm. If no burn just push the rest in slowly... good luck.

Ive been IVing for a few months now and my body is so tense that I am starting to feel a lot of pain in my arms. I can't even lift anything with my right hand without my elbows and triceps area hurting. I don't know if it's a pinched nerve or if the meth is eating away at my muscles. I know I haven't been eating as much but I've been sleeping. And my left kidneys are hurting like crazy and I feel like this is the end of me. Is there anything I can do besides hydrate and take kidney supplements. Is there anything I can do for muscles like am I ever gonna be able to work out again or did I screw myself for good ?

Have you been taking magnesium? That seem to help with muscular problems for me.

> I doubt the meth is eating away at the muscles in a big way, although it can corrode your veins at the injection site. It is possible that you have some kind of infection though. Another possibility is that you hit a nerve when you injected. Nerve pain can sometimes manifest in a location away from the site of the actual damage.

Yeah I take my vitamins everyday and as far as the injection site goes I don’t inject the right arm.. usually the left. So it can’t be from that. Maybe tendinitis could be the cause for the pain in the arms and strength training mixed with drug use can cause problems if you over do it

Blood pressure is low and heart rate is high. I’d be seeing a doctor. Although I read you are supposed to measure both those things at the same time every day for like a week to make sure it is not an isolated incident. And obviously when you are not high or it’s pointless to measure it. Bluelight can’t be giving any advice about diagnosing  or resolving medical stuff like this beyond sharing similar experiences and recommending that you see a doctor.

I missed that you work out in the original post. That sounds like the most obvious explanation if it’s in the arm you don’t inject into.

What's it mean when large shards don't readily dissolve in water? Like it takes 3 or 4 mins of stirring in warm water. Otherwise, it's good meth-- I just wonder what the cut might be.


FWIW, I smoke a little but mostly plug it. That's why I'm dissolving it in water.

It means it is cut with MSM (most likely). That might be shards of MSM thrown into the bag, or possibly more likely MSM and Meth “re-rocked’ to form a single shard.


The single shard you have could be 80% totally fire d-methamphetamine + 15 % MSM cut + 5 % leftovers from manufacturing. Or any combination of the three.


An acetone wash will take out the MSM and the manufacturing leftovers leaving you just with the meth.


Some unknown cuts may still be present after the wash but not often. After you acaetone wash the meth it should dissolve near instantly in water but you still need to filter it with cotton before shooting. If you are plugging there is less issue about filtering but it still wouldn’t hurt.

This is obviously the problem here. In large enough doses seroquel absolutely kills the meth high (btw risperidone does the same thing).

Hey man, I saw your comment and just wanted to share my experience.


A few years ago I was ignorant and doing lots of meth (and not even injecting it) & I would often push my body to extremes, usuallty sexually. All I wanted to do is keep going and going every time. This fucked my body up every single time. Sore muscles, stiff muscles, etc..


Eventually one night on a binge I went to go pee and my urine was root beer colored. If you ever see this, it's possible you might need to get to the hospital right away for IV fluids. It scared the shit out of me and I learned it was rhabdomyolysis. I was tearing away at my muscles. The meth's not exactly "eating away" at them, I mean maybe the other toxic shit it was made with could be too, but it does send your body temp & heart rate and everything sky rocketing. So the added stress of the meth ontop of say, a strenous work out, could shut down your kidneys by way of muscle damage.


I managed to recover by immediately drinking tons and tons of water, electrolytes, & by taking things like benzo's or other downers that would bring my body temp down and let my muscles relax. Lots and lots of sleep. If you're not noticing incredibly dark urine, you may be okay or just on the edge. For me I often thought my pee was just so dark because I was dehydrated, until it came out almost the same color as a kidney bean/root beer. That's when I realized I was doing a lot more to my body than I even realized.


Even casual hardcore workouts can cause muscle damage leading to kidney damage/failure.


I had blood work done twice since this experience and everything came back normal. But I dunno what would have happened had I ignored the signs and kept on going that night. Probably kidney failure. I was lucky to apprently not have any lasting damage either. Or at least not any that the doctors were concerned about, but I wouldn't press my luck again. lol

I could have died & didn't even see it coming. So be safe!

So as long as I'm consuming meth and working out even if I get sleep.. I'm always gonna be at risk with getting rhabdomyolysis even if I stop injecting? =(

It's possible. I had no idea what rhabdo was or that I needed to take precautions until it happened to me. They say the lifespan of a daily meth user is roughly 10 years. I don't know if I believe that as i've met people who have been using for 10-20 years and are still alive and still working and everything, but they're not exactly healthy in the 'head' if you know what I mean. I can sort of see it though, as there's so much toxic shit that goes into making it, that one must think the risk of premature death must be a lot higher for meth addicts. I've been using myself for about 20 years, but my use has always been rather sporadic binges rather than an every day thing. I also was stupid and just kept going and consumed over a gram (probably more) in a total of 5 days with no sleeping or eating when this happened to me. I then chose to lay around and masturbate for most of those 5 days (crazy, I know lol) and I'm pretty sure it was all that strain on my muscles, dehydration and too high of a body temperature that contributed to it. I know better now, but any time I use, even when I drink shit tons of water, my urine still comes out a little dark (although it's never been that root beer color again).


I'd say if you're worried or still experiencing the pain in your kidney area, you could always go to a doctor and tell them you just haven't been feeling well and ask them to do complete bloodwork. This way they'll see if there's damage accumulating in your kidneys and if they find it soon enough, you can take the steps necessary to prevent yourself from going into kidney failure. Which might mean having to give up meth or working out or both.


Unfortunately as long as one consumes meth (in any shape or form) they will be at risk to many things. If you're a bodybuilder/weight lifter and like to work out and use, your risk of possible rhabdo will be higher, along with probably a lot of cardiac strain. Unlike a lot of other drugs, it is directly toxic to the cells and neurons in your brain & organs. So using meth long term generally leads to poorer health and permanent changes in the brain that can start to affect personality.  I've seen it in a lot of people I've known who used it for too long and have even observed these changes in myself. I hate seeing it happen to others, but I know addiction is not an easy thing to just say "hey you should stop" to, so the least I can do is try to help inform others and give them the knowledge to protect themselves if they decide they're gonna use.


Technically, every time one uses meth in recreational doses, they are giving themselves permanent brain damage and possibly organ damage. The brain is great at building new pathways and adapting with time, but it can only do so much and eventually you can reach a point of no return (parkinsons, psychosis, etc..).

My partner now hears voices, has delusions of persecution and talks to people that are not there. And this is even when he's not using. He loved to inject it too and after awhile, it changed him into a different person who now has some sort of psychosis/schizophrenia, that hasn't worn off or gone away, even with extended time away from meth.


Hope you are feeling better man! Take good care! All the best!

Well I’ve already had 2 heart attacks and I’m only 34 so if that doesn’t get me to quit I don’t know what will.  That’s bad enough as it is I can tell you that much. I’m just stubborn and if only I was mentally strong like I am physically strong then it would be easy to quit.


You know I find it strange that I can have 4 Mexican guys stab me in the back because I was at the wrong place and the wrong time and still manage to beat the shit out of two of them while the other two ran away but quitting meth I just can’t get myself to do it. I’m a beast when it comes to street fights but this should be easier to do.


It might be the whole lethargy problem and me not wanting to feel tired constantly after I quit and gaining weight like crazy. I don’t know. It’s just annoying because with all the shit I’ve been through I should be mentally a lot stronger and want this for myself. Guess I need to work on loving myself more ![😕](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f615.png)

The pull of drugs can grab anyone. Once your brain is accustomed to that level of neurotransmitters, any sudden drop is going to be hell. I personally believe it becomes an "illness" at that point and I'm completely astounded at the fact that there's no "maintenance" for stimulant users, kind like there is with opioids. Some kind of maintenance stimulant could probably help somebody who's really ready to be done but just physically needs something to get out of bed in the morning. 


Recovery can take a very long time, but there's stuff you can do and take to help speed it up a bit and make it a tad easier. Loving yourself more is definitely a great first step. 

I think it's really unfair that our society doesn't address these things differently. If they now accept that addiction is a "disease", then why are people still punished for it? And why the lack of medication assisted treatment options? They could make it so much easier and safer for people if there wasn't so much stigma and regulations. 


I have messaged you though man. You are not alone and are welcomed to vent to me any time.

I personally believe it becomes an "illness" at that point and I'm completely astounded at the fact that there's no "maintenance" for stimulant users, kind like there is with opioids. Some kind of maintenance stimulant could probably help somebody who's really ready to be done but just physically needs something to get out of bed in the morning.

Yeah that’s one thing that pisses me off is these doctors prescribing nothing but anti depressants instead of dextroamphetamine or ritalin, focalin, vyvanse. Every doctor I ever saw told me they don’t prescribe stimulants.. but here’s a fuck ton of antidepressants because that’s what we doctors do now days. Like wtf is the point of going to the doctors when you can’t even get the help that you need? Lol crazy world we live in

I like eating high carb, lean protein and at times lately a lot of fruit. I am planning on experimenting with oral meth use soon, is there some slight modification to my diet or supplement to take? More specifically I prefer starchy vegetables like jap sweet potatoes, beans and lentils, steering clear of heavy grain use and switching to way more fruit instead. I have issues metabolizing too large amounts of fat.

Vitamin C - ascorbic acid - which you will get from eating a lot of fruit will reduce the effect of meth. It causes the body to process and excrete it more quickly.  Anything that acidifies your system does.

Depends on your goals I guess. Higher doses will fuck you up more in the short term but the high will be of shorter duration if you are very acidic. Better thing to do is alkanalyze your system by taking a small bit of bicarbonate of soda in water before you dose your meth.

Hmmm...that might interfere with the fruit metabolism though? I'll give that a shot though just like tums would work then? Probably wouldn't be too bad to do it like twice a week or so I tend to feel the tums messing me up if I take them too often though.

> Somewhat related, how dangerous might it be to take meth orally in a fasted state? I am a somewhat experienced faster 5+ day fasts multiple times a few of which I went 2-3 days with no water either. Question is say you were on day three of a water fast and took meth orally, would this just be a disaster? I hear people on this site stress the importance of eating when taking meth and I figure it must just be because of the chemical being injested. I mean fasting sucks when you have no experience, but now that I'm used to it, it provides great clarity and reduction in stress. Problem is it gets hard to move around and you become lethargic after like 3-4 days of it.

The problem I see with fasting is that meth quickly depletes you of a wide variety of nutrients. This would be compounded by fasting and would slow your recovery from meth. A lot of the negative push all effects of meth and the harsh comedown come through not eating due to appetite suppression.

Well you know...I'm not anti-fat and have done carnivore and keto diets....I do find fat necessary in certain amounts for mood, memory, and overall cognitive functioning. Raw fat is the easiest to metabolize...for me maybe raw bone marrow honestly. Would meth mix well say parachuted, and then a meal of bone marrow and maybe some raw beef?

Definitely. It’s really protein that you need as well as leafy greens for the necessary neurotransmitter precursors for dopamine.

Oh no way. Yeah I love kale and brussle sprouts. I think I may try that instead of a starchy meal. Should help to hopefully limit my use, since I don't plan on making high fat and protein meals my norm as they were in the past, but well...I'll just hope lol.

This can't be overstated. As someone who regularly ingested the stuff (empty pill capsules work best), don't eat it on an empty stomach.

It's a big waste because you end up preoccupied with the somersaults your stomach's doing as if you haven't eaten in a week (think coffee on an empty stomach, but worse).

And like Perforated said above, neurotransmitters aren't replenished without food. Protein-rich foods are crucial.

I've only used meth once before, I only insufflated a very small amount. I have always been cautious and saved it until such a time I have such great drug experience and knowledge I trust myself enough to do it.


So I have just gotten 2G of M and, well. What should I know before I do it?


Advice such as, don't do it. Won't be heeded.


Advice such as, maybe try not having a whole 2G around or doing more than XXX amount in XXX time. Things that will make my short experimentation with this chemical safer and more comfortable an experience would be appreciated.


I have smoked a bunch of really good crack before and I am not addicted to that. I have a great ability to be able to try different substances (even H/etc) and take my experience from it then leave it alone and seek more things to experiment with. The one thing I always return to and polarise myself with is psychedelics and LSD.  Saying that, if someone did offer me a pipe filled with some nice C it'd be hard to say no. But I won't go out actively looking for it or paying for it. If you know what I mean?


So, knowing my personality and the fact I have 2G to mess around with, what's the best way to proceed? I am thinking to vape/plug BTW!

If you're thinking this drug will just be another leisurely cake walk through psychonaut country, you're in for a rude "AWAKENING"  and that monkey doesn't go back into the box. If you are really convinced you know better, use a different ROA that is less reinforcing **(ie; do not smoke it). **

Well, as a regular meth user who has broken his addiction twice for several years but always come back to it and as someone who has tried the whole panoply of drugs you mention as well as quite a few others, I feel it is my harm reduction responsibility to first caution you against messing with meth. The euphoria when first using it is 10 X what crack cocaine is. Combine that with longevity of the ride and the extreme pro sexual effects, it can very easily get a grip on you before you know what’s happened. For an absolute novice, 2g is more than enough to earn you an ongoing habit. 


But that said, let’s move on to how to use it safely if you insist on proceeding. Firstly, as an absolute novice and provided you are not any any neuroleptic medication, a dose of just 50-100mg should get you high for a good 18-24 hours. The first 8-12 hours will be extreme whole body euphoria. You’ll be quivering with excitement and if your mind turns in that direction you’ll get as horny as hell. One of the features of the meth high is stereotypy or punding where you get obsessed with one action or activity endlessly to the exclusion of all else. Often this takes the form of masturbation and once you get started it can be extremely difficult to stop for 8 hours or longer. It’s good to have a concrete plan to go somewhere or do something BEFORE you get high - otherwise you’ll be stuck in your bedroom doing something pointless but that seems all engaging. The second 12 hours of your high will be less euhporic and you’ll be wide-awake, energetic but not overly so, and feel you have great mental acuity, focus and concentration. Towards the end of the period you’ll start to feel more irritable and sketched out depending on how long you’ve gone without sleep. 


Start with 50 mg. Meth is cumulative and you can re-dose at any time (unlike say LSD) to both increase the high and the duration. The time until re-dose depends on your ROA because you need to wait until your first dose is metabolised to see how high you actually are. 100 mg straight up could easily overamp you, and that ain’t fun. 


Insufflating: time to high 15-20 minutes. Hurts like hell because meth so caustic. Irrigate your nose with saline water afterwards (once meth absorbed)

Smoking: time to high 5-10 minutes. Requires specialised implements, takes forever, the act itself us addictive and you can easily pund on smoking.

IV: time to high 2-5 minutes. Highly dangerous. Highly addictive, Very destructive on body. Don’t start.

Plugging: time to high 10-15 minutes, depending on where you hit in your rectum. Bit hit and miss but gives nice smooth rush if done correctly. Easily botched.

Oral: time to high 30-40 minutes. Put meth in a gelcap or twist of toilet paper to swallow. 


With 2 g at your disposal you will be highly tempted to keep re-dosing. You should not have to do more tha. 100 mg in 24 hours. You also don’t want to stay high longer than 48 hours due the effect on your body and mind and the increased intensity of the crash. If it takes 100 mg to get through the first 24 hours it will probably take 150 mg to get through the second 24. But only redose every 6 hours or so with 50 mg. You can easily push yourself into overamping or psychosis in that second 24 hours. 


At the end of the trip you are going to have real trouble sleeping and if you don’t the comedown may be one of the most psychologically traumatic experiences of your life depending on what kind of tendency towards anxiety or depression y0u have. Benzos or an anti-psychotic like seroquel are a must. You don’t need a big dose of either and if you still can’t sleep at least go to bed and try and relax breathing deeply and listening to chill music. 


So for 48 hours you are going to need a MAX of 250g, probably less if you want to stay out of trouble. If you leave your house DO NOT TAKE THE 2g BAG WITH YOU, or next thing you know it will be 4 days later and you’re in some kind of institution, penal or medical depending on luck mainly. Measure out your 50 g doses WITH SCALES into gelcaps to take with you. It is very difficult to eyeball meth weight. A 0.05 g shard and a 0.2 g shard often aren’t that different really depending on density. 50 grams the wrong way and you could be overamping since you have zero tolerance.


Make sure you eat a high protein meal (with lots of leafy greens) before you take off, try and remember to snack a little through your high, and stay hydrated with electrolyte drinks. You need to drink a lot. Do a search here to find the symptoms of overamping and meth overdose. It could safe your life. There is a recent great thread on meth overdoses you should read just in case. Beware of overheating - that’s when meth becomes particularly neurotoxic 


Finally meth has diminishing returns. Enjoy this first experience because IT WILL NEVER FEEL LIKE THAT AGAIN no matter how much you take. The first thing to go with continued meth use is euphoria. If you went through that 2g bag in say 2 weeks you’d notice that you need 100-150 mg at the end to equal anything like what that first 50 mg did. It’s all downhill from there. A seasoned user will go through 1 g in 24 hours, feel next to no euphoria, and sleep at the end of it. 


Any specific questions hit me up.

Combine that with longevity of the ride and the extreme pro sexual effects, it can very easily get a grip on you before you know what’s happened. For an absolute novice, 2g is more than enough to earn you an ongoing habit.
> 
> 
> 
> But that said, let’s move on to how to use it safely if you insist on proceeding. Firstly, as an absolute novice and provided you are not any any neuroleptic medication, a dose of just 50-100mg should get you high for a good 18-24 hours. The first 8-12 hours will be extreme whole body euphoria. You’ll be quivering with excitement and if your mind turns in that direction you’ll get as horny as hell. One of the features of the meth high is stereotypy or punding where you get obsessed with one action or activity endlessly to the exclusion of all else. Often this takes the form of masturbation and once you get started it can be extremely difficult to stop for 8 hours or longer. It’s good to have a concrete plan to go somewhere or do something BEFORE you get high - otherwise you’ll be stuck in your bedroom doing something pointless but that seems all engaging. The second 12 hours of your high will be less euhporic and you’ll be wide-awake, energetic but not overly so, and feel you have great mental acuity, focus and concentration. Towards the end of the period you’ll start to feel more irritable and sketched out depending on how long you’ve gone without sleep.
> 
> 
> 
> Start with 50 mg. Meth is cumulative and you can re-dose at any time (unlike say LSD) to both increase the high and the duration. The time until re-dose depends on your ROA because you need to wait until your first dose is metabolised to see how high you actually are. 100 mg straight up could easily overamp you, and that ain’t fun.
> 
> 
> 
> Insufflating: time to high 15-20 minutes. Hurts like hell because meth so caustic. Irrigate your nose with saline water afterwards (once meth absorbed)
> 
> Smoking: time to high 5-10 minutes. Requires specialised implements, takes forever, the act itself us addictive and you can easily pund on smoking.
> 
> IV: time to high 2-5 minutes. Highly dangerous. Highly addictive, Very destructive on body. Don’t start.
> 
> Plugging: time to high 10-15 minutes, depending on where you hit in your rectum. Bit hit and miss but gives nice smooth rush if done correctly. Easily botched.
> 
> Oral: time to high 30-40 minutes. Put meth in a gelcap or twist of toilet paper to swallow.
> 
> 
> 
> With 2 g at your disposal you will be highly tempted to keep re-dosing. You should not have to do more tha. 100 mg in 24 hours. You also don’t want to stay high longer than 48 hours due the effect on your body and mind and the increased intensity of the crash. If it takes 100 mg to get through the first 24 hours it will probably take 150 mg to get through the second 24. But only redose every 6 hours or so with 50 mg. You can easily push yourself into overamping or psychosis in that second 24 hours.
> 
> 
> 
> At the end of the trip you are going to have real trouble sleeping and if you don’t the comedown may be one of the most psychologically traumatic experiences of your life depending on what kind of tendency towards anxiety or depression y0u have. Benzos or an anti-psychotic like seroquel are a must. You don’t need a big dose of either and if you still can’t sleep at least go to bed and try and relax breathing deeply and listening to chill music.
> 
> 
> 
> So for 48 hours you are going to need a MAX of 250g, probably less if you want to stay out of trouble. If you leave your house DO NOT TAKE THE 2g BAG WITH YOU, or next thing you know it will be 4 days later and you’re in some kind of institution, penal or medical depending on luck mainly. Measure out your 50 g doses WITH SCALES into gelcaps to take with you. It is very difficult to eyeball meth weight. A 0.05 g shard and a 0.2 g shard often aren’t that different really depending on density. 50 grams the wrong way and you could be overamping since you have zero tolerance.

You need to drink a lot. Do a search here to find the symptoms of overamping and meth overdose. It could safe your life. There is a recent great thread on meth overdoses you should read just in case. Beware of overheating - that’s when meth becomes particularly neurotoxic
> 
> 
> 
> Finally meth has diminishing returns. Enjoy this first experience because IT WILL NEVER FEEL LIKE THAT AGAIN no matter how much you take. The first thing to go with continued meth use is euphoria. If you went through that 2g bag in say 2 weeks you’d notice that you need 100-150 mg at the end to equal anything like what that first 50 mg did. It’s all downhill from there. A seasoned user will go through 1 g in 24 hours, feel next to no euphoria, and sleep at the end of it.

I ended up using it through a freebase pipe, I had really pure DW stuff. I got the rush, yeah. It was cool, I still think the crack that I've smoked in life has been 10x. Methamphetamine feels boring. Oh yeah, I plugged too.


Maybe not my thing, but in the collection it goes!!!


I'm getting to the end of my experiments with RCs and psychs and drugs in general except cannabis (my medicine) I wish to finish it off with a-pvp and Meth, being the strongest stims I can find. Not together obviously.


I can honestly say though, I expected meth to make me go Peter Griffin, lmfao. 


I don't really feel like more, infact. I'm tired off acid trip. So I'm gonna sleep. Peace guys!!

Sounds like it didn’t put a hook in you. glad to hear it. And no time is ever better than the first time, so there’s no incentive to try again now you’ve ticked it off your list.

I've smoked it, boofed it. Done what I could which would usually work with coke, the quality is undoubted (online) so I guess I'm just not a meth guy, glad I tried it. But I can see the risk behind a vulnerable mind who isn't a psychonaut falling into using it for escapism. I've never really liked amphetamines much as a whole, unless they're psychedelic amphetamines, I'm glad I tried this though. (Don't let this be encouragement. My life and it's path is mine.)


I'm gonna smoke a joint, I literally did this and I'm on it now and I feel like going to sleep, so goodnight. (Perhaps I have ADHD? I was misdiagnosed as such as a child but ritalin just made me super hyper. Now they think I have Asperger's.) I just think we're all individuals and people should be careful with their own personal chemistry whether it be bringing on anxiety through smoking weed or curing it smoking weed. 


Everyone's different, but I guess that's why general warnings are good. I've seen people slip up with hard drugs before and never come back!

Is that every day? How long have you been hitting it for?


I quit once when I was up to a gram a day and stopping was pretty hellish for a while. When I started again 2 months later I was still highly tolerant.


I believe there are two types of tolerance. A chronic lifetime tolerance that just gradually gets worse with regular use and never improves no matter how long you take a break for. Then there is an acute tolerance that builds up during binges and can be reset with abstinence for a while.


So basically your tolerance is dependent on personal metabolism, your lifetime use, and how long and strong your latest run has been. So as long as a piece of string.


It could also be influenced by certain neuroleptic medications if you are on t

I got it working in the end, it's just I'm used to the euphoria of crack and PvP, so I just found meth shit. I guess people have diff tastes.


In regards to GHB, I'm almost dying trying to stop that ATM.

I've been a daily intravenous usuer probably the last 6 months or so. Here recently while  fishing for a vein while being highly dehydrated I felt a sharp pain then afterwords not sure when but I'm noticing my arms numb . Not my whole arm but the lower forearm. It's been like this for days now. Any ideas? It feels like it's asleep. Also how long does the depression lay when trying to quit. I made it 5 days but the depression got really bad and I'm always alone in my motel room so I had to use.

But last night I couldn't hit at all and got frustrated and my hands were shaking from the shots of ice I've been doing and staying up. So In my twacked out state I found one on my forearm and I hit BUT I SHOT UP GOING TOWARDS MY WRIST instead of towards my heart. The way the blood runs. And the shot was THICK. And I didn't miss. But now I have a huge lump raised up about 3 inches across and significantly raised. It doesn't hurt but I've never in my career of use ever done something like this so idk what to do or what might happen.... Please advice.

I replied with some more comprehensive advice on your other thread about this. Basically you likely have superficial thrombosis from damaging a valve in your vein. You need to see a doctor but I've describe some first aid in the other post.

Thank you! Yeah I honestly don't hide the fact I'm an opiate/meth IV user even though it gets me treated rather badly most of the times at hospitals. 


The lump is hard and pretty big. Only hurts when I touch it. Could me injecting the wrong direction have had some part in it? I have strong antibiotics left over for when I had staph should I take them? Sorry for all the questions. 


So in your opinion I shouldn't wait for worse symptoms to occur before going to the ER?

Here's what I wrote in your other thread. If it was me I wouldn't wait to go to the ER and I'd just ignore any judgementalism and ensure I was safe. The symptoms at the site wil probably only get worse if you get an infection but the clot dislodging and moving through your body will be less immediately noticeable rightup until the point it lodges somewhere else deeper inside you.


......


From what you describe it is likely that you injected towards a valve. A corrosive shot like meth will quickly damage a venous valve and possibly result in superficial thrombosis (clotting) and blockage. The risk of the clot dislodging and flowing through your vein to somewhere it can cause real damage is significant (complications include deep-vein thrombosis, stroke, or cardiac damage). You need to see a doctor for a scan and possibly take anti-clotting agents for it to heal. You are at risk both from the clot and potential infection.


If for whatever reason you decline to see a doctor, a continual warm compress, an NSAID like aspirin or ibuoprofen and keeping the limb elevated is the best thing to do (and no further injections in that area and preferably no further meth because the resulting vasoconstriction could make things worse). If it hasn't killed you or gotten worse in 2 weeks you are probably ok.

Heat. With a meth miss, unlike heroin or coke, your body immediately encapsulates the foreign material. hence the hard lump. Heat asap allows the solution to permeate the walls of the white blood cell barrier. Heating pad. Sleep with it. And massage the lump as much as you can stand to. Hold up on antibiotics. Hydrate. Heat.

Jesus....is it normal to have your vision shake..... heat and even had tracers for a minute from a shot of ice?     I had all the normal mamp type things like breathing heart rate and BP ultra focus. It was a large shot. .3 eyeballed.... ice looking and it melted like mamp and everything.


      Super fun but This high feels toxic to me and I've been getting confused at work too easy when crashing from morning doses.  Now that it's gone its. 2G lasted me 5 days. Time to chill for awhile. Might be the beginnings of amphetamine psychosis with that since I have done it everyday the last 5 days....I've slept.... prolly 4 hours a night and wake up everyday wide awake.  I force food and eat protein shakes. Also drink water non stop but there is only so much you can do against this.

So my question is how long do y'all last before craving? How much do you smoke? How can you tell good meth from bad without running a test or an alcohol bath. Just on the spot by the look or smell smell. Also how can you tell apart speed from crystal? again by the looks and stuff.


I live in a country where meth is very rare and hard to find. Which results in prices being ridiculously high (Literally double the price of cocaine). To add to that it is absolutely shit quality, or so I suspect. Not sure tho as i have never tried anything better.

I've been smoking meth once or twice a week for about a year. Until about two months ago and now it has increased to about everyday with a break on the 3rd day if I haven't slept. Well so naturally my tolerance has increased and with it my consumption. Tolerance increase is also the reason given by my source. So i went to another guy. Turns out they both get their stuff from the same source!

You could try snorting your meth, as it's less wasteful than smoking and lasts longer (though it's not as intense).

funny you say 30 minutes, we used to have a default disclaimer that after the first initial round of hits 

for 37 minutes you'll get as high as you're gonna get all night,

but fuck me - you'll spend all night chasing it.  


If you're smart you;ll put it away after a couple of hits but who can resist ?

When it's smoked, yeah. Terribly impractical way of using the stuff and straight up pointless after the first 3-4 hits. If you're a new user this should have you blasted for around 6 hours though. 


The urge to keep taking hit after hit is much stronger.

Im by no means encouraging hard drug use but why not buy  the coke  half the price.  Better quality?? Whip it in to crack in mins an smoke that insted cheaper purer n sounds as if its lasting as long. 

I can go hours inbetween smoking pipes if i want or need too. 

I always assumed meth would be so intense an last for days lol. Its one drug ive not heard of any ever  being sold local.  I know theres a small market for it here. But its all coke/Mdma here when it comes to stims amphetamine also but its not as popular as in the 90s ![🤔](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f914.png)

I've got a question about meth. I was researching how to test your meth for purity or cut. I do not have access to the reagent testing kits that I've read about or any methods like that. I am more in the area of home-made testing theories. I've ran across several ways including dropping meth in bleach and watching the reaction, something about adding a type of alcohol and doing something etc. But the one I was most comfortable that I would do properly was putting a small amount of your meth into a spoon with a small amount of water then boiling off the water while leaving a miniscule amount of it to evaporate/dry itself. I read that if you have good/decent product it will leave a geometric sheen on the spoon. Well I did this test and there was a said sheen on the spoon but in the center of it it seemed the meth left a hard mound in the center. I scratched at this and it crumbled very easily and seemed to be turned back powder like?! I occasionally inject my meth and this scared me beyond belief!! I know injecting any substance is risky but is this normal? What can this mean? I would think the meth 'dissolves' in the water so how did it solidify and have a powdery texture??


Update: I found this on the web.

<copied> 

**Water test:**


This is the most simple and basic of tests. Any IV user will know this but people who don’t shoot up might not. Mix about equal parts water as meth. Warm water works better. The crystals should dissolve pretty fast. Depending on the size will depend on the speed though. It should also dissolve clear with no other impurities in it. Also will turn out oily. Depending on how much water you added will make the thickness of the oil vary.


This test you can see reuse the meth. Just leave it out to dry and the water will evaporate leaving it to recrystallize again. <End>


So the mass that's left over is the meth? I also read about the differences in the 2 isomers in methamphetamine. Levo and devo. It said devo meth triggers the dopamine release which causes the euphoria and mental stimulation whereas levo meth will make you 'feel a rush', become hot and sweaty with no stimulation yet your wide awake. I can say I've had some that was excellent and gave you all the good qualities of a meth high and then some like wat I have now do all of the latter. I have only used twice in the last 2 weeks. Is there any truth to what I've read?

Meth is generally a fairly high potency compared to other street drugs. Like 90% is pretty normal. It's a little more potent then dextroamphetamine, so I don't know why many are recommending 100mg+ shots. 20mg is enough to get extreme euphoria; if you start off with 100mg it may feel nicer at first but then 20mg won't be enough anymore. People mess up their tolerance like that with most drugs.


Dextromethamphetamine will be about 130% more potent than racemic methamphetamine. Also the type of salt form changes its potency too. HCl will be more potent than sulfate, and the amino acid salts in Adderall are even less potent. That's why Dexedrine is about 1.75x more potent then Adderall even though Adderall is 75% dextroamphetamine, it's only dextroamphetamine sulfate. Adderall has a much heavier mix of salts.

I personally believe it becomes an "illness" at that point and I'm completely astounded at the fact that there's no "maintenance" for stimulant users, kind like there is with opioids. Some kind of maintenance stimulant could probably help somebody who's really ready to be done but just physically needs something to get out of bed in the morning.

I think because there's not an excruciating physical addiction, it's the comedown you're feeling the most. It is extremely psychologically addictive, don't get me wrong.


Opioid, barbituate, and benzodiazepine withdrawal makes you so sick you feel like you're dieing if you were on a heavy dose.


Opioid withdrawal is by far the worst feeling, that's why substitution therapy with methadone and buprenorphine is a lifetime thing for many addicts. It's hellish restlessness that you can feel going down the nerves of your arms and legs, with flu like symptoms, temperature disregulation, sweating, unable to eat or sleep. It doesn't fully go away for a year or more. You can go to work without meth after chronic daily use, but for opioid withdrawal you wouldn't be able to do anything productive and hiding because you look obviously sick.

Can you flesh out how you get those numerical values for relative potency? 


D-meth 130 % > DL-meth


D-amp 175 % > Adderall


My understanding is that the L enantiomer of meth in racemic meth quite perceptibly changes the subjective experience by its action in peripheral nervous system - so a like for like potency equivalence is a bit problematic.


Also, where do you think one might ever come across amphetamine hydrochloride (vs usual sulfate) or methamphetamine sulfate (vs usual HCL)? Why do you say HCL is more potent than sulfate? I’m not questioning truth of this but I’d like to know why?

True.


I find stimulant (especially meth) crashes after a binge are sort of similar to opioid withdrawal in a way though. 

Hot flashes, extreme lethargy, boredom, even aching & pain. But they're different in their own way and I'd say opioid withdrawal can definitely be worse.

First off the simple question. The HCl salt is more potent than the sulfate salt because HCl has a smaller molar mass. If you put a gram of HCl and a gram of sulfate on a scale, the HCl will have more amphetamine molecules since there's 6.022E23 molecules in a mole. Hydrogen is ~1 atomic mass units (a single proton for the most abundant isotope) and chloride has 35.4 atomic mass units (17 protons, 18 neutrons usually) making for 36.4 g/mol. Sulfate, or has 96.1 atomic mass units and two acidic functional groups when sulfuric acid before sulfuric acid reacts and forms a sulfate anion with a base at 2:1 moles of base and sulfuric acid allowing for 2 amphetamine molecules for every 1. So amphetamine freebase is 135.21 moles of amphetamine per gram.


There's 135.21 + 35.4  = 170.4 moles of amphetamine HCl in a gram, while there's 135.21 + 84.25/2 moles = 177.34 moles of amphetamine sulfate in a gram.


93.10/135.21 then multiplied by Avagado's number makes 0.69 moles of amphetamine in a gram of amphetamine sulfate. This makes there 5.91E17 or 591,000,000,000,000,000 molecules of amphetamine per gram amphetamine hemisulfate.


135.21- 35.4 = 170.61 mol/g making 135.21/170.61= 0.79 moles of amphetamine in a gram of amphetamine HCl making 6.81E17 or 681,000,000,000,000,000 molecules of amphetamine in a gram of amphetamine HCl


 Therefore there's almost 100 quadrillion molecules more of amphetamine per gram of amphetamine HCl than 1 gram of amphetamine sulfate.


That took longer than expected to explain. I'll answer the other question later.

You're welcome. I like to take my knowledge of chemistry as I have a degree in organic chemistry and explain so people have a better understanding from info you can't get off of most addicts. Most people forget what a mole means after HS.


As for the dextrorotatory vs levorotatory enantiomers, levomethamphetamine is almost all peripheral. It's sold OTC I'm the US, and no one abuses it. Dextromethamphetamine is where the euphoria comes from. L-amp adds side effects. It's true that it's hard to compare potency as levoamphetamine may feel stronger physically causing much more discomfort.


Dextromethamphetamine is all you want. I think Adderall has L-amp in it because the cheaper precursor P2P makes a racemic mixture, while norpseudoephedrine makes just dextro.

Literally just registered for the site to post this— please let me know where to post this if it doesn’t belong here! 

So, I have a question regarding gastrointestinal upset directly following relapses. This is the second time I’ve gotten it bad, and I’ve been wondering if this is common among people who relapse after abstaining for some time. I wanted to know if me abstaining made it so that my body is no longer equipped to deal with the drug. Sort of like those very first few times that I messed around with this drug— where I would feel really sick (nauseous and/or severely bloated/cramp-y), usually the day after using. The stomach issues quickly dissipated as my body got used to the drug, and I had all but forgotten the handful of times I dealt with them. Is it possible I’m once again experiencing these, after being sober for the large majority of 8 months? Or is it just fallout from severely neglecting my body?

So, I don't know what your ROA is. I personally usually smoke. Occasionally hotrail. My favorite ROA is mixing in a drink, usually morning coffee and I'm good all day, but I haven't done that in months. I am USUALLY a daily user, tho lately money has been a little tight. Anyway, so I never had the upset tummy thing until recently. Now, almost every time I smoke, I get a stomach ache of some kind. I'm not sure if it's from just use, what it's cut with, etc. But, because of other serious health issues, I monitor my blood pressure and heart rate daily. I was diagnosed with tachycardia (abnormally high resting heart rate) about 3 years ago. My heart rate is NEVER below 100 when at rest, and never below 130 when active. I had been suffering from high blood pressure as well for a good 15 years, but when I stopped smoking pot, my blood pressure mellowed out. I still have high heart rate, but blood pressure was completely normal. But looking back at my records, I found for the past year, I've been suffering from LOW distolic blood pressure (the bottom number). And in the past few months it's been extremely low, like under 50 low. Doing some research on that, I discovered that low blood pressure can cause all kinds of nasty stomach upset, just like high blood pressure does. You'd think using a stimulant as strong as meth, I wouldn't be suffering from low blood pressure as badly as I am, but there you have it. When you put a carcinogenic like meth into your system, no matter the ROA, it's bound to do some nasty things to the body. Alka seltzer works pretty good for me when I get drug induced stomach issues. Or some ginger tea. Just, when you are using, whether daily or just occasionally, you really need to do your absolute best to sleep at least every other night, and eat. Even if you aren't hungry, you need to force yourself to eat. I drink 2--2 "Premier Protein" drinks everyday along with whatever food I can force down. No one except my husband and my connect know I use. I sleep, I eat, I hold a job and am now enrolled in college. I'm what they call a "functioning addict." If you're having stomach upset, try to eat something. And please, for the love of everything that is good and holy in this world, DO NOT mix uppers and downers of ANY SORT!

If you put a gram of HCl and a gram of sulfate on a scale, the HCl will have more amphetamine molecules since there's 6.022E23 molecules in a mole. Hydrogen is ~1 atomic mass units (a single proton for the most abundant isotope) and chloride has 35.4 atomic mass units (17 protons, 18 neutrons usually) making for 36.4 g/mol. Sulfate, or has 96.1 atomic mass units and two acidic functional groups when sulfuric acid before sulfuric acid reacts and forms a sulfate anion with a base at 2:1 moles of base and sulfuric acid allowing for 2 amphetamine molecules for every 1. So amphetamine freebase is 135.21 moles of amphetamine per gram.

I gave up on taking a break and all approved to be well. My ROA is snorting and slamming alternating between. 8 hours ago I began to sneeze uncontrollably, clear fluid is now flowing from my nose.Im running a low grade fever and ironically feel sluggish while on a stim. It could be exposure to constant a/c because of the intense heat where I am. Am I just coming down with the common cold or is my reintroduction to daily use of meth the determining factor in play?

Hey Roided,


First off welcome.  From reading your post I gather it’s probably a bit of both, Meth hits hard on the immune system allowing for something to get you sick easier that it could have before.


I’d highly recommend taking a break for a week to rest and allow your body a chance to fight this thing off.

If you slam, closely monitor your injection sites fo signs of infection. That could account for some of your symptoms.

Nothing wrong with bumping a thread. Methinks [@Cuntboi69](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/562598/) is probably projecting some bad faith. I'm gonna just merge this with the Meth megathread.

What’s the worst thing that could happen to your gastrointestinal if you’ve used on and off for 15 years and have always or for the most part just taken it orally? (( put it in gel caps )) 


I mean I’ve coated my stomach with yogurt and drink a gallon of water but still it’s gonna do damage no matter what I just worry what my insides look like and I’m sure I’ve got ulcers. This is what scares me the most is not knowing. Am I gonna have a slow horrible death?

Well, I won't comment on the manner of your death, as I'm not omnipresent, but honestly if you're not smoking, snorting, or injecting, there is a lot less harm that is done to your body. No form of methamphetamine is safe totally though.

I see. Well yeah, at those dosages I could see why you'd be concerned over a long period of time as I imagine the crystal would be quite toxic to the cells, even orally. 


Best thing to do would probably just be to get scoped by the GI doc if you believe you're having stomach issues, if you're able to.

Direct damage to your gastrointestinal tract from meth being caustic is not actually what you need to worry about. Your  stomach has several somewhat redundant systems to control the pH of everything that it passes to the digestive tract. 


Generally the pH of your stomach acid is 1-4. However, your duodenum uses the large amount of bicarbonate produced in the pancreas to  continually moderate the pH of everything entering the digestive tract. Several integrated systems kick in to quickly control stomach pH once it passes 4.5.


Pharmaceutical grade dl-methamphetamine hydrochloride has a pH of around 6, although street meth varies from 4-7 depending on all kinds of things. 


What you want to worry about is getting an Ileus, or the reduction or cessation of peristalis or gut motility in your intestines. Meth causes this through several different mechanisms: directly through monoamine cascade (particularly norepinephrine), increased expression of the CART peptide, vasoconstriction, and dehydration. 


Basically the contents of your bowels stop moving and harden into extremely hard/dense pebbles that can tear at your lower intestines and anal cavity if you try and force them out or mechanically extract them.


The ideal way to avoid them is actually not to eat too much when on a meth bender and to consume fairly large doses of Movicol laxative containing polyethylene glycol and electrolytes together with plenty of liquid. Other types of laxative don’t help this condition. 


Personally, I think a good dose of Movicol is up there in the top 3-4 pre-binge harm reduction preparations. If you get those solid impacted shit pebbles lodged in your colon the irritation often feels like you need to piss but can’t and the sensation renders you impotent.

Yeah. Maybe not the best way to respond to somebody in a harm reduction forum. Sensible strategies for mitigating the many many risks of methamphetamine should be promoted here. And what did not kill / harm one person can easily snuff out or seriously damage another.

What he did with that porn lady is tame, vanilla chemsex.  There is nothing wrong with it but it is standard chemsex/pnp according to friends who were into METH.


I actually do not like PNP/SLAMFUCKKK porn that I have seen by browsing on Tumblr and now on free amateur porn sites, but it is not sexy or hot to me, and is actually boring and a turn off to me.  I have never used METH and never will.  I do not use any drugs now by choice, but if others want to use any drugs they want they can do this by their own choice.


I have met tweakers and chemsex fans who do fisting or use dildos when their cock goes soft from speed.

I didn't mean pnp/Chemsex as being only for bisexual and gay men, but I thought chemsex/pnp means having sex on METH, coke, or basically almost any drug? I remember when sociologists and the media both LGBT and non-LGB Claimed that chemsex/pnp was somehow super new in the late 1990s or early 2000s, only ever happened or was done in large cities, never in small cities, towns,villages, etc. When in reality it had been going on and super mainstream since the 1960s.


I have never used a dildo with a lady either.  If she wanted me to I would.  I have used dildos in men but condoms were used, and I did this as they were bottom/versatile and I am super careful and picky about which men I fuck with my cock and these were guys I assumed could be Poz and we were just very casually dating or hooking up.  I have no desire to do receptive anal sex or much anal sex at all, personally.


I was then living in what to me was a super rural area, but was a traditional university town and a gay friend who preferred to have chem sex and pnp on heroin, any opiates he could get, alcohol, weed, and at rare times coke and meth unfortunately got pozzed with HIV and HEP C from receptive anal sex or sharing needles, and he became extremely sick with delirious fevers and opportunistic infections, had AIDS with a very low cd4 count, and he was not the only person this happened to.  He is on meds for HIV and HEP C and is otherwise in excellent health and the only drug he uses is marijuana as needed for (no pun) chronic pain.  Luckily when he thought he was "neg" he never infected his then partner, or a guy we all knew who hooked up with him.


I never had anal or oral sex with him, only mild w/s (watching each other piss in a club toilet while I was drunk), some mutual touching, kissing, and spanking which is all safe sex.  I did this as I assumed correctly that he is Poz and I get super horny, insatiable, and love public sex and exhibitionism when drunk or on drugs.


I am HIV NEG, have no sexual diseases or parasites, I stopped hooking up in 2008 I believe, and I no longer use drugs by personal choice.

I've just been reading about how he banged the ex-pornstar for 10 hours straight. I think what actually happened is he jerked off to a current pornstar for 10 hours straight. Men get a bit confused sometimes you know ![☺️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/263a.png)

What can I say? I have been around.  I never was a rent boy or escort, or never did any actual porn films, but if this were the 1970s or very early 1980s before 1984 I would have done all types of porn bisexua (mmf/ffm)l, gay, porn with TS/TG men and ladies, heterosexual porn, and not only the solo/fetish and B&D, S&M, and bondage without discipline porn I did online when I was in debt, almost homeless (this is a fear of mine), and desperate for M-O-N-E-Y!

Haha Abbey let’s be honest.. you wish you were pretty enough to even be a pornstar but every time you get up in the morning and brush your teeth you have to be reminded that you’ll never be pretty enough to be one. 


And so you say something funny about me that isn’t true to get a few laughs and I did think it was funny.. but babe.. you know you wish you had this dick and I’m not just letting my ego talk. I know I can back it up. No need to lie if it ain’t true I got nothing to hide. What about you? What’s your deal?

Apart from the megathread there are also dozens of random threads and many more posts all over the joint on this wonderful topic. It’s like the first thing to do after fucking like a maniac for hours is dissect your depravity online.

One thing I would like to work on, is consolidating some of the huge pile of stray threads we have in various forums into more proper mega threads. I'm trying to work on that in OD at the moment, just because we get so many random questions throughout the day. Once they're answered, I don't think there's any reason they can't be ferried off into it's respective threads. 


It's a little different in BDD, since the nature of it is just straight basic questions about anything and everything, I think it's more ok to have a bunch of just general questions, but if you see anything that could be consolidated, feel free to do some janitorial thread management.

Question for seasoned IV users out there. 


I've been using meth since 2016. During 2016 I would have used maybe 20 or so times IV as I needed someone else to do it for me and I usually ate or sniffed it instead when I couldn't get in touch with my friend. Initially 2 points would last me 2 days or so, but by early 2017 on a whim I picked up some needles and scored and managed to shoot up first try. Since then my rate was about 75/25 hitting to missing and when I couldn't hit on the second or third day of a binge I would plug it instead. I would generally use the first 5 days of my pay cycle (meth) then weed for the second week and cough syrup. I mixed the meth with codeine and heroin when I could get it. 


By mid 2017 I needed 3 points to get some kind of rush and I remember doing 3 point shots which did nothing much. By the last fortnight of my using I used close to a gram a day the last couple of days then I went to rehab. 


For four years I had periods of abstinence with slips periodically, usually 3-9 months apart. Generally I would buy 3 points and it would easily last me 2-3 days. 


Eventually I got 18 months off the gear but relapsed in late December last year. Initially I could buy 2 points to last me a day and a half, but then in January I think I fucked up my tolerance by doing 4 points in a night. By January I also started on dexamphetamine which I'm aware would be creating a cross tolerance. 


December - Feb I was using 3-4 days a week. March - May I used once to twice a week/fortnight. 3-4 points was more than enough to get me spun if it was quality gear. However, one night in May I used a gram in a night and since then I needed half a gram at least to get any kind of rush. 


Come May 20 I moved into my n new apartment and with it came a $150 a week increase in rent. Bye bye extra meth money. But I figured taking a month off wouldn't be a bad thing anyway, seeing as it would reduce my tolerance. 


I used a point tonight and it kept me awake all night which is more than the last batch of 3p I used did. That barely kept me up. Is a month long enough to have reset my tolerance down to something approaching baseline? Not all the way obviously, but if I keep my uses spaced a month or so apart can I keep my tolerance low even with the dexamphetamine and fucking it up with the gram?

I can't say for sure, but imo, there is some permatolerance that can come into play with long term amphetamine use, like many other drugs. But yeah, generally speaking I think a month, while not resetting it to baseline (you'll never get there again) is enough of a break to give you a better time with the stuff. And yes, the dextroamphetamine script will definitely play a factor. 


I can say that magnesium and NMDA antagonists/dissos do a good job at reducing some tolerance for stimulant drugs quickly. Just be careful with drug combos if considering dissos.

I'd been using regularly for around 7-9 months at least half a fortnight or so where money allowed and a bit extra here and there. I felt miserable for weeks, like nothing would ever cheer me up again. And I was utterly exhausted, I didn't feel like I'd have the energy or motivation to do anything worthwhile in a long time but I pulled my way through the rest of my law degree and put myself into outpatient treatment specifically for meth use.

I'm not able to shoot heroin (my preferred drug) due to maintenance therapy so I use meth due to availability. Because of that and having both narcolepsy and ADHD it doesn't really have the full effect on me that it has on other users. I've never felt like I was touching god or anything after shooting up. Bit of a rush then thats it. I also don't endlessly wank and have sex, I usually just browse the forum, sit on the discord, and write in a journal.

Thanks for the reply. Yeah I've noticed that the dexamphetamine definitely plays a part in how much of a rush I get and there isn't much I can do about that considering I need it to function at an appropriate level. I'm not willing to forego my prescription to get a better high in any way, shape, or form. 


I'm thinking that keeping my use spaced to a month apart is what I need to do in order to get anything out of it anymore, perhaps even longer at some stage.

Yeah, I can empathize as I can't really function without my daily amphetamine prescription. But I have only touched meth once in the past year, which is great progress for me, as I used pretty heavily from like '17 - '21. Definitely the least frequency of meth use the better, if you still are trying to get those types of effects from it.

But I have only touched meth once in the past year, which is great progress for me, as I used pretty heavily from like '17 - '21. Definitely the least frequency of meth use the better, if you still are trying to get those types of effects from it.

That is great progress man! You should be really proud of that. I remember back in 2018 when I managed to only use I think 3 times that year I was pretty proud of that, then 2019 it might have been 2 times, 2020 it was once. So I made slow progress but the progress was there.

I have seen “plugging” mentioned several times but cannot seem to find specifics - I have never heard of this, I can assume what it means but how is it done? Sounds like it would burn the shit out of my asshole. What is the dosing like for a newbie (not really new but haven’t used in 17 years.). Is there a difference in rush between IV and plugging?  Also, does plugging vs IV create more of a time-release effect? Sorry I have so many questions. ![🤣](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f923.png)

We have a plugging megathread but to give you an easy how to guide I will explain it for you. 


You will need: 

1. 1x5ml baby syringe from any chemist. Should cost you less than a dollar. 

2. A decent amount of lubricant.

3. A source of clean water. 

4. Cotton filter

5. Alcohol swabs for wiping your hands afterwards. 


Before you begin, it is advisable to take a shit to clear out your bowels to prevent any unwanted absorption of the solution. Some people go so far as to use an enema, but I've found this fairly unecessary. 


After that, you should measure out your dose. Your dose should reflect the normal method in which you take meth. 


If you normally IV your meth, you can safely boof/plug 100% of your dose. 


If you normally snort your meth, you can use approximately 80% of your normal dose. 


If you normally smoke your meth, you can use approximately 70% of your normal dose. 


If you normally eat your meth, you can use approximately 60% of your normal dose. 


If you want to be extra safe, particularly if you have not IVd meth before and have either eaten it, snorted it or smoked it, 50% of your regular dose is an advisable starting point. This is because plugging has a 99% bioavailability rate and by consuming the same as your regular dose you do risk overamping easily. 


Get your water next and dissolve the meth in around 1-2 units of water (10-20ml, I think. Someone feel free to correct me on the ml I just use units because I inject). You don't want the solution to be too watery, or too thick. The less water the better, within reason of course. 


Once the solution is dissolved, draw it up into the baby syringe through the filter. Some might argue a filter is unecessary but this solution (if you put it in the right spot) is going directly into your bloodstream through mucus membranes in your rectum, so you sort of want all the gunk out. 


Lie down on your side and grab the lube. Put a generous amount of lubricant over the tip and shaft of the baby syringe. Lie on your side and lift one leg up, and push the syringe into your rectum. You will feel some initial resistance but then it will pass through the rectum and from there, due to the size of the 5ml baby syringe you should be able to push it in all the way until it's prevented from going further by the wings on the syringe then grip it with your hands and depress the plunger. 


You should be able to feel the solution go in and leave the syringe. Don't get up. Some people swear they can, but others say they lose the solution if they stand up too quickly. In my experience just as body position is important (being on your hands and knees doesn't tend to work as well as being on your side) I have found that staying lying on my stomach while the feeling of needing to shit passes and scrolling my phone for 5-10 min after I wipe my hands off using the alcohol swabs and wait for it to kick in. 


It will kick in after 5-15 minutes. There is no rush, but the feeling of euphoria is much stronger than with any other ROA bar IV use. It is more like a wave, and it lasts a very long time. 


Some DOs: 


Do clean your baby syringe out well after you use it, as you can use it again. 


Do use a baby syringe, it is the appropriate length and size for this ROA. 


Do filter the solution. 


Do mind what dose you take for your first time. You can always redose. You can't undo too large a dose. 


Some DO NOTS. 


Do not just stick a shard of meth up your ass, it will hurt, and you might rip something. 


Do not use an insulin syringe with the tip broken off unless you truly are desperate and know  not to insert it the whole way and how slowly to depress the plunger so as to not overshoot the solution. It's got a higher chance of not working and the insulin syringe have rough edges on them which make them hard to shove up your ass. 


Do not redose until around an hour after your initial dose, that way you know what the full effect is. 


Do not shove meth water up your ass more than once a week or a couple of times a month. While it is a great form of harm reduction for IV users, that is simply because the risks associated with IV use are so high. Meth, even in water, is caustic. It's caustic on your veins, so it's caustic on your butthole. This is a 'special occasions' type of event. 


You WILL feel like you need to shit when you push it in. That is completely normal. Just hold it in. Once you are well and truly high, you can shit again to your heart's content. 


It will not burn the shit out of your asshole. If it does, you are doing it very, very wrong. I started plugging as a means of harm reduction when I was struggling to shoot up regularly and told myself if I missed too many shots or registered then miss so had blood in the rig, I would just switch it to a baby syringe and plug it instead. I've never once had it feel like it's burning and I would have done it dozens of times. 


If you have any further questions let me know. I hope this comment clears some things up for you about this method of taking meth.

I mean that sounds like a lot of people's experience that I heard. Some people just don't handle stims super well, they're more built for sedatives. Sounds like you might be that type. Me person I've been addicted to uppers and downers at times, so meth has definitely ensnared me. But even I could kinda take it or leave it, even IV, whereas some ppl get so sucked into smoking it all day or banging it daily. 


Idk. Everyone's just built different I guess. My ex wife go super attached to it and had a bad time. Luckily I've only done it once the past few years, that was smoked too, didn't really do a whole lot.

I prefer slamming because of the rush of course but also because the high is bleaner and clearer as  as opposed to smoking wheee you aew lost in a haze. After the rush I just don't vegetate. I am motivated to engage eithef internalky when I write or physical activities. As insane as it sounds slamming netb is what got me away. From heroin addiction. For over 5 years I shot and then nodded turning into a sedentary lump of flesh. Slamming. Meth makes me engage with the environment. Shooting heroin made  me a part of the scenery The heroin and meth jigjs are very different highs and I am grateful for that. My meth use has  made me more productive in several aspects of my life wbime heroin made me counterproductive. In short its better to be a hyped up Tweaker than a junkie that just sit and nods out puking once in a while for emphasis.

I came to this conclusion as well. I prefer using stimulants because they actually give me the ability to make moves and engage. The problem is that if you have impulse and compulsion issues, they can turn on you very hard. 


Don't get me wrong, I enjoy sedatives and opioids, but only enough to relax me and rid my pain and anxiety. Being a dope fiend and just getting obliterated and laying around isn't really any fun for me. Which is probably why most of my heroin use has been nasal. I was physically addicted to H/fent for two years, but primarily all nasal so I was actually functional. Just wasted a lot of money really. I did get a little too lit up a few times tho.

When i smoked meth, The urge to redose very soon was a problem. When iv or bombed, i usually don't want to redose at least 6 hours.

Question - if your eyes always dilated on meth before and this current batch doesn’t. Is it likely bunk?

Hello everyone I have some meth related questions. I found out how to get meth I was thinking about buying .25 gram of crystal ice it’s said to be really good quality I think from Mexico. Anyway I never used meth before in my life and I don’t want to start abusing it. I was reading in the psychedelic experience that 25MG of meth eaten orally while using LSD can have cool effects. Im very confused you guys talk about shooting like .1 gram shots. Will 25MG actually do anything I figured that’s 10 doses so that’s 20 weeks worth of meth. I just don’t know if I can only use it with LSD I feel like I’ll try it by itself and become an addict. Anyone know what 25MG of meth does anyway?

25 mg will have you properly stimulated for 8 to 20 hours.


Dont forget you can always take more if it doesnt cut it.

Couldn't say specifically, I'm sure it's different for everyone. That said, I normally equate the dextro isomer in amphetamines to work more cognitively while the levo works more physically, but that's an obvious simplification.

Interesting article about P2P meth:


![filtermag.org](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Ffiltermag.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F09%2FIMG_3307-scaled.jpg&hash=64c3c4e31e1069064d7c4f7d64b8c6c5&return_error=1)


##### "New Meth" Is Nothing to Fear. It Isn't New. It's Just Meth.

Sinister depictions of "new meth" tend to trace back to one Atlantic article. There's no evidence that P2P-derived meth has additional harms.

you're obviously pretty cluey - asking pertruant questions on meth use, and fantastic you realise early on.  The addioction ? Chasing that initial rush/ euphoria; and the more you use, the better it isn't - but users will chase it forever and a day.  The receptors in your brain love it, scream more and more !!  Irony being, it's Seretoin Dump, you aint getting any higher, but people will smoke huge bowls and empty their baggies until it is gone. Ivreckon there is merit in your preference for Opiates and potential for it to inhibit the Meth shine for you. Its magic is turning up the pleasure metres in the brain via neuron pathways and perhap the ones set by your Opiate use dont meet up with what you are used to - and therefore your brain, goes yeah, and ? 


 IVing meth - ive only done it a few times, to be honest I wasnt impressed but confess to not having had the burning feet, pull on the back of the head (like I did with Speed), pools of sweat shit, so probably didnt have enough.  The other thing is - given the shit Iso going around recently, is a possibly it wasnt the best gear,

I've never taken it orally with LSD, but I've taken LSD and then smoked. I've also smoked it and then taken LSD.


Doing the LSD first, coming up, and then smoking the meth was a way better experience. For some reason, when I did the meth first, it felt like it dulled out the acid a lot.

 I’m not certain about discerning d- from racemic. But to tell d- from l- you need an optical polarimeter.

My scale will only read as low as 0.03 (30 MG), and it's annoying because microdosing is almost impossible because I do like to redose, but it adds up quickly when the lowest my scale will read is 30 MG.  Ideally, it would go down to 10 MG.  Any solutions, or is this just how point scales are?

Ideally it would go down to 0.001g or 1 mg. And come with a 50 mg weight to re-calibrate it from time to time. Amazon sells these for as low as $20. Just read the description to ensure accuracy is really .001. Because some advertised mg scales are not actually .001. 


Just search “milligram scale .001g” . I can vouch for Feedron brand (which is old under many different brands - same Chinese factory) About $40.

gem20s, theres decent 10$ ones.

filling little zips, put a weight in a lil zip. turn it on, throw the zip and a finger of a latex/nonlatex glove's finger. finally turn on the scale


just dont buy a corner store "jeweler's scale" accurate to .*000*1g for 10$. or buy from someone using them either, your grams are gonna be 0.25g

Thanks for This! There's TOO MUCH misinformation around this. Certain bikers used to make P2P dope before the cartels ever did. The issue was it is more complicated due to it producing racemic yields. Perfecting a way too sperate the dextro from the levo was too much of an issue but they worked it out. It is far from new and it actually produces more potent and much larger quantities. So it really is superior to pseudo. I think the issue is the potency and misinformation. People don't know how to use it properly and too much amphetamine will always be a negative experience and it can really wreak havic on even a seasoned user.

I wanna IV after 7 years clean but I know my tolerance isn’t a .4 anymore. Besides abstaining any suggestions? I always use new gear, use a scale and wash the dope. Just need a good starting point, dont want to overamp and not enjoy it.

Start as small as possible would be my suggestion. As long as you're using all other basic harm reduction techniques regarding IV, then dosage is probably the biggest factor. I never used to IV more than .1 personally.

Another good thing would be to do a bump or take it in some other fashion in a small amount so you can judge the potency and make sure it is what it should be.

I use to slam up to .4 as well and last weekend I reached meth toxicity from 3 days of 100mg orally in capsules and about 250mg oral capsule towards end of day 3. I've been in and out of everything a long time and my new gear connection is far superior than anything before. My first capsule of 100mg oral I took before I walked into my therapist office thinking it would be fine. It hit me so hard, I mean harder than IV 0.2 and I got up walked out and found reality. I later puked halfway through our session. Again about 0.55 grams spread evenly over 40hrs sent me into full convulsing and I could not then treat myself and ended up in the ER and I have years and years experience. So be careful. This new dope that I get is so potent that you need to do less and if you do more yeah you don't feel good and you feel awful but that's not because it's shit it's actually the opposite and the euphoria rests in the small proper doses. I had two years no meth but prescription Adderall/Vyvanse. Sorry I wasn't available but I was in the ER Monday.

How much you do is pretty easy to figure out. You can start with a 1/4 gram of product and mix with 0.5 cc (0.5 mL) of water.

Did you do it?  It's a couple weeks after your post so I'm probably a little late with my reply.  But I would have said. Don't do it.  It's not the same stuff you did 7 years ago and you will have relapsed for nothing. That being said, use whatever you like but go very slow.  If you mixed it so it's strong you'll know when your done when the rush hits you.  Or keep going till it's gone and make it stronger next time.

I want to know this as well, because I realize now after multiple meth binges, I overamp every time (IV user) thinking my shit was bunk when in reality, I always used too much right off the bat. Now I know less is more and will properly dose in the future, but considering I was blowing through a gram in 3-4 days I probably fried the fuck outta my brain. 


Fortunately, I recover really fast, and get my shit together in a day or two after and continue on a sober life without depression and other side effects (I’m sure my heart fucking hates my ass even though I workout everyday), so my hope is my brain can still enjoy it correctly next time. I plan on waiting another 2 months at the least. 


Gonna start at 50mg and if I can’t enjoy that I’m just gonna say fuck it and quit cause I’m happy enough without it

Exactly this is what I hope to see more of. I was hospitalized last month consuming less than a gram over 4 days and I've used meth for years including pseudoephedrine dope and everything. Yes I had been off meth for quite some time but I was orally dosing capsules and on day four went into convulsion and sure enough I was hospitalized and treated for acute meth/amphetamine toxicity and responded immediately to treatment and was back fine within hours. However I used once after and got sick immediately. I have been staying off amphetamines and meth since but will probably use again soon. After being clean I can't handle more than 100mg per 24 hours without some harm after a few days. The product I get is incredible and I started using meth by smurfing pseudoephedrine for my cook. The dope I get now is so far superior to that old dope there's no comparison. I've posted facts and my experience and opinion not to mention my family is from Mexico and I've had a steady supply. I've also lived and sold dope all over the US. I'm out of that life now but still use personally on occasion and I've been around it all. I wish more would stop being paranoid and see the facts like you and I. Hell I posted years worth of lab tested meth and people still don't get it. 200mg of pure dextro 0.2 grams is literally lethal. If you dose even a little too much you'll get bad effects and no euphoria and eventually you'll build tolerance while blowing way past the euphoric threshold so no wonder everyone feels like dope is different it is! It's more potent and cheap than ever which means very easy neurotoxic effects or methamphetamine toxicity (overdose/overamping). Less is MORE. I get a rush from taking 100mg orally that rivals IV use and I use to shoot up to a gram a day when I sold dope and I've done that with pseudo that I watched get cooked and crystal from huge labs in Mexico. But people can think they know everything and keep harming themselves. I also mentioned that there are very harmful byproducts from cooking meth that can go undetected and only take very small amounts to do harm. That's a very real possibility but most likely people are experiencing meth toxicity. Be safe and enjoy friend! Good for you realizing what you did wrong! I've done it many times myself. It's easy to do.

not sure if this breaks the sourcing rules. i’m not asking for a source. just something seems off.


let’s say you’ve met a dealer through a friend. You picked up once from them both. Then had to drive the dealer to an appt. 


Down the road you’re picking up again. you’ve got to pick him up and take him to where he gets it. Then drop off. 


something about him feels like a cop. would one go through all the trouble for a small buy?

Since reading the neuroprotective effects of memantine, I have been making a habit of taking 5mg of memantine orally aobut 30-1hr before taking any stim,  including MET. I definitely notice that there is a different quality. Does memantain attenuate the euphoria? Is that how it is neuroprotective?

The mystery of if meth is clean, or if it’s got weird shit mixed in…


Most of the stuff I’ve had, from multiple sources, sometimes varied a little bit, some of it was mega clean but still weak. Some had more physical side effects. Most of it, I just cannot seem to get properly stimmed off any amount. Like it almost feels sedating.


I just thought it was perma tolerance but then a few years back I got a sample of some local stuff and it blew my mind. Psychosis off of just one night. Blast of dopamine. Still clean. Def felt WAY better and stronger than 90% of what’s out there. 


So I am sure there is something added there has to be for all these differences between batches. 


There’s the “big shards” stuff that is almost wet and brittle, like it wants to melt at human body temperature. Often it’s sold as cartel meth. Have to use high doses and still can’t get too blasted. Idk ![🤷‍♂️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f937-2642.png) maybe there’s a lot of contaminants and the testing that’s been done hasn’t been done recent enough or just somehow missed those compounds. 


Sometimes it feels insanely “clean” but high doses have a ceiling effect.. or even start to sedate as you raise the dose. Weird shit. 

——


Also, when I see videos online of people supposedly blasted on meth they act a certain way that I’ve never had happen to me. Like they’re dosed on something else.

So this sounds simple, but  it never really works the way i intend. 


So i got my pipe and have some mini shards in the bubble.


I'm using a bic (i don't have a torch) 


I hold the flame about an inch below the glass and as it heats up roll the pipe from 2 to 10 ( im trying to figure out how to breathe because it feels like when the pipe is ready to be hit im out of breathe) is that the basic process ?


Put the lighter about an inch below the glass bowl, heat the dope as your rolling your fingers from 2 to 10? It always seems like the bic is literally putting blisters in my fingers before i can get a good hit. 


Is there a certain pattern i need to be rolling the pipe in or any special tricks i need to know.  


Or anything i should avoid doing? 

.


Im sure it seems simple but I'm a newbie and I'm having trouble getting decent hits.

I think you’re holding your flame way too far away, you only need to hold it that far when using a torch bc a torch gets way hotter . If using a bic (or any lighter) you actually want the tip of your flame to be just barely about to touch the bowl, almost touching , but not touching. Got it? Try that and lmk

So I found that wearing light soft gloves will keep you from chewing the living shit out of your poor fingernails. Like mine used to have really pretty nails, and now it's ground beef, some were bloody, and I couldn't stop doing it, knowing that I was hurting myself, so now I wear those gloves. Like that cone dogs wear to keep them from chewing on their crotch.

I remember when sociologists and the media both LGBT and non-LGB Claimed that chemsex/pnp was somehow super new in the late 1990s or early 2000s, only ever happened or was done in large cities, never in small cities, towns,villages, etc. When in reality it had been going on and super mainstream since the 1960s.

So my friend usually snorts a bump or a line and was wondering (it sounds dumb) but where is he trying to snort it too? Like up his sinuses or what? Secondly, how long does he let the pulverized dust sit in his nose before dropping water drops down his nasal passage. And thirdly when can he snort another line?  And should he blow his nose first? 


I know these seem like very novice questions, but i got to double check. Usually meth will run out of his nose in mucus. Not all of it but some of it. How can he prevent this?

Snorting meth makes me feel like I'm doing my Adderall just a little strongest. Smoking is more fiendish if you ask me

When you snort drugs it mostly gets absorbed in the mucous membranes lining your nose. A portion of it drains down your throat into your stomach (the drip) which effectively turns into an oral dose. It doesn't get into your sinuses.


It doesn't matter much how long you let it sit in your nose, but saline should always be used at a certain point. Meth is particularly damaging to snort, but this happens during the act of snorting because the crystals are effectively tiny razor blades and cut up your soft tissue. Try not to rub your nose while meth is in there either.


Meth should be crushed as finely as possible into tiny particles to minimize the damage. Eventually you will probably encounter a nose bleed, it's almosy inevitable of you repeatedly snort meth. I would stop snorting if this happens to avoid a potential infection. 


I wouldn't suggest blowing your nose for awhile, as this will cut your nose up more if there is meth in there.


I enjoy snorting meth, mostly because snorting is my favorite ROA of any drug, but it's not really advisable because it is damaging. I usually mix up ROAs when using meth for this reason.

If it drips out of the nose then use tinier lines, snort harder, or both. Grounding the crystals as good as possible is relevant to minimize harm to the nasal tissue but using a saline spray to dilute the meth before to its administration will work better by avoiding the razorblade effect Snafu already mentioned.


And yeah, snorting is way more fiendish/moreish than oral dosing, the substance hits the brain almost instantly so both is there more rush and more of an addiction learning effect.

I can snort a line little lines that is 1 time in two hours rather then smoking all my stuff up over night. I say smoking is more fiendish to me anyways.

Yeah, it is. It's difficult to put that pipe down and theres no natural limit to how much you can ingest during a period of time like snorting.

What if my nose is broken and deviated? Will this Impact the surface area availability? Cause the inside of my nose is fucked up from getting broken. So my mucous membrane linings are kind of really bent on the one side (where there's a big hole, my nasal passage) and on the left the linings are kind of smashed, and there's barely a hole for my left nasal passage because it's so broken. 


Do you guys thinking snorting in this case would really be worth it?  I'm worried I'm losing most of it to my stomach.  I know it's kind of a hard question to answer, but would i just be better off smoking it?

If you're having trouble snorting just take it orally - it's an excellent and underrated roa


Smoking it is just asking for trouble. It's super fiendish, incredibly compulsive, massively unhealthy, ritualistic, instant hit too which makes addiction 100 times more likely, and honestly, all things considered, not even as good a high as oral


So, no - you're not gonna be better off smoking it

I recently got some pure d isomer and it came as a powder (more common for pure d isomer if made my a chemist who didn’t want to make shards). Right away I could tell because a tiny dose vaporized cleared my head up, vision went smooth and hd, and has that feeling of almost too much dopamine. All of that without much of a body effect. Very good brain / mental stimulator. Feels clean, even smells clean vaped unlike the cartel / typical stuff everywhere. 


Also the dose needed of the powder is less. It’s worth paying extra if you can find it (sometimes sellers will lie but worth trying anyways)

Has anyone ever gotten hot flashes after dosing (vaping)? Just today I’m getting it, freaks me out my entire body feels flushed with sudden heat, kinda like a niacin flush. Lasts like 30-90 seconds. Very weird, meth always seems to cause bizarre side effects even when it’s clean days before.

Dudette** haha I’m jp I really don’t care & no problem bro ham, it has taken me quite some time to master hitting the bubz properly (meth itself also just has some crazy chemical properties which doesn’t make it any easier) without burning/wasting all my dope so lmk if you have any questions & don’t don’t worry about feeling like an idiot for asking.

I know my stuff is okay because I did the fent strips, and my tolerance is probably going up because I been using on and off the last 4 weeks after being clean for 5yrs.... I'm a banger. Haven't done this shit since I was 18 feels like I'm not remembering something. I test, crunch put water or injectable iv sodium chloride, mix filter and draw but I feel like I'm over diluting? I kinda don't mind a little extra juice because I don't want to burn my veins out but I am confused and having trouble remembering ...how much water to dope ratio? Tried the Penny trick to guess how much I'm using per shot but I kinda just put enough water for it to dissolve... Should I wait longer for the dope to dissolve before I add more water? Any tips to help not water down shots? I would say I probably been using between 1-3 mg each shot tho I guess I should try to be more on the ball on exactly how much I'm using, any tips for that too? Think I'm ending up with 20-30 cc liquid when all's said and done.

Just did a 0.3 shot about an hour and a half ago. Haven't used in a week and still have pretty low tolerance (have slammed about 10 - 15 times since I started a year ago).


This shit has the weakest rush ever but I'm a bit buzzed now I guess. Definitely not amped up tho. Just feeling quiet and laidback. Anyone have any ideas where the rush went with this dope? A shot this size would normally send me to the moon.

1. Bunk meth. 


2. High tolerance. 


I got to a point last year where one Thursday and Friday I did 0.3p shots and got very high. Then Saturday my planned 'last night' I got... Nothing. Used again nothing. Used half a gram nothing. 


My tolerance was fucked. Now I don't use more than one day a month. That's it. It happens eventually.

Especially with the racemic garbage. If you have good stuff, when the high hits you that’s when you put it down. But 12 hours later if you’re chasing that feeling again yeah it can be difficult to stop smoking

Hey all - question about comedowns; apologies if this has been asked, but I've searched across the internet and not found anything that explicitly answers my question. 


So - most of what I've read about the comedown says that the strongest effects start around 24 hours after the last consumption of the drug, including the dreaded psychosis... and, of course, the comedown is stronger the more you've had, etc.


What I'm trying to understand is the extent to which that 24 hour timing might be "reset" or "staved off" by consuming more, even if significantly less. As an example - say I had 6-7 days of decently heavy usage (with some sleep, good hydration, somewhat beside the point) ending on a Sunday night. At the end of that Sunday night, I obviously felt exhausted and slept properly, had a normal day the next day, and so on. But then 19-20 hours after the end of that binge, I smoke a bit Monday evening - enough to feel the effects, certainly not as easy as the start of the binge, and not as much that evening as any other evening during the binge. 


In that situation, are you setting yourself up for a 7-8 day binge comedown on say, Wednesday? This might imply things like daily or 6x / week use is exponentially worse than 4-5x and suggest the "trap" of using frequently...

...or is it more like the comedown effects would taper and you'd start coming down from the first binge on that Monday and Tuesday, even though you're smoking a little more? This seems more logical just on the face of it, but obviously substances can work in strange and nonlinear ways...


Maybe it's a weird question and I'm a little too fixated on rigid endpoints; I'd imagine the truth is person-dependent and somewhere in between. I've been lucky so far not to get any really bad comedown effects (other than perhaps the very first time) - I'm good about hydration, though it's so easy to go a LONG time without eating...

I don’t agree that the comedown effects depend on a 24 hr cycle from your last use. The comedown is when the high wears off and you feel the effects of being on a strong stimulant for the last 12 or so hours. Sore muscles, mouth if you’ve been clenching your teeth and rubbing your tongue on them, and possibly psychosis although to me psychosis is something you get if you stay up for days at a time. Tapering off to prevent withdrawal should help for a long term user but after a binge I don’t think it matters, all that matters is if it’s going to spark another binge. So if you use Monday then you might again Tuesday and so on.

Thanks for your response! Yeah, that makes sense to me. The 24 hour thing did strike me as odd if you stop feeling high well before that, but I could see a handful of different explanations for it...

I can see why it came off as complaining, but that wasn't my intent lol. I was just ridiculously spun and word vomiting without actually thinking much about how my tone would come off.


I just tried the dab pen and hash/meth again. I used about 1/4 of the hash i used last time and that didn't seem to be quite enough to shield the meth, so it was a rather short lived session. Did not get me the same way. I'm trying to decide if I was actually as high as I thought, if I just hit the hash too hard and mistook a green out for an insane high, or if the last dose was still active and the redose just did me in. The most likely to me is that I greened out and mistook it for an crazy high.


 The gear IS really good. Certainly has something as a cut, I can tell because regardless of how I light it, it turns brown. It also leaves a ton of shit behind when a bowl runs out. But whatever it's cut with is not negatively impacting the effects. I have barely gone through a gram since I picked it up a few days ago. Normally I go through 1 to 1.5g or so in a day.


I hope this higher quality shit is the new norm around here because the meth game has been total shit for too long around here.

Yeah, I mean I guess there’s two comedowns. There’s coming down from the extreme euphoria of the initial high, where you still feel good and peppy and wired but dont have that omg I’m about to cum in my pants feeling and everything in the world is perfect. But then there’s the hard comedown or withdrawal, after you slept, and haven’t used for a day or two when everything feels bleak and pointless because you depleted your dopamine in your brain. If you’re at that point, then using again is definitely going to make you feel better but like opiate withdrawal you’re just putting off that inevitable crash. I think a lot of it depends on your dosages and tolerances. Theoretically if you’ve used the smallest doses required and haven’t spiked your tolerances then using again may not hurt, but if you’re like me and can’t control your urge to do more and more then you are just making it even worse for yourself because you’re shutting down your brain’s ability to release dopamine and the longer and stronger your usage, the longer it will take for you to be normal again without the drug. Just my two cents. Meth is one of those drugs that really should only be used on Friday and Saturday and then don’t touch it again til the next weekend


Also when I used to stay up for days, I would have a bunch of stages of coming down, on day 3 I’d be completely twacked out haven’t used in 10 hours but still have some of the positive effects. Possibly from the 24 hour half life or whatever, of multiple doses stacking on each other. I liked that feeling in a way but also hated it and it’s one of the reasons I quit. I was losing my mind

Also when you use in that state of dopamine depletion the effects become shorter and shorter. Where you used to feel great for 6 hours now it’s 4, and you need more, and etc

I was digging through some court docs from a recent bust here a couple of years ago.  Apparently the gear was coming from California (and I'm assuming Mexico before that.) When the DEA tested it, it was 96-99% pure methamphetamine hydrochloride. Which is consistent with much of my experiences with the shit being super good. I've ran into the other garbage of course here and there, but I'd say 90% of the time it's the super pure shit where it lasts me 4 or 5 times as long.  <blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/PYYGcjW" data-context="false" ><a href="//imgur.com/a/PYYGcjW"></a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Yup. The compulsion is over the top. Depending on the person though anything can become super compulsive. The most compulsive I have ever felt was Coke. Until recently . I did a contaminated line of meth that had fentanyl. It reminded , subtly, of Coke. Taste smell feel drip all of it. Numbed my tongue etc.

IDK, I don't have compulsions. I usually smoke a bowl when I wake up, another around 3PM and another around 10-12pm. I'm the same person who can get blasted before having a 4 course meal though so I'm definitely not your average meth enthusiast LOL.

Yeah street fetty is a dirty, disconnected feeling with no real euphoria.


Now, a 1200mcg Fentynal lollipop?! I think Activis made them. Now THAT is bananas. I laid in bed for 18 hours staring at the ceiling with my entire body just flush with orgasms and warm nectar flooding over me the whole time. It was magical. Almost like opium made me feel.

What's up bluelight, haven't been on here in years. Good to ge back. Gone through a lot the past few years. Homelessness and incarceration suck. I'm doing good now. Just can't shake that goddamn monkey off my back. I've just been feeding the monkey ![🐒](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f412.png) and making it work ![🧊](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f9ca.png).  ![😅](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f605.png)  so I got a geek vape. And I've been loading that sucker up. Just drop it in and hit the button, with amazing results. Trying to stay off that ![✏️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/270f.png).  And just eat, sniff, smoke. Everything is ok right now. But I am forever cautious ![⚠️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/26a0.png).  Being on papers and what not. Also curious about why they haven't offered vyvanse/amphetamines at clinics to help people get their using under control. Stabilize habit, reduce risks 100%. Behavioral therapy, support groups, etc... if I mention such a thing to a psych doc. They laugh and I see the red flags going up. I think it would help a lot of people get off the street and out of trouble. Ok going on 3am, I feel like im in the right place to rant. I hope someone else is awake lol.

I see a ree flash, then i press the plunger, i feel my chest contract, I can taste, smell, and feel it.   an exhilarating feeling rises up within me. Now ive reached the point of no return. Im scared and excited as i plunge the rest of it with wreckless abandon ,I know it's too much, but i don't care. and maybe 1 or 2 seconds later you feel tight in the chest, coughing, gasping for air and this "oh shit, I'm gonna die for real this time" feeling. Then that glorious dragon breathe. your head might itch or feel super hot. It can feel very overwhelming at first. But then a crisp, warm, and toasty euphoria washes over you. imagine like your wrapped up in a heated blanket,thats on ![🔥](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f525.png), or your laying in the sand on the beach and that wave washes over you lol. Hard to explain. I get calm, quiet, dry mouth, i feel my heart beating hard in my chest and i might be sweating at this point, and im probably pacing back and fourth trying to process the intensity of it all, if I'm not layed back trying to regain control of my breath. The rush is wearing off, but I'm not stressing about the next one. I feel amazing . when I finally do come to and get back to "reality". I still feel amazing. Then you go on about you business. Or w.e you like doing when your racing. You might feel the urge to redose.if your a rush chaser I don't recommend banging anything.  You'll end up in the psychward if you can't leave the rush alone for a little bit. Sorry I had to share this, helping me get it off my chest. I'm off the rig, and things are more managable. Personally I don't think you should try it lol.  You'll never forget your self inflicted god-mode and immense euphoria. And it might come back to haunt you.

I mentioned my vision issues recently, but am throwing out an elaborated version before seeing my doctor about it  


A quick google brings up nothing on meth and hypertopia [wandering pupil]


Starting last fall I have been getting hypertopia whenever I go on a meth run, with my right eye turning upwards and inwards. 

 Seeing double is an understatement - I have to keep the right eye closed to walk or ride my bike, and often end up walking the bike.


It always starts about 20 hours after I start the meth    In this period I probably  do 3 or 4 points, then I typically cut back to about 2 points a day, but 


sometimes continue at this pace and end up adhd on steroids.  During the rest of the run the vision issues  may come or go, and sometimes it goes away when I dont epect it to, like shortly after redosing.


I dont think it is an issue with the product, not only is there a lack of other one eye warriors in Vancouver, meth has always made me lose depth perception in close - to the point where I usually struggle to hold the flame under the bowl, and about a year or two ago I did thc gummies and Ketamine which caused me to hold an eye shut to ride my bike the whole next day. 


I am lucky to have a doctor Im not afraid to be honest with and will tell him within a few says, but thought this place worth a look.

I’ve had issues seeing double on both uppers and downers(meth and fent ) with meth it usually only happens if I spend hours on end staring at my phone or a game, with fent it  happens when I’m trying to keep my eyes open while nodding out…just ask yourself if whatever you’re doing while you’re tweaking is normal. Again like staring at a screen watching porn for hours on end.

Just can't shake that goddamn monkey off my back. I've just been feeding the monkey ![🐒](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f412.png) and making it work ![🧊](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f9ca.png).  ![😅](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f605.png)  so I got a geek vape. And I've been loading that sucker up. Just drop it in and hit the button, with amazing results. Trying to stay off that ![✏️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/270f.png).  And just eat, sniff, smoke. Everything is ok right now. But I am forever cautious ![⚠️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/26a0.png).  Being on papers and what not. Also curious about why they haven't offered vyvanse/amphetamines at clinics to help people get their using under control. Stabilize habit, reduce risks 100%. Behavioral therapy, support groups, etc... if I mention such a thing to a psych doc. They laugh and I see the red flags going up. I think it would help a lot of people get off the street and out of trouble. Ok going on 3am, I feel like im in the right place to rant. I hope someone else is awake lol.

I have a really liberal, trustworthy doctor that works with high-risk patients with the worst situations (homelessness, HIV/AIDS, meth and heroin use rampant) and we discussed this very point. She was agreeing with me that replacement therapies have long existed for opioid addicts (methadone, etc) but not for stimulants. I knew she wouldn’t be able to give me Adderall but the point I was making was that I’d stand a much better chance abstaining from meth if I were on addy. She knew I was probably right but without directives from the FDA, those kinds of options won’t be available. It’s tragic, in my humble opinion.

I'd have to disagree. The pipe is the devil wether it's crack  or Ice. First time. I used ice , about 8 years ago. Ate it. Smoked it. Booked it. Snorted it. Was up for 4 days off a point or 2. Since then I've smoked the shit and it was nearly daily since then.

Yep it can definitely suck you in fast if you smoke the stuff or inject it. I usually don't go out of my way to get any but if it comes my way I just snort it.

Tried meth the first time a few days ago. I live in an area where meth is extremely unpopular and expensive, so I assume that the only dealers who sell it are competent enough to get a high purity product. 

I put it to the test by giving a 15mg dose intranasally to one of my friend's. She was very energized and talked so much to the point it was annoying as fuck. Took about 6-7 hours until the effects subsided.


I went to a party and consumed 250mg in the timespan of 12 hours (50mg orally, the rest intranasally)

I am not usually reckless with the drugs I consume, but for some reason, during this session, it did not feel like I was overdoing it at all.

I wasn't really redosing on comedowns, I just took an 50mg line every few hours when I felt like it. However it is obvious this was an abuse, as the comedown was on par with a heavy MDMA session comedown, and my body felt extremely exhausted to the point of wanting to vomit (but not vomiting) for hours on end.


My question, how often can I use this substance, what ROAs and at what dosages?

I think I went overkill at the 200mg mark. Would 150mg for a ~10 hour party session suffice? 50mg oral, and two 50mg redoses?

Highly depends on the purity. 100mg of 100% pure methamphetamine would kill even Hitler. If that's what's working for you, then leave it at that, but treat each new batch as if it was 100% pure. 15mg was a wise starting dose but I find it interesting that you used your friend as a guinea pig. I assume they were a willing participant though.

Next batch you get start with around that amount.

How long you can use it is really down to you, but I'd be very careful about using this drug regularly, as it is extremely addictive.

Have breaks, sleep, eat well etc. and you should be good, but weekend use often spills into the week due to the horrible comedown and the fact the euphoria lasts only a few hours but the stimulation lasts all day and night, so to get through the next day it's tempting to take more. Take care.

Make sure hands are clean and tear off cotton tip and roll into a small compact pea sized ball, or just use the one as supplied by your needle exchange. Put it in the liquid you're gonna inject and allow it to saturate. Stick the needle in the cotton and suck the liquid out. Repeat until the cooker is empty and the cotton is no longer producing solution. [@houseman5](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/155705/)

I know this is from a while ago but this section of the thread came up on google so it’s safe to assume a significant number of people are going to see this first and assume the title of that post validates the information, or lack there of in the body of the post. Being a harm reduction community, misinformation needs to be minimized.

Anyway I never used meth before in my life and I don’t want to start abusing it. I was reading in the psychedelic experience that 25MG of meth eaten orally while using LSD can have cool effects. Im very confused you guys talk about shooting like .1 gram shots. Will 25MG actually do anything I figured that’s 10 doses so that’s 20 weeks worth of meth. I just don’t know if I can only use it with LSD I feel like I’ll try it by itself and become an addict. Anyone know what 25MG of meth does anyway?

25mg would actually be 0.025 grams; 0.25 grams equals 250 mg (one thousand mgs per g).

Honestly this is where I have a fucking problem, I have legitimate dyscalculia (basically maths dyslexia) so I find it so fucking hard to keep track of shit like this. 


Thankfully, I had a guest stay in my house earlier this year who left high sensitivity scales when he went back overseas home. Has been a huge benefit to my HR. I can't believe I never used scales before now. 


People, if you are gonna IV, please PLEASE be as safe as possible. Yes, people here will answer questions. But you can't run into this method of drug use not knowing somewhat what you're doing and being willing to always learn better ways of staying safe.

So what can you guys tell me about this it's been lingering around for like months and months I finally went to the doctor and got some antibiotics for it I'm going to get blood work done a few days but I was just curious what you all had to say if anyone's ever specifically got in this... I don't know if it's related cuz it might be from sitting on my computer for like 16 hours a day and I also have a thing about picking scabs so every time he gets scabbed up I end up picking it off

No I'm not that's why I'm posting here. It took me a reallyong time to find this site! Whenever you look for drug info on Google it's all ads for rehabs! I'm not smoking anymore until I figure out what it is. I'd like to test it to see what it actually is.

Hell it could be salt for all you know. Or worse some type of fentanyl. People’s dying left and right from fentanyl/meth mix they don’t know is a mix. And anyone who thinks all the meth is good…like no. Maybe it’s good in your area but I don’t see how. Without pseudo it’s a joke

How long of a break from meth for tolerance break? And what’s the best ROA that’s the least fiendish so I don’t use as much. For me it’s smoking that’s the most fiendish. And I wanna slowly lower my klonopin intake so I can take less to get high. I just woke up and took 5mg. I was using 2g to 3g meth and 8mg to 10mg klonopin for 3 weeks straight. Sorry I don’t know how to make a thread or post.  I’m new. And I just slammed a .3 and I’m barely high. I ended up buying 6 grams. Sorry I’m new to this website and don’t know how to make a post in a thread.

Hello fellow bluelighters can anyone tell me if I should be concerned about this. About 2 days ago I shot up in my leg (I know I shouldn’t but arm veins are getting impossible to hit) and when I was getting ready to do another about 5-6 hours after I noticed where I had shot up hurts pretty bad and was getting pretty red. I slept on it (slept for about 24 hrs since I had been up several days) well when I woke up it didn’t hurt as bad but the redness seems to be spreading and it’s definitely warm to the touch but also the pain is slowly getting better. Is this something I should be concerned about? Does it seem like it’s time for another trip to the hospital? Also the skin around it feels very tight and almost “hard” feeling

Well the actual spot where I injected looks fine. It’s just red like all the way around it. Still pretty tight feeling and has a slight shine look to it. I guess it’s kinda swollen too. My plan was to go to the hospital tmr but if it’s life/ limb threatening I will go tonight.

Took klonopin and edible and hydroxyzine last night to sleep. Slept 18 hours. Took only 3mg klonopin and psych meds and at work and feel great.

I've only smoked meth, the first time I did it off tinfoil, I took like 6 or 7 hits and it made me super talkative, energetic, euphoric, made me want to talk to everyone specifically the opposite sex because it made me horny. It lasted about 5 hours or so, then when the comedown hit me, I lost all the energy I had and I felt drained. Now when I smoked it out of a pipe, I felt really wired, anxious, paranoid and my adrenaline felt like it was through the roof. But I was also smoking crack too so that would explain why I had more negative effects.

Hey guys I have a problem when trying ti inject. I can push the needle in slow, snd I make sure my needle is as parallel to the vein as possible but 9/10 times I will not get a successful register until I’m pulling back on the needle. But then it’s too late because it hurts way too bad to continue with the shot. I’m guessing this means I’m going through the vein. I don’t understand how considering I’m using short needles and making sure I’m at least 45 degrees before entering the vein. Does anyone have any advice on how not to do this?

yes and no, ive been taking some small amounts for that duration, i cant get my vyvanse script rn so im using that as a substitute. But ive been able to sleep like 4 hours every night, maybe not the first night but all others ive slept.

I'd bet it's just a fixation and you just need to take a break, get some nutrients + a couple full nights of sleep and it'll go away. That may not be what you want to hear, but I doubt there is meth stuck to your eyelid that won't go away even after multiple showers

no that does make me feel better that makes sense, like in my mind this is relatively early in the overall timeframe ive gone without sleeo in the past- even without stims- so its just confusing me, but I bet youre right.

I've been there man. Sleep deprivation is something I think uses up a predetermined available amount, and you can't really gain it back. So once you use it up, even 10 years later if you stay up a couple days the negative aspects become present sooner than in the past, if that makes sense, even without drugs

Yeah that makes sense to me man, i think thats a pretty accurate way of describing the whole thing. And brain chemistry always changes anyway so it'd make sense that whatever thing ive used in the past to measure how strung out I am wouldn't be very accurate anymore anyway. Thanks man this is pretty much what I needed to hear to not let that paranoid obsession shit fester in the back of my mind, appreciate it.

So now I believe the feds lie about it being 95-99% pure, OR…. They just lie about it being mostly D isomer. 90% of it SUCKS because of whatever crap is mixed in. Gives me all side effects, heart rate so high I can’t move or take more. It’s almost all like this now and I thought it was permanent tolerance but then someone from a trailer park gave me a tiny bit and it blew me away. Superman energy. Not the same stuff so it had to be lies about it testing in the high 90s % purity of or claims about it being d isomer. Or maybe 1% L isomer is enough to RUIN it totally.

*It sounds like unfortunately wherever supplies in your area are coming from they're just bunk. You mentioned a trailer park and I've never even seen a trailer park in real life so it sounds like we're from vastly separated areas. On the east coast , Philadelphia Metro  area I've been forced to diversity my acquisition sources for various reasons and it's consistently good quality no matter where it comes from. I've even been so spun I was having debates out loud with myself cus I'm so high and impulsive and could give a fuck less about people thinking I'm nuts lolol.  Across the past 6 days, the pattern was speed for 48 hours, sleep for 12 and after starting with 1.8g there's about . 7 or . 8 still left. That's what tells me the quality more than anything how long it lasts before the last crumb  goes into the tooter *

I've recently discovered the wonders of stretching out and consistently having movement in my limbs. I began having issues with hypertension and fluid retention making my feet balloon up and id spend 14 out of 24 hours in my computer chair without moving to the point where id have to hold on to the railing and waddle down the steps since my knees felt so shaky, I'm 300 pounds by the way -- I was losing weight til I began immune to appetite suppression lol  BUT after a 4 hour chat with a good friend and him explaining how he wouldn't go beyond 20 minutes without switching postures, I began getting up from the chair and standing on a step stool to stretch, as well as constantly stretching my arms out, waving them in circles, all types of shit and my limbs stopped cracking when I move them for the first time in years. I feel like an idiot for taking this long to realize my transgressions but 2 days in my body is feeling so much better, spread the awareness far and wide !!!!

I used to pass out in the computer chair when I was doing ice and Xanax together, that's actually the first time I ever had any problems I woke up and my feet had been stuffed in this odd position all night  resulting in shiny flushed with pink and looking like 2 puffer fish, FML... I was like how do these junkies nod off on tranq and fetty for days folded over themselves but I can't sleep or work too much in a fuckin office chair

It's MOST LIKELY from not blinking for long periods of time/dehydration/HBP causing scleritis exacerbated by dry eye.


IT PROBABLY FEELS LIKE GLASS STUCK IN YOUR EYE


Use an eye hydrating gel/drop, ensure no sweat/oil is rubbed in (because it will be acidic and burn), and sit with eye closed for as long as possible. 


Obviously ensure no foreign object.


If it was ACTUALLY methamphetamine HCL in your eye you would almost certainly have a serious chemical burn in your eye.

Somewhat tangential; I recall someone telling you shouldn't put LSD to your eye either, but can't remember shit about arguments but I think some people have done that. What's with that?

Yes.


Meth-HCL is commonly at pH around 3 or so, but locally the HCL can turn into hydrochloric acid which has a pH closer to 1.5 - stomach acid.


Do you want that in your eye. Remember this stuff will burn an indentation into the underside of your tongue.

I recall this one guy taking orally 3 g of meth, I think, in single dose.


It acutely fucked up their stomach, had to go to hospital. They treated it pretty good, but they made some mistake at one point, that caused other chronic issue, I don't know how the guy is hanging nowadays.

If I eat more than like 0.3 I will surely shit my brains out and it's this very odd smelling, peanut-buttery diaharhea that keeps coming and coming. It's actually awesome once in a while if I've been a little constipated. I picture the Meth going into my intestines and turning all of the clay-like turds into peanut-butter shit and then I can easily pump it out -- although it's pretty intense feeling / overwhelming while it's happening, lol.

I've had tons of "dry eye" issues from takin amphetamines and being on screens all day. What you need is "synthetic tears" rather than eye drops. I used to just go to the CVS and steal the most expensive kind, they were like 60 bucks for a tiny little squirt bottle and BOY were they effing AMAZING and felt GREAT. Then I realized I could just get my doctor to prescribe me next level prescription kind and my co-pay is $0 since I have Medicare, so I began doing that. It takes like 2 days and boom problem gone, just put a drop in each eye every hour while using screens.

Wow so it seems I made some strange discovery or thud was an accident.


I’ll preface by saying I haven’t had a proper strong ‘roll’ in a long time, I did try ordering mdms off various darkweb markets.. some of them sort of got me half rolling but not jittery jaw. Very relaxed a bit trippy roll.


I ordered - $10 g bag of “shake” since the pic looked good snd comments seemed good.


Well it wss really good (good meaning, better then average cartel and felt smoother) and smelled like standard cartel meth illegal had but less of the smell.


Well since I was going to attempt to just quit drugs and stimulants I did want to see what can be done after washing or recrystallization.


—-

I don’t have lab or chemicals laying around for this do I was gonna order 99% isopropyl alcohol off eBay and see if I can saturate the “mdma/meth like substances”  like I used to do with DMT. I would dump like a gram of dmt into a small vial and slowly add heptane drops and stop before it’s all able to dissolve.


The idea being that when heptane is packed full of dmt in solution, less of the bad or annoying jungle compounds are able to get into the non polar part which is heptane. So I was doing it in small batches. After mixing up the vial id leave it to slowly crystallize or just settle - there would be dmt on the bottom and heptane with dmt on top. I’d suck up the top heptane off and put that in a dish to evaporate and with no actual crystals making, the dmt from these first few pulls was 99%+ tested by LCMS.


So I put in iso alc no where enough to dissolve it all, shook it up hard, then let it sit with the top off for a couple days to slowly evaporate


Wow- welp, the first compound is the first iso  I sucked up that would be saturated and there must be a difference between that, and the still undissolved rocks left behind. 


The stuff sucked up from first iso was like meth on crack I mean I heard hallucinations and saw movements but somehow it wasn’t that freaky. But I was on klonopin too. I usually have increased psychosis effect when on a benzo.


It was super addictive but did have a trippy side to it. 


Ok - today I dosed some of the slightly yellowish xtals.  They’re still together since I didn’t crush them so apparently isopropyl alcohol doesn’t dissolve it easy. Vaping it too just like meth. Im rolling rolling pretty darn hard. But even only after smoking one or 3 hits? Maybe it’s a guy who’s trying to mix in a RC to get high reviews quick? 


It’s worth getting to try and analyze. Next time I’ll measure the dose but i just randomly hit the pipe.

Body load non existent just the love happy stuff of SERT release.


God I hope it’s not a 4-chloro compound. Feels smooth like mdma… is there a 6apb or 5mapb etc that has more realistic hallucinations (pleasant but they got weird like my dead dad the sound he makes when he walked to the bsthroom, hearing him cough too! Also choir of singers singing pleasant music thru the walls), voices having convo outside but nothing there)


More later….

Oh I should add my pupils are dialated ![🔥](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f525.png) full. It’s like mdma mixed with meth or RC that is strong and causes realistic hallucinations. Also seems more trippy so maybe its MDA… more awake too. The weird unique hallucinations are interesting. Even with headphones on no sound at all I was hearing talking. Or like a door knock. Colors are bright.


Let’s say IF it was MDA, could taking 800mcg of a choline metabolism inhibitor huperzine-a help if it gets too strong? Things got scary at peak. Now I must look up some of the 6apb type molecules.


Seems potent and long lasting and I fell asleep on it while still wired up like meth. Woke up and steered organizing shit which is great because I lost the good effects from classic stims long ago. 


My eyes definitely have a look of SERT release and eyes jitter or dart.. colors look nice and bright.

I snort mine "hurts like a bitch!"


IV meth is something I like too much, so I don't do it anymore. I don't even smoke it anymore. The rush is too intense for me. And my meth is almost the purest I have ever seen.

One time I somehow accidentally got given shards of MDMA instead of Tina and IDK the economics of MDMA but I wasn't complaining.

Don't slam, eat, or smoke it anymore. I just crush and snort it, despite the pain it causes in my face right after I snort it.

Gives me all side effects, heart rate so high I can’t move or take more. It’s almost all like this now and I thought it was permanent tolerance but then someone from a trailer park gave me a tiny bit and it blew me away. Superman energy. Not the same stuff so it had to be lies about it testing in the high 90s % purity of or claims about it being d isomer. Or maybe 1% L isomer is enough to RUIN it totally.

  So I tried meth for the very first time in my (46 year) life tonight. I have always been a social drinker but that’s picked up a bit since divorce 4 years ago.

I have a co-worker that I recently hired and he CLEARLY has a major meth habit, as you can tell visibly and also I saw his criminal background. My coworker friends and I have laughs at his expense and nicknames for him like “Methany”. 

 Anyway curiosity, and lack of coke for 2 weeks, got the best of me so I caved and tried it. He gave me a small bubbler rig and just shy of a gram (.85) to try it out. I have to say I wasn’t impressed. First impression was the smell and taste was absolutely disgusting! I was a bit nervous so I started light doing about half of it and waited.

Bummer of it is that it’s cheaper than coke by far and (supposedly) lasts a lot longer as a stimulant and motivating substance. 

  Is this just how it goes for some people? Or is it like you said, the quality is just mass produced imported crap?

Try it orally. What dose of Adderall do you take? Meth is essentially stronger, more euphoric Adderall, with even more dry mouth and vasoconstriction, so it might just not be for you.

Meth makes everything better.


Not sure how anyone couldn't love the feeling.


But I understand how people hate  it due to the comedown and damage it causes.

Modern-day mass produced cartel meth is pretty unimpressive, particularly when smoked. I was never a big meth fan even back when high quality pseudoephedrine derived meth was predominant (a decade ago), but this new cartel stuff is notably less euphoric and pleasant, *particularly* when smoked. It has sort of a fuzzy, scattered high, edgy feel to it, and almost has a dissociative quality to it.


My theory is that, while mostly dextromethamphetamine, it has enough remaining levomethamphetamine in it to be pharmacologically relevant (in terms of overall perceived effect). Keep in mind, l-methamphetamine is a selective and potent norepinephrine releasing agent, so even small amounts (say 5%) would change the feel of it compared to enantiomerically pure d-meth (such as that made from pseudoephedrine -- which the mexicans abandoned in favor of the much cheaper precursor P2P; this produces a 50:50 ratio of d-meth:l-meth, which they then take some more steps to lower the l-meth content, but it never really gets much less than 7%). The resulting product has a different feel to it than pure d-meth since l-meth is some pretty nasty stuff (l-methamphetamine is an even more selective norepinephrine releasing agent than straight ephedrine). The presence of this l-meth content is most apparent when smoked because of the speed of onset and relatively small amount that can be smoked in one hit. Large oral doses are better since the onset is more gradual and the release of serotonin (which only occurs significantly at higher doses) helps smooth out the rough edges.


So yeah I could see a first timer smoking this newer stuff and thinking that it's a shitty drug. Again, being primarily an opioid abuser, I was never a meth afficionado, but over the course of my life I've probably consumed in total a few ounces of meth (most of which was the older pseudoephedrine-derived meth), and the differences between the two are quite clear. And the differences between the old pseudo d-meth and this new mass-produced dirt cheap mexican cartel meth become most abundantly clear when it is smoked. When taken orally however, at high doses (enough to evoke notably serotonin release, perhaps 80mg+) the differences are less apparent. Still feels different, but not nearly as dramatically so as when smoked. 


Anyone who has has both the pseudoephedrine derived d-meth, and this new P2P derived "mostly d-meth, with some l-meth" cartel made shit, knows that the difference is striking. Aside from the effect profile, the crystals themselves appear different (the crystals are not completely clear, are more much more fragile and shale-like, whereas good pure crystalline d-meth is very hard, and completely clear and glass-like). 


 The crystalline structure of the new mass produced cartel meth 


definitely a big step down, especially when smoked.

Wow. Brilliant and impressive piece of documentation right there! Bravo and thanks for it. I miss the pseudoephedrine days more all the time. My complaints are something that I have to abandon, and I understand why this shit is damn near given away. Total different and weird ass substance.

Interesting theories


I personally can't say I've had pseudo meth. Of course every here in the Midwest claims they got mad anhydrous yo, and yet smoking meth is like fiendishly chasing every Adderall side effect and ten espresso shots


Once I started grinding it up with a dash of magnesium and B12 powder and loading 50-70mg into capsules it was so much better, very much a nicer Adderall. But man I still want to grab a pipe even though I know I'll instantly feel like shit. No rush. No euphoria. Just a nice long prescription amph. Naturally I'm skeptical of anecdotes but there's a lot of gripes decades long users of meth have that match my experiences perfectly.


I doubt it will ever get "solved" but I would like to find an answer if not just to satisfy my curiosity. And when exactly users complaints peaked. If it lines up with 2010/2011 then yeah its gotta be something going a bit wonky with the "precursors of precursors of precursors" strategy. Would be sick if our government would let a lab run traditional and modern synths to try and identify what is different. 


Maybe the microplastics in my cashew head are blocking my dopamine receptors

I can dig up the study in the morning- but the subjective effects of amphetamine are split by genetics. Roughly 72%-28% is the split in men. 28% is a lot of people who don't "get it" at first. 


Maybe it's my autism and ADHD super powers but there isn't a ton of recreational value I get from it. It is nice for going fuckin hard on a project or driving thru the night, rolling a bowl and being ready to rock at the knife show. No 'rush' (the onset is noticably fast, but not euphoric) no horniness. No up for seven days either barely any water. I always slept after two days awake, redose or not.


It just feels like an inconvenient amphetamine. Hard to dose with consistency, really gnarly peripheral stimulation. However I would be thrilled if a big balls pharma company found a way to re-brand methamphetamine and bind it to a pro-drug to slowly activate the meth. I think low and slow would perhaps dethrone Vyvanse as king of ADHD...

They need to allow people that've been on Adderall for 15-20 years access to legal meth. I only switched to it because Adds stopped working.

Why not switch to Zenzedi or some other 100% Dextroamphetamine preparation?


Methamphetamine isn't much better at treating ADHD than dextromethamphetamine. Meth will come on a lot stronger but once they both reach peak concentrations they're remarkably similar

I hate to break it to you but the meth stops working too. Eventually you're tolerance will become so high and it will be hard to maintain financially chasing that feeling of it "working". 


If I'm being honest I prefer Adderall over meth. The euphoria is better, feels cleaner, more clear headed. But I too caught myself chasing that dragon, my tolerance was up to. 120mg of Adderall a day, switched to ice and after a few months noticed my Adderalls had no effect on me and my meth habit started spiraling outward.

Hey guys! So I was a meth addict for about 3 years. I got clean for 5 years and for whatever reason started using again. I make sure I eat and take vitamins. I also sleep every night. So Ive been using for 2 months with a 3-5 day break between. I had used about 7 days in a row (30mg Iv, and 15mg last two days). I IV 90mg one day and didn't get much out of it, which was expected. Unfortunately I didn't get to sleep much last night because my 3 year old is sick but I still got 4 hours of sleep. I went to work this morning and I didn't feel overly tired and did a 25mg shot to make it through today so I could start a recovery break. I haven't responded is a single day and I only use in the morning. Anyway when I injected I felt a "rush" and I knew it wouldn't be euphoric, but this was unlike anything I've felt. It was like a wave of dysphoria washed over me and it made me feel like ass and confused. It's been about 12 hours and I feel better now but have very slight brain fog. The stuff I have is the same stuff I started with that was sourced from the DN. I'm in southeast U.S. has anyone experienced this?

I have a question for users who smoke it. I've only smoked and eaten it. I think eating it is the better high. I have been using since late 2017. I've taken a few long breaks, the longest being a year and a half. I've reached the point where I'm no longer getting 'high' and I feel pretty normal. I just have more energy and am able to focus on things a little better. I use mainly because I get chronic migraines but I don't get nearly as many when I'm using. Ive never shot anything. My veins are shit to begin with so it's not something I would consider.

I might make another thread to separate this but:


Can we take advantage of any differences in solubility of L isomer and D in various solvents or water? People sometimes like to use water bongs to smoke meth - even though meth is soluble in water. So obviously some is lost but… maybe MORE of the impurities get absorbed by the water faster than meth absorbs? Is there any difference between D and L isomer?


What about making a bong not using water but have it bubble through PG or VG (like what e cigs use)? Or something else relatively safe for human consumption but that MIGHT absorb Levomethamphetamine faster than Dextromethamphetamine. 


We can’t let the cartel impurities ruin meth there must be a way via much experimentation. Meth is cheap enough where I bet if people just think outside the box we can figure out how to take out more of the junk and leave more pure Dextro.


——-

I noticed when I consume meth orally, it feels closer to pure dextro IF the dose is kept low. I think some of the extra psychoactive junk maybe gets filtered out (but not totally, just enough to notice it being cleaner) more when eaten.


I was thinking about GC/MS machines - I actually don’t know how they work other than a tiny bit I read about different compounds having different weights and it got me thinking about how every compound has different freezing and boiling points…. What about making a device with an Arduino and super accurate thermostats and some kind of tube where there is a gradient of a temperature difference along the tube. Have the arduino control a hot plate that slowly raises the temp, the different compounds including d and l meth will evaporate and then condense inside this tube but I’m thinking they will separate along the tube depending on compound. Anyone understand what I’m trying to think? 


Then in theory you could figure out how where along the tube the d-amphetamine is condensed and scrape it off. Possible?

Nice find! Even if it’s super cheap I still enjoy building things myself - I was into electronics and programming as a kid and teen, then my 20s for a total mystery it’s like I got suddenly bad inattentive ADD / desire to do things faded (which is the reason I started searching for reasons or solutions - which led me right into the drugs, meds, research chemical world). My main symptom is tiredness like I’m not asleep but no drive and stuck in a weird daydreaming all day type of thing. Anyways…


After so many years of trying to “tough it out” with no meds, all that happened was I just did lots of Kratom and stuff to dull the feeling of being unable to do anything but passive activities like watching movies. So I actually do LESS or zero other drugs when on a stimulant when it’s working, the nagging sensation of wanting to “feel something” goes away and I’m busy doing things.


Dealing with doctors is SUCH a pain these days, so much time gets wasted, pharmacy issues, some doctors you will be with for 8 months and still they think 50mg Vyvanse should be enough or 20mg adderall or whatever. There are some that do give people 90-120mg adderall.. this is the type I want to find - not to actually use that much (it really is hard on the body above 60) but to be able to stock up for all those times when mishaps happen (doctor on vacation, nationwide shortage, etc)


I actually think I usually prefer pure dexamphetamine to meth, sometimes, but really both are better for different things. I feel I should have the choice to have both and more than enough supply and not be talked to and treated like a criminal or always being suspected etc. 


These “professionals” that go to school for so long should be way better than they are. Maybe psychiatrists should be required to take one dose of a few different meds so they have a clue what it’s like - they have zero experience (usually) and read outdated ancient information. 


Anyways, orally meth works great a lot of the time but sometimes even the stuff that “feels clean” has made my blood pressure go WAY up. Even low dosages. Something ain’t right. Different batches do different things. I try to find the “least shitty batch” on the dark web. Also sometimes vendors will send one gram of excellent clean stuff but if you buy a bigger qty like 7g they send crap. 


I got just one g of some recently and am taking it orally and the doses seem legit like desoxyn (but have never gotten ahold of that to try). Blood pressure measuring devices sometimes aren’t accurate- so I should try to find a medical-level properly calibrated one to buy.. I mean pharma Dexedrine doesn’t seem to mess with BP much and some studies show d-meth should be even less of a BP change. 


——-


It’s weird - I also would get these batches that WAY messed up my stomach even at just adhd oral doses. Like it would blow up like a balloon even get painful. Haven’t had that happen ever with Dexedrine. 


So I really would love to find a way to be able to get some dirty but still meth and clean it to REALLY clean, like 99%+ dextro methamphetamine.


Or.. try to get a desoxyn script. Docs that allow that seem more liberal with the daily dosages - I’ve heard of people getting 100mg a day, 120mg (narcolepsy guy who is like 80 years old, he says it’s working as good as the first day after like 30 years and he seems fine).  Maybe even TINY amounts of levomethamphetamine really is the danger.. and maybe 1mg makes your BP jump up 30 points. Or maybe it’s some strange active synth byproducts.

Found this:  (most labs do not check for isomers, they just check for methamphetamine... which is why the DEA is always claiming its so pure)

##### The Low-Down on Methamphetamine Isomers: Prevalence and Pharmacology in Humans

> According to the National Forensic Laboratory Information System (NFLIS)-Drug 2021 Annual Report, methamphetamine was the most frequently identified drug in federal, state, and local forensic laboratories. Methamphetamine exists as two stereoisomers: dextro-methamphetamine (D-MAMP) and levo-methamphetamine (L-MAMP). The D-MAMP stereoisomer is a central nervous system stimulant and drug of abuse, available in both pharmaceutical and clandestine preparations across the globe. As clandestine labs are rudimentary and uncontrolled, most street methamphetamine is a racemic mixture of D-MAMP and L-MAMP. The L-MAMP stereoisomer is also available over the counter (OTC) in nasal decongestants. However, most forensic laboratories (including seized drugs and toxicology) do not differentiate between isomers, assessing simply for methamphetamine. With advances in liquid chromatography technology and lowering costs, forensic laboratories are increasingly moving from GC-MS to LC-MS/MS techniques. With that shift, there is an opportunity to inform and empower toxicology and crime laboratories to separate and quantify methamphetamine and amphetamine enantiomers in casework. Separating methamphetamine enantiomers will maximize information gained from existing forensic evidence and workflows.
> 
> 
> 
> Alongside increasing prevalence in drug reports, 2021 results from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) estimate that nearly one million Americans drove while under the influence of methamphetamine in the past year. Despite widespread methamphetamine use and abuse, translatable knowledge on the pharmacokinetics of both methamphetamine enantiomers across forensically relevant human biological matrices is lacking from the literature. Additionally, several metabolites (e.g., amphetamine and p-hydroxymethamphetamine) are psychoactive and may contribute to the impairment profile observed by law enforcement and other first responders. However, the stereoselectivity of methamphetamine metabolic pathways remains undefined, giving those who interpret toxicological testing results little to go on.

Specifically, this work will have two major aims, (1) develop and validate an accessible methamphetamine enantiomer-specific identification and quantification method to maximize information gained from existing forensic evidence and (2) contribute to the fundamental scientific basis of knowledge surrounding methamphetamine pharmacology. Of note, the proposed work seeks to quantify methamphetamine enantiomer and metabolite concentrations in several human biological matrices following controlled study drug administration. We will also correlate analyte concentrations across plasma, whole blood, and oral fluid. Data gathered from this work will directly inform forensic science practice and translation of results to legal proceedings. CA/NCF

So basically it could even be different metabolites or different pharmacology of the metabolites from d-meth and l-meth. Maybe just a few % of l-meth is enough to do some funky weird stuff to the receptors that the d-meth binds to... changing its effects. I really hate when people keep posting the same line "no meth is exactly the same as it was 30 years ago, science proved it, you just fried your brain's dopamine... don't you trust science???" - there was a time when i thought that was a possibility.. or dopamine cells dying off or something but I personally chat with a guy who's old (never asked but like 70-85 range) he's got narcolepsy... takes 120mg of Desoxyn a day! And yet he's healthy, told me it still works exactly as it did many years ago, no noticeable potency loss, he talks like a average normal person. Not tweaking. He takes 30mg of the 5mg pills 4x a day. For like decades and he doesn't seem to have rotten teeth and tweaker issues or anything noticeable at all. I have always searched the internet for Desoxyn reviews or stories, and really have never seen a bad one except maybe a minority saying it was too relaxed compared to Adderall. Almost all of them describe it being such a light medicine that allows them to be normal and doesn't come with the nasty side effects the non methylated amphetamines have. I never see them complaining about how it used to work but now it doesn't... or feels different now vs then etc. Basically 99.9999999% of the people prescribed Desoxyn love it and have no complaints. Street meth ya got like 1000 different variations of bad side effects lol.


I'm not someone who bets but if i was I'd bet that its levoamphetamine. Its got to be partly that maybe something else that isn't showing up on analysis? There are many ways to analyze a substance, some can't detect certain compounds. I have no idea what "level" of chemistry analysis equipment these labs have

#### Free Bubble Pipe Stand​

#### How many of us have had a used up but still hot enough to melt, mark or burn things (including ourselves) & had nowhere to put it down? So we sit, holding a hot pipe until it cools down.​

#### Or, just had pipes rolling around on tables, on chairs until... <<CRUNCH>> ​

#### Well, this has been staring us in the face for years!​

#### The large, bright yellow (well, they are in the UK) cans of butane we fill our lighters & torches from have a lid or cap that has 6 or so adapters, moulded with the lid, it's these going to use to support our pipes.​

#### Take the lid off of the can, turn ?it upside down, and there is our bubble pipe support. Slip the mouthpiece end over an adapter in the lid. ​

#### Ta-da!​

#### The pipe is supported upright but away from the plastic side of the lid. You can drop a pipe over each adapter and once all adapters have a pipe on them those borosilicate tubes the harm reduction teams give out for crack can be dropped between the bubble pipes, keeping them safe from rolling off of the table too.​

I'm beginning to think I'm being secretly drugged.


I'm completely serious. Someone please respond.

Does meth break down when it's just chilling sitting out? How about when it's stored away in a jar? To clarify: I'm referring to a pretty dang humid environment (which you know always made me figure with how hydrophilic this is that it would get torn apart by humidity) as i know it will technically break down after being left out but would potentially take a while. Sometimes it seems like my shit is just.. evaporating. But I also have a really bad mold problem where I'm living at so I'm wondering if that could be related. The whole storing in a way in combination with the mold/humidity is kind of a catch-22 because I don't want to leave it out to get messed up by that stuff but when I store it away it's difficult to do so without storing it away with some of the humidity as well as some of the mold so when I go back to look at it later,seems like it's messed up again. But then again maybe this is all just psychosis in my head.


Follow-up: is there a best practice for storage in regards to humid spaces? I know that it's technically supposed to be airtight container cold dry dark spot but I'm pretty limited on the dry and cold spots currently.

So I believe I may have figured out why even clean meth seemed to have side effects and just not work like it did years ago. 


Maybe some of us are just out of shape - I just started going to the gym daily about a month ago, and I’m noticing big changes. Weight lifting seems particularly extra good for stimulant use. I only go for 30-45 minutes daily and now… batches of meth are good and feel like super clean D isomer only. Blood pressure barely goes up at all. I am taking just ADHD doses orally (15mg, 10mg, maybe max 30mg in a day) and it’s working better than any pharma drug. 


I bought a reliable brand BP cuff and been taking measurements several times a day, it goes up a little but only goes up way high if I take too much and it’s near the end of the day.


Also the anxiety and panic feelings are gone. It was giving me panic attacks if over 10mg before when I was sedentary.


———


This explains a lot if true. I noticed years ago all stimulants seemed to make my heart pound way more and more anxiety even tho they used to work fine. I was taking pyros for adhd and i guess not exercising much creeps up and somehow makes stims feel shitty.


Stim users might wanna try working out hard daily if you’re getting side effects. The benefits ramp up over a few weeks (but weight lifting seems fastest vs cardio, also way easier to do at least for me) and then last 24 hours/everyday. 


My heart rate also went down. Also.. stomach issues disappeared! I can eat fine on stims now. So weird!

Any tips for smoking in hotel rooms? I used to do it a lot but nowadays I’m paranoid. For example, I’m in a non smoking hotel that’s also kinda moldy and the people below me are smoking…I literally feel the warmth and humidity rising from my floor and it makes my room extremely uncomfortable. How do I prevent the same thing from occurring if I smoke my meth?

Cartel, Canada, and Research Chemical Labs Networking?


The Mexican Cartels have been partnering with research chemical labs in the Netherlands and Germany as well as small low scale pseudoephedrine meth labs in the Czech Republic for two years, and replacing them with consolidated superlabs creating resolved P2P meth. A cheaper product to synthesize than research chemical stimulants, far more potent meaning smaller shipments to smuggle, and much longer lasting with an RoA option similar to the needle for people afraid of the needle. Since late this summer, the Cartel have partnered with Canada to route shipments to Australia, and recently Spain as well as targeting smaller European ports. Organized crime groups in the UK appear to be recieving shipments.


I suspect/fear this partnership is an attempt to replicate the US strategy in forcing a fentanyl and meth market from the supply side. The timing of so many beloved Netherlands research chemical stimulants like 3MMC and 4MMC seemed strange, but now massive meth shipments are being siezed in the UK and Europe where no sizable market exists for it. With the Dutch labs involved, they can just force it and gain an operation which is:


More consolidated into fewer but higher output labs- smaller quantity of drugs needed to smuggle into ports- organized export/import teams- monopoly of another continent- capability to produce enough product to monopolize highly desired markets with multiple options for smuggling routes- infrastructure in place to bring fetty to Europe


Like so:


Step 1. The Dutch bring back beloved and fiendishly addictive research chemicals 3MMC, 4MMC etc and flood the market along with meth. Maybe MDMA too.


Step 2. Consolidate large number of small research chemical labs into small number of insane output industrial scale P2P superlabs. Pull synthetic stimulants and MDMA off European market except small batches and jack the price. Make metric tons of meth cheaply, tank the price


Step 3. Use Cartel/Dutch/German/UK gang members as boots on the ground marketing dealers to push addicted stim users to meth: "cheaper, longer lasting, crystal lattice means always at least 70% unlike dirty amphetamine sulfate"


Step 4. Convert UK network ot dummy grow houses into recrystallization labs. Begin dissolving meth freebase in solvents to smuggle in as liquid which isn't detected by drug dogs, and is more versatile to get in. Meth has an addicted market now, appealing to cost potency and addiction-substitute


Step 5. Use better and established smuggling techniques and united Dutch, Canadian, Czech, Mexican, Spanish, and UK network to corner out the expanding East Asian and Middle Eastern syndicates from establishing a market in Europe


Step 6. United North American/Europe syndicates excess production of resolved P2P meth exported to high street value markets like Japan Australia, and New Zealand


Step 7. Begin attempt to introduce fentanyl

Although I’m currently “hooked” on meth, I honestly hate the shit and long for my old adderall script lol. I say “hooked” cause realistically I could up and quit the shit whenever, it’s just currently the only thing I can really get other than fent and I don’t fuck with that. Don’t get me wrong, I love the meth high when I do get some pseudo-cooked d-meth, but it was rare enough when I’d just started and it’s literally just gone now. My hometown is notorious locally for home cooks and I see all the Sudafed Stacy’s lined up at Walmart and the other pharmacies whenever I go so I know they’re still producing, think the shits just kept for personal use or gone the second it’s ready cause everybody is sick of this nasty shit that’s been going around. 


I’ve been out of the drug scene in this city for a long time but as soon as I started buying myself I gained a ton of connects real fast and I’m not gonna say people here wouldn’t sell me some bullshit just because, but I have a lot of old friends and even more acquaintances that I was real good to that jumped to hook me up when they heard I was back around, so the fact I haven’t got one good bag in the last few weeks just tells me there isn’t any available. No matter how many times I’ve hyped the shit up thinking I’m finally gonna be high, it all ends up being shit ![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png) the most recent bags are the worst yet, shite so nasty if I do get another batch I’m quitting. Stuff makes my mouse taste horrid and I’m fucking starving and tired as shit like im going through WD while doing the shit every ROA except IV/plug. 


I’m gonna either post in here or make a thread a little later seeing if anybody at least in my region is getting the same shit cause it’s so wide spread it’s gotta be mass produced stuff, but definitely not that cartel pure shit everybody’s talking about unless it’s cut and re rocked cause the shit us disgusting when heats added to it.

Maybe just a few % of l-meth is enough to do some funky weird stuff to the receptors that the d-meth binds to... changing its effects. I really hate when people keep posting the same line "no meth is exactly the same as it was 30 years ago, science proved it, you just fried your brain's dopamine... don't you trust science???" - there was a time when i thought that was a possibility.. or dopamine cells dying off or something but I personally chat with a guy who's old (never asked but like 70-85 range) he's got narcolepsy... takes 120mg of Desoxyn a day! And yet he's healthy, told me it still works exactly as it did many years ago, no noticeable potency loss, he talks like a average normal person. Not tweaking. He takes 30mg of the 5mg pills 4x a day. For like decades and he doesn't seem to have rotten teeth and tweaker issues or anything noticeable at all. I have always searched the internet for Desoxyn reviews or stories, and really have never seen a bad one except maybe a minority saying it was too relaxed compared to Adderall. Almost all of them describe it being such a light medicine that allows them to be normal and doesn't come with the nasty side effects the non methylated amphetamines have. I never see them complaining about how it used to work but now it doesn't... or feels different now vs then etc. Basically 99.9999999% of the people prescribed Desoxyn love it and have no complaints. Street meth ya got like 1000 different variations of bad side effects lol.

You ever read the Stuffmonger(aka John McAfee) thread about MDPV in the best of BL? I read all 53 pages with zero sleep so I never figured out if there was truth behind it, kinda forgot I even read it til reading your post. If you didn’t ever read any of it, basically John McAfee, the antivirus guy, moved to a remote jungle and was doing some sort of research but was also experimenting with pure MDPV as allegedly the original one to hit the market was a different color and had completely different effects. The pure MDPV was a very shitty high, and he discovered that by either bringing out shittier metabolites or changing the drug all together by converting it to freebase and letting it sit out while wet made the drug have much greater effects. 


I spent honestly way too much time sitting there staring at the wall thinking about the post I was gonna make on here asking the legitimacy of the thread and if it’s possible that the pure meth that’s around that’s actually ass is because it’s pure. What if all of its best effects are brought out by unconverted precursor and metabolites that aren’t active because of the purity. Then I remembered that it’s a mix of d and l isomers which is why it has basically zero effect. But still lol, thought I’d made the discovery of the decade then just realized I really needed to sleep and eat. That was actually the last good bag I got

Not the place to ask my friend, no synthesis discussion here


What you're considering a serious chemical reaction under conditions that no free radical reaction involving an explosive metal or deadly toxic gas should ever be willingly performed in.


The law will likely pose an unimaginable level of risk. Whether it's a bottle or a Gustavo Fring esque industrial scale OSHA ready mega-facility under a laundromat; it remains a methamphetamine lab. Avoiding discussing specific laws I can say that any layman would understand that a Sheriffs office will look fantastic busting a meth lab on the news right before election day. And thats if you don't hurt yourself, someone else, your property, or someone else's.


I'd advise finding a less risky way to secure your zoomy salts. The one you seek in particular is more abundant than ever before globally. If you do decide to, against all harm reduction tenants; attempt this chemical reaction (which to be clear, my only suggestion is do not.) I believe it would be essential to make sure you understand every aspect of what chemical changes are occuring and by what mechanisms. Every reactant, precursor, and step. This will take a few weeks at minimum.


You can start by calling it a synthesis route, not a recipe


Edit: to remove specifics regarding legal penalties, and clarify that the stance I take is never to attempt an illegal chemical synthesis, much less one involving potential life threatening compounds.

There's barely any Levomethamphetamine present on the streets worldwide. Criminal groups already perform a purification step which is essentially what you describe.

Unfortunately, whatever impurities you refer to being unique to the "Cartel" are reaction byproducts that would have such similar characteristics to meth that the usual extraction, washes and recrystalization wouldn't be able to separate. Gas spectrometry analysis of meth samples shows that these chemicals are present in very trace amounts. There's debate that some of these are route specific to manufacture methods used by CERTAIN Narcos groups and MAY alter the expected high of meth, but in my opinion any differences in perceived effect are in the eye of the beholder to to speak; tolerance, greater potency, and cheaper product per gram have made smoking bowls upon bowls of meth normalized in a way it would not have been at $100 a gram in the latest 90s early 2000s. It's just how people use meth, not the meth they are using imo.

What psychoactive junk? Dextromethamphetamine is a potent CNS and PNS stimulant. In the only study done on human subjects D-meth showed notably higher strain on cardiovascular activity by way of blood pressure and heart rate than L-meth.


Perhaps a lower dose is the answer to your problem? You likely are overdoing high potency meth, and are disappointed that it is high potency. A lower dose saves you money and keeps the amount of illicit substance in your possession lower.

What about making a device with an Arduino and super accurate thermostats and some kind of tube where there is a gradient of a temperature difference along the tube. Have the arduino control a hot plate that slowly raises the temp, the different compounds including d and l meth will evaporate and then condense inside this tube but I’m thinking they will separate along the tube depending on compound.

Maybe. But it's not worth the bother, there's hardly any L-meth coming over the boarder as optical resolution and purification methods are well known and quite literally an assembly line task for these well funded and well connected global criminal organizations. Meth synthesized from a starting material that isn't chiral gets purified into essentially the same product as meth synthesized from an enantiomically pure starting material. You just have more available to consume, and you're consuming too much


Don't fight your tolerance, keep it low

I agree, I also enjoy dextroamphetamine more than dextromethamphetamine it seems easier on the body. I've heard others say the opposite so I suppose it's just subjective. Really they're nearly identical in action once in the brain... neurologists and pharmacologists simply will refer to both as amphetamine and not bother differentiating between the two chemicals unless there's a specific need for contrasting. Tbh 20mg of meth and 20mg of Adderall feel identical to me taken orally

I don't know, I don't mean to sound like a dick or be rude but you don't seem to have done a lot of professional research on these drugs. I'd be inclined to trust the professional in this circumstance by merit of their academic background alone unless the specific Doctor is provably incompetent. Yes some do exist that are not particularly open minded or academically curious post med school. But many do it because it's their life interest.

Different batches do different things. I try to find the “least shitty batch” on the dark web. Also sometimes vendors will send one gram of excellent clean stuff but if you buy a bigger qty like 7g they send crap.

Oral methamphetamine will always feel superior theraputically than other ROAs which are designed to be recreational. Taking a 30mg oral dose allows it to slowly pass through the stomach lining and reach a gradual peak plasma concentration, whereas other ROAs are

virtually instantaneous and subjective effects tend to dissipate as quickly as they come on. This is desirable for the rush or norepinephrine which is processed into adrenaline, but isn't particularly optimized for benefiting the management of a user's ADHD symptoms and behaviors.

That's because Desoxyn is designed to be consumed orally, which supports my point above. You're simply observing what many users have discovered quickly or over some time; amphetamines are best wielded as a 'tool' when taken orally.


No wonder you feel symptoms of overdose nearing even fatigue; you're overdosing

Dextromethamphetamine will significantly raise your blood pressure especially if you're already predisposed to high blood pressure by age genetics or lifestyle. You will find that this will always be the case, and you may look into medications or habits that lower blood pressure.

You can dig into all sorts of chemical solutions for a variety of potential byproducts or suspected cutting agents but the most commonly used ones that show up in street samples will be cleansed with a proper anhydrous acetone wash. Unless you have reason to suspect an unusual and identifiable cutting agent, you're really taking shots blindfolded. Many drugs benign and harmful are in the form of acid salt crystals which have similar physical properties to meth; for example fentanyl citrate won't come out with acetone, and won't recrystalize separately in water. If you knew it was present you could run a distillation; but its rarely present and wouldn't be possible visually to determine so you are more likely running time consuming tedious purification methods for no gain.


Most meth in the USA is above 70% dextro purity at the bare minimum as this is required for lattices to bond over the lengths needed to form crystals.

Docs that allow that seem more liberal with the daily dosages - I’ve heard of people getting 100mg a day, 120mg (narcolepsy guy who is like 80 years old, he says it’s working as good as the first day after like 30 years and he seems fine).  Maybe even TINY amounts of levomethamphetamine really is the danger.. and maybe 1mg makes your BP jump up 30 points. Or maybe it’s some strange active synth byproducts.

You could try, and I admit subjectively it appears to me that Desoxyn prescriptions have been handed out more freely with the shortage on traditional amphetamine stimulants... but you risk drawing suspicion and distrust for a drug that really isn't likely to be more effective therapeutically than Dexedrine or Vyvanse.


Levomethamphetamine is a weaker central nervous system stimulant and weaker peripheral stimulant in human studies, it's presence likely isn't a danger at all compared to its right handed stereoisomer which packs a significantly more potent punch onto dopamine receptor and transporter systems, is significantly more neurotoxic, and a bit more cardiotoxic.


Racemic meth has shown at least twice in human studies to have no discernable subjective difference in effect to dextrometh proper. Even it's effect on heart rate and blood pressure was nearly identical to dextrometh. Levo meth in any amount isn't the culprit of any danger... maybe of having a shorter less driven and motivated rush if you were to take it alone... but nobody does that


I highly recommend you remain on oral doses, and go lower if you're having uncomfortable effects. Why not take less, feel happier, and have more tomorrow? If your BP reaction continues you worry you and you're unable to change your lifestyle or find a BP control med that works with your drug use; it's probably time to look into solutions less potent than amphetamines

For example, I’m in a non smoking hotel that’s also kinda moldy and the people below me are smoking…I literally feel the warmth and humidity rising from my floor and it makes my room extremely uncomfortable.

Unless you’re standing directly under a smoke detector and are damn near tall enough to reach it I doubt anybody will ever know the difference. I stay in hotels fairly often, expensive ones(I’m a cheap, broke fuck I don’t pay for them) where the rooms actually cleaned and the smoke detectors work and there’s signs everywhere saying no smoking of any kind or you get charged out the ass. I always start off cautious huddled over and blowing the vapor into the toilet, and typically within minutes my girl wants to fuck so we’re smoking on the bed under the detector. Never once has one gone off and not once has anybody ever even hinted that they knew we were doing anything we shouldn’t be. But we’re also good looking people, usually dressed well in a fancy hotel. When people see us acting zoomy they probably assume coke, not meth.

So I see some outdated or possibly inaccurate information throughout  everything I share is from experience research and knowledge. Going to share some facts about the substance and IV for new individuals. Fact 90% of the meth in the U.S. is from Mexico and highly pure P2P meth. This synthesis yields the most D that's what gets you high the cartels and main distributions don't cut it Fact! They don't have the regulations and security the US has to obtain the precursors in fact ephedrine isn't even used it's phenyl 2 propanone it yields the most D isomer fact. Ephedrine 2nd. The worst and most dirty meth is made in the US made with pseudoephedrine which yields the lowest D isomer and has to be stripped out using the most volatile chemicals and nasty process for a sub par impure product Fact. Pretty much shake and bake and one pot methods all that really is local to the US anymore due to the fact you can't get the precursors. So all those old stories that meth used to be way better when jack down the street made it is a wise tale and simply BS it was made with pseudoephedrine which makes the worst dope lowest D isomer and very impure you start with a impure main ingredient you get a impure product fact 55 60% if they know what they doing compared to 90% coming out of Mexico it's low level street guys cutting it if it's cut. So when you get the shitty dope that kinda just makes you jittery and upset stomach that's US pseudo meth you can taste the damn cold meds in it. When you get the real good stuff that's pretty abundant at least where I'm at and it makes you real euphoric and horny you can bet the farm it came from Mexico. When you get the trash dirty stuff that's your local home made cold med experiment from America. We may have better a lot of things but not dope I will not entertain arguments of objective truth these are facts look it up 


Ok so you want to start IV meth pros cons 

First of I don't recommend it your tolerance will go up and there is more risk involved with that said people going to what they wanna do so let's get some correct information out. First off Why is meth bad to shoot well it's acidic and harsh so not very good for your veins it dehydrates you causing your veins to constrict shrink and roll around and thats not ideal so stay hydrated. With all that it makes you kinda shake mixed with smaller constricted veins leads to a miss. What's a miss that's when you either go through or don't make it in the vein and hurts like hell and swells up everyone misses some more than others. When you miss with meth you usually stop instantly it burns but not always be careful. Some stupid stuff I hear it's better to use hardly any water untrue the more diluted your shot the better your veins will be water is less harmful fact don't fill the dang thing up all they way 35 to 45cc is probably about what you want. People say meth is the worst to shoot compared to other substances well not really if you miss you probably going to know pretty quick so you avoid a complete missed shot. If you miss can you get a abscess yes but highly highly unlikely if you have sterile needle and clean skin meth is very caustic and harsh so bacteria and germs don't tend to want anything to do with it meth will eat the stain off a table micro organisms won't survive long in contact with it. So if you miss do you need panic and go to emergency room possibly but if you use clean tools probably not use a warm towel then a lil ice it should start to get better in a day or two if it doesn't then go. I have personally never seen someone have to go because of a abscess but that doesn't mean it can't happen it will leave a hard spot and be tender for quite some time from tissue damage in the area be prepared it's going to happen eventually even with a pro. I have seen some abscess from heroin and cocaine bacteria can grow in it much easier I have never shot either so can't get into much detail. How much should you do ? Well I'm not a doctor or your body I can give you a generic idea. If you have never done meth before your dose should be 0 snort some see how that works out. if you are not a frequent user .1 should rock you maybe do a lil less. If your tolerance is high but you never iv before .2 is going to rock you maybe do a lil less that's what I take at most .3 that's big and quite scary rush for me don't do it often. If your taking a bigger dose than that your asking for a unpleasant experience. Can u fatally acute OD from meth like heroin/opiates I don't know or heard of anyone that has from a single dose that wasn't absurdly large. I think it's something like 2 or more grams at once for it to be fatally toxic to a healthy human that's a lot and know way you could do that in short period without eating it on purpose or something like that. Where to start? Well don't start. With that said hold your arms straight out with you palms up look in the bend of your arm that big vein in the bend close to the surface learn there least risky place kinda of a hollow pit so when you miss and you will lots of space and room for swelling. Carefully insert the rig in pointing up your arm at yourself slowly pull back the plunger if you get a good flow of blood in the needle not a faint trickle very steady and slowly inject if it hurts immediately stop you messed up. Are those the best veins? Not in my opinion but start there. Next hold you arms out with palms down look at the bend on the top part if your arm on the inside above your elbow maybe you can see em if not you can feel em those are the least painful and less likely to move they go all the way to your arm those are the best for a lot of people once you know what your doing. DO NOT try your hands your legs your wrist they are super hard to get will probably blow out and if you miss going to very bad lots of pain lots of very bad stuff could happen nerves artery's definitely going to have to go the emergency room! I should not have to say don't hit your neck or face if you fuck up probably could die if your in the neck it's time to get help imo. The veins on the bottom of your forearm I also would not recommend they are smaller deeper and just not a good idea they hurt badly could be arterial blood vessels so pushing the substance into your hand not your body also not good. Go onto you tube or something to watch the basics of iv safety and sterilization and a vein chart. How many times can you use I needle? Ok this is also important ideally one time throw it out they get dull and you will miss and have leaks and more damage to your veins if you keep the same one. Does it suck to go in and buy new ones yes but worth it! This always isn't possible so for me I'm not you the needle is still sharp after one go I save it wash it put up for emergency move to a next one if I have to use it again it usually is fine then I throw it out immediately because 3 and 4 uses that point is dull and rolling and tearing your comfortable access spots you don't have many. I messed up one of my crooks when I was a novice it disappeared never came back don't know where it went. The right one I thought the same it got hard and small and was going away I got very depressed took a break and luckily after about a week I noticed it was back at the surface and big and soft again I will never use it again it was a miracle. My left top forearm that's my trusty spot been through hell when it stops registering one time I take a break and let it heal it up do not keep poking and poking at it be patient it will heal if you let it. If I mess it up funs over I will not hit legs hands go digging around for a new one I've tried before never any luck it will be time for a new adventure. Some ending notes after you have taken 2 or three shots your vines get rubbery and become impossible to hit that's your body telling you break time mofo if you obsess over that shot and poke over and over you won't have any luck and will be waiting longer because your not letting it heal. Iv does not give you the same high as smoking and snorting it's very very different much more intense at first then a very long lasting mellow energetic feeling so easy for me to be un noticed and normal if you wanna be tweaked the hell out twack star status all day it ain't for you. The rush is addictive and if you think you can just go all Willy nilly and just pop away as much as your little heart desires your mistaken. If you have small or deep hard to find veins this isn't a option for your standard ROA don't try it won't work you will have a horrible time waste all your gear and be in lots of pain and miss all the time and partially miss every time and usually are one and done. Most girls also have a really hard time they have smaller veins thinner walls and cannot take much damage. In closing I do not recommend anyone to try it most will never do it any other way it's a hassle it's time consuming it can be very depressing and frustrating no matter how good you are you still will miss still waste gear. And bye the way it makes your arms sore and ache and hard all the time

hey you seem like you know your stuff. Can you please explain why it is said that stimulants release/elevate blood levels mainly of dopamine and norepinephrine? epinephrine is not mentioned in those associations as far as I can remember. Is it really just prodrug to epinephrine then? How does the natural fight/flight-reaction work, is human body able to release plain simple epinephrine under threat or is it always norepinephrine first before conversion? I've been always curious about this and maybe even read explanation once or twice but have forgotten ever even doing that.

I will share the documentation i have saved that illustrates the overall purity averages in the US, but I do know that seized samples not by border patrol but by local county to county police departments at the end of the distribution chain still average in the 90% purity range


I have no even educated guess as to where the large but not really statistically significant illicit pseudoephedrine and ephedrine powder goes that is seized entering the US. My suspicion is small communicating groups of individuals who synthesize drugs as a passion and love of the thrill. Likely made up of individuals with a self taught understanding of organic chemistry that falls into the higher education range, if not actually have academic degrees or titles in organic chemistry. Their product would probably be sourced through the dark net to reach a sort of "craft beer" type audience.


There are a handful of viable options to source or even produce from legal precursors ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, but I don't forsee a clandestine project motivated by cravings and desire to supply oneself with the drug would want to go through the additional steps. The latter personality of course is going to be where most local production stems from as limits on the ephedra alkaloid rich cold pills don't allow for a yield that is profitable to prepare for sale. If I was in that conundrum I would absolutely favor the shake n bake process so I 100% agree with you there. I can't really understand why residual cold pill solids would make it out into the finished product as the required extraction steps and precipitation would surely give you a yield free of at least the binders flavor and dye? What's left could still be dirty and precipitate out with under or.over reduced pseudo and it's intermediate... and at that point a cook following a "recipe" likely wouldn't know or even have the means to remove those impurities.


Maybe you can help me with a question, earlier this year after I had done my own experimenting with chemistry, there was a somewhat coordinated rollout of multiple pseudoephedrine brands and some stores generics that now contain a second "active" ingredient that is similar enough to pseudo to make the pills no longer viable. Is this at every major retailer? I only skimmed a headline and saw mention of the two big name convenience store and.pharmacy chains but not grocery stores.

I don't know that I mentioned anything about IV as an ROA except to say that I feel meth is at its best taken orally and in spite of smoking being my poison of choice purely out of fidgety addiction


I try to frame my stance on IV meth as so; I will share with anyone considering trying it who has not committed the potential risks should they ever get too comfortable and cut corners on the proper administration steps, and that the bioavailability isn't really impressive compared to rectal or oral doses (but the onset of effects is still king of the RoAs)


If a person made sure to follow every step purifying their meth, using sterile needles, and preserving the availability of veins all they'd need to monitor is their redosing urges and they could control the majority of the most serious potential risks. Not everybody has that discipline for more than a few weeks, but plenty do


If somebody's ROA is already IV for meth or even if the person intravenously administers opioids and is planning to try meth by way of the same ROA I don't see any purpose in singling it out aside from maybe saying hey do you have a good easy injection step by step? And if not I send them a website I really like the layout and humor of


My best friend's ROA was always IV, and she is honestly still a role model level individual juggling college, the life of a single parent, and full time running a business. I often forget how we met at this point because there's no signs of exhaustion or impatience or anxiety at all. And three months ago when she won a probation hearing and the violation was correctly found to be dubious she immediately quit using and I never heard a peep about it. Just dropped it like it was yesterday's paper. There's something about Abigail that really just exists in the moment, and grants her this sharp and reserved intelligence and durability.


Anyways with something like IV use I really find it counterproductive when people go any further than saying that it's a route where you can't get sloppy, and can't get casual or cut corners. Shaming an adult for their curiosity after giving them the information to choose in fairness seems like a great way to damage a connection of trust, and hurt the impress of someone safe and judgement free that there is an open line of communication to. You can't control the decisions of adults, and as you no I get very hot and bothered at the notion of using disinformation to serve as manipulation even if I believe I could force a better outcome.


The goal is to build trust, and if things get bad then you can be a much needed voice of support.

People say meth is the worst to shoot compared to other substances well not really if you miss you probably going to know pretty quick so you avoid a complete missed shot. If you miss can you get a abscess yes but highly highly unlikely if you have sterile needle and clean skin meth is very caustic and harsh so bacteria and germs don't tend to want anything to do with it meth will eat the stain off a table micro organisms won't survive long in contact with it. So if you miss do you need panic and go to emergency room possibly but if you use clean tools probably not use a warm towel then a lil ice it should start to get better in a day or two if it doesn't then go. I have personally never seen someone have to go because of a abscess but that doesn't mean it can't happen it will leave a hard spot and be tender for quite some time from tissue damage in the area be prepared it's going to happen eventually even with a pro. I have seen some abscess from heroin and cocaine bacteria can grow in it much easier I have never shot either so can't get into much detail. How much should you do ? Well I'm not a doctor or your body I can give you a generic idea. If you have never done meth before your dose should be 0 snort some see how that works out. if you are not a frequent user .1 should rock you maybe do a lil less. If your tolerance is high but you never iv before .2 is going to rock you maybe do a lil less that's what I take at most .3 that's big and quite scary rush for me don't do it often. If your taking a bigger dose than that your asking for a unpleasant experience. Can u fatally acute OD from meth like heroin/opiates I don't know or heard of anyone that has from a single dose that wasn't absurdly large. I think it's something like 2 or more grams at once for it to be fatally toxic to a healthy human that's a lot and know way you could do that in short period without eating it on purpose or something like that. Where to start? Well don't start. With that said hold your arms straight out with you palms up look in the bend of your arm that big vein in the bend close to the surface learn there least risky place kinda of a hollow pit so when you miss and you will lots of space and room for swelling. Carefully insert the rig in pointing up your arm at yourself slowly pull back the plunger if you get a good flow of blood in the needle not a faint trickle very steady and slowly inject if it hurts immediately stop you messed up. Are those the best veins? Not in my opinion but start there. Next hold you arms out with palms down look at the bend on the top part if your arm on the inside above your elbow maybe you can see em if not you can feel em those are the least painful and less likely to move they go all the way to your arm those are the best for a lot of people once you know what your doing. DO NOT try your hands your legs your wrist they are super hard to get will probably blow out and if you miss going to very bad lots of pain lots of very bad stuff could happen nerves artery's definitely going to have to go the emergency room! I should not have to say don't hit your neck or face if you fuck up probably could die if your in the neck it's time to get help imo. The veins on the bottom of your forearm I also would not recommend they are smaller deeper and just not a good idea they hurt badly could be arterial blood vessels so pushing the substance into your hand not your body also not good. Go onto you tube or something to watch the basics of iv safety and sterilization and a vein chart. How many times can you use I needle? Ok this is also important ideally one time throw it out they get dull and you will miss and have leaks and more damage to your veins if you keep the same one. Does it suck to go in and buy new ones yes but worth it! This always isn't possible so for me I'm not you the needle is still sharp after one go I save it wash it put up for emergency move to a next one if I have to use it again it usually is fine then I throw it out immediately because 3 and 4 uses that point is dull and rolling and tearing your comfortable access spots you don't have many. I messed up one of my crooks when I was a novice it disappeared never came back don't know where it went. The right one I thought the same it got hard and small and was going away I got very depressed took a break and luckily after about a week I noticed it was back at the surface and big and soft again I will never use it again it was a miracle. My left top forearm that's my trusty spot been through hell when it stops registering one time I take a break and let it heal it up do not keep poking and poking at it be patient it will heal if you let it. If I mess it up funs over I will not hit legs hands go digging around for a new one I've tried before never any luck it will be time for a new adventure. Some ending notes after you have taken 2 or three shots your vines get rubbery and become impossible to hit that's your body telling you break time mofo if you obsess over that shot and poke over and over you won't have any luck and will be waiting longer because your not letting it heal. Iv does not give you the same high as smoking and snorting it's very very different much more intense at first then a very long lasting mellow energetic feeling so easy for me to be un noticed and normal if you wanna be tweaked the hell out twack star status all day it ain't for you. The rush is addictive and if you think you can just go all Willy nilly and just pop away as much as your little heart desires your mistaken. If you have small or deep hard to find veins this isn't a option for your standard ROA don't try it won't work you will have a horrible time waste all your gear and be in lots of pain and miss all the time and partially miss every time and usually are one and done. Most girls also have a really hard time they have smaller veins thinner walls and cannot take much damage. In closing I do not recommend anyone to try it most will never do it any other way it's a hassle it's time consuming it can be very depressing and frustrating no matter how good you are you still will miss still waste gear. And bye the way it makes your arms sore and ache and hard all the time

You've got a good write up. Now you need to convince whoever makes the final call on the subreddits policy to allow experienced IV users to have discussion with people who post questions about using for the first time or those who are distressed or feel they're injured from a mistake or just too big of a rush.


The policy that IV use just has to be pretended to not exist isn't honest, and it's not harm reduction. Your voice as an experienced user of that ROA and authoritative figure is a powerful asset that's completely wasted when you have to usher people away to an isolated subreddit. Bit dramatic of me to say this but it feels a bit dehumanizing, separating IV users even in that small way. I know you have been saying that for ages, but I'm with you 1000%.


I'm burnt out of reading government data papers about fuckin meth for the week so I've taken the last four days off of research, writing, and bothering to throw sources at trolls, but I will link those sample testing results for you later


The only thing I know for sure is the salt lattices won't co-crystalize beyond a fine powder except when 75% of the "shard" is enantio-pure meth of one or the other isomer. So the maximum amount that one could adulterate crystalline meth by re-rocking is a quarter. Someone could try slipping bunk salt crystals of some similar looking chemical in loose with the meth crystals but idk that I've seen an example of a compound that isn't obvious contrasting in appearance when you put them right next to each other


Appreciate you.

Good question, norepinephrine and epinephrine play off of each other and work together to induce flight or fight body conditions. Dopamine also does a lot more than just regulate reward memory decision making, focus, and provide us with motivation to complete tedious tasks; it too informs the body and brain to behave as though we are isolated from our community alone in a potentially hostile survival circumstance. The libido is because the brain makes genetic lineage an urgent priority because it thinks there's a chance we don't survive much longer. Orgasm rewards reproduction (even if it's just porn and a hand) and now we are self reinforcing an unnecessary and pointless action. Dopamine also is what keeps you from feeling sleepy, hungry, or thirsty, and it heightens your sense of suspicion and distrust as an actually extremely helpful survival enhancement.... if we were actually in a fight or flight circumstance. When we're not it escalates to paranoia and eventually delusions if you go that far


Anyways norepinephrine and epinephrine are interchangeable names for noradrenaline and adrenaline. They're the exact same chemical, they just have multiple identifications depending on region. Norepinephrine is always active and stays in the brain, when we get stressed it starts giving us those mental feelings of dread and jumpiness, but it also sends the signal to the kidneys to release epinephrine.


Epinephrine is basically norepinephrine sounding the bodily alarm. Epinephrine functions DIRECTLY in the body, norepinephrines physiological action is done through the brain. Epinephrine binds at sites located on every major organ in the body, and overrides their normal functioning and demands they now function in fight or flight mode.


Stomach queasyness and constipation can occur when this is done too often or aggressively, but essentially more energy is given to the heart lungs and brain, and other major organs function at bare minimum and lose communication privileges. No hunger signal, thirst signal, not stopping and peeing or pooping, etc.


So thats roughly how it all works. Keep in mind dopamine and norepinephrine do cause potentially unpleasant  physiological side effects of their own by issuing brain commands. In fact dopamine is responsible for the INCREASE in cardiovascular activity which is sometimes a source of unpleasantness in non-emergancy ODs

BTW.. I don't think 90-95% purity necessarily invalidates the dirtiness or clean and smooth variations people feel with meth. The hydrochloride is supposed to pH between 7-8, weakly basic. But modern street samples average at a 5, and thats mostly due to a LOT of samples at an unbelievable 3 pH. Way acidic enough to cause digestive system issues, rot teeth, and blister tongues. The more acidic the product is, the less bioavailable it becomes. The pH has a very meaningful impact on the potency, and the aim for a weakly basic salt is because the body is weakly acidic usually same idea as to why the "baking soda trick" assists with absorption.


On top of THAT god knows what implications combustion of some of these P2P, methylamine, and intermediate byproducts can cause in the body.


I will say this, the product I've gotten over the last year has definitely had unique characteristics each time, and the last bag I bought was quite unpleasant... felt like an oil was coating my teeth and mouth, and I got those blisters on my tongue.


Was seeing that same piss colored ice slurry looking crack back that people are posting. A few months back I spilled a bit of water into the pill bottle I used to secure my meth in, and the previously impressive product took on characteristics like this batch.


I used a small space heater and a packet of silica gel like in beef jerkey hoping that the dry ultra water friendly salt had been siphoning water out of the extremely foggy, rainy, and humid Midwest environment last week. Idk if that's how water got absorbed into the crystals: but drying the shit fixed every single issue. It removed the yellow discoloration with even light heat, recrystalization uniformity and sharper more defined pattern like actual cracks, removed that fuckin foul weird taste, and my sores started to heal even while using.


It's just my one experiment and theory, but I think it's an easy enough and harmless enough hypothesis and solution to maybe suggest it and see what results others have

I'm also from the Midwest 100% agree Caustic chemicals in all synthesis if done perfectly and PHd down to a lil above neutral p2 will be the only acceptable synthesis if done properly anything else is pretty much fake imo. I'm right in the middle of the Midwest we usually have a everlasting supply of top quality although about a month ago some very dirty low quality stuff very dusty that white powdering the shards and very brittle was scattered everywhere it was trash haven't seen that garb for years until recently

I do believe quality and purity have a lil to do with the smoothness and way I feel. less quality means lower D isomer that is the chemical compound that releases dopamine and produces the high if it's a racemic mess with more Levo it's going to be shaky jittery and way less smooth for me  it could be done filtered and washed correctly yes. But in my experience the two usually go hand in hand

It's both yeah, it's dropping the pH of my mouth and blistering from the acidity


I do still have jaw movements and eventually get sore muscles, but these tongue ulcers appear near instantly and the best relief I've found is swishing sodium bicarbonate. Its also only gotten this servere on the first day twice before, both had the yellowish darkening when first melted, foulish bile taste, and it induces like exceptional amounts of sebum production on my skin, I'm sticky and oily, but it's not the viscosity of my natural oils and sweats.


I think there's hydrochloric acid trapped in the shards maybe somehow... the taste of bile is giving me an entirely baseless hunch. Can sprinkling a teeny amount of my baking soda push up the pH without involving heat or a big fanfair?

If you put a gram of HCl and a gram of sulfate on a scale, the HCl will have more amphetamine molecules since there's 6.022E23 molecules in a mole. Hydrogen is ~1 atomic mass units (a single proton for the most abundant isotope) and chloride has 35.4 atomic mass units (17 protons, 18 neutrons usually) making for 36.4 g/mol. Sulfate, or has 96.1 atomic mass units and two acidic functional groups when sulfuric acid before sulfuric acid reacts and forms a sulfate anion with a base at 2:1 moles of base and sulfuric acid allowing for 2 amphetamine molecules for every 1. So amphetamine freebase is 135.21 moles of amphetamine per gram.

Sorry to dig up a quote from a million years ago but it's a good question I don't see discussion on often


So while your very technical explanation is interesting new information to me, why drugs are chosen with certain salts is in truth much more simple, pharmaceutical companies will choose the first salt that has fine water solubility, reasonable stability, and is as cheap as possible.


Interestingly up until the mid-ish 20th century drug patents specified the salt as part of the formulation. Since then all salts of the formulation are umbrellad into the patent. So for example if you discovered and patented morphine HCL in 1889 or whatever, a competitor could patent morphine sulfate and compete(interestingly both salts offer medically unique benefits and morphine can be found in both types today). Today, if you patented morphine HCL nobody can sell any other version. Once the drug becomes open to generics it's better to stick with what the customer expects since salts cab vary wildly from what freebase they're binding to including in potency which is potentially dangerous.


Older drugs may be sold today in a quirky salt just because the original most well marketed product back in 1920 happened to be a citrate salt.  Today, if it can be HCL or sulfate it will be 99% of the time.


Clandestine chemists and pharmaceutical companies alike will always opt for a hydrochloride salts first because hydrochloric acid is dirt cheap, abundant, consumer available and garuntees to play nice and predictable with our stomach acid. If not HCL then the sulfate will be the next choice because it's cheap, abundant, and consumer available. Street drugs that are neither HCL or sulfate are rare, because the risk-reward can drop sharply to attempt large scale production when other cheaper drugs can be made instead.


The only reason you don't see amphetamine hydrochloric is because it is insanely hydroscopic; it absorbs so much moisture from the air humidity so quickly that the salt will degrade into a slushy wet mess and evaporate away way too rapidly to be practical. I'm told it's a pain in the ass to HCL gas the freebase without great yield loss but I've not cared enough to see why


Methamphetamine sulfate isn't in that sweet volatility spot to both boast good stability and shelf life in an average environment and a melting and evaporating point below it's point of combustion. It can't be smoked, and the HCL is stable enough, water soluable enough, and tolerates the stomach enough while also being able to smoke.


Not that there needs to be another reason, but I daydreamed about making a meth sulfate and the crystallization was frustrating, it had a strange unpleasant color and was much less potent and took ages to kick in. I read on a forum somewhere that the color, flaky small crystals, and low potency was all normal. Someone explained the theory is that the counter ion doesn't play well on meth.

Hey what's up. I'm hyped to post on this thread it's cool lol. I do have serious question though. I have been slamming a very humble amount of ice about two to three times every 24 hours for a month or two. 


My urine has been smelling like hand sanitizer and it's really disgusting. I have experienced this back in 2018 and 2019 as well with the cleaner ice. I'm currently shooting the Mexican old lady perfume stuff and I have that smell seaping out of me too.


I always thought the hand sanitizer piss smell was my kidneys. I try to google it and I get a million different horrible things. So yeah if anyone knows hit me with a reply.

Heat asap allows the solution to permeate the walls of the white blood cell barrier. Heating pad. Sleep with it. And massage the lump as much as you can stand to. Hold up on antibiotics. Hydrate.

Thank you I'm going through it if you saw my arm you'd be disappointed....hey I've healed my arm and have a very small bump underneath the vein in the crook but I have completely healed is this am encapsulation does it go away how do I bring this up to my doctor without mentions what I did man ?

Repeated cold anhydrous acetone rinses should remove virtually all of it. But you’ll need a fair bit of acetone because fentanyl isn’t highly soluble in acetone.

So I ended up doing what you said and keep in mind I wash almost every sack I get, atleast a quick rinse over the rocks.. I don't typically loose much at all but this bag went from 3.1 to not even half a G.. So I'm not positive what the majority was if it was mostly msm or what.. 


Anywho thank you for getting back to me on this, much appreciated

Well what very little was left wasn't even good dope.. They took low quality shit and then cut it at least 80/10 or maybe eve. 90/10.. I try and wash every sack I get but this takes the cake..


The cup was the cut after the acetone evaporated away.. And the other is what was left.. Although I know you can't see see jack shit because my dumbass thought a white tray is best for having a white substance lol


EDIT : on your question about the wetness/dryness.. The shit itself it, it felt normal.. The cut itself. Was very dry/powdery... It was very hard to. Scrape out of the glass jar.. I did a little. Taste test but couldn't tell. What it was

Usually we have a lot of people who know.  I am not one of them.  Which brings me to this thread.


As I age I am glad i did not use stimulants in my younger years.  Does anyone know of any old meth heads, at least that did meth for 20-30 years that are now 75-80 years old?  I am just curious.


I remember reading in the Miles Davis autobiography when he went heavy with cocaine and he was up there in age.  Like 60's.  Makes me wonder the fate of heavy meth users.  Surely a few made it to their 90's.  I for one do not believe it harms some people.  I think some people are tough.  My father is 91 and has double heart failure. (CHF) Has had acute heart failure that stopped his heart about 5 times and smoke cigarettes for 78 years even in the midst of this.  His doc told him if he keeps smoking he would be dead in 6 months 5 years ago.  Not so. But he is very restricted, uses a walker.  He has had his defib turned off.  And here he is making a mockery of the saying cigarettes cause lung cancer. Fluid goes everywhere EXCEPT his lungs.  It makes me grieve for the younger guy with heart failure that dies a and leaves a family behind.  Life is not fair.


I think I posted this because we can always find exception to the rules.  And of course if we hear of an old 90 year old meth head then they would also be the exception to the rule.  I for sure think some people are very tough.  (although the thought of a 90 year old shooting meth is a funny picture)

Late reply:


Yep, the most common adulterant is Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) 

What you call "re-rocking" is a really easy overbake proses, MSM is readily available as a supplement.

Can be separated by washing with ice cold acetone, one thing to keep in mind acetone must be dried beforehand to prevent loss to water present in industrial grade (hardware store) acetone.

If your tolerance has increased due to frequent use, perhaps 1/4 gram (.25 - typically a purchased "twenty" in the US). Always test your dope prior to injection (especially when you obtain from several sources), to test: roll a small bowl in a piezo first, or run it on foil. Quantities just go up from there.

Lord knows I missed plenty when I first started, unfortunately one of my misses ended up abscessing and getting infected. I had to be treated with IV antibiotics to cure the abscess, and I'm left with a gnarly little scar that'll probably never go away. Also, make sure that EVERYTHING that comes into contact with your dope is ABSOLUTELY CLEAN. Your spoon, your syringe, your water (tap water is fine) should be as clean as possible, that's just common sense.

For example, I’m in a non smoking hotel that’s also kinda moldy and the people below me are smoking…I literally feel the warmth and humidity rising from my floor and it makes my room extremely uncomfortable. How do I prevent the same thing from occurring if I smoke my meth?

Howdy from West Coast USSA. Been habitual user after motorcycle accident put me out on disability for 3+ months, my ending amicably a 10+ year relationship, and about a year after the accident my Father pass on from his 2nd heart attack, we were very close and I couldn't conceive the strength of this connection and how it affected me. Recreational substance use has been a feature of my life since I started w LSD at 18 and a long love affair with psychedelics. I have a sequence of events and just seeing if it has any echos of familiarity with others. When I was 22 or so extasy and MDMA popped up on my scene and were only found at parties which was tragic for me. Probably around the 15th to the 20th time using I found that it drastically changed for me and I did find the value for the money anymore and the occasional testing of the waters every 3 years or so show no change or no reversal back to the first. Those were filled with an astounding increase in libido (baseline is high drive so kinda redundant but the euphoria was there also) The transformation make it so I feel great, talkative, touchy feely, inc empathy but a lack of increased libido and marked change in the euphoria to one of great contentment. Might be great on paper but the toll is too high in money and the come down, and without the effects I loved there is no reason for me using it.

So, I'm not sure if these have been mentioned before,  but I have a 20$ "Smoke Buddy" personal air purifier that works extremely well for hotel rooms!


...At least,  I've never been busted before...I smoke cigarettes, 420 and ice, and so far, so good!

Have never injected it so cannot say from experience but from what I've heard it kicks the same way as other drugs when IV'd as opposed to snorting, smoking or whatever


Just reading some of your recent posts (and this one) strongly suggest that it would be a really seriously bad idea for you to start doing that.


It sound like the party is over for you regarding stims tbh, and that's a really handy thing to become aware of when that juncture is reached (which it always will be at some point). All best wishes

Switching to IV is a game changer for most. There’s not much comparison to other ROAs (routes of administration) during the first few minutes, however after the initial rush wears off, the high is essentially the same. I always preferred smoking and enjoyed the gradual rise in euphoria, but IV gives it to you all at once. No other ROA gives a rush like IV and that’s why its so much more addictive. You IV for the rush, otherwise why take the added risks associated with IV use when the next 10 hours (after the first few minutes) will feel the same as any other ROA? 


If you struggle to control your use with other ROAs, then it’s a mistake to go IV, you’ll struggle more. If you keep trying to repeat that first rush, tolerance builds quickly and soon your doses are escalating, and all the negative effects that come with that. It’s not a decision to take lightly. Stay safe and all the best!

Agree with [@Auranova](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/344015/) that it's not worth it. Only practical gain is if you need to be able to dose relatively quickly and silently

I find it starts to hit you before the plunger is all the way in. It builds very quickly and peaks about 10 seconds after you’ve pulled the needle out. If you do a decent amount then for about 1 to 2 minutes you’re basically paralyzed by a mixture of ecstasy and all the muscles in your body tensing up. You can’t do anything that requires physical dexterity during those first couple minutes. Then it starts to kind of wash away and the high becomes more normalized, i.e. like any other ROA. After about 10 minutes it’s like the peak high for other ROA’s keeping in mind that it takes much much longer to reach that level of peak high depending on the ROA. Maybe a half hour or more of continuous smoking if you go that route, or an hour or more if you ingest, etc. etc.

Missed this before sry. Rush over for me pretty quick about 10 secs. I try to keep dosing where it is though because upping it doesn't seem to end well from what I've read.

Recently acquired some "ephedrine based meth", which runs and smokes just like meth in the pipe, but has basically no effect whatsoever. Very, very disappointing, yet realistic fake of meth.

What substances could potentially behave and look a lot like meth, but not have a high?

The  crystals are really light and fine, and quite small.

Not looking for a substance ID, but just wondering if there are substances that can have these properties. Thanks y'all!

Well a bit on meth chemistry in case you didn’t know, but methamphetamine occurs as two mirror isomers, levomethamphetamine (l-meth) and dextromethamphetamine (d-meth).  It’s the dextromethamphetamine isomer that provides the wonderful effects on our central nervous system that we all love. Most meth that’s sold is typically a mixture of the two and called racemic methamphetamine. Good cooks try to maximize the amount of d-meth, which is difficult and complex to do. Shitty meth tends to be primarily l-meth which lacks the euphoria.


Then there’s the whole range of cuts that can be added, and there’s many if you do some research. Personally, I’d test your product to see if there’s any meth in there at all. There’s inexpensive test kits you can buy online, or simple and crude tests you can try at home like putting a small shard in bleach. If it doesn’t fizzle and dance around, it’s not meth. I can tell by the taste if it’s meth. But with all these tests, you can’t tell the product’s purity, only if meth is present. You need a lab to find that out. Personally, I’d throw the product in question out and find a new source.

Most common are benzylamines such as isopropylbenzylamine, how it ends up looking kinda depends on the method of recrystallized.

It's ok buzz, but I am over it. I just shoot 0.04 5 6 or 7.    I use to do 0.18 the buzz is to much. 5 min later I am at the knock shop waisting 1000s on hookers. 

     Do stuff to my body that I would never do straight. When I was doing larger shots every time I would say to myself I will not act that way this time.. 10min later I, do the same shit. 

    I just shot 0.06. Good rush nearly spewed.. Now just getting shit done, like cleaning, eating, trying educate instead of trying to put some things where they don't fit.. Lol

My best advice here is not to move on to a different form of administration until you are bored with the one you are currently using. If you just luv blowin clouds or takin capsules, stick with it. Because once u feel that rush, u are pretty much gonna stick with the needle.

> For me, the rush is my favorite part. IMHO, the rush depends on the purity of the meth, the amount you are consuming, and the amount of water you use. If you have a decent size shot of good quality meth that is diluted half water half dope you will prolly get an amazing rush. It starts as a burning (not painful) in your stomach and it rises up your chest and exits as a cough. For me tho, it not only rushes up, but it also heads south and exits in 'other' areas. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) I get all tingly and hot. It's very intense! I've never taken heroin so I can't tell you how it compares. The high that is left behind is Euphoric and steady for a few hours. Sometimes I will be productive......but sometimes I am taken hostage by my computer!

0.25 is way too much for first time, I think same. I have been shooting for 6 months I think my biggest shot was 0.2.. Now I just have 0.07 give or take 1/4 of a point. 

    Going to work  0.04, going to the girls 0.1.. Good enough and more for later

> 			I was an IV meth user for about 6 months. I don't remember a whole lot. The majority of it was a blur, between the substance abuse and the physical and mental abuse from my boyfriend, I think my brain has just subconsciously blocked a lot of those memories out. I *DO* remember my first time, though... wow is all I can say. I couldn't even see straight, and I felt like I wet my pants (not pee, either)! After that, everytime we were gettin ready for a shot, I'd have to poop first, because I would get so excited! I never acheived that same high, although I'd come very close. Sometimes I'd get sleepy immediately after a shot. I have no idea why, because it is an upper - not a downer. But I'd nod kind of like what I see heroin users do. I've never done H, so I can't compare the two... but it was extremely strange! And it was pure, too. We made the shit ourselves, so we know it didn't have anything else in it. I never wanted to continue abusing on a daily basis like we did, but I had an abusive stalker boyfriend who would accuse me of sleeping with other men/women and getting high without him. He'd say that's why I didn't want to get high with him. When in reality, I just wanted to quit. Anyway, I never shot myself up - it was always him, and he NEVER missed. Not once! I once asked him what the most he'd given me was, and I guess my tolerance was up to about a .75 gram per shot (and I'm naturally a very small girl. 115 lbs off dope, got down to about 100lbs when I was using). He had these really cool glass syringes.. HUGE fuckers. Could hold a lot more than a regular insulin needle. Sorry for this being so long, I haven't talked to anyone about this in a long, LONG time. I quit cold turkey 2 years ago.

Holly shit that a big shot.. I miss a few times, not the whole shot. 10 units something like that. Never bothered me though. I feel like sleeping straight after a shot some times.. I think it's just relief that the anticipation is over for now

i also want to gravedig this one like the poster above -- but for different reasons! 


i wanted to specifically touch on shooting up in your breasts, which is something i did a lot when i was using IV. i strongly advise against it. 


i was the type of IV'er who didn't give a fuck if she was missing. i would spend hours trying to hit sometimes, so when i finally got it, nothing could stop me from full sending it. super stupid, obviously, and i have faced a lotta consequences from that mindset. there was a point where both my breasts were completely covered in bruises and lumps, even went to the doctor for it. almost all the lumps went away with time, as lumps from misses usually do. all except for one. i am waiting for my appointment to get that lump checked out still, and will update this post with any relevant info once i do. 


i can't answer exactly on the safeness of it, but i know from my experience that it isn't something that should be considered first when locating veins.

So just to answer one question, i have an answer for the 2nd part of question #3. I can also shoot using either hand but when i have to use my non dominant hand i have to use a cheat code. Someone once referred to it as "training wheels for a noob" lol dumb person but great name or description as it is kinda like using training wheels,  except ive been riding this bike for 15+yrs, so its just a good idea to me.


Anyway my big huge secret issssss...a key ring![🙃](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f643.png) lol but fr though a key ring just like the one holding all your keys together, can be put on the end of the plunger, by straddling the post inside of the rings section that overlaps itself. This gives you the ability to pull back a bit for that bit of suction you (or at least I) need to get a good flag/register, without having to use you pointer and middle finger to pull while using your thumb and ring finger holding the barrel. Having an extra finger to hold steady the barrel gives you a TREMENDOUS advantage when you need all the stability you can get. Pls try it even if you feel you dont need "training wheels" lol


Oh and as far as using your boobs. I unfortunately dont have boobs![🙃](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f643.png) BUT every girl thats gotten me to hit her, if i cant hit there arms in 2 tries (i may have to dig around in my own arms bc my veins are the size of dental floss, but ill be damned if i do it to others) bc usually if they arent dehydrated, i can hit ANYONE with like a 90% success rate on the first 2 tries.

But anyway if i cant i always suggest a try at their breast. No creep lol i mean yeah i like seeing and touching tits but this is business, and im a professional when it comes to hitting someone else. But they are great veins all over and they seem to be big enough to not immediately scar shut like mine do. I swear some spots quit after just one shot. I understand how dumb shooting sub strips and meth is forbyour veins, but damn!

So anyway give that little trick a try even if you don't think you need it because it's still a wonderful too old to have and know how to use... I hope you and your boobies have a wonderful day LOL but I'll leave the other questions and stuff some other folks to answer that probably no infinitely more about the subject than I do.

I decided to Iv it and the rush was great and kept wanting more so I would keep shooting every hour or so not knowing that's crazy but no one told me. I have a pretty extensive drug history but opiates are my first choice. Ironically I have add and take adderall daily but anyway I'm getting off topic I wanted to ask a few questions but I have not been able to find them in other forums.

How is it I put all that effort into writing that reply just the look and see that it was a post from 2012 LOL. Hell I'm sure by now you're either a professional, in jail or rehab, completely sober, or at least figured out the answers to all your questions and gotten plenty of practice with that left hand LOL. But anyway I just had to reply again to point out that it's been 1 and 1/2 decades since you asked that question LMAO![🤣](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f923.png)
