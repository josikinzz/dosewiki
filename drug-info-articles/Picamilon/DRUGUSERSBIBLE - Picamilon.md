## Subjective Experience

First developed in 1969, this is another chemical which is sold as a prescription drug
in Russia. It is used as an anxiolytic, but does have a following for its nootropic
properties.

Dose was difficult to pitch, but at 80mg I did feel an effect. This was a slight uplift,
and minor change of headspace. However, this was minimal, making it impossible to
document any further delineation.

There are a number of enthusiastic reports dotted around the Internet, many of
which compare it to phenibut, and discuss its merits with respect to inclusion in a
stack. As a one-off recreational drug, however, it has never gained significant
traction.

Like phenibut, it could be worth pursuing further research at a later date.
