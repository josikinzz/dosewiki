DESCRIPTION #
 
Hydrocodone is a semisynthetic narcotic analgesic and antitussive with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of codeine. Most of these involve the central nervous system and smooth muscle. The precise mechanism of action of hydrocodone and other opiates is not known, although it is believed to relate to the existance of opiate receptors in the central nervous system. In addition to analgesia, narcotics may produce drowsiness, changes in mood and mental clouding.

Hydrocodone Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
 
Hydrocodone is most commonly sold as "Vicodin", produced by Knoll Laboratories. Each tablet contains both hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen/paracetamol. It comes in tablet form and is taken orally. Vicodin tablets come in three different strengths ( [see image](https://erowid.org/pharms/show_image.php?i=hydrocodone/vicodin_tablet1.jpg) ). Starting in late 2012, Vicodin brand reforumulated their hydrocodone containing tablets to lower the amount of acetaminophen in each tablet to 300mg, reducing the risk of injury or death from liver damage.

**Onset : 30-90 minutes (depending on stomach contents) Duration : Normal After Effects :**
 
 Acetaminophen/paracetamol can cause liver problems at high doses. It may not be safe for heavy alcohol drinkers or those with liver problems to take more than 2 or 3 Vicodin tablets at one time. Some people take more than this recreationally, but it is generally not a good idea.

**Hydrocodone (Vicodin) Health Concerns** 
 **by Erowid** 
 
 
*** Every individual reacts differently to every substance. * Be mindful at every step. * Know your body. Know your mind. Know your source.** **Respiratory Depression:** 
 At high doses or in sensitive patients, hydrocodone may produce dose-related respiratory depression by acting directly on the brain stem respiratory center. Hydrocodone also affects the center that controls respiratory rhythm, and may produce irregular and periodic breathing. 
 
 **Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure:** 
 The respiratory depressant effects of narcotics and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure. Furthermore, narcotics produce adverse reactions which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries. 
 
 **Acute Abdominal Conditions:** 
 The administration of narcotics may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions. 
 
 **Drug Interactions:** 
 Be careful when combining hydrocodone with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, narcotics, antihistamines, antipsychotics, and anti-anxiety agents. The use of MAO inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants with hydrocodone preparations may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone.

Hydrocodone (Vicodin)
 
Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Hydrocodone**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Scheduled
- SCHEDULE: Schedule II
- CLASSIFICATION: Opiate
 
Hydrocodone and any products which contain it are Schedule II in the United States. This means they are illegal to sell without a DEA license and illegal to buy or possess without a license or prescription. 
 
 Prior to October 6, 2014, products containing less than 15 mg hydrocodone per dosage unit were Schedule III in the United States. Almost all prescription hydrocodone was prescribed in Schedule III dose units (e.g. Vicodin). In 2013, an FDA advisory panel recommending moving these Schedule III preparations into Schedule II at the DEA's request. Further, a group of US congresspeople pressured the FDA to follow that recommendation, and the change in schedule took effect the following year. See [the DEA ruling](http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/rules/2014/fr0822.htm) , [the FDA commentary](http://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2014/10/re-scheduling-prescription-hydrocodone-combination-drug-products-an-important-step-toward-controlling-misuse-and-abuse/) , and [. Schedule II drug prescriptions may only be refilled with a written prescription.](https://www.pharmacist.com/hydrocodone-moved-schedule-ii-dea-final-rule)
 
U.S. STATE LAW #
 
While most state laws are consistent with the federal scheduling system, they can and do vary from state to state. As most prosecutions happen at the state level it is important to be familiar with your [state](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/law_states.shtml) and local laws.
 
INTERNATIONAL LAW #
 
Canada #
 
Although there are many rumors stating that products containing hydrocodone may be purchased over-the-counter in Canada, it appears that Hydrocodone is a [Schedule I drug in Canada](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/law_canada.shtml) , requiring a prescription.
 
China (Macau) #
 
We have heard that products containing hydrocodone (such as Vicodin) can be purchased over-the-counter in Macau.
 
Colombia #
 
One visitor reported that tramadal, codeine with acetaminophen, hydrocodone with ibuprofen (5/200), and dihydrocodeine by itself can be purchased in Colombia over the counter in any drug store. (unconfirmed) (thanks p) (last updated Jun 12 2013)
 
Germany #
 
Hydrocodone is BTM Anlage 3 in Germany making it illegal to possess without a BTM prescription. (unconfirmed) (thanks PM)
 
Italy #
 
Although one contributor told us hydrocodone is available over-the-counter, this may be incorrect. We have also been told by more than one submitter that it is available only behind the counter, where a pharmacist can choose whether or not to dispense it if there is no prescription. (unconfirmed) (thanks N, J)
 
Mexico #
 
Prescription only. Although there are rumors that products containing hydrocodone may be purchased over-the-counter in Mexico, we have been unable to verify these rumors, instead finding that hydrocodone is either available only by prescription or perhaps not available at all, even with a prescription. Lortab, Vicodin, etc are reportedly widely available on the black market (last updated Jan 2004).
 
Netherlands #
 
Hydrocodone is Schedule I and thus prescription-only in the Netherlands. This makes it illegal to possess without a prescription or license. See [http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0014405/geldigheidsdatum_13-05-2013](http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0014405/geldigheidsdatum_13-05-2013) (thanks r) (last updated May 13, 2013)
 
Thailand #
 
We have been told that hydrocodone is not available over-the-counter or by prescription in Thailand. (unconfirmed) (thanks M)
 
U.K. #
 
Hydrocodone is [Schedule II/Class A](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/uk/uk_law_definitions.shtml) in the U.K., making it illegal to buy or possess without a prescription.
