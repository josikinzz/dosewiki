## Subjective Experience

Plant materials infused with AM-694 appeared on the market shortly after the
demise of the original spice (typically JWH-018 and JWH-073), circa 2010.

I sampled two such brands, and contrary to the usual flow of synthetic cannabinoid
development, which is to create stronger and stronger compounds, I found these to
be weaker and more benign.

They were psychoactive, certainly, but there was less of a punch. That isn’t to say that
they were necessarily inferior, but were instead, less intense on initial consumption.

I should note that I didn’t redose with this or any other synthetic cannabinoid. My
modus operandi was to toke the material once and once only, rather than to top-up
over a prolonged period.

Finally, some recent reports suggest that AM-694 may metabolise into the highly
toxic fluoroacetic acid when consumed orally. This RoA should therefore be strictly
avoided.
