**25C-NBOMe can be fatal at heavy doses (as low as 4mg).^[1] It is strongly discouraged to take large amounts of this substance or to snort it.**

*25C-NBOMe* or *2C-C-NBOMe* is a serotonergic N-benzyl derivative of the substituted phenethylamine psychedelic known as 2C-C.

It has nearly no history of human use prior to 2010 when it first became popular due its ease of purchase from online research chemical vendors.

25C-NBOMe was discovered in 2003 by Ralf Heim at the Free University of Berlin, it differs from 2C-C structurally through a substitution on the amine (NH2) with a 2-methoxybenzyl (BOMe) group as shown in the image above. This change in structure results in roughly a sixteen fold increase in potency when compared to 2C-C, allowing even the most extreme of dosages to fit in liquid form onto tabs and blotter paper (which people often mistake for LSD).

There are, however, methods of differentiating between LSD and adulterants like 25-C-NBOMe with and without test kits.

For example, one of the key differences between 25C-NBOMe and LSD is that this substance is only active when taken through a sublingual or insufflated route. This means that in order to get the full effects, 25C-NBOMe blotter paper must be lightly chewed on within the mouth for 10 - 20 minutes and never immediately swallowed.

Insufflation, however, is not recommended due to the amount of people who have suffered through dangerous and often fatal overdoses due to this route of administration.

The 25C-NBOMe experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical effects:**

The physical effects of 25C-NBOMe can be broken down into six components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:**
**

- **Sublingual numbing** - assuming the substance has been taken sublingually, the very first physical effect which a person will notice immediately after sublingual absorption is a strong, unpleasant metallic chemical taste. This is accompanied by a very obvious feeling of general numbness of the tongue and mouth which can stay for up to an hour after the blotter paper has been consumed. This is the key difference when it comes to determining whether your blotter paper contains LSD or one of the NBOMe series.
- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - the body high itself can be described as a generally mild, all-encompassing, soft but euphoric tingling sensation. This tingling sensation is also accompanied by spontaneous rushes of euphoria that become longer and more drawn out proportional to the dosage consumed.
- **Decreased bodily weight** - in terms of the body’s perceived weight, this substance consistently leaves people feeling extremely light, often to the point of total weightlessness.
- **Stimulation** - in terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, 25C-NBOMe is usually considered to be energetic and stimulating, but it can be considered less stimulating when compared to 25I-NBOMe. For most people, this substance induces a unique type of physical stimulation which can be described as feeling extremely energetic but in a way which does not force the tripper to move unless they genuinely choose to do so. For others however, the stimulation can be quite uncontrollable, occasionally resulting in bodily shakes and a grinding of the teeth comparable to that of MDMA and traditional stimulants such as amphetamine, but this is manifested much less consistently when compared to 25I-NBOMe
- **Vasoconstriction** - it is worth noting that an undetermined percentage of people who experiment with this drug will experience negative physical side effects, such as a temporary difficulty in urinating and vasoconstriction. This is defined as the narrowing of the blood vessels resulting from contraction of the muscular wall of the vessels and is triggered through the way in which 25I-NBOMe’s target receptor (5-HT2A) modulates both vasoconstriction and vasodilation among its many other functions.
- **Nausea** - as the tripper begins to come up, nausea is not uncommon and can sometimes result in initial vomiting, but passes once this has either happened or the trip begins to fully set in. In comparison to other psychedelics such as psilocin, LSD, 2C-E and 2C-I, this could actually be very considered very mild in its intensity.

**Cognitive effects:**

The head space of 25C-NBOMe is described by many as remarkably light and underwhelming in comparison to the classical psychedelics. It is not uncommon for people to report feeling that their thought stream has maintained general normality in its specific style throughout low to moderate dosages. At high dosages, however, mild to overwhelming cognitive alterations become present; this dosage seems to be lower in proportion to physical effects when compared to 25I-NBOMe.
The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include:

- **Introspection** - this component is consistently manifested only in the context of a non-social setting in which the user is alone.
- **Increased empathy, love and sociability** - the entactogenic effects range from mild to powerful, but are inconsistently manifested. Entactogenic effects for people who try this substance usually become prominent in the presence of others. These feelings of increased sociability, love and empathy do not seem to be quite as strong or profound as those found within other entactogens (such as MDMA, 2C-B and AMT)
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Time distortion**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Connectivity of thought**
- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Removal of cultural filter**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**

**Visual effects:**

*Enhancements*

25C-NBOMe presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally include:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

The visual distortions and alterations which are experienced are detailed below:

- **Visual drifting** (*melting, flowing, breathing and morphing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in their appearance and unrealistic/cartoon like in style.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition** - In comparison to other psychedelics such as LSD or psilocin, this particular visual alteration is significantly more basic and less intricate in style but still distinctively present and seems more intricate in comparison to 25I-NBOMe.

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip is often described as very similar in appearance to that of LSD. They can be comprehensively described as algorithmic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, fine and zoomed out in detail, fast and smooth in motion, structured in shape, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, sharp around the edges and mostly rounded across their corners. In comparison to other more commonly used psychedelics, they can be described as significantly more intricate than the visual geometry found within 2C-I and most of the 2C-x family in general as well as completely on par with LSD, psilocin and DMT at appropriately high dosages (which seem lower in proportion to the accompanying physical effects when compared to that of 25I-NBOMe).

In terms of their behaviour, 25C-NBOMe’s geometry leads onto Level 7A visual geometry with Level 7B remaining so far unconfirmed within this substance. They also seem to consistently build up in visual intensity when the tripper stares at a central point. This eventually envelops the visual field and creates the sensation that the tripper has broken through into a continuously shifting geometric landscape or structure with a vast sense of immersive physical size attributed to it.

*Hallucinatory states*

25C-NBOMe is capable of producing a full range of hallucinatory states within the level 1 - 3 range extremely consistently. However, level 4 hallucinatory breakthroughs are reported but very uncommon and inconsistent in comparison to other more commonly used psychedelics such as psilocin, 2C-E and DMT. This can be considered as on par with and identical in behaviour to that of LSD and 25I-NBOMe.
These effects include:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - this particular effect commonly contains hallucinations within scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of 25C-NBOMe are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly includes:

- **Enhancements**
- **Distortions**
- **Hallucinations**

**Health effects, addiction potential and tolerance:**

25C-NBOMe is a very new substance and little is known about its pharmacological or behavioural risks. The LD50 is not known. Some deaths have been attributed to 25C-NBOMe overdose caused by improper handling and uneducated use of this substance. Its recent widespread use suggests that death is primarily caused from overdoses and not from ordinary doses, particularly from insufflation.

The fact that 25C-NBOMe is active in the microgram range is likely a contributing factor since this makes measuring doses significantly more difficult.

It’s worth noting that although many 5-HT2A agonists have documented safety, none of these have been full agonists so their safety data cannot be applied to 25C-NBOMe.

In terms of its addictive potential, 25C-NBOMe has not been studied formally but due to its immediate tolerance build up which lasts up to 2 - 3 weeks after the experience, it is essentially impossible to use this substance compulsively.

**Legal Issues:**

- **UK:** The 25x-NBOMe series is under a temporary class drug order, lasting one year from 10th June 2013.
- **USA:** On Nov 15, 2013, the DEA added 25C-NBOMe to Schedule I using their emergency scheduling powers, making it “temporarily” in Schedule I for 2 years

**Conclusion:**

The subjective effects breakdown contained within this article was written and contributed by the PsychonautWiki admin known as [cocoanatta](http://encyclopediapsychonautica.org/index.php?title=User:Cocoanatta).

As for the substance itself, 25C-NBOMe  and the NBOMe series as a whole are an extremely interesting set of psychedelics but do not quite compare in terms of hallucinatory and cognitive depth if you have access to classical psychedelics such as genuine LSD, DMT and psilocin.
