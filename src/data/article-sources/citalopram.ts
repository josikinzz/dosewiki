## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenylbutylamines. These are compounds containing a phenylbutylamine moiety, which consists of a phenyl group substituted at the fourth carbon by an butan-1-amine.

### Background

Citalopram is an antidepressant belonging to the class of selective
serotonin-reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs) widely used to treat the symptoms of depression. It is a racemic bicyclic phthalate derivate and is the only compound with a tertiary amine and 2 nitrogen-containing metabolites among all SSRIs.
12
,
13
Citalopram enhances serotonergic transmission through the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, and among all the SSRIs, citalopram appears to be the most selective toward serotonin reuptake inhibition.
12
,
13
Specifically, it has a very minimal effect on dopamine and norepinephrine transportation and virtually no affinity for muscarinic, histaminergic, or GABAergic receptors.
12
Citalopram was approved by the FDA in 1998 for the treatment of depression in adults 18 years or older.
18

### Indication

Citalopram is approved by the FDA for treating adults with major depressive disorder.
19
It has also been used off-label to treat various diseases, including but not limited to sexual dysfunction, ethanol abuse, psychiatric conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and diabetic neuropathy.

### Pharmacodynamics

Citalopram belongs to a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It has been found to relieve or manage symptoms of depression, anxiety, eating disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder among other mood disorders. The antidepressant, anti-anxiety, and other actions of citalopram are linked to its inhibition of CNS central uptake of serotonin.
19
Serotonergic abnormalities have been reported in patients with mood disorders. Behavioral and neuropsychological effects of serotonin include the regulation of mood, perception, reward, anger, aggression, appetite, memory, sexuality, and attention, as examples. The onset of action for depression is approximately 1 to 4 weeks. The complete response may take 8-12 weeks after initiation of citalopram.
16
In vitro
studies demonstrate that citalopram is a strong and selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine central reuptake. The chronic administration of citalopram has been shown to downregulate central norepinephrine receptors, similar to other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Citalopram does not inhibit monoamine oxidase.

### Mechanism of Action

Sodium-dependent serotonin transporter
Inhibitor

### Absorption

The single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 40 mg/day. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.
19
Following a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food.
19

### Metabolism

Citalopram is metabolized mainly in the liver via
N
-demethylation to its main metabolite,
demethylcitalopram
by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4.
5
,
8
,
19
Other metabolites include
didemethylcitalopram
via CYP2D6 metabolism,
citalopram
N
-oxide
and propionic acid derivative via monoamine oxidase enzymes A and B and aldehyde oxidase.
5
,
19
Citalopram metabolites exert little pharmacologic activity in comparison to the parent drug and are not likely to contribute to the clinical effect of citalopram.

### Toxicity

Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage.
19
Available data from published epidemiologic studies and postmarketing reports with citalopram use in pregnancy have not established an increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies demonstrated that citalopram levels in both cord blood and amniotic fluid are similar to those observed in maternal serum. There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including citalopram, during pregnancy. There also are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy.
19
Citalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 32, 56, and 112 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 8, 14, and 27 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, based on mg/m2 body surface area. Citalopram caused maternal toxicity of CNS clinical signs and decreased weight gain at 112 mg/kg/day, which is 27 times the MRHD. At this maternally toxic dose, citalopram decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and increased fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 56 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times the MRHD.
19
Citalopram was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m2 body surface area. No maternal or embryofetal toxicity was observed. The NOAEL for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD.
19
Citalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during late gestation and lactation periods at doses of 4.8, 12.8, and 32 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 1, 3, and 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m2 body surface area. Citalopram increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days of birth and decreased offspring growth at 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 12.8 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD. In a separate study, similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses ≥ 24 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the MRHD. A NOAEL was not determined in that study.
19
SSRIs, including citalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients,
who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction.
19
The following have been reported with citalopram tablet overdosage:
• Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.
19
• Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. Hypertension is most commonly seen, but hypotension can rarely be seen alone or with co‐ingestants including alcohol.
19
• Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other pro-serotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).
19
Prolonged cardiac monitoring is recommended in citalopram overdosage ingestions due to the arrhythmia risk. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a citalopram overdose. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1‐800‐221‐2222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.
19
Citalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established. Citalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up to 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m2 body surface area.
19
Citalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.
19
Citalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses ≥ 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased to 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.

### Mechanism of action

The mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT), potentially through the inhibition of the serotonin transporter (solute carrier family 6 member 4,
SLC6A4
).

Citalopram, sold under the brand name Celexa among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. It is used to treat major depressive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and social phobia. The antidepressant effects may take one to four weeks to occur. It is typically taken orally (swallowed by mouth). In some European countries, it is sometimes given intravenously (injected into a vein) to initiate treatment, before switching to the oral route of administration for continuation of treatment. It has also been used intravenously in other parts of the world in some other circumstances.
Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping, sexual problems, shakiness, feeling tired, and sweating. Serious side effects include an increased risk of suicide in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, glaucoma, and QT prolongation. It should not be used in persons who take or have recently taken an MAO inhibitor. There are concerns that use during pregnancy may harm the fetus.
Citalopram was approved for medical use in the United States in 1998. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2023, it was the 43rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 14 million prescriptions.

## Medical uses

### Depression

In the United States, citalopram is approved to treat major depressive disorder. Citalopram appears to have comparable efficacy and superior tolerability relative to other antidepressants. In the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ranking of ten antidepressants for efficacy and cost-effectiveness, citalopram is fifth in effectiveness (after mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline) and fourth in cost-effectiveness. 
Evidence for the effectiveness of citalopram for treating depression in children is uncertain.

### Panic disorder

Citalopram is licensed in the UK and other European countries for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia.

### Other

Citalopram may be used off-label to treat anxiety, and dysthymia, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, and obsessive–compulsive disorder.
It appears to be as effective as fluvoxamine and paroxetine in obsessive–compulsive disorder. Some data suggest the effectiveness of intravenous infusion of citalopram in resistant OCD. Citalopram is well tolerated and as effective as moclobemide in social anxiety disorder. There are studies suggesting that citalopram can be useful in reducing aggressive and impulsive behavior. It appears to be superior to placebo for behavioural disturbances associated with dementia. It has also been used successfully for hypersexuality in early Alzheimer's disease.
A meta-analysis, including studies with fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, and citalopram versus placebo, showed SSRIs to be effective in reducing symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, whether taken continuously or just in the luteal phase. For alcoholism, citalopram has produced a modest reduction alcohol intake and increase in drink-free days in studies of alcoholics, possibly by decreasing desire or reducing the reward.
While on its own citalopram is less effective than amitriptyline in the prevention of migraines, in refractory cases, combination therapy may be more effective.
Citalopram and other SSRIs can be used to treat hot flashes.
A 2009 multisite randomized controlled study found no benefit and some adverse effects in autistic children from citalopram, raising doubts about whether SSRIs are effective for treating repetitive behavior in children with autism.
Some research suggests citalopram interacts with cannabinoid protein-couplings in the rat brain, and this is put forward as a potential cause of some of the drug's antidepressant effects.

## Administration

Citalopram is typically taken in one dose, either in the morning or evening. It can be taken with or without food. Its absorption does not increase when taken with food, but doing so can help prevent nausea. Nausea is often caused when the 5-HT3 receptors actively absorb free serotonin, as this receptor is present within the digestive tract.

## Adverse effects

Citalopram theoretically causes side effects by increasing the concentration of serotonin in other parts of the body (e.g., the intestines). Other side effects, such as increased apathy and emotional flattening, may be caused by the decrease in dopamine release associated with increased serotonin. Citalopram is also a mild antihistamine, which may be responsible for some of its sedating properties.
Other common side effects of citalopram include drowsiness, insomnia, nausea, weight changes (usually weight gain), increase in appetite, vivid dreaming, frequent urination, dry mouth, increased sweating, trembling, diarrhea, excessive yawning, severe tinnitus, and fatigue. Less common side effects include bruxism, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmia, blood pressure changes, dilated pupils, anxiety, mood swings, headache, hyperactivity and dizziness. Rare side effects include convulsions, hallucinations, severe allergic reactions and photosensitivity. If sedation occurs, the dose may be taken at bedtime rather than in the morning. Some data suggest citalopram may cause nightmares. Citalopram is associated with a higher risk of arrhythmia than other SSRIs.
Citalopram and other SSRIs can induce a mixed state, especially in those with undiagnosed bipolar disorder.
According to an article published in 2020, one of the other rare side effects of Citalopram could be triggering visual snow syndrome; which does not resolve after the discontinuation of the medicine.

### Sexual dysfunction

Sexual dysfunction is often a side effect of SSRIs. Some people experience persistent sexual side effects when taking SSRIs or after discontinuing them. Symptoms of medication-induced sexual dysfunction from antidepressants include difficulty with orgasm, erection, or ejaculation. Other symptoms may be genital anesthesia, anhedonia, decreased libido, vaginal lubrication issues, and nipple insensitivity in women. Rates are unknown, and there is no established treatment.

### Abnormal heart rhythm

In August 2011, the FDA announced, "Citalopram causes dose-dependent QT interval prolongation. Citalopram should no longer be prescribed at doses greater than 40 mg per day". A further clarification, issued in March 2012, restricted the maximum dose to 20 mg for subgroups of patients, including those older than 60 years and those taking an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C19.7.

### Endocrine effects

As with other SSRIs, citalopram can cause an increase in serum prolactin level.
Citalopram has no significant effect on insulin sensitivity in women of reproductive age and no changes in glycaemic control were seen in another trial.

### Exposure in pregnancy

Antidepressant exposure (including citalopram) during pregnancy is associated with shorter duration of gestation (by three days), increased risk of preterm delivery (by 55%), lower birth weight (by 75 g), and lower Apgar scores (by <0.4 points). Antidepressant exposure is not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. It is uncertain whether there is an increased prevalence of septal heart defects among children whose mothers were prescribed an SSRI in early pregnancy.

### Overdose

Overdosage may result in vomiting, sedation, disturbances in heart rhythm, dizziness, sweating, nausea, tremors, and rarely amnesia, confusion, coma, or convulsions. Overdose deaths have occurred, sometimes involving other drugs, but also with citalopram as the sole agent. Citalopram and N-desmethylcitalopram may be quantified in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma citalopram concentrations are usually in a range of 50-400 μg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 1000–3000 μg/L in patients who survive acute overdosage, and 3–30 mg/L in those who do not survive. It is the most dangerous of SSRIs in overdose.

### Suicidality

In the United States, citalopram carries a boxed warning stating it may increase suicidal thinking and behavior in those under age 24.

### Discontinuation syndrome

SSRI discontinuation syndrome has been reported when treatment is stopped. It includes sensory, and gastrointestinal symptoms, dizziness, lethargy, and sleep disturbances, as well as psychological symptoms such as anxiety/agitation, irritability, and poor concentration.  Electric shock-like sensations are typical for SSRI discontinuation. Withdrawal symptoms can occur when this medicine is suddenly stopped, such as paraesthesiae, sleeping problems (difficulty sleeping and intense dreams), feeling dizzy, agitated or anxious, nausea, vomiting, tremors, confusion, sweating, headache, diarrhea, palpitations, changes in emotions, irritability, and eye or eyesight problems. Treatment with citalopram should be reduced gradually when treatment is finished.

## Interactions

### Serotonin syndrome

Citalopram should not be taken with St John's wort, tryptophan or 5-HTP as the resulting drug interaction could lead to serotonin syndrome. With St John's wort, this may be caused by compounds in the plant extract reducing the efficacy of the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes that process citalopram. Tryptophan and 5-HTP are precursors to serotonin. When taken with an SSRI, such as citalopram, this can lead to levels of serotonin that can be lethal. This may also be the case when SSRIs are taken with SRAs (serotonin releasing agents) such as in the case of MDMA. It is possible that SSRIs could reduce the effects associated with an SRA since SSRIs stop the reuptake of Serotonin by blocking SERT. This would allow less serotonin in and out of the transporters, thus decreasing the likelihood of neurotoxic effects. However, these concerns are still disputed as the exact pharmacodynamic effects of citalopram and MDMA have yet to be fully identified. Citalopram is contraindicated in individuals taking MAOIs, owing to a potential for serotonin syndrome.

### Other interactions

SSRIs, including citalopram, can increase the risk of bleeding, especially when coupled with aspirin, NSAIDs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants. Taking citalopram with omeprazole may cause higher blood levels of citalopram. This is a potentially dangerous interaction, so dosage adjustments may be needed or alternatives may be prescribed.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Citalopram contains two pharmacodynamically distinct enantiomers: (S)-citalopram (escitalopram) and (R)-citalopram. (S)-citalopram is a highly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and is thought to be responsible for most of the SRI activity of citalopram. (R)-citalopram, by comparison, is a 20-fold less potent SERT inhibitor and antagonizes the actions of (S)-citalopram at this site. The mechanism of antagonism is uncertain, but may involve kinetic interactions between the two; it has been proposed that the long-lasting inhibited state of SERT induced by (S)-citalopram may be attenuated by (R)-citalopram binding. 
Citalopram has a ~6-fold higher affinity for H1 histamine receptors than (S)-citalopram (Ki = 257nM vs 1500nM), though the clinical significance of this difference is unknown. Both citalopram and escitalopram have similar affinities for the σ1 receptor (Ki = 50nM).

### Pharmacokinetics

Citalopram is considered safe and well tolerated in the therapeutic dose range. Distinct from some other agents in its class, it exhibits linear pharmacokinetics and minimal drug interaction potential, making it a better choice for the elderly or comorbid patients.

## Stereochemistry

Citalopram has one stereocenter, to which a 4-fluoro phenyl group and an N, N-dimethyl-3-aminopropyl group bind. As a result of this chirality, the molecule exists in (two) enantiomeric forms (mirror images). They are termed S-(+)-citalopram and R-(–)-citalopram.

Citalopram is sold as a racemic mixture, consisting of 50% (R)-(−)-citalopram and 50% (S)-(+)-citalopram. Only the (S)-(+) enantiomer has the desired antidepressant effect. Lundbeck now markets the (S)-(+) enantiomer, the generic name of which is escitalopram. Whereas citalopram is supplied as the hydrobromide, escitalopram is sold as the oxalate salt (hydrooxalate). In both cases, the salt forms of the amine make these otherwise lipophilic compounds water-soluble.

## Metabolism

Citalopram is metabolized in the liver mostly by CYP2C19, but also by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Metabolites desmethylcitalopram and didesmethylcitalopram are significantly less energetic and their contribution to the overall action of citalopram is negligible. The half-life of citalopram is about 35 hours. Approximately 80% is cleared by the liver and 20% by the kidneys. The elimination process is slower in the elderly and in patients with liver or kidney failure. With once-daily dosing, steady plasma concentrations are achieved in about a week. Potent inhibitors of CYP2C19 and 3A4 might decrease citalopram clearance.
Tobacco smoke exposure was found to inhibit the biotransformation of citalopram in animals, suggesting that the elimination rate of citalopram is decreased after tobacco smoke exposure. After intragastric administration, the half-life of the racemic mixture of citalopram was increased by about 287%.

## History

Citalopram was first synthesized in 1972 by chemist Klaus Bøgesø and his research group at the pharmaceutical company Lundbeck and was first marketed in 1989 in Denmark. It was first marketed in the US in 1998. The original patent expired in 2003, allowing other companies to legally produce and market generic versions.

## Society and culture

### Brand names

Citalopram is sold under these brand names:

### European Commission fine

On 19 June 2013, the European Commission imposed a fine of €93.8 million on the Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck, plus a total of €52.2 million on several generic pharmaceutical-producing companies. This was in response to Lundbeck entering an agreement with the companies to delay their sales of generic citalopram after Lundbeck's patent on the drug had expired, thus reducing competition in breach of European antitrust law.

## Other uses

Citalopram is also a parasiticide. Schistosomula have high mortality when treated with citalopram.
