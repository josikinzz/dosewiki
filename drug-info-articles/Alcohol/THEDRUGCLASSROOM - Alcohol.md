# Alcohol (Ethanol)
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/alcohol-ethanol/*

Ethanol, usually called alcohol, is the most popular recreational drug in the world. It provides general depressant, anxiolytic, and euphoriant effects. In most countries, it can be used legally, at least by adults.

Alcohol is unique in that it has been used on a large scale for thousands of years. There is evidence of alcohol use in many parts of the world dating back millennia.

At low-common doses, it causes reduced inhibition, mood lift, euphoria, increased sociability, and anxiolysis. But, at high doses, it can lead to blackouts and death, though the lethal dose is well beyond what people normally consume.
