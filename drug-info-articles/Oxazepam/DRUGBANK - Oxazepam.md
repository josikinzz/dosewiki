## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 1,4-benzodiazepines. These are organic compounds containing a benzene ring fused to a 1,4-azepine.

### Background

Oxazepam is an intermediate-acting, 3-hydroxybenzodiazepine used in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal and anxiety disorders. Oxazepam, like related 3-hydroxybenzodiazepine
lorazepam
, is considered less susceptible to pharmacokinetic variability based on patient-specific factors (e.g. age, liver disease) - this feature is advantageous as compared to other benzodiazepines, and is likely owing in part to oxazepam's relatively simple metabolism.
11
It is an active metabolite of both
diazepam
and
temazepam
12
and undergoes very little biotransformation following absorption, making it unlikely to participate in pharmacokinetic interactions.
14

### Indication

Oxazepam is indicated for the management of anxiety disorders and for the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety.
14
It may also be used in the management of alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
14

### Pharmacodynamics

Benzodiazepines, including oxazepam, exert their sedative and anxiolytic effects by potentiating the effects of endogenous GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS.
10
Compared to other benzodiazepines, it has relatively low potency and a moderate duration of action.
10
Oxazepam should be administered with caution to patients for whom a drop in blood pressure may lead to cardiac complications as, in rare cases, it may cause hypotension.
14

### Mechanism of Action

GABA(A) Receptor
Positive allosteric modulator
GABA(A) Receptor Benzodiazepine Binding Site
Ligand

### Absorption

Following oral administration, peak plasma levels (C
max
) averaged 450 mg/mL and occurred approximately 3 hours (T
max
) after dosing.
14

### Metabolism

Oxazepam has a single major inactive metabolite, a glucuronide conjugate.
14
The glucuronidation of the S-isomer is catalyzed by UGT2B15. The glucuronidation of the R-isomer is catalyzed by UGT2B7 and UGT1A9.

### Half-life

The mean elimination half-life of oxazepam is 8.2 hours.
14

### Toxicity

The oral LD
50
in rats and mice is >8000 mg/kg and 1540 mg/kg, respectively.
16
Symptoms of oxazepam overdose are likely to be consistent with its adverse effect profile and range from mild to severe, sometimes fatal, CNS depression.
14
Treatment should include gastric decontamination, via lavage or induced vomiting, followed by symptomatic and supportive measures. The benzodiazepine antagonist
flumazenil
may be used in hospitalized patients as an adjunct to non-pharmacological management, but may increase the risk of seizure in long-term benzodiazepine users and in cyclic antidepressant overdose.
14

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Oxazepam is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Abacavir
Oxazepam may decrease the excretion rate of Abacavir which could result in a higher serum level.
Aceclofenac
Aceclofenac may decrease the excretion rate of Oxazepam which could result in a higher serum level.
Acemetacin
Acemetacin may decrease the excretion rate of Oxazepam which could result in a higher serum level.
Acetaminophen
Acetaminophen may decrease the excretion rate of Oxazepam which could result in a higher serum level.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol. Co-administration with alcohol may potentiate the CNS effects of oxazepam.

### Mechanism of action

Like other benzodiazepines, oxazepam exerts its anxiolytic effects by potentiating the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on GABA(A) receptors, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the mammalian brain.
8
GABA(A) receptors are a component of GABA-gated ionotropic chloride channels that produce inhibitory postsynaptic potentials - following activation by GABA, the channel undergoes a conformational change that allows the passage of chloride ions through the channel. The inhibitory potentials produced by GABA neurotransmission play an integral role in the suppression and control of epileptiform nerve firing such as that seen in epilepsy, which makes the GABA system a desirable target in the treatment of epilepsy.
Benzodiazepines are positive allosteric modulators of GABA(A) function. They bind to the interface between alpha (α) and gamma (γ) subunits on the receptor, commonly referred to as the benzodiazepine binding site, and modulate the receptor such that its inhibitory response to GABA binding is dramatically increased.

### Protein binding

likely to albumin.

### Route of elimination

Oxazepam is primarily eliminated in the urine as its glucuronide metabolite, with the feces containing approximately 21% of the unchanged drug.
15
The majority of an orally ingested dose of oxazepam is excreted within 48 hours.

### Curator comments

Benzodiazepines modulate GABA(A) function by binding at the interface between alpha (α) and gamma (γ) subunits. Of the 6 α-subunits, only 4 (α-1, -2, -3, and -5) participate in the formation of this binding site. The above target is a collection of all α- and γ-subunits that are known to participate in the formation of the benzodiazepine binding site.

### General Function

Binds water, Ca(2+), Na(+), K(+), fatty acids, hormones, bilirubin and drugs (Probable). Its main function is the regulation of the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood (Probable). Major zinc transporter in plasma, typically binds about 80% of all plasma zinc (PubMed:19021548). Major calcium and magnesium transporter in plasma, binds approximately 45% of circulating calcium and magnesium in plasma (By similarity). Potentially has more than two calcium-binding sites and might additionally bind calcium in a non-specific manner (By similarity). The shared binding site between zinc and calcium at residue Asp-273 suggests a crosstalk between zinc and calcium transport in the blood (By similarity). The rank order of affinity is zinc > calcium > magnesium (By similarity). Binds to the bacterial siderophore enterobactin and inhibits enterobactin-mediated iron uptake of E.coli from ferric transferrin, and may thereby limit the utilization of iron and growth of enteric bacteria such as E.coli (PubMed:6234017). Does not prevent iron uptake by the bacterial siderophore aerobactin (PubMed:6234017)
