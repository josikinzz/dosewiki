## Subjective Experience

Entada Rheedii has a long history of use for a variety of purposes, but most notably
by indigenous tribes in Africa to communicate with ancestors (‘the spirit world’) by
inducing vivid or lucid dreams.

Entheology.com describes its traditional use thus: “...the inner meat of the seed is
either consumed directly, or chopped, dried, mixed with other herbs like tobacco,
and smoked just before bedtime” whilst the South African National Biodiversity
Institute states simply that "To induce these vivid dreams, dried seeds are powdered
and smoked in a pipe before bedtime."

Not wishing to experience the effects of tobacco or other plants, I elect to smoke it
stand-alone. I also elect to eat a small amount.

The exact source of my own supply is unknown. I purchased it from one of my usual
online vendors some years ago, but I am unable to recall which. The sealed silver
packet is clearly labelled and as I open it I find that the creamy coloured nut has been
ground into an extremely fine almost fluffy powder.

Whilst I found no indications of toxicity or related issues during research, I did find a
post referring to allergy. With this in mind I pre-test a small dab on my tongue. All is
clear.

Regarding oral dosage, one bean is frequently cited as sufficient. Given the nature of
my supply this really doesn’t help me much: how big is a nut? After deliberation I
decide to go for 1 gram.

I am in good condition, but do have a bit of a cold. For the record, I haven’t been
dreaming much recently.

At 9:30pm I weigh 1g and swill it down with water. It tastes a little odd, but not bad,
and it morphs into a sort of slimy feel as I swallow it.

I now fill the bowl of my hand bong, step outside, and take a couple of large hits. This
isn’t so terrible, but it has a sort of woody tang as I inhale. I am smoking a nut after
all, so I shouldn’t be surprised at its slightly unusual quality.

On sitting back at my desk I immediately notice a mild sort of heady strangeness and
possibly enhanced clarity of vision. I could be imagining this, as it is only a hint, but a
minor change of disposition appears to be evident. I was tired, but this seems to have
drifted into a more sedated dreamy and more pleasant sleepiness.

I retire to bed just before 10pm. On hitting the pillow I drop asleep quickly and
easily.

I awoke at 7am. Did I dream? Indeed I did.

I dreamed constantly all night, waking (with a dry mouth) on at least three distinct
occasions with dreams still spinning in my head. The dreams were lengthy, vivid and
recallable, although not necessarily pleasant. For the periods during which I was
half-awake I was aware that I was dreaming and allowed this to continue in
something of a twilight zone.

This is a genuine oneirogen; possibly the most effective I have tested to date. A
remaining question, however, is which RoA is most effective? As I used both methods
(oral and smoking) I cannot answer this, although the fact that I was still dreaming
early morning does tend to suggest oral was in play at that point.

Note that I encountered a number of sources which stated that for significant impact
it is necessary to repeat the exercise over a number of nights. My experience runs
counter to this, which is not to say that the dreams don’t become even more vivid and
lucid over subsequent occasions.
