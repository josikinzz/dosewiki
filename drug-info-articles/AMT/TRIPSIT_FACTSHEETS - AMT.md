### ⚡ Caution
- **alcohol**: aMT has a broad mechanism of action in the brain and so does alcohol so the combination can be unpredictable
- **caffeine**: High doses of caffeine may cause anxiety which is less manageable when tripping, and since both are stimulating the combination may cause some physical discomfort.
- **cannabis**: Cannabis has an unexpectedly strong and somewhat unpredictable synergy with psychedelics. Small amounts can reduce nausea with aMT but take care.
