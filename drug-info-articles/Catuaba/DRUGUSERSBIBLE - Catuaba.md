## Subjective Experience

In its native South America, catuaba has traditionally been used as an aphrodisiac
and a stimulant. However, with respect to the latter, there are occasional reports
which appear to contradict this, suggesting that it also possesses calmative and
anxiolytic properties. Regarding the former, references to this as a love plant and a
sex drink are not uncommon.

In terms of its value as a nootropic I have frequently encountered claims that it is
used to address poor memory and forgetfulness, and even that it has been used as a
treatment for Alzheimer's disease and dementia.

I should add that many reports cite daily use as the route to accentuate these effects,
an approach which is beyond my own modus operandi (largely for safety reasons).

For my original test I brewed 12g as a tea. The results were inconclusive, registering
the mildest of body/head changes. For the more rigorous re-test, I have abstained
from any other psychoactive for over a week to enable a more focused study.

The recommended dose is usually 1-2 tablespoons, with suggestions that higher
doses can leave a headache. After due consideration, I scoop two generous spoonfuls
from the transparent plastic bag, which equates to 8.2g, and steep this in a pot of hot
but not boiling water for ten minutes.

```
T+0:00 I pour the first cup and begin to slowly sip the tea. It is a pleasing
red/brown colour and tastes a little woody and slightly bitter, but is quite
palatable. [3:50pm].
```
```
T+0:10 I am on to my second cup. Perhaps a slight head change and body
warmth is emerging.
```
```
T+0:30 The tea has now been consumed. I feel warm, with a mild head buzz
within an overall calmness. There is certainly something of a simmering
background stimulation in play.
```
```
T+0:35 There is more of a feeling of being in a zone than perhaps with
caffeine, with a slight physical response in terms of a moderately raised
temperature.
```
```
T+0:45 The buzz and general comfort are still there, and I am not feeling any
of the fatigue I have endured over the last few days. In terms of a nootropic
effect, I am able to concentrate and focus, although no more so than when
using a mild functional stimulant. The claims regarding enhanced memory, of
course, are impossible to verify without formal testing.
```
```
Regarding its use as an aphrodisiac, there does seem to be something there.
Compared to amphetamine, for example, this hardly registers. Unlike
amphetamine, however, it does not seem to induce stim-dick, which probably
supports the suggestion that it can be used to alleviate this symptom if
combined with it (which is not something I recommend).
```
```
T+1:10 The mild stimulation and heady feel continues on the same level as
earlier. I should also add that I am no longer hungry, so there may be some
appetite suppression in play.
```
```
T+2:00 The effects are now slowly winding down.
```
Overall this provided a reasonably pleasant low level stimulation, with minor
aphrodisiacal properties, and some appetite suppression, whilst wrapped in a
background of gentle sedation. The only rough edge was a very minor pre-headache
type feeling which I experienced during the evening (probably due to dose), and
which persisted into a heavy headedness during sleep disturbances.

In terms of its use as a nootropic, I found that concentration was clear, but there was
nothing exceptional to note. On a single experience I cannot comment sensibly with
respect to memory and dementia.
