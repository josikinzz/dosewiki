## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenothiazines. These are polycyclic aromatic compounds containing a phenothiazine moiety, which is a linear tricyclic system that consists of a two benzene rings joined by a para-thiazine ring.

### Background

Promethazine, originally known as 3,277 R.P., is an N-dimethylaminopropyl derivative of
phenothiazine
that was developed in France in 1946.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Promethazine is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Abacavir
Abacavir may decrease the excretion rate of Promethazine which could result in a higher serum level.
Abametapir
The serum concentration of Promethazine can be increased when it is combined with Abametapir.
Abatacept
The metabolism of Promethazine can be increased when combined with Abatacept.
Abiraterone
The metabolism of Promethazine can be decreased when combined with Abiraterone.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol. Alcohol may increase the sedation caused by promethazine.

### General Function

ATP-dependent transporter of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family that actively extrudes physiological compounds and xenobiotics from cells. Transports a range of endogenous molecules that have a key role in cellular communication and signaling, including cyclic nucleotides such as cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cyclic GMP (cGMP), bile acids, steroid conjugates, urate, and prostaglandins (PubMed:11856762, PubMed:12523936, PubMed:12835412, PubMed:12883481, PubMed:15364914, PubMed:15454390, PubMed:16282361, PubMed:17959747, PubMed:18300232, PubMed:26721430). Mediates the ATP-dependent efflux of glutathione conjugates such as leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) too. The presence of GSH is necessary for the ATP-dependent transport of LTB4, whereas GSH is not required for the transport of LTC4 (PubMed:17959747). Mediates the cotransport of bile acids with reduced glutathione (GSH) (PubMed:12523936, PubMed:12883481, PubMed:16282361). Transports a wide range of drugs and their metabolites, including anticancer, antiviral and antibiotics molecules (PubMed:11856762, PubMed:12105214, PubMed:15454390, PubMed:17344354, PubMed:18300232). Confers resistance to anticancer agents such as methotrexate (PubMed:11106685)

### Specific Function

15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (NAD+) activity

### Gene Name

ABCC4

### Uniprot ID

Alongside codeine, it is popularly known as one of the active two ingredients in "lean". It acts as an [antihistamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antihistamine) .

Promethazine was developed in the mid-1940s by French chemists. Today, it is available in many countries under many brand names.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [nausea suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea_suppression) , and strong [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) . It also reduces motion sickness and has anticholinergic properties.

Promethazine has been shown to have quality [hypnotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnotic) effects and is sometimes used for this purpose.

It is highly advised to use harm reduction practices if using this substance.

## History and culture

Promethazine was developed in the mid-1940s when a team of scientists from Rhône-Poulenc laboratories was able to synthesize it from phenothiazine and a diamine side chain of diphenhydramine. It was previously used as an antipsychotic, although it is generally not administered for this purpose now. It has approximately 1/10 of the antipsychotic strength of chlorpromazine.

It became popular among the Houston rap and hip-hop scene in around 1990 , and the trend resurfaced in around 2015 to 2016. Often, it was combined with the opiate drug [codeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Codeine) in a preparation called "lean." Lean usually consists of ice, Sprite or a citrus soda, the promethazine/codeine cough syrup, and occasionally jolly ranchers for enhanced flavor.

## Chemistry

Promethazine is a phenothiazine-based compound.

## Pharmacology

Promethazine is a direct antagonist of histamine H1 receptors, whereas [diphenhydramine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diphenhydramine) is an inverse agonist. It is also an antagonist of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which is likely the cause of sedation and delirium that occurs with higher doses. It blocks dopaminergic D2 receptors, but weakly. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - Promethazine causes pronounced sedation and a general feeling of slowness, usually with the feeling of not wanting to move, this effect is normally considerably stronger than Diphenhydramine or Doxylamine and it is generally considered to be one of the most sedating antihistamines due to its high anticholinergic, H1 antagonist and weak D2 antagonist activity.
 
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)** 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - This can lead to a very pleasant feeling of the entire body relaxing, feeling like warm gel. It is similar to but distinct from an [opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) 's physical euphoria. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
 
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** and **[increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** - Anticholinergic activity at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors causes these effects.
 
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)** - This effect is exceptionally rare.
 
- **[Nausea suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea_suppression)** - Promethazine is used to treat motion sickness or nausea.
 
- **[Dry mouth](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dry_mouth)** - This is a common side effect of this substance.
 
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)** - This side effect is uncommon. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)** - Usually, promethazine acts as an [anti-anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiolytic) agent.
 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** - Promethazine can occasionaly cause paranoia and Anxiety due to delirium although it is rarer than that of Diphenhydramine, Doxylamine and chlorpheniramine.
 
- **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria)** - Usually, promethazine causes minimal euphoria normally only in anxious individuals and can even be dysphoric, however when used at low doses and combined with an opioid such as codeine, oxycodone or hydrocodone, it can effectively potentiate the euphoric effect and allow for a lower opioid dose.
 
- **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)** - This effect is mild and occurs due to the mild weak antipsycotic effect, however much weaker than that of chlorpromazine or prochlorperazine. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
 
- **[Delusions of sobriety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions)** - This is the false belief that one is perfectly sober despite obvious evidence to the contrary such as severe cognitive impairment and an inability to fully communicate with others.
 
- **[Sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)** - Feelings of physical exhaustion and tiredness are a common and pronounced effect of promethazine. The substance is therefore used to treat insomnia and abnormal sleep cycles.
 
- **[Delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium)** and **[confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion)** - In low to moderate doses, promethazine presents a harmless sense of being confused or delirious. In high doses and overdose, it can become (but rarely does) so severe that the patient or user experiences excited delirium, a state of severe agitation and confusion. ### Visual effects
 
- #### Distortions
 
- **[Depth perception distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depth_perception_distortions)** - This side effect is uncommon.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - The threshold for hallucinations on promethazine is higher than other 1st generation antihistamines like diphenhydramine and doxylamine, occurs mainly heavy doses and can be difficult to reach due to the user likely falling asleep before they can reach delirium, as promethazine is extremely sedating at high doses. It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as delirious in believability, controllable or autonomous in controllability and solid in style. The most common themes for these hallucinations include those of both everyday occurrences such as smoking phantom cigarettes, talking to people who are not there, seeing and feeling insects and immersion in sinister or nightmarish experiences.
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - Relative to other [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) , this effect occurs briefly and spontaneously at moderate doses but becomes progressively extended in its occurrence and duration proportional to dosage before eventually becoming all-encompassing. It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as delirious in believability, interactive in style, equal in new experiences and memory replays in content, autonomous in controllability and solid in style. [Internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) may occur at lighter dosages than needed to cause [external hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) and [delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_use) when using this substance.

### Lethal dosage

The lowest published toxic dose of promethazine in humans ( [oral](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Oral) ) is 3.5 mg/kg. This means that a person weighing 70 kg can show signs of toxicity at 245 mg. The [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) of promethazine in mice ( [oral](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Oral) ) is 255 mg/kg. If applied to humans, this suggests that 50% of people weighing 70 kg would die after consuming 17.85 grams of promethazine.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Promethazine is not addictive.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .* Promethazine, because of its extensive pharmacology, has many interactions. According to the interactions checker on [Drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com%7C) , promethazine is known to interact with over 1000 other prescription and OTC drugs.

- **[Depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants)** ( *[1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) , [2-methyl-2-butanol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-methyl-2-butanol) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) / [GBL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL) , [methaqualone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methaqualone) , [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids)* ) - This combination can result in dangerous or even fatal levels of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . These substances potentiate the [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) and [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) caused by one another and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. There is also an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If this occurs, users should try to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **[Anti-dopaminergics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine)** - Because promethazine also blocks dopamine receptors, other drugs and substances that do this will increase the chances of developing acute or tardive dyskinesia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, or parkinsonism. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Anticholinergics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acetylcholine)** - Promethazine with anticholinergics (or antimuscarinics) can cause increased blocking of acetylcholine, being potentially dangerous with cardiovascular effects as well as delirium. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Due to promethazine's excitatory cardiac effect, combining it with stimulants poses a risk of an abnormal heart rhythm, severe tachycardia, or a heart attack as well as other cardiovascular events.

Promethazine, sold under the brand name Phenergan among others, is a first-generation antihistamine, sedative, and antiemetic used to treat allergies, and nausea. It may also help with some symptoms associated with the common cold and may also be used for sedating people who are agitated or anxious, an effect that has led to some recreational use (especially with codeine). Promethazine is taken by mouth (oral), as a rectal suppository, or by injection into a muscle (IM).
Common side effects of promethazine include confusion and sleepiness; consumption of alcohol or other sedatives can make these symptoms worse. It is unclear if use of promethazine during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe for the fetus. Use of promethazine is not recommended in those less than two years old, due to potentially negative effects on breathing. Use of promethazine by injection into a vein is not recommended, due to potential skin damage. Promethazine is in the phenothiazine family of medications. It is also a strong anticholinergic, which produces its sedative effects. This also means high or toxic doses can act as a deliriant.
Promethazine was made in the 1940s by a team of scientists from Rhône-Poulenc laboratories. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1951. It is a generic medication and is available under many brand names globally. In 2023, it was the 230th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions; and the combination with dextromethorphan was the 252nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions.

## Medical uses

Promethazine has a variety of medical uses, including:

Sedation
In Germany, it is approved for the treatment of agitation and agitation associated with underlying psychiatric disorders with a maximum daily dose of 200 mg.
For nausea and vomiting associated with anesthesia or chemotherapy. It is commonly used postoperatively as an antiemetic. The antiemetic activity increases with increased dosing; however, side effects also increase, which often limits maximal dosing.
For moderate to severe morning sickness and hyperemesis gravidarum: In the UK, Promethazine is the drug of first choice. Promethazine is preferred during pregnancy because it is an older drug and there is more data regarding the use of it during pregnancy. Second-choice medications, which are used if Promethazine isn't tolerated or the patient cannot take it, are metoclopramide or prochlorperazine.
For allergies such as hay fever and together with other medications in anaphylaxis
To aid with symptoms of the common cold
Motion sickness, including space sickness
Hemolytic disease of the newborn
Anxiety before surgery

## Side effects

Some documented side effects include:

Tardive dyskinesia, pseudoparkinsonism, acute dystonia (effects due to dopamine D2 receptor antagonism)
Confusion in the elderly
Drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, more rarely vertigo
Known to have effects on serotonin and dopamine receptors.
Dry mouth
Nausea
Respiratory depression in patients under the age of two and those with severely compromised pulmonary function
Blurred vision, xerostomia, dry nasal passages, dilated pupils, constipation, and urinary retention. (due to its anticholinergic effects)
Chest discomfort/pressure (In children less than 2 years old)
Akathisia
Less frequent:

Cardiovascular side effects to include arrhythmias and hypotension
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
Liver damage and cholestatic jaundice
Bone marrow suppression, potentially resulting in agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia
Depression of the thermoregulatory mechanism resulting in hypothermia/hyperthermia
Rare side effects include:

Seizures
Because of the potential for more severe side effects, this drug is on the list to avoid in the elderly.  In many countries (including the US and UK), promethazine is contraindicated in children less than two years of age, and strongly cautioned against in children between two and six, due to problems with respiratory depression and sleep apnea.
Promethazine is listed as one of the drugs with the highest anticholinergic activity in a study of anticholinergic burden, including long-term cognitive impairment.

## Overdose

Promethazine in overdose can produce signs and symptoms including CNS depression, hypotension, respiratory depression, unconsciousness, and sudden death. Other reactions may include hyperreflexia, hypertonia, ataxia, athetosis, and extensor-plantar reflexes. Atypically and/or rarely, stimulation, convulsions, hyperexcitability, and nightmares may occur. Anticholinergic effects like dry mouth, dilated pupils, flushing, gastrointestinal symptoms, and delirium may occur as well. Treatment of overdose is supportive and based on symptoms.

## Pharmacology

Promethazine, a phenothiazine derivative, is structurally different from the neuroleptic phenothiazines, with similar but different effects. Despite structural differences, promethazine exhibits a strikingly similar binding profile to promazine, another phenothiazine compound. Both promethazine and promazine exhibit comparable neuroleptic potency, with a neuroleptic potency of 0.5. However, dosages used therapeutically, such as for sedation, have no antipsychotic effect. It acts primarily as a strong antagonist of the H1 receptor (antihistamine, Ki = 1.4 nM) and a moderate mACh receptor antagonist (anticholinergic), and also has weak to moderate affinity for the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, D2, and α1-adrenergic receptors, where it acts as an antagonist at all sites, as well. New studies have shown that promethazine acts as a strong non-competitive selective NMDA receptor antagonist, with an EC50 of 20 μM; which might promote sedation in addition with the strong antihistaminergic effects of the H1 receptor, but also as a weaker analgesic. It does not, however, affect the AMPA receptors.
Another notable use of promethazine is as a local anesthetic, by blockage of sodium channels.

## Chemistry

Solid promethazine hydrochloride is a white to faint-yellow,  practically odorless, crystalline powder. Slow oxidation may occur upon prolonged exposure to air, usually causing blue discoloration. Its hydrochloride salt is freely soluble in water and somewhat soluble in alcohol. Promethazine is a chiral compound, occurring as a mixture of enantiomers.

## History

Promethazine was first synthesized by a group at Rhone-Poulenc (which later became part of Sanofi) led by Paul Charpentier in the 1940s.  The team was seeking to improve on diphenhydramine; the same line of medical chemistry led to the creation of chlorpromazine.

### Recreational use

The recreational drug lean, also known as purple drank among other names, often contains a combination of promethazine with codeine-containing cold medication.

### Product liability lawsuit

In 2009, the US Supreme Court ruled on a product liability case involving promethazine.  Diana Levine, a woman with a migraine, was administered Wyeth's Phenergan via IV push.  The drug was injected improperly, resulting in gangrene and subsequent amputation of her right forearm below the elbow.  A state jury awarded her \$6 million in punitive damages.
The case was appealed to the Supreme Court on grounds of federal preemption and substantive due process.  The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' rulings, stating that "Wyeth could have unilaterally added a stronger warning about IV-push administration" without acting in opposition to federal law. In effect, this means drug manufacturers can be held liable for injuries if warnings of potential adverse effects, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), are deemed insufficient by state courts.
In September 2009, the FDA required a boxed warning be put on promethazine for injection, stating the contraindication for subcutaneous administration. The preferred administrative route is intramuscular, which reduces the risk of surrounding muscle and tissue damage.
