Althought MDPV is not specifically in the amphetamine chemical family, it works and actually is used in much the same way stimulants are used.

**Mdpv**


Well according the fonts of knowledge it lasts about 5 hours ! I find repeated dosing causes it to last much longer !

I tried it on several different occasions at different dosages at very far intervals. The end result was always the same:


4-ish hours of very light central stimulation and mood lift, slight improvement of performance, followed by two or so hours of an agitated state; followed by a WEEK of *absolute fucking depression* - on the scale of binging on meth for a weekend while redosing with E 10 times and coming down all at once. 


Repeated dosing only increases the bad effects.


Poison.

It's not good to repeatedly redose with the stuff at all. Very useful if you have one or two doses giving anything up to 8-10 hours of not needing sleep. More than that & you're into sleep deprivation until you crash

Wouldn't say light stimulation - for staying awake/waking you out of a tired state of mind I find it leaves amphetamine standing

I did not possess an accurate scale when I had some of this last. I was eyeballing what were, in retrospect, massive fucking doses.


I would be awake for 48 hours, mildly wired, and then be paranoid and sketchy for about ten days.


I was taking a shitload of GBL at the same time.

I remember reading the mdpv thread and likening it to watching a car crash - the level of idiotic dosing, irresponsible use etc. escalated faster than any initial substance appraisal I recall.

**Yes**... higher blood levels of a substance can take longer to eliminate (depending on pharmacokinetics, I believe).  MDPV is definitely one of them IME.

I noticed that myself, and find it puzzling... I get seriously compulsive with stims (including MDPV), but have never dosed in anyway resembling some of the examples I've seen - such as 1.5 grams in two days w/psychotic break.  How the hell do people reach this level of insanity?  The stuff feels VERY unpleasant when you exceed a certain dosage, like drinking about 50 cups of coffee.  And I don't see how tolerances could get that high within any reasonable timeframe (?).

IME that is a very unusual reaction, particularly from a single dose... ever gotten anything similar with cocaine or ritalin?  What you describe sounds like intolerance or hypersensitivity reaction to boosted dopamine levels.  Perhaps related to the particular areas of the brain MDPV is most active.

Im no idiot and work most thinks out but im not a scientist so just side on caution !Now what are the rules? can i pour my 250mg mdvp into 250mg solution and mix then give it  it a good shake and use my 1-4 ml pippette to measure the solution?will this give me my 1ml/1mg per dose? is that  really easy hope so!!shoud i add citric acid to preserve?


So to sum up i just want my mdvp powder to be solution so i can use my pippetta to draw out 1 on the marker and this should be around one gram yes? i plan 2 take 4ml/4l first times!!!

Your liquid titration method should be fine; I'm not sure if adding citric acid will do anything, and I'm not sure about the stability of MDPV, maybe someone else has some info on that.

It decomposes much faster in solution than as a powder,as far as I know. Ive had some for ~ 2 weeks in h2o at room temp before and noticed a slight decrease in potency

I got a free 50mg sample from a new vendor, and since I didn't have a scale, ended up eyeballing doses.  I started out with a small insufflated dose, then when that didn't do much I bumped it up to a ~10mg IV dose which felt really damn nice.  After that it was on - I ended up going through the entire 50mg sample in 6 hours, all IV except for the first 3mg bump.  This shit is the crack of the RC world.


I didn't crash that bad, got to sleep around 2am and woke up feeling refreshed with no side effects the next morning.  Guess some people are just lucky.

Does anyone know about the neurotoxicity of MDPV?


Since it contains the methylenedioxy moiety, it would be metabolized to the reactive dioxy free radical like mdma, correct? Could anyone more knowledged shed more light on this?

^ In the MDPV discussion thread in AusDD there has been talk about chronic use of MDPV causing permanent tolerance to stimulants and even LSD.


As for neurotoxicity, there was also talk about Parkinson's like symptoms with chronic use.

Well, that doesn't sound quite right then. Would it be wise to avoid all drugs containing the methylenedioxy functional group?

I just want to throw my 2c into the pool of knowledge. As an avid researcher of all chems new and exotic, I feel it his duty to add my subjective input for anything new and rare I puts into my body.


MDPV.


Never again.This has to be by far one of the worst chemicals I have ever ingested! (And I don't want to whip it out, but I have tried quite a few things...) I love stims, have had lots of fun with methylone and meph in recent times (until I way overdid the methylone that is!), and was at one point (a very long time ago) in a serious relationship with crystal.


I first insufflated 5 mgs of the brown dirt-smelling powder when the package arrived in the mail. Then I waited. And waited and waited and waited. 1.5 hours and nothing was felt, working around the house was not easier or more fun, and there was no mood lift, no extra energy, nothing.


So I, being a fan of the IV method, decided to try out this route. 2.5 mgs was dissolved in sterile water, heated and injected 1 unit at a time, (extremely slowly) with about 30 seconds in between just to be safe. When the rig was half empty, I waited a further 5 minutes before finishing it off. Then finally I felt something. It felt like I had drunk about 100 cups of coffee. I got jittery, flushed, tense, and felt stimulated, but not “good”. That lasted about half an hour, and then the panic set in. It was pretty mild but uncomfortable.


As the experience trailed off (I didn’t redose because he wanted to sleep), my legs got unbearably tired and I felt ill in the stomach. When I laid down in bed, my heart was racing and just about to jump out of my chest. Valium was needed to sleep.


Take two: the next morning before work, I dissolved another 5-6 mgs in my coffee, although I may have been a tad heavy handed. (I doubt the reliability of my scale at these micromeasurement levels.) I felt fine, a bit more awake than normal, but again, nothing extraordinary. Then I got to work, and I had the feeling that everyone was talking about me. The paranoia increased throughout the day until about 4 in the afternoon. I knew that my thoughts were paranoid delusions with no root in reality, but it was not an enjoyable day.


So far: not a work aide, not recreational, and I am doubting any benefit in physical performance, although the only time I felt OK that day was when I left the office and briskly walked around the block as I sometimes do.


Third strike: It's Saturday morning and I decide to give it one last shot. I remember being too cautious with methylone dosage in the begining and only experiencing similar, negative effects until I upped the dosage, so I decide maybe I am just underdosing. This time, I go the distance and inject 10 mgs. IV. And... OK; I'm done with this shit! Immediately tense muscles, paranoia to the extreme, sick stomach, jittery, nervous, uncomfortable, and yet, still nothing positive. The best part about my MDPV experiences every time was when it wore off.


And with that, the remaining ~195 doses were consumed by my toilet bowl. That's the most depressing thing: a cheap, potent stim of which I suddenly had 200 doses, and it's not worth the baggie it came in to me!


Oh yeah, and although I was never really up, I sure came down hard! It's not quite as bad as after a major meth binge, but it FAR outweighed anything positive about this stuff (wait, was there anything positive?). I don't understand why anyone would willfully try this more than a few times, or why it is so popular, but to each their own. (I never liked Ritalin either though, which is what I would most closely compare this to, it's like Ritalin's dirtier, meaner cousin...)

I certainly won't overdo them, but I'm a bit more concerned about neurotoxicity than the average bluelighter, I think. I'm not going to sacrifice too much neurons for a few hours of empathy or stimulation. Besides, it doesn't really seem to work as pervert powder for me, DPT is way better at that.


All in all, until I know that MDPV isn't metabolized to a radical dioxy variant, no MDPV (and methylone and other methylenedioxy's) for me.

That's not my experience, I find it a quite calming experience. It's "up" effect isn't that strong and it's not really euphoric like cocaine, but more "just nice", like nicotine. I do crash relatively hard from it, though.

^ In my limited experimentation, I really enjoyed the stuff and had no bad effects at all other then a little muscle-twitching. My ladyfriend also enjoyed it at first but experienced paranoia and hallucinations after a relatively small amount (3 or 4 5mg lines over a night). Strange stuff that seems to affect people very differently. But I like it and so does she... as long as the redosing is kept to a reasonable limit ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

150mg, seems to me there was just one 0 (zero) too much!

You didn`t know...?

Don´t worry you`ll be OK anyway. At this time,as you see. (?)

Dosage 10mg is good to remember and never overdo 20-30mg. That should keep you away from those negative experiences. 

Can´t help wondering how so many, on these pages, find MDPV so worthless.

About two yeras ago, when my first contact with this stuff, I still prefer it to any 

other CS product. 

MDPV actually made it very easy for me to leave long lasted abuse of those

illegal, more destructive so called amphetamines.

Can´t refuse, there is a backside of this coin, too, but that`s another story.

A datum:

I have written it off as garbage.  It is jittery enough that I can never really feel that good from it...or even make use of increased focus and motivation.  Yet it is fiendy a la cocaine.  And then it has a nasty crash.


The only thing it's good for for me is sex, and only during the sex.

I would certainly assume that it would exhibit the same problem with the unstable 3,4-dihydroxy- pro-oxidant metabolite.  With the beta-keto moiety, it is assumable that the toxicity would resemble that of methylone.  Some people seem to get really cracked out with methylone as well--I have seen one person have a rather hysterical freakout on methylone.  Not that this is in anyway related to the pro-oxidant metabolite. 


Personally, I thought MDPV was absolute shit--no redeeming qualities, particularly compared with other stimulant compounds.  I had no problem pissing on the rest of my sample and watching it circle down.

I had it 2-3 times each time snorted without re-doses. 


Stimulation wise its VERY stimulating in a normal dose, I'd compare it to the stimulation of methamphetamine when snorted. 


Euphoria wise its better than ritalin but not as good as dextroamphetamine. I'd say dextroamphetamine gives better euphoria in my opinon with added emphatogenic and entactogenic effects which MDPV lacks, plus dextroamphetamine is a lot smoother on the body for a stimulant. 


I must say as well that there is craving on MDPV to do more probably just as much if not more than there is with dextroamphetamine. I didn't really crash from this other than feeling a lack of energy and feeling stressed out because I couldn't sleep with 2x my clonazepam and clonidine. 


I haven't had many stimulants plus I'm not a fan of stimulants so I don't have anything else really to compare it to.

not suggesting it, but vaporized it's the most euphoric stimulant* there is for me. 

tread carefully, the cautions are pretty realistic.

(*my brain isn't wired right for cocaine & freebase, thank god)

you should NOT vaporize this chemical, as some research suggests that it forms dangerous breakdown products.

not doubting you at all, but can you suggest any links to research along those lines? Following the EU threads about MDPV which seem to be the largest concentration of info here at least, warnings about vaporization seem to have been limited to concerns about impure synths and the byproducts left behind by the chemist at the time. In any case any kind of suitable studies or research would likely be very helpful as it's clear there are a decent number of folks on bluelight who do vaporize it.

Well if you lose a big load of MDPV some poor soul will pick it up and do a big fat line thinking its coke, then be up for three days, tis socially irresponsible I tell thee!

This stuff seemed great at first glance, from a price/availability standpoint, but there are LOTS of stories dealing with hard comedowns and habituation - a large percentage of the users seem to be redosing every 45-60 minutes which is extremely hard on your liver and hepatic system. The metabolites build up and take 72+ hours to be fully excreted - a binge is worse than a single use but I'd caution anyone against habitual or continual use, since the metabolites look to be worse than those of cocaine or amphetamines.

Good lil piece of info. Guess it would be good to keep something for the comedown to keep from 

craving so bad. Will have to try that out sometime. It sounds good to keep a benzo and a beer around for the comedown.

A more apt comparison would be with ritalin.

It is like the aforementioned, but far more potent.

I dont really like DOM, but if I tried it way to high a dose not knowing anything, I woulf of loathed it for life. since I diddnt, I'll drop a tab now or then to trip with some friends.

Well this is was a new one for me. I had a lil trouble with the dosing, either that or I just didn't know what I was looking for. I've heard it was a learned high. It seemed like all I was getting was a escalated heart-rate and feeling a lil edgy. 

So I just went and took the rest I had to get what I call an "unmistakable high", perhaps I know what I'm looking for now. 

After that I experienced washes of euphoria. But it isn't a state that I liked to stay in long... I'm used to long highs with Tramadol but after a couple of hours I was like, "OK, I'm ready to come down now."

On the comedown I experienced a decline in mood, a continued increased heart rate and continued edginess. It wasn't pleasant but I think it certainly would be more manageable on benzos, if nothing but decrease the heart rate a bit. It goes away after a few hours and I felt pretty normal. 

I think this would be something I would take again if I had something to manage the come down a bit, not that it can't be done just fine without anything, its just a lil unpleasant. Not bad for my first stimulant comedown I figure...

I should add that when re-dosing or dosing in general but way more noticable in re-doses is that the resulting effect is very mellow for 2-3hrs and then its like all the re-doses combined together hit you at once during the comedown and you find yourself with high blood pressure all of a sudden.

**Mdpv**


Forgive me if this ends up in the wrong place/ thread whatever,.....I originally posted the following, but mentioned a source..oops! So am trying again:


Anyway - just a middle-aged Brit's reflections on 'Whip' as it's known in the UK:


MDPV is legal (as a plant fertilizer..not for human consumption ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  )and available by post in the UK, and probably wherever you live too. I live in France, but my gramme turns up reliably every week by registered mail!


Interesting how opinions vary on this one- for me it's the ultimate drug - the only problem is its concentration and individual tolerance variations.


IF you get the dose right, and intervals between redosing (even that's all hugely variable depending on the individual),  it does everything good coke does, except it's pure, lasts 50 times longer (1g approx. 25 euros, fun for seven days, gentle regular dosing) and is available legally through the post! Can't be bad at all, the only problems being its addiction and tolerance development rates, but again all that depends on the person, as with any drug.


There's also a fine line between pleasant high and descent into dry-mouthed, gibbering madness. Without enough knowledge at the time, my first experience was no sleep or food for nine days....recovery after a few nights' sleep but stuffed my face with chocolate for the following month...be careful!


Find the right amount for you, and get organised with some sort of sleeping/eating pattern if you are able, and it's the best thing out there, in my opinion.


In addition, it not only produces the most extremely intense fifteen-minute orgasm I've ever known (flaccid willy, solo: sorry, girls, it'll never be the same again), it also, in controlled doses, opens the mind to achieve friendly solutions to human or technical problems in all walks of life. For example:


Having just left England, selling everything we owned, to build our new home on the side of a beautiful French mountain, my wife fell for a local Frenchman. Using a bit of Whip sensibly by this time, and after the initial anger had subsided, I invited the guy round, had a few beers, and all became friends. We've maintained the house and business, and any children related to any parties are happy and less stressed than would have been the case normally.


I was able to come to terms with the whole thing, I believe, in part due to the mind-expanding properties of this drug, and its weird ability, in the right quantity, to make obvious, but unorthodox solutions possible.


Get it while you can! 


Ben.

I too have heard that vaporizing (chasing the dragon) is one of the best drug expreriences of all time, period be it stimulant downer or psychedelic. I smoked meth once and it was way more euphoric than crack....people who smoked MDPV say its even more euphoric than meth.

Whats with everyone saying that peevee is great for sex/wanking?

It's the exact opposite for me, hard to get an erection, even harder to keep an erection and blowing the load at the end of it just feels wrong.

Amphetamine on the other hand is simply amazing for these purposes ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Most of those reports are linked to the original batch of 'tan' peevee that was particularly more potent and produced other noteworthy effects (like you listed) that have not been reproduced since then.

Ahhh has the mystery of the tan PV been solved yet?

What was it, a completely different compound or what?

I ordered some more PV recently as the description on the supplier's website said that it was tan coloured

I was rather dissapointed when I received the same white fluffy stuff as always. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Yea suppliers got wind of the 'tan' craze and used it to your advantage. Don't be fooled...it's long gone.


mystery was never solved although there have been many speculations. check out the peevee megathreads in EADD for more info

ohhhh the tan peevee is just around the corner if you research a little more through the boards...in particular, pay close attention to any posts stuffmonger has made regarding converting white peevee into the glorious tan. T - 10 minutes until my own conversion experiment begins...will post pics/results.

Hi, I come from Czech republic and I want to Swami also share this remarkable substance. I was 5 on methamphetamine and the last time I caused health problems so I was looking for an alternative and found just mdpv and since I ordered one gram do not want anything else! It took me about 3 weeks later than my body can become accustomed, while condensate time I almost died: D but managed. From the beginning I had a decent psychosis, because I did not sleep much, and I was really ohubu have hallucinations, etc. IMO the first case gram lasted me 3 weeks 2nd gram 2 weeks and I stopped for a 1 gram per week. Most methodology charmed as I have had first a drag, it was amazing, and indeed a few who can resist. They were days when I smoked meth, but as it turned out terrible. But now Semito been brought under control but with a school for drivers, measuring benefits exaggerated What is my glass normally takes a little heat and Seto just melts and then inhale, but you'll only do they have burnt 1.prda and drop throw. Because it does not burn again nothing good for my lungs. and I would like to ask if more such substances as mdpv, or what would you advise me as the best alternative meth?Ps: sory for bad translation. And thanks for the reply. You guys are doing and whether

I'm not going to condone you continuing to use drugs, but if you know you'll use something... then I would personally use these over  MDPV.  Any drug addiction will come with consequences.  I strongly urge you to reconsider daily use of any one stimulant.  


d-amphetamine

methamphetamine, yes, I would recommend over MDPV

cocaine (not without reservations)


Psychosis, and other problems as a result of stimulant use, can all happen on these drugs as well - please be aware on how to keep and maintain a healthy diet, exercise regimen, and sleeping habits on these sorts of drugs if you are going to use them for any regular/considerable length of time.

Methamphetamine is not "meph" aka 4-mmc or mephedrone.  I would not use this drug either.


I think for you, it would be best not to use stimulants.  Really.  A life off of hard drugs is one to be admired. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I know too well mephedrone is weak as tea. But I would like to make sure that you will not find me one day lying dead on the ground with swelling of the brain or something like that. otherwise I have the problem that after the experience with me mdpv it does not methamphetamine, I put 0.3 methamphetamine nose and suddenly hours later came the haze of yawning and fatigue.

Meth shouldn't damage your brain in a lethal way, unless you take a massive overdose.  


These stimulants are going to cause some level of neurotoxicity.  


If you can't quit, then meth might be better for you.  Overall, quitting is best.

Please people's attention, especially to those who are experienced users of cocaine or meth! People 6 years I took meth, this spell on me the strength and micro-dose ... as I have put a drag so I was in heaven the moment I quit meth and a month and a half every day enjoying this extract of evil ... after a while I realized that I do have full control! and It started after some time you go for your life ... body of toxic overflow! It is not cocaine, methamphetamine is not it, can not it take a long time, you very quickly and it kills you even though you know it continues ... because the state after a powder is so intense that just get you over and you do not care. Forbade it and because some will not end in a coffin, hair dryer, non-oxygenated blood, retreating gums, pain, internal organs ... high blood pressure, inability to walk in the extreme, extreme weight loss, delusions, paranoia, blurred vision, twitches in the body, poor sleep, abdominal pain, and what does it feel that warms me still know that the lung, the production of mucus, rapid social exclusion, and this My experience will it cost me less than two months of treatment for peace and pray that they are not physical withdrawal. And what this one would let the people tortured for years and then eventually drowned feces weight behind him!

Lots of 'living information/experience' around too, if folks are cool with asking and offering.  IMO, there's nothing 'inferior' about asking someone for their opinion/personal experience, and nothing arrogant or 'superior' about offering one's own experience to whoever may be interested.


From here, it's just that sort of sharing that makes for a worthwhile and lively message board, helps in reducing harm, and results in permanent/useful posts that are worth sticking around and being read by everyone.

I would take an MDPV addiction over a Meth addiction any day, an MDPV addiction is seriously childs play. You can *just put it down*. Look what happens when Methamphetamine addicts try to quit after years of heavy use. It rarely ends pretty.

Strange I can control meth urges (redosing doing stupid high doses ect) but mdpv for some reason never really peaked on my "better stop doing that" scale. I had shot roughy 200mgs and was shaking like a crack baby doing the jitterbug while I tried to hole my rig steady to shoot some more I would definitely say that mdpv is equally if not more dangerous to meth if not only for its high accessibility.


ps dont fucking shoot it unless you want some crazy fucking addiction tendencies.

^ I'll repeat what I said on another thread -- if you don't "need what you want", you can always kick an addiction, and addiction isn't such a big deal.  If you "need what you want" you're in trouble.

Be careful with that shit... there's nothing happy about staying up for 10 days in a row, or clinical level paranoid psychosis.

I started mdpv at like 2 or 3 mg, worked up to 20 in about 3 or 4 doses and I quite like it. I haven't had any depression and I've done 20 mg twice. I would like to know how much is too much cause I wanna up it to about 35 mg? I wake up with my 1yr old son at like 7am and don't do any till 11pm or later so I'm asleep in a few hours and wake up feeling great at 20mg. how far do you guys think I could push it? I'm 6' 190llb.

I just posted this in EADD but I'm not from europe or africa:


"muahaha I just flushed my mdpv!


I had a G and some change, I did about half a G to a G of the stuff over the past month or so.


I binged on it the first night I got it, and maybe once or twice on other nights during the course of having it.


Most days I would just do a bump and smoke a few cigarettes.


It didn't control me -too much anyway- in that I would only do one bump a day.


The thing is, I would always do that bump, I only skipped like one day in the last month or so.


So, although fun, since it wasn't really helping me any and I was always wanting to do that one bump each day... I just did my last bump and dumped the rest out into the toilet, flushed it and waved goodbye.


goodbye mdpv, it was fun but I'm off the stims! (I was only smoking cigs cause of the mdpv). "


to add some information to this post - I often got extremely paranoid on it, it's like if you take just a little too much you get extreme paranoia, and if you take a bit more than that I would get uncontrollable energy and just pace around.


I found the best way to take it was to do as little as possible (I was eyeballing bumps) - usually too little, and then do another tiny bit once that hits if it wasn't enough. This way I could just get into a little bit of stimulation and have a few smokes without being driven half crazy by the shit or having nearly uncontrollable energy.


I'm glad I'm done with it as I had been off stimulants for years and now I'm going to be off them again since this stuff is flushed and down the drain.

ok I just tried this stuff, legally bought (crazy), umm, two days ago it was. And in that time i have learned a lot about it. First thing, MDPV in SMALL doses is great, almost cocaine or ecstasy esque. However I dont think that many people understand that there is a fine and significant line between a good and a very bad dose (kinda like GHB). So if you take a little bit, a little little bit, you should experience euphoria and pleasant energy and concentration. But if you keep repeatedly dosing like you would with cocaine, or if you simply take too much, you will end up in the sketchiest place, all paranoia and not a dollop of fun. Basically you just need to dose small and then ride that out completely. and then you can dose small again. Remember to always resist the urge to redose once you start to feel good. This might work with coke but not with mdpv.


Basically it is a difficult drug to learn. But its pretty good once you do. Strangely addictive though. Even after a couple days.

You just totally contradicted yourself dude. It's hard, if not impossible, to do a substance in small amounts if that substance is highly addictive. This MDPV shit is shit just like cocaine. I'll say it again, that it perplexes me why someone would want high paranoia and sketchyness when they could just spend money on an opiate or a benzo. Pretty soon this shit's going to be illegal to sell in head shops anyway. The DEA is already on board with controlling it as we speak, with good fucking reason.

Smoking herb works wonders. It may be difficult, but also try to eat and drink plenty of water. A patient friend to talk to also significantly aids the panic factor. After a good nights rest, you should be (mostly) back to normal.

Has anyone else tried the "Fly like a...G6" stuff they sell in headshops in the northeast? It's billed as being "plant food" I'm almost positive its MDPV based on descriptions i've read and what i experienced in taking it.


When i got it home it looked and tasted almost exactly like Kool-Aid crystals. The girl said to put it "in a Corona" so i put it up my nose. Don't do that unless you're a masochist. 15 minutes later i felt like i was 17 again and got burned on "DANK Herbal Blendzz" or something. A half an hour later i was afraid i did too much.


I Snuffalupagussed about half the bag and went for wild ride. The high lasted about 5 hours but my heart was beating really fast all night. I don't think i slept any. The next day my pupils were REALLY dilated. 2 people asked me if i was on shrooms. I didn't feel "high" per se, but i definitely felt a little wonky the whole next day.


I really believe what i read somewhere else, that this can help with social anxiety after the comedown. It seemed to have other side benefits too. Even though i was rushing hard, heart beating out of my chest, a little concerned when it was going to wear off, i hadn't had lucid thoughts about my life like i did on this stuff in a long time. 


Mainly i bring this up to see if anyone else has experience with the "Fly like a...G6" stuff, and if they know if it is in fact MPDV, but also to say that if you come across this stuff and think like i did "aw it's probably some bunkum but fuckit what if it's not, i have the $XX to burn on it..." 


TREAT THIS SUBSTANCE WITH RESPECT whatever it is. I would highly, HIGHLY suggest ingesting 2 lines worth (NOT OF PURE MPDV, but if it's 'plant food' form like i had) and waiting a FULL HOUR to see how it hits you. I had a 30 second panic attack where i was like "ohfuckohfuckohfuck didn't i read somewhere this shit can last 24 hours what if i never come down ohfuckohfuckohfuck" I'm pretty sure if i had done ONE more line i would have been deep in some uncomfortable paranoia. 


30 seconds sounds like no big deal, i assure you, it will be a big deal if you get to that place. If it had lasted 2 minutes i was going to consider calling an ambulance. I'm talking "out of body sheer terror heart beating out of chest looking in the mirror and i look like a different person oh my god what did i just put in my body" kind of panic attack.


Also, on the "two lines worth" i suggest, is of this G6 stuff which is a Kool-Aid like gummy powder blend they have at headshops, IT IS NOT PURE MPDV. Don't do 2 lines of pure as a baseline point. Maybe a small key bump or something. Actually don't do that, consult someone who knows what the hell they're talking about instead ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


Again, treat this substance with respect, don't let it's "legality" fool you, it was much, MUCH, and i stress MUCH more intense than the eh-could-take-it-or-leave-it kinda coke i've tried from time to time. It felt like coke for the first half hour of the comeup, then felt like ecstasy with a little upper for an hour and a half, and finally felt like what i assume Meth feels like for the remaining 2 or so hours, just intense focus no euphoria, very speedy heart.


As freaked out as i was and as far reaching as its effects were, i would try this again. Maybe in 2-3 months. My thinking just felt much more clear after doing this, my thoughts weren't muddled, i didn't get stressed/angry as easily, seemed to just be able to say the right things at the right times in social situations. I can't say that it's 100% MPDV that did this, but it really felt like it was a big part of it. I think for me i would take it alone at like 9am so that i would have a chance at falling asleep that night, and would use it mostly for the side benefits and less for the high itself (I'm not a big fan of uppers).

Most people just judge by what they read aswell and expect the worst and thats what they get its like any phyc really thing positive and you will feel positve thats how it works for me think about other things so you dont get paronoid like type a bunch of useless shit on bluelight ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I LOVE MDVP ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) im on it right now so that is why i have like 350mg left done 100 or so over the night i have done it 5 times before and it sucked complete dick i love how it makes me feel though soo i dont mind the comedown if i have a couple of percs 4, 5mg percs to be exact make me fall asleep and forget it happened ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) im looking forward to doing this on my plane trip to ohio this afternoon ill tell you how it goes, as for parnonia it is terrrible unless you do alot like i did 100mg then your just so hyper and dont even think about anything but typing on bluelight i mean i started an account at 1 in the moring yesterday and have already made like 40 posts cuz of this shit i mean it does make you want to socialize alot but impaires tying ability's and grammar aloot as you can see im sure ive use like one period if that. anyway if you have opiates or benzos for comedowns it rocks my socks so i think if you do it have weed on deck for tommmorow being hungry and not being hungry because im sure pot will help with that factor and opiated to sleep the comedown away. definatly some after effects a couple days later to...and i do want to keep doing it and all your posts i read make me paronoid ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png). wish me luck on my trip to to ohio no pun intended haha kinda funny though. sorry im so fucked up guys! peace out hope my post had somewhat of a bennifit toward people that wana do it like everysaid before it depends on your brain and past experinces definatly for people who love amph and dont care what drug they do.

**bath salts**


Me and my hubby tried Tranquility bath Salts. That was like coke,  and ecstasy and Meth all rolled into one.  Then we tried Drone which obviously was like mephedrone then they had some specialty salts called Black Diamond Novelty salts which was like ecstasy and pcp. Strangest buzz I've ever had. Anyone heard of those? Just curiousj,  see what you thoughft..

**MDPV, fascinating RC, these are my observations. I want YOURS**


FIRST OFF, i'd always accompany MDPV with minimum 1mg clonazepam and low dose asprin as well as peptol bismul to reduce unpleasant side effects... no harm in a bump of MDPV once in a while, or a shot for that matter. KNOW APPROPRIATE DOSAGES, DON'T BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO RUIN OUR GENERATION'S NAME TO THAT BS, To each his own and to all be safe and know what you're doing first (IV rush btw is so good it's incomprehensible in my opinion) To be a weekend warier is one thing but how is one to touch this damn substance without compulsive re-dosing until your chest hurts or you run out?? This is unique because it's got similarities to MPH, yip, crank, and in my opinion MDMA as well (to a point, I'm not trying to argue about that one). I've noticed people saying it only keeps you up, and there's no euphoria etc... well everyone is different but I notice that per 10-20mg bump, the onset is a bit long (5-10 mins) at which point there is a certain euphoria, very short lived followed by a noticeable stimulant high for about an hour and then you feel it while very slowly coming down for hours. After the high starts to wind down noted that freebasing a dose of roughly 5mg will temporarily bring you right back up and even potentially re induce that short lived euphoria. Smoking this stuff gets to be like smoking crack, it's hard to touch MDPV without binging. Before work, doing 10-15mg sublingually gets me through the day focused and productive (but wanting more). I'd say, if you aren't an experienced stimulant user, don't touch it and NEVER underestimate the strength of this RC, I was hoping for input as to how what I've said compares to you're experiences. Currently on a binge so fellow users... agree with what I said? Disagree?

The biggest challenges with peevee are keeping the doses small and not re-dosing too often. Shouldn't need to dose more than once every 2-4 hours if that. Can't reccomend more than 50mg/day. Plenty of people talk about dosing every 30min-hour and doing huge amounts, but that's pushing it. Vaping seems to be easier on the body than oral or insufflating ROA's. Careful with this stuff...or it will become the friend you wish you never met hahaha.


Don't know how many of you guy's were familiar with Ektamine or what happened to him. You can read his posts from earlier in this thread. I "knew" him from his posts in the mdpv megathread in the European/African discussion. RIP Ektamine. Don't mean any disrespect by bringing this up...just thought it might help someone looking for motivation to quit.

A trusted vendor of mine is offering the oil freebase in 50mg increments, If kept sealed until used would this have any benefit over the salt (I plan on vaping) I cant find much info on the pure freebase oil. 


What do you guys think, is it worth checking out. Yes i've read how horrible it is, i've seen some bad reactions to it, I have great control and so far ive been able to put it down with no cravings or thoughts about it. So please don't respond with that, I'm very aware of psychological dangers that accompany this but i am responsible.

^don't smoke MDPV. I did it a lot for while. I also had mouth, throat and lung infections during that period, and my throat felt like someone rammed a wire brush down it most of the time (to the point where I had a hard time talking)

Just tried it today. ~5 milligrams orally. Quite noticable affects. Flushed, sweaty face. 


2 hours later dosed ~10 milligrams orally. More sweat, mild euphoria. 


Smoking strong jwh blend sometime after the effects came on seemed to really potentiate this. 


It isn't entirely pleasant or unpleasant. Interesting. Seen in another thread (maybe this one too) that this stuff smells like semen? I haven't really smelled this yet but to me 4-FA *really* had a fungusy, semeny smell, lol.


Editing this again: I should have mentioned that thanks to having well-researched this here and elsewhere by reading many people's experiences before mine arrived no doubt saved me lots of grief. I strongly suggest you use it very, very sparingly at first, with time in-between doses until you get a idea how this accumulates and how it affects you. 


So far have only taken it orally, and it's powerful at low doses, quite noticeable even at 2-3 mg. Have been tempted to insufflate but held out so far.


I'm really kind of amazed at the extent to which smoked JWH-122/210 really potentiates this. Maybe it's just me, I don't know. Much trippier, and brings on more face and underarm sweat but can't really focus well. This stuff might be ok for my adhd if I lay off the jwh. Will have to try it sometime ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png).


I have much less "throbbiness" in my head after experimenting with this a couple more times which I think is my blood pressure going up. Maybe it's more obvious to me because normally my bp is excellent? Anyway it's less pronounced than it was the first time I did mdpv when it was fairly off-putting. 


I understand the whole rambling problems now ahaa. Yes this can be nice if you are very careful and only gradually increase the dose.


Somewhere in these threads someone mentioned reduced social anxiety for a period after using mdpv. I noticed this as well and it's incredibly cool.

YMMV, but I HATE the freebase of pv. It's like the shortest most explosive crack rush, followed by an INSTANT plunge into despair. And I LOVE love love MDPV. But The freebase is like the cliff notes version with an afterword written by lucifer. I prefer to just vape the salt, chase it with some mullein and it will counteract the lung damage. The best I ever had was I vaped a crystal version of it that was super smooth with a great rush. But I can't find her anymore, she's my unicorn :-(

Hello everyone - my first post here. I'm glad to have found some other people to discuss this fascinating drug with.


I've had MDPV a few times now and I don't recognise (yet) the crashing depressions that some posters have described. Having said that, I am hoping, after the events of tonight, when I have taken a lot more than I have on previous occasions, that I won't be withdrawing this statement on Saturday night as I find that we've run out of butter which which somehow leads on to almost tearful thoughts about my fundamental lack of direction in life, etc. etc., ad nauseum. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


**My MDPV experience today and tonight**


I'm M, weigh 9st 8lbs (or 152lbs in US measurements). I'm slim and I'm 5ft9.


Context is that I was in town with my friend, a girl I like and know quite well, without it being a sexual relationship, and we were wandering around my home town doing a bit of Christmas shopping. Food was two slices of toast at 12 noon, then one pint of strong bitter at 1.45pm. Last night we were up till 6am doing mephedrone and drinking port and sherry (well, it's nearly Christmas!)


**2pm **

Took MDPV - all I can say about the quantity is that it was a thickish (say about 2/3mm) line about 25mm or one inch long as had no way of cutting it nicely before snorting it.

**2pm + 2 mins**

Almost immediate sense of euphoria and sociability. A greatly increased desire to talk.. Although I do talk quite a bit anyway, I was aware of really enjoying it..Fortunately I bumped into lots of friends and acquaintances to natter to.


Slight feeling of increased sexual desire, which was there at a very subtle level for most of the afternoon.


Waves of different senses being heightened. Fascinated to walk round shops looking at things, being much more interested than normal in colours, interesting patterns etc., No visuals, but enjoyed e.g., feeling wind in air, and focusing in on sounds. This was a lovely phase and i really enjoyed it. I was glad we were out. What was nice (as opposed to the methadrone we had taken the night before) was that the feelings kept changing. One minute the quality of the light felt gorgeous, the next minute a fabric pattern on an apron in a shop was fascinating. 


Physically I felt very aware of my arms and my legs (the vasoconstriction maybe?) It made walking very pleasing and interesting.


**About 3.30pm** 

Did a little more, a bit less than last time. No euphoria, I didn't enjoy this phase much. I immediately started to feel a nausea high in my stomach which I had to try hard to ignore. Still found walking round the shops quite fascinating, but I wasn't as talkative and felt I was carrying my body around with me a bit. Legs started to feel heavy a little like they do from crap e which isn't mdma.


**4.45pm**

Another (final) dose, again a bit difficult to judge as we did it down a dark overgrown alleyway by scooping it off with a Bic pen top to snort it,  but from its effects it must have been our biggest hit of the afternoon. Decided to eat a banana immediately afterwards which reduced the nausea a great deal. Again, no euphoria but I started feeling the intense sense impressions again, and the sensual pleasures of the cold and the dark came back. 


At some point it started affecting my voice and ability to speak. I couldn't finish some of my sentences and found it difficult to move my mouth in a normal way.


We got home at **6pm**. I found it an effort to talk coherently to my housemates but forced a few sentences out, trying not to appear as off it as I felt. I disappeared to my room as soon as I could. I felt a mild bit of sexual energy (coupled with the knowledge that I wouldn't be able to do anything about it), My friend wanted to go out for another walk round the local streets  but I wanted to stay in the warm. I wrote a long, flowing, email to a woman I have just started seeing and who I would like to sleep with. It was a bit like e - close and with lots of description in it about my afternoon and my feelings towards her, without anything explicitly sexual in it. I enjoyed writing, even though typing, as is typing this, was difficult, error-strewn and much slower than normal. 


Now, I am afraid that at this point, I had to go and look after my three children, who are all around 12-13, I make a rule of never getting off my tits before babysitting but I had forgotten my ex was going out. The urge to talk was back but I think I got away with it, since, to my great relief, they enjoyed me telling them (at great length) about when I used to be in an Am Dram group before they were born. It all ended up happily (although my eldest asked me if I had a cold), but I felt very bad at having done that,, for only the second time in 13 years of jointly looking after them. It's just utterly wrong, in all sorts of ways.


I came back at about **11.00pm** and had a long phone call with the woman i mentioned earlier, and found it very easy to talk to her and tell her lots of things about how much I like her, and how talking about her with my friend this afternoon had helped me to know that I'd really like to take it further with her. I didn't tell her about the MDPV or last night;s mephedrone, but said I'd been down the pub  - so no *actual* lie there, just being a bit economical with the truth. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I'll tell her in time if it develops.


Then about **midnight** I took a small line of miaow miaow and sat typing another long email to the woman I'd just been speaking to on the phone. Again, this almost uncontrollable desire to talk to someone. We write to each other all the time but never as much as I have done today. 


Now, it's **6.02 am** and I am feeling bodily tired but mentally wide awake, I have to go to the dentist at 9am and am a little worried that i will look awful, but I've a feeling I won't get much sleep.


**Things I enjoyed:**


- the lovely one-off euphoria at the very beginning, when everything goes brighter and you suddenly feel very happy, in a skipping along the road kind of way

- the urge to communicate in talking and in writing, and the heightened pleasure gained from these

- the mild sense of sexual arousal 

- the heightened sense impressions which were very pleasurable yet still allowed you to feel in control (and which let me get away with not making a mess of the babysitting)

- the way that the feeling goes in waves and changes quality all the time rather than a high followed by a steady decay


**Things I didn't enjoy:**


- the nausea (possibly that was my fault for not eating enough beforehand though)

- the fact that it's keeping me awake now over 12 hours since our last dose and after all of the good effects have worn off.

- the way my body felt heavy after the first re-dosing

- the way that later on, it interfered with my speech and made it difficult to finish sentences, especially when talking with non-users (e,g, my housemates)

- the sweating. I had to wash my armpits and face and change my T-shirt and my shirt at about 6pm as I was sweating so much, making the room smell a bit.


**Things I don't know about yet:**


- will i crash? And if so what kind of crash will it be and how long will it last?


**And the moral of the story is:**


- Enjoy the long high of the initial dose and don't go chasing the initial euphoria by re-dosing too soon.(*) Even better, don't re-dose at all, perhaps.


* I'm 47 now and I sill find it difficult to follow this most simple piece of advice.


Apologies for the length of this post - I will not write so long next time,

I fucking hate how people sometimes say MDPV has MDMA-ish effects.  No, it's a fucking straight up stimulant with no use other than getting twacked, cracked, fucked up, and feeling like shit.  It's not therapeutic or anything close, I wouldn't want anybody I like to do this shit.


Edit: it blows meth out of the water

^^Exactly...it's not as euphoric as meth IMO however but definitely more potent and easier to go into psychosis!!

I really wish I had stocked up in September. MDPV was perfect for me and did exactly what I wanted it to do. Early on I found myself on multi-day runs that weren't always pleasant but over time I nailed down exactly where my happy zone was and it was perfect.

Me too - unfortunately, just at the time everyone was rushing to buy it all before the law changed, I just didn't have any money at that particular time. I regret that, because I quite like it, in small doses. Bit of a crash a couple of days afterwards but that could be because we redosed too soon.


I've fallen back to Benzo Fury's but I'm not sure about them. They take ages to come on (even when I crush them and snort them, which is a very unpleasant experience) and they're too mild.

**mdpv brown patches on skin**


I have already posted a question in ODs on this. I have been doing a ton of coke lately and was concerned when I got some brown patches on my arms, someone replied saying itscommon with mdpv usage. I know suspect that the "coke" I've been using has been cut with mdpv. I have a bad chest/cough, had tinitus a couple of weeks ago (apparently side effects from mdpv). My friend who does loads of the same supply seems to be suffering from all the bad comedown symptoms.The appearance of the "coke" has seemed slightly clumpy/sticky which I think would be down to the mdpv. Do aany of you think I'm right? it also tastes sweet/fizzy....

This shit is the most awful drug known to mankind.  Thank goodness the DEA stepped in and imposed a temporary ban in Ariozna (since the politicians in this state are too fucking dumb to do it).  I have nothing against tweakers, cokeheads, etc.  But people on this shit are WAY tweaked out and do crazy shit, like complain of seeing demons.  Anything with the word "pyro" in it has to be bad...

My ex (who was a regular here on Bluelight), OD'ed from MDPV after a year-long addiction with this substance. He had been abusing drugs since he was about 14, off and on, and being one of the smartest people I've ever met, his drug use increased with RC's that can easily be obtained online. It started out with  the pre-mephedrone ("meow-meow") era, where he discovered (from purchasing mescaline online), that he could fulfill his sniff fix by simply getting a PO box and ordering baggie after baggie. 

Back in June of 2010, he offered me a line of what he described as "a more euphoric mephedrone" which to me, sounded bomb. I'd done meph a few times and thought it was a better version of coke (which I think is the most boring drug to use) with slight bits of Molly mixed in. So, when I did my first line of peeves, 8 hours before I had work the next morning, I thought, "this will be fine, that stuff wore off in no time."

And I got the results that seem to be the most popular- for the first few hours, I felt great. It was a nice buzz, nothing FANTASTIC, but it fueled our conversation I wished to have for over a year. I took a few more lines, and by the next time I look at the clock, I'm supposed to be at work (for my stepmom's law firm, first day) in less than half an hour. So I called in- "Oh, I have a flat, I'm so anxious I don't know what to do" 

Which they bought. I put off coming in for a good 4 hours, then finally drove in a panic to work, shaking, anxiously awaiting their approval, and what do you know? I sideswipe the curb and actually give myself a flat tire. Karma at it's finest! I went into work looking extremely cracked out, and they told me to go home and rest.

I luckily surpassed the extreme depression phase of the long comedown, but the moral of the story is- don't do MPDV.

My ex was eventually shooting it up, and when his mom found him dead in his apartment, she found hundreds of needles. 

Please, please, please, stay away from this horrible drug.


(And- is anyone else really irked by all of the media attention accompanied with ignorance about bath salts and how suddenly now, after someone displays the ultimate zombie paralysis, NOW the drug is getting the false attention it needs?

^I'm sorry for your loss.


I did not think it was possible, but MDPV makes meth seem tame by comparison. I've known many who said they liked it more than meth or coke. I've seen harden tweakers and crackheads freak out on MDPV bath salts. MDPV seems to be more of a mind fuck than traditional uppers. 


I liked to smoke 8 ballz, a MDPV containing bath salt. It had a rush like smoking crack.You don't have to freebase it to smoke it, the salt smokes fine on foil. God slamming it must be nuts!


MDPV seems to have no medical use, it sucks for ADD, too short acting for an appetite suppressant.Good aphrodisiac though, if your not too paranoid to be with a girl.And it goes great with alcohol, though it's easy to get carried away.  There seem to be a thin line between a dose that gets you pleasantly spun and one where you're paralyzed by the fear. Best cure for the fear is a couple beers.


Part of me is glad it's banned, and yet part of me misses it and wishes that I stocked up on it.Still, I truly think cocaine is safer than bath salts. Legalize meth and coke, so no one has to sniff bath salts.


And I too think it's bullshit bath salts get blamed for the zombies. Florida was one of the first states to ban the good bath salts.It seems obvious that it's due to 2012 Mayan apocalypse![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

**MDPV, a potential ADD medication?**


So heres a little backstory to my experience:


Since Thursday, I've been binging on PV for couple days w/o sleep, but did not suffer any of the side effects like paranoia, vasconstriction, chest pains, or stimulant induced psychosis. This was my second experience on this substance, and I must say it's really not that bad of a drug, although it holds little to no recreational value. It helped me a lot with concentration, felt like the ultimate ADD medication, I wrote like a 7 page essay without realizing it. And would be mesmerized by reading...anything that seems remotely interesting, which my sober self with attention deficit disorder would've just got up and left without finishing the first page. 

In fact, IMO and IME it is fairly safe, benign, and mundane drug, but due to it's property as a very very potent stimulant and how the substance works on the the brains reward system given it's very mild euphoria, it can pose to be very dangerous for those who are uneducated about the substance and had done little to no research before hand, especially those idiots who are out there trying to chase that "high", the initial rush (minimal, can be even compared to MPH) and end up resorting to dangerous ROAs such as slamming it or smoking it and taking on heroic doses that would just give you an 8 hr + anxiety attack and heart problems. What people need to realize is that this substance holds absolutely no recreational value, once you realize that, your mentality changes and you overly compulsive desire to redose will be greatly reduced, because you know thats all the "buzz" it can really give. And vaping or slamming the stuff would definitely give you an intense rush, akin to smoking crack, but shortly afterwards would just lead you to psychotic behavior. 

That is why I am seriously enraged about how the government and media portrays this substance, as some kind of supercrack or super meth, and repeatedly dubs it the name of "bath salts". Those commercialized vendors who sell these packaged "bath salts" or "legal highs" who used to put PV in their own personal cocktail of RC's, and prior to that they did the same shit with 4MMC. So to end of my rant, we shouldnt be so quick to judge and stigmatize MDPV as some kinda psychotic-inducing demon drug that makes you rape goats and go on these beserk violent rampages. We, as a responsible therapeutic and recreational users shouldn't be pulled into what they media wants us to think, and resist being mindlessly tagged along with their own political agenda and their hopeless War on Drugs. So the florida zombie man is just one of those political propaganda, but we can't blame them for their lack of knowledge, since those commercialized legal high vendors would throw out any any newly sythzed compounds that might theoretically be recreational or mix a cocktail of RCs to try to imitate the classic narcotics. So what i meant to say is to encourage people to do their own research and educate themselves in regards to harm reduction, because those vendors who sold the bath salts are just money-grubbing companies just trying to make a quick buck and don't really give a shit about it's clientele. And in regards to the government's biased approach on educating the public of these RCs is based on a very ignorant and heavily politicized bullshit. **Sorry there, i went off in a little rant **


Now back on topic, after having great results from experimenting with MDPV with sem-responsible use, by only railing 5mg lines every 3-4 hrs and rinsing my nasals with saline solution, I came to a conclusion that this substance has a tremendous potential to be a ADHD medication. To the contrary of popular view, I find the effects to be very calming and the initial rush is what gives the slight anxiety but it is short-lived, not to mention it is quite long lasting as opposed to the prescribed ADD medications (Adderall, Dexedrine, Ritalin). Even kind of giving in to self-indulgence (hence the propensity to redose) I was able to refrain myself from taking on doses anything even remotely higher than 10mg and I would give plenty of time space out each redose, because I know that I don't need it. But it did lead to a small binge sesh, where I was up for 24+ hrs sleep deprived, but still had massive, yet smooth mental concentration. When I did finally decided not to redose anymore, I did not experience any sort of crash or go into delirium. Moments later after my last dose, I was sleeping fine, but woke up with slight headache (probably from dehydration, although I sipped on water thru out my binge and ate accordingly as I would). So I recommend anyone who wants to try out this drug, dont go over 5mg when dosing and dont redose after until 4 hrs into it, and id say only a max of 2 doses a day and ull be good to go. Sleep wasn't a problem, and apetite wasn't a problem either. Don't use PV if you want to a proper stimulant euphoria, just stick with AMPs for that, please. I wouldn't recommend daily use of pv, but just those days that you need it, like you need to get up super early and have a stacked schedule for work, errands you got to do, or whatever tasks you got to accomplish. And make sure you get your beauty sleep!

Absolutely not.


2-fma perhaps but mdpv NO NO NO


Even 2-fma is uncharted waters, but I find it to work better than dexedrine personally. Doesn't make it safe.

I found MDPV to be a shitty ADD drug. I swear crack is more effective. IMHO it's basically only good for getting high, probably why it was never developed as a pharmaceutical. But if it works for you great.

MDPV is not something you should experiment with to supplement ADD meds. Doctors are there for a reason.

Why were you binging on the substance if it has no recreational value?

**Can MDPV diminish or kill a Mephedrone "roll"?**


An acquaintance of mine has been holding a very hq batch of 4MMC (I'd even go as far as saying it's just like the stuff we have encountered during pre-ban), not going into any further detail as how this person was able to acquire such quality product, but my guess its probably refurbished from the left overs from Chinese labs or something during the time of Mephedrone's peak production. I can personally attest to this person's strong claim on this batch's quality, for I have taken some of it on a night out a couple months ago and was peaking harder than ever, intense eye wiggles, jaw clenching, and smiles all around. Not to mention the extreme energy boost and ego boost that 4MMC provides, properties that Mdma lacks. I also know that this particular batch wasn't tainted by-products or adulterated, because I did not experience any sort of crash or the depression that accompanied with it.


In retrospect, I was lucky enough to be given a chance to experience the legendary pre-ban drone, and I must admit it was an experience that I'd never forget. The combination of feeling like you're truly a super-god much like you would experience if you're snow blowing on some pre-levamisole era gold dust, free from RC adulterants, accompanied by the unique loved up euphoria that are characteristic to the empathogenic properties of Mdma, made me think think this thing is the ultimate drug! Having the best of both words. However as any user will learn, theres no such thing, and there will never be a "miracle" drug. Aware of the cardiotoxicity and the obvious neurotoxicty along with the disgusting corrosive nature of this substance proves it could be very detrimental to health, but I sure as hell wouldn't mind using it every now and then, as long as I don't over indulge and keep it to a maximum of two oral doses (one stacked initial high dosage then boost with a smaller dosage couple hrs later). IME, I've never experienced any sort of side effects from using responsibly. 


Back onto topic: So i've decided to dose some of this hq drone for a show, but I wanted something to pump me up, sorta like pre-drinking for partying, I wanted something to get me into the mood, a "pre-raving" sesh. I had some PV in a small vial stashed in my med cabinet, and at the time I thought maybe a little bump ~5mg will get the party mood going. After taking a small pump of pv, about 30 min later i parachuted about 350 mg of drone. Now, usually this is on the steeper side of the my usual initial dose, but I didn't want to redose later on in the night. And given the potency and quality of this batch, it should send me off to cloud 9 and maybe even beyond lol. I noticed that whenever I parachute substances, it drastically prolongs its onset time, usually would take me 1 hr and half to start kicking in, hence the reason I decided to do the bump of pv. I start to realize the problem, around when it was already 2.5 hrs since i dosed my drone and 3 hrs since i did pv, at this time I've felt a little bit of a drone come up but mostly masked by pv's long gradual plateau. I was excited and anticipating the drone rush and peak, but it never happened. In fact, I didn't feel anything from the drone, as if the buzz/roll has been completely killed off by MDPV. 


So here's my question: has this happened to anyone before? I tried searching BL and no results or related questions. Is it simply that the fact MDPV is such a potent stimulant it in fact masked all the effects i would have rather experienced from the Mephedrone? OR is there some kinda contradiction that relates to how the two substances affects our brain chemistry? Anyways, I was rather disappointed of the outcome and felt that I've wasted some good drone. I ended up not having as much fun at the show, as most of you who are aware, pv isn't really a social lubricant, more like antithesis of social lube lol, and i tried to resort to drinking alcohol to no avail, just felt bloated and sick. Stopped after my second beer. 


Any inputs would be much appreciated! Thanks

That was my own mistakes that I chose, and I binged cus I really had nothing better to do and just wanted to be lab rat, but I still hold my stance that it holds no recreational value, except the excessive urge to redose to chase that initial rush it gives, which tbh is a very shit rush, not all that euphoric. And because of that reason u will have made urself prone to the vicous cycle of seeking something that wasn't even there in the first place. I can get the big deal with amphetamines and esp the appeal of meth, because they can quote produce astonishing euphoria, but MDPV? c'mon guys get real here, it gives as much euphoria as maybe a light dose of dexedrine.

iirc, crystal meth is infact d-methamphetamine , same ingredient as desoxyn. So yea, if meth can be beneficial to ADD, why can't PV?

my ROA is sniffing, to my knowledge its more efficient, smoother, and not to mention much much less dangerous than IV or Vape. And I heard oral ingestion is a bunk ROA, because low bioavailablity through digestive system or something like that and you waste a big chunk of it.

Dexedrine is a recreational substance... Dextroamphetamine. So saying it has as much euphoria as a light dose of another recreational substance... where does that leave us?


There are many users on here that have experienced dreadful side effects from MDPV. 


The excessive urge to redose is what makes MDPV such a dangerous substance.


EDIT: Desoxyn is pharmaceutical grade meth, PV is not pharm grade - it's purchased from shady areas of the internet. Apples to oranges.

To answer your OP question, no it is a bad idea to use for ADD. It is similar to coke for me in that I get very fuzzy brained. Even though I am stimulated heavily, my thoughts are muddled with the intensity of the buzz. And to answer the question of meth shards and desoxyn for ADD, consider this: the methamp crystals are in likely a largish quantity as far as dose goes( buying a bag that weighs 500+ milligrams usually) and it is of unknown purity. Also the methamp is in bulk, abusable form,  possibly racemic or  with mixed r/d isomers and its very likely you would redose and/or do an unknown exact amount of meth thru a possibly more fiendish route (smoking, sniffing, etc). Desoxyn is pharm-grade d-methamp in a non abusable matrix form at a low dose. So its much easier to gauge your use and have control while also certain of your product.

So you think schools should spend taxpayer money on teaching children the proper ways to shoot up heroin, and how to properly filter their solutions? I'm just saying, you have no idea the quality of the MDPV you are getting unless you spend an outrageous amount of money sending off a sample to the lab every time you get a new sack. Trying to use a party drug therapeutically is highly irresponsible IMO. That would be like dropping acid for Parkinson's Disease. Harm reduction should only be presented to those that are already using so as to keep from peaking curiosity in individuals that wouldn't have ever dreamed of using drugs.


Don't get me wrong. I feel that the CSA of 1970 has many flaws, but do I think that people should be snorting bath salts for ADD? Hell no. And I used to be one of those "junkie tweakers" you speak of, and I have yet to experience health problems from using methamphetamine. And btw, MDPV is much worse for you than dextromethamphetamine. IIRC it's also more neurotoxic. I used to do half a gram of meth a day, and I would NEVER do MDPV.


Please do not refer to me as an ignorant fuck again.

I agree with most of what was said in response to that attack.. but MDPV is not thought to be very nuerotoxic as its a NDRI not a releaser like m-amp... just saying.

since when did i say teaching kids how to shoot up or filter their drugs? please dont put your words into 

my mouth. i meant like in lifestyle health and substance lectures they make u sit thru in high school (at least my school did). All i learnt in those classes were more about avoiding "drugs" as a whole, those who taught those classes seem totally misinformed about the basics of how psycoactive substances were , or even try to exaggerate the side effects and addiction.


plus, i wasnt even close to suggesting the use of "bath salts" for theraputic reasons, i dont know where you got that idea from. and the fact that you use term "bath salts" in reference to mdpv makes me think ur not grasping the whole picture here, the epidemic of RCs being used as substitutes because of a worldwide drought of the "classical drugs", but moreover those online vendors who more or less takes on the position as distributors , and whats more easy to reel in the cashflow? lol they remind me of the shady street dealers, who goes thru a couple mid men, so their batches could be tainted from contaminents or by products, and like shady dealers theyll cut their product with whatever they can get their hands on or make a cocktail combo mix of substances (without a damn clue about pharmocology, contraindictons, etc) just for making quick money and thier marketing strategy is to disguise their crazy cocktails in legal high colorfully designed packets with snappy catchy names, but w/o even mentioning the active compounds in them and the amount of theyve decided to put in them. so it is damn near impossible to figure out the dosages. plus your playing with ur life doing those legal high packets cus each batch may contain a completely different compound. a seasoned and knowledgable RC user would only go with a trustworthy vendor that deals directly with laboratories of their own, and would those vendors arently like the legal high companies that only market RCs , but they include a wide spectrum of labatory equipments, solvents, and non-RC chemicals. The professional vendors produce pharm grade products and comes with gc/ms sheet, documentations, and some even require u to sign a waiver, etc. 


to recap what im trying to say is... RCs are just like any other drug and deserves to be treated with respect. So it is the users responsibility to learn from the risks before even deciding to go into them and the biggest risk would be finding a trustworthy vendor. lets put it this way, a 14 yr old candy girl whos new to the rave and edm scene and would just eat any pill thrown at them sold as "e" or any capsule sold as "molly" from dealers slinging at events. bc the qualitity of pressed pills have gone to shits and half the time dont even contain any MDxx, a experienced and responsible user would never resort to purchasing pressed or go to a rave w.o having or knowing someone who has proper gear. and an experienced user would never test their limit by takin way too much, in fact one would measure out thier dosages and number of doses enought to have fun as opposed to often witnessing these candy kids floored and mangled to the point it looks like theyre eating their face in , with eyes rolled so far back they literally are watching their brains being fried.

> Since Thursday, I've been binging on PV for couple days w/o sleep, but did not suffer any of the side effects like paranoia, vasconstriction, chest pains, or stimulant induced psychosis. This was my second experience on this substance, and I must say it's really not that bad of a drug, although it holds little to no recreational value. It helped me a lot with concentration, felt like the ultimate ADD medication, I wrote like a 7 page essay without realizing it. And would be mesmerized by reading...anything that seems remotely interesting, which my sober self with attention deficit disorder would've just got up and left without finishing the first page. 
> 
> In fact, IMO and IME it is fairly safe, benign, and mundane drug, but due to it's property as a very very potent stimulant and how the substance works on the the brains reward system given it's very mild euphoria, it can pose to be very dangerous for those who are uneducated about the substance and had done little to no research before hand, especially those idiots who are out there trying to chase that "high", the initial rush (minimal, can be even compared to MPH) and end up resorting to dangerous ROAs such as slamming it or smoking it and taking on heroic doses that would just give you an 8 hr + anxiety attack and heart problems. What people need to realize is that this substance holds absolutely no recreational value, once you realize that, your mentality changes and you overly compulsive desire to redose will be greatly reduced, because you know thats all the "buzz" it can really give. And vaping or slamming the stuff would definitely give you an intense rush, akin to smoking crack, but shortly afterwards would just lead you to psychotic behavior. 
> 
> That is why I am seriously enraged about how the government and media portrays this substance, as some kind of supercrack or super meth, and repeatedly dubs it the name of "bath salts". Those commercialized vendors who sell these packaged "bath salts" or "legal highs" who used to put PV in their own personal cocktail of RC's, and prior to that they did the same shit with 4MMC. So to end of my rant, we shouldnt be so quick to judge and stigmatize MDPV as some kinda psychotic-inducing demon drug that makes you rape goats and go on these beserk violent rampages. We, as a responsible therapeutic and recreational users shouldn't be pulled into what they media wants us to think, and resist being mindlessly tagged along with their own political agenda and their hopeless War on Drugs. So the florida zombie man is just one of those political propaganda, but we can't blame them for their lack of knowledge, since those commercialized legal high vendors would throw out any any newly sythzed compounds that might theoretically be recreational or mix a cocktail of RCs to try to imitate the classic narcotics. So what i meant to say is to encourage people to do their own research and educate themselves in regards to harm reduction, because those vendors who sold the bath salts are just money-grubbing companies just trying to make a quick buck and don't really give a shit about it's clientele. And in regards to the government's biased approach on educating the public of these RCs is based on a very ignorant and heavily politicized bullshit. **Sorry there, i went off in a little rant **

> 
> 
> Now back on topic, after having great results from experimenting with MDPV with sem-responsible use, by only railing 5mg lines every 3-4 hrs and rinsing my nasals with saline solution, I came to a conclusion that this substance has a tremendous potential to be a ADHD medication. To the contrary of popular view, I find the effects to be very calming and the initial rush is what gives the slight anxiety but it is short-lived, not to mention it is quite long lasting as opposed to the prescribed ADD medications (Adderall, Dexedrine, Ritalin). Even kind of giving in to self-indulgence (hence the propensity to redose) I was able to refrain myself from taking on doses anything even remotely higher than 10mg and I would give plenty of time space out each redose, because I know that I don't need it. But it did lead to a small binge sesh, where I was up for 24+ hrs sleep deprived, but still had massive, yet smooth mental concentration. When I did finally decided not to redose anymore, I did not experience any sort of crash or go into delirium. Moments later after my last dose, I was sleeping fine, but woke up with slight headache (probably from dehydration, although I sipped on water thru out my binge and ate accordingly as I would). So I recommend anyone who wants to try out this drug, dont go over 5mg when dosing and dont redose after until 4 hrs into it, and id say only a max of 2 doses a day and ull be good to go. Sleep wasn't a problem, and apetite wasn't a problem either. Don't use PV if you want to a proper stimulant euphoria, just stick with AMPs for that, please. I wouldn't recommend daily use of pv, but just those days that you need it, like you need to get up super early and have a stacked schedule for work, errands you got to do, or whatever tasks you got to accomplish. And make sure you get your beauty sleep!

"dont redose after until 4 hrs into it," I would like to actually see if someone could use pv in an uncontrolled environment but could only have 20mg's  a day in 4 seperate doses. How would that pan out?

I'm sorry, I've had pv bindges where I wouldn't sleep for 9 days straight and I've had bindges where I have slept every night for atleast 7 hours.  Either or, still taking 20mg hits probably 15 times within a 24 hour period whether I sleep or not. The stuff isn't for medicating or treating anything. The chemical structure is like an antidepressant on steroids. Almost every pleasure center in your brain going off like crazy when you get ahold of some good pv.

I know exactly what you mean. About a year and a half ago, I spent many sundays, after being up for 3-4 days straight,  at my computer desk writing a single post like it was a novel. Erasing and re writing sentence after sentence and accidently erasing the whole thing. And would finally have the perfect post by midnight that night. Post it. Come home from work the next day and read it and remember thinking "what was the fucking point I was trying to make?" When at the time it sounded so brillant. So don't feel bad brother. Many have done the same. Including myself. SEVERAL TIMES.

I know this is totally different from most people's experiences here, but I thought I'd post it just for the sake of giving another perspective...


I got a hold of 250 mg MDPV from a reliable source and did some experimentation. When I first got it, I did a few small bumps with 15 minute intervals. I was pretty stimulated, and was still able to get to sleep after taking some etizolam. No serious cravings for it the following day, but still took a small bump in the morning to "wake up." Then I left it alone for a few days, until I got invited to go drink at a friends house. I was tired, but thought that after a bump of PV I'd be right as rain. So up the nose it went and I arrived at the party, shining. It got late and most of the people left, but there were a few more there. I convinced the person I was closest friends with to come back to my place and try some "stuff that's kinda like speed," I said. He told me he didn't want to do bath salts, because he'd done them before and hated it. I assured him that it was something else (which was a lie, but I knew that since I had pure PV he probably wouldn't know) and that he'd like it. So we started doing small lines every 30 minutes or so until sunrise talking shit all night like we were sharing our life stories with a best friend. Then the comedown started. I took a regimen of supplements for the comedown and forced myself to eat and then braced myself. There were demonic dreams, paranoia, depression, etc. I almost flushed the shit down the toilet. But my friend told me I should keep it around in case I wanted it again. So I did, and didn't touch it for a month or two. 


Once I randomly tried smoking it off foil but I have no technique so that was a bit of a failure. And one other time I took a decent bump before going out to a bar since I was tired and didn't think I'd make it through the night if I didn't. 


And most recently, I took a bump to get me through one more day of college. 

My conclusions on this drug is that it is only useful if used sparingly. Like once or twice a month, separated by at least a week or two. The comedown can be somewhat harsh, so I take phenibut shortly after the peak to help keep away the crazy feelings. It's not the cleanest stimulant, but if used in small doses, it can help you stay awake and be productive. Never done meth before, but this seems like a dirty version of that. The only time I really experienced any kind of euphoria I could enjoy on this drug was the time I binged all night, but that euphoria in no way was worth the comedown and aftereffects. This is a good pick-me-up for emergency situations when the dextroamphetamine tolerance is too high and you've got shit to do. If you redose more than one time, you'll feel especially shitty during the comedown.


I'd describe the comedown as feeling like an empty, used shell. A slight sinking in the heart, tiredness, hot hands, maybe flushed face as well. Phenibut or a benzo helps smooth out the comedown a bit, but you still have to be prepared for it. If you've got PV, then this is the way I'd use it effectively. Still haven't even gone through half of the 250 mg bag yet. If you're thinking of acquiring it, I say don't bother. Find some good clean meth, since I've heard it's alot smoother and clean feeling than PV. Or just find some prescription dextroamphetamine. 


Anyways, sorry for the super long post. Just thought I'd give my 2 cents to the discussion and maybe help some people out. 

Keep it real, stay safe.

So I have moderate experience with pv, huge experience with stims and opiods. I was prescribed tussionex recently, and have gotten my tolerance down quite a bit, it takes about 20-30mg hydro for me to feel a buzz, I get nodding off about 50. Is pv and hydrocodone a good combo? Kinda like a speedball? I am wondering, anyone have experience?

The stuff became illegal in the states *right* as I was about to try it for the first time. Sort of glad though.. I've heard some nasty horror stories about IV MDPV and I know my history with shooting coke, so I think I would have been fucked.

Yea scag, I only smoke/snort it and its super feindy, worse than coke because with pv, you don't realize how hard you were feinding till its all gone and you are scraping the bag haha. Best to stay away from any RC iv. It's too risky.

Yeah I heard it's a really compulsive drug. The urge to redose constantly being very very strong. One of the other OD mod's, Zneg, had a rough experience with it and basically told me to stay the fuck away from it, hah. Glad I heeded that advice because IV coke ruined me enough.

It is what used to be the MAIN ingredient in "bath salts", however, "bath salts" can mean anything (from actual active RC's to nothing active at all). It is completely illeagel in the US now so it isn't in "bath salts" anymore and almost every smoke shop/head shop whatever doesn't even sell "bath salts" anymore.

hahah yes. But headshops and other stores would label RC's as "bath salts" so they could take advantage of a legal loophole to sell them.

Shit, that's why they called it reefer madness. Faces getting eating off weekly. That same strain is back, be careful what you smoke. Faces getting eaten all over the place. Scary times for weed smokers. Stick with OTC bath salts . Shits safe, dog.

**Please read my story before using Bath Salts or MDPV-medical/psychological accounts**


I have always been a 'pothead' since I was 12. At 16 I was introduced to MDPV or "bath salts". I am 18 now, sober, and have been to detox and a 28 day program. I am going to a 6 week substance abuse treatment center next week to continue staying clean. I highly recommend one reading this before trying the stimulant. Every aspect of my using is discussed in this. Even if you don't use I think this can be highly educational. I wish someone would to a research study on me so more solid evidence of what mdpv does and is can exist.


Let me first say that MDPV completely controlled my life, thoughts, actions, friends, everything. I started using MDPV by insufflating and thats how I used it every time. The feeling of snorting a stimulant is that of none other. When I was in rehab people would think I was weird for wanting to stick something up my nose, but I did miss the feeling. I had gotten into the stimulant because I was using ADHD pills/amphetamines and they were frankly too expensive and too hard to get and too much risk of an overdose. The reason ADHD pills are lesser than MDPV/Bath Salts are because you can overdose on them. I never overdosed on bath salts, but I fucked up my body doing them. Consequences I am still suffering with today. I would snort MDPV and I would snort a lot of it. Atleast 20-100 mg at the beginning each line. I highly recommend if you are using MDPV you figure out how 'potent' your substance is. My MDPV was not that potent, and I could snort large ammounts of it, but if you go on erowid the recommended dose is max 15 mg. So make sure you test out your MDPV and try it 10 mg at a time if you do decide to use after reading this. During my use, I would go to high school, come home and use all afternoon and night. I would use as much as I could before school, but it would wear off by the end of the day and I was completely wiped out. But I would get home and use again. This is an incredibly vicious cycle, when people say redosing happens a lot on MDPV THEY FUCKING MEAN IT! You literally will use it every chance you get every hour on the hour if you have enough and are an addict like myself.


 Now during my light to moderate periods of using MDPV/Bath Salts I had incredible gastrointestinal problems. The reason why? The Stimulant. When you snort MDPV it doesn't dissolve into your nose, some of it does but most of it doesnt. So you have to take a huge sniff of tap water and snort that and swallow it into your tummy. Let me say, MDPV takes like fucking shit. It tastes so bad it will make your stomach literally shrivel up and die. MDPV gives you the feeling that sleep and EATING is unneccessary. So when I did eat (Maybe once a day or every two days) I would eat a big McDonalds meal when I was coming down and my body was so unused to food being in their, and the bath salts messing with my GI lining that I would fall asleep for 12 hours immediatly after I ingested any food. So what did I do? I stopped eating all together. The bath salts made me not want to eat and if i did eat I got to fucking tired to use so I just stopped. For about 8 months I ate close to nothing, I slept maybe a couple hours a week. The hilarious thing is that I was so blinded by the drug that I thought it was helping me, I told my dealer I needed it to live. Which technically is true. Because when you use bath salts/mdpv it is a fucked up cycle of using, using, using, not sleeping, not sleeping, not sleeping, and then having to USE MORE just to function from the lack of sleep. 


At about the 2-3 month mark of using MDPV I developed extreme paranoia. I would hear cars on the highway and think they were coming to my house. I would check the windows every 10 minutes. This is the point where MDPV stopped being a stimulant that helped me do school work and stay up late having fun, I would literally lose my focus every 5-10 minutes. I had a thousand projects or things I was doing at once, none of them ever got completed though. And your memory on bath salts? Combined with lack of sleep you will develop.. it goes to shit. I could not remember what I had just read a few minutes ago. I was failing all my classes. At first bath salts is like an ADHD pill in it makes you sharp, focused, social, stimulated... but once you start redosing (and you will I promise) the lack of sleep and effects the MDPV is doing on your brain will be unbearable to your memory. Also, once your paranoia develops, you will not trust anyone ANYONE. So the socialness of the stimulant is gone and masked by being so scared of getting caught or that your being watched/followed that you will disengage from all social events, friends, anyone who is trying to or was close to you.  Atleast it did for me


Let me tell you about the mood swings. This drug will kill anyone close to you. I literally was a complete bitch, stole money, lied, deceitful, and hateful. If my family caught me in a good moment .. right after using.. then I would be all cool and nice. If they caught you while you were trying to use or hadnt used in a while... I went complete ape shit on them. I was so angry and mean and self centered. All i could think about was using again. And in the heavy using it will get bad. Because youll want to use every hour. And people will want to hang out with you or check on you or talk to you, and your trying to be sneaky and use, and youll be totally paranoid and angry if they 'bug' you. I went to Europe for a week after using MDPV for quite a long time. My father almost took me to the ER in london several times because I would sleep for 22 hours a day. Wake up and eat maybe go out for an hour and then sleep some more. I had no idea at the time that my "life saving" drug was causing such fatigue and malnutrition. I had some ADHD meds on the trip so I managed to stay awake for half of it for the most part. 


When I got back from Europe thats when I started going down. I got home from the trip immediatly said I needed to 'shower' and I used more than I have ever used even when redosing. My body being unused to it for a week, I immediatly threw up and got a nose bleed. I would say I used about 200 mg that time. And I used 200mg + every time I used from that point on. I was so scared I had lost the drug for a week that I made up for it by using more than I have ever used in my life with it.  I didn't sleep for atleast a week after I got back. And my paranoia got so bad I started stapling blankets to my windows so people (who weren't looking) couldn't see in. I started to say things to my family like there's a man outside the house watching me, and I would tell them GO LOOK HE'S THERE. And they told me no one was there.  I had developed psychosis from MDPV and bath salts.  One night, I was withdrawing, incredibly sick...and was sick of being scared. Scared= thinking my house was bugged, seeing and hearing people talk behind windows and curtains, and thinking their were people in my basement waiting to kill me and watching me. I truly believed all those things at the time. I was so scared I told my mom about all my suspicions and she was like WTF? And then I just told my family I was abusing MDPV and had been lying to them this whole time.  


I couldn't get into detox and rehab for a week after I told them. So they obviously didn't let me use,  and I withdrew at the house basically. Withdrawal from MDPV is not bad the first week.. because you will just sleep then. It was while i was in detox/rehab that was absolutely miserable about this drug. So for about a week I slept 20-23 hours a day, woke up to eat food, and went back to sleep. I could not physically walk my body was like jello so my family had to help me use the bathroom and shower. When I went to the hospital I had to use wheel chair assist because I had lost every bit of muscle mass in my body. I was 97 lbs and 5 '8 (Female).  In 'detox' I mostly slept. However I wouldn't call it much of a detox place because they released me to the substance abuse program and I had Post Acute Withdrawal and more withdrawal shit their for a month. And I would like to point out to everyone there is no 'medical research' or whatever bullshit of what MDPV withdrawal is like. So they gave me no medicine and I had to deal with the side effects as they scratched their head and said wow thats interesting. 


So the 'real' withdrawal after I had gotten a tremendous ammount of rest was brutal. I had skin crawling my skin would shake without my arms moving. I had tremors and mild seizures. I would wake up in the morning and my arm would be twitching and spasming and I didn't even no it. The body spasms are embarassing. Its like you have terrets and you throw your hands out wildly and your legs convulse out. I also could not put my hands down from my body, it was like they were stuck in t-rex mode, they would not relax. So dyskenisia and other weird shit. The worst. Absolute worst.. was the mental feeling. I was so used to doing a thousand things at once and multitasking that I was completely restless to a point where I would walk around in circle outside for hours. Just walking or pacing back and forth because my mind was used to going a thousand miles a minute and my body too. But my body was still moving at that 1000 mph. The physical discomfort was painful. When I first got to the hospital I could not make out a sentence verbally that made sense. My mind was exhausted and I would try to think of things but I couldn't put together a sentence. I also could barely walk.. Within 3 weeks my motor functions improved. I could talk basically like a normal functioning person and could move around pretty well. As far as medical issues I had a lot because of this drug. For two months my PULSE was 130 resting. I had abnormal EKGS. My liver functions were so bad and damaged that I was diagnosed with non infectious viral Hepatitis. I was sent to the ER a few times because they thought my liver was failing. I also developed Mono/Epstein Barr Virus because my immune system was so weak. I would have night sweats so bad that I would have to change my sheets a couple times atleast each night, it would look like I had run a marathon I was so drenched in sweat. Also, I would get fevers (probably linked to the mono) and my nose would run so much that it was hard for me to eat. I had to hold a napkin to my nose while i ate. 


So my doctors thought I had damaged my heart, but after a few months being off the drug my pulse and heart function went back to normal. As well as my liver issues resolved. The harmful effects this drug does to your body is outstanding. I am a first hand survivor of it. The withdrawal and health problems you can develop when you become addicted to this drug are not worth it. The drug will kill you before you kill yourself from the paranoia and psychosis you can get from it. The redosing and vicious cycle of this drug make it in my opinion unmanageable. Please take my word for it. If you want any advice, help, or have any questions about this drug or recovery please ask. MDPV is the love of my life. I would use it all day everyday if I had more than one life. But I Only have one, mine, and sometimes "if you love something, give it away"


P.S. I am a female and this drug did improve my sex drive

 It is true that you can become violent and incredibly angry on this drug, I did if I ever got caught or told not to use

How do people who get addicted to this rate their "normal" life? I have enough, but I hate delaying sleep more than a couple of hours and rarely indulge in more than lets say 25 mg. I have to say my sober life is quite stimulating, so I can imagine this being some kind of environmental enrichment case. I honestly have a hard time believing some of the stories I read on here.


I would like to see whether there is a correlation between being (somewhat of) an mdpv addict and having a nonfulfilling life, so if you are (somewhat) addicted, please respond ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Silly bath salts lol that one would never fly here in Sweden. People would bombard authorities with angry letters untill you were forced to stop selling it. You'd probably be the subject of random newspapers coming to harass you as if you were the devil too.


MDPV -> methylphenidate with worse comedown and more compulsive redosing, only reason to buy this is if you are cheap ass really. This drug lasts quite some time in relative to cost. I don't see why on earth anyone would do it though it nor for UA problems or lack of better substances/money.


Oh well, to each their own, if you like it it must be great cause it's cheap as hell and available easily.

Tried this shit a couple of years ago, maybe longer now actually. To get to the point, it was fucking horrible. It started off magnificently but it got way too intense. I ended up going somewhat psychotic, could barely think, or string up a sentence, felt like a zombie. Couldn't get to sleep all night, I got out of my bed in the morning finally given up on trying to get to sleep, and realised that my bed was covered in a pool of sweat. Fucking awful stuff.

They are still here just not called bath salts, many webpages still sell MDPV with it's correct labeling.

5 mg should be adequate.  10 mg is likely to be too much by IV, at least until you develop a tolerance.  Then again I'm not sure how comfortable you are with your heart feeling constricted and jumpy.

I don't know if it was the quality of the Mdpv or what but a few years ago I use to get the tannish color chemical and I would do crazy amounts of oral doses ( 100mg ) which of course I had a tolerance but that would have me super speedy and euphoric for about 4 hours and then about 2 hours of comedown. I've also experimented with various batches of a-pvp using the same 100mg oral dose. Has anybody else tried this and have had decent results?

No, but after all these horror stories, I think MDPV is one of the most forgiving stims if you dont redose more than once or twice. Theres no vasoconstriction like with speed, not insanely euphoric, but yeah...just feeling good. 100mg sounds very much to me, but 5mg snorted picks me up, 10mg is too much, like side effect wise, high pulse, anxiety.

I just ordered 500mg of this stuff. Tried it once before, snorted, but wasn't really impressed. It was cheap and I'm just curious of the WOW effects. I have plenty of experience with all sorts of drugs, rather high amphetamine tolerance. What would a good dose be when smoked? I have a mg scale.

"Importantly, MDPV is at least **10 times more potent ****than cocaine in assays measuring motor hyperactivity and cardiovascular stimulation in vivo**."


"Two of the most serious side-effects of bath salts ingestion in human users are acute tachycardia and hypertension (Rosset al, 2011; Spiller et al, 2011). Here we  compared  the  effects  of  MDPV  and  cocaine  on cardiovascular parameters in conscious rats. Similar to its effects on other in vivo endpoints, MDPV is more potent than cocaine in its ability to increase heart rate and blood pressure...


Our preclinical findings may have important implications for people who take bath salts products for recreational purposes. The potent blockade of dopamine uptake caused by MDPV predicts that the drug has a high risk for abuse, whereas the potent blockade of norepinephrine uptake portends dangerous cardiovascular stimulation."

No shit, I think everyone knows by now that MDPV is much more potent than cocaine.
