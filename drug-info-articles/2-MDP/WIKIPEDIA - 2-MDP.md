2-MDP (U-23807A) is a dissociative anaesthetic drug which has been found to be an NMDA antagonist and produces similar effects to PCP in animals. The levo or (−)-isomer is the active form of the drug. It also has stimulant effects, having only around one third the potency of amphetamine by weight, but with a long duration of action, lasting more than 24 hours from a single oral dose.

## Effects

The therapeutic action is said to exhibit appetite suppressant- and antidepressant-like activity.

## Synthesis

In a variation of the nitrile-aldol reaction, combination of benzophenone (1) and propionitrile (2), in the presence of sodamide base and ethyl ether solvent, leads to 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-3,3-diphenylpropanenitrile (3). The reduction of the intermediate nitrile group with lithium aluminium hydride completes the synthesis of 2-MDP (4).
