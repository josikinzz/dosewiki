[Here's a paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2044905/pdf/brjpharm00701-0094.pdf) comparing it to some common opiates in mice. Looks like it's roughly equivalent to morphine.


In your position I'd take a needle-tip sublingual dose to rule out the vaguest possibility of ultra-potency and then titrate up from a low morphine dose.

Well that's comforting, I'm stepping in a land where only mice have stepped before? Not sure I want to do this anymore, sounded good when it was talked about. I'll wait til someone with a bit of chemistry can tell me if this is dangerous. No offense, but the suggestion was a great one for dosage... now the question is, is this safe?

Try another forum - there are quite some experiences with various dosages, mostly between 10mg and 100mg where 100mg is strong and 10mg is particulary weak. Oral.


Also check if you've got freebase - smoking this compound has been reported, with very good results. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Asking the chemist he got it from


smoking it would be much safer

Well definitely don't test an un-tested novel opioid directly in your veins.  Start very small; titrate up incrimentally.  And maintain a sharp awareness of any adverse or unexpected side effects.

Theres been opiate RC's available for a while..


Hmm anyone chamical savvy wanna hazard a guess with the different BA's for different ROA's? I think this requires further research ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


A Few reports from other sites:


**

> **(60mg intranasally) Once again the lingering burning sensation was reported to be present after insufflation in the nostrils and in the back of the throat, though it was a lot more painful in the back of the throat most likely due to the larger quantity ingested. Subject stated "imagine the worst case of strep throat you've ever had" though after about 8-10 minutes of agony the analgesic effects began to kick in and the pain subsided. There was no rush and the effects were as described as last time but stronger. Except unlike tramadol it didn't produce lots of psychological energy like was noticed in the previous trial so the assumption regarding that effect can probably be ruled as a placebo. It was not sedating like codeine/morphine is or energizing like oxy/hydrocodone are, more of some where in between, alertly relaxed would be the perfect words to describe it. The physiological effects were no more apparent than 100-150mg of tramadol (not ODT) but lasted around 5-6 hours which was a major plus. Another 40mg booster was administered intranasally at about the 7-8 hour mark after initial dosing which resulted in an renewal of the previously felt effects except now the subject says it is itching worse than 20mg of Oxycodone (non-tolerant) would produce**.
> 		
> Click to expand...


> **Anyways the first test trial began like the usual new substances do, with 1-3mg dosed for an allergy test. After 30 minutes no noticeable effects were present. 20mg was than administered intranasally, burn was no worse than MXE but had a definitively noticeable lingering burn on the nostril and back of throat for around 6-8 minutes. Multiple things were used in an attempt to alleviate the burning sensation such as drinking water, water mixed with baking soda, and milk. None of which seemed to provide any long term relief, I would suggest against this a ROA for any trial. (20-/+5mg insufflated) The psychological euphoria was fairly pleasurable and the physiological warm "stoning" feeling that most opiates give was minimal to mild at best, most comparable to 5-10mg Oxycodone in the latter catagory and lasted about 1/2 to 3/4 as long (30-1:00min) while the psychological effects were more comparable to tramadol in that it produced lots of energy and gave an urging desire to do things while still feeling content and relaxed. Another 15mg was administered orally around 1 hour after the inital 20mg with minimal to no effects felt from the booster (15mg).Summary: Overall it is definitely a unique substance which I could see becoming very popular if it was available for around the cost of high quality MXE ($35-45.00 gram) though at the current prices I would no sooner pay for that than I would 600 grams of some Bali Kratom for the same price. I gave it to two other subjects at 25 & 35mg doses, the one who took the 35mg already had a minor opiate tolerance while the other one with 25mg had none at all, neither of them stated they experienced effect any stronger than the feeling tramadol and kratom are able to produce by themselves. The vendor I ordered from was excellent in customer service and I received the package in the estimated time at the promised weigh in (1g), sadly its just not that great of a substance for the price he is offering at. Especially when you consider the toxic possibilities it might have. Though if anyone is interested I would be willing to part with 500mg of mine if your interested (PM). **

70mg shot, headrush ha feels good man


Mm finally getting somewhere with this one, pity i've run out of some to play with, woke up earlier in mild withdrawals (only been using various opis for 3 days man wtf ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) but feel completely better now, no amazing rush from pinning it but a nice warm rush with legs, now i've got the energy to go buy some heating for my place! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


Not itching or owt either, feels on a par with a medium dose of oxy

I think people are expecting too much from this one, most of the reports mention it's a very good painkiller, however, it lacks euphoria.

I really want to know more about this one, as o-desmethyltramadol is the only other opioid RC that I know of and would love to know if this maybe compares to fentanyl or something similar.

**WELCOME TO THE AH7921 MEGATHREAD**


*Since this is quickly turning into a mega-thread like thread, here's the structure and Wikipedia link, thanks to C.H*


[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AH-7921](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AH-7921)


![AH-7921_structure.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2F7%2F74%2FAH-7921_structure.png&hash=7adef848e5534e3787066d6f941e8ea1)


I have just ordered 1 gram of the Novel Pschoactive Substance AH 7921 which is an Opiod and said to be similar to Morphine and simililar potency.


What could of stater dosage should I try? I have quite a high Opiod tolerance, drinking Poppy Tea on a daily basis with dosages varying from tea using 65 g up to 130 g, the former maintenance dose and the lattter for when I want to get high, my average dose uses 95-100 g of poppy grounds.


Has any one else tried out this substance?


It is quite pricey, the order cost *NO PRICES*


Regards


KHH

Sorry for the long post, but I have an ill-informed and paradoxical answer for you.  The mods'll probably slap you down for mentioning the price, which is against the rules  in OD - but Mods, ye high and exalted ones, could this thread please remain open once you've snipped the price?  Seems like a lot of threads are getting shut down these days in pretty arch tones, and this one concerns a little-known substance that merits discussion.  


Searching the net turns up limited and contradictory info on AH-7921: animal studies and forum threads that peg the potency, compared to morphine, at anywhere from 80% to equipotent to '30-40 times stronger but less likely to cause tolerance and addiction' - that last from a wiki piece on 'dermorphin', which it uses interchangeably with the name AH-7921, citing this reference, : ^ Broccardo M, Erspamer V, Falconieri Erspamer G, et al. (1981). "Pharmacological data on dermorphins, a new class of potent opioid peptides from amphibian skin". Br. J. Pharmacol. 73 (3): 625–31. PMC 2071698. PMID 7195758. [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=2071698](http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=2071698).


So I think there may be some confusion here, as other forums disccuss AH-7921 as a synthetic easily cooked up by non-chemists.  Either way, given the ambiguity, START SMALL.  Like 1mg or less (if you don't have scales that sensitive, RC opiods are Russin roulette with dum-dums).  Eyeballing this stuff is a suicide attempt, even if you know and trust the lab - potency is highly uncertain, and your system's  swimming in morphine anywy.  But the various conflicting threads and journal pieces make it clear that nothing's clear about this stuff - it's stronger than codeine, weaker than fentanyl, may have a higher oral BA than morphine, and may be less inclined to build tolerance and addiction, IF it's synthetic AH-7921, as opposed to te naturally accuring version found in certain ampibians.  Bear in mind that freak deaths sometimes occur from OTC meds, RCs are playing chance with your neurotransmitters, and RC opiods are, to my mind, best avoided, as they're probably either weak or lethally strong at 'normal doses'.    Given the ambiguity about this one, I suggest making a solution of 1mg/1mls, starting with an an allergy dose of less than half a ml at that concentration, then 1mg if there's no allergic reaction, and if that (as it probably will), has a limited or negligible effect effect, titrate upwards SLOWLY.  Keep an anti-histamine at hand as a precaution, but don't use it to frontload/potentiate.   You're dealing with a substance of unknown strength - better to underdose than die for a buzz.   


But syth'd AH-7921, as opposed to the amphibian variety is claimed to be very easy to make, and 80% - 105% as potent as morphine.  This tells you nothing about your tolerance and appropriate dose, because pod grinds' weight doesn't tell us their morphine content, which varies crop to crop, pod to pod and strain to strain.  Start with 1mg, give it at least two hours before redosing, and be patient - bear in mind, pods have a very long half-life, so you won't be starting from baseline (or rather, your baseline's swimming in morphine).   You may have had good experiences with this source, but that doesn't mean you can rest assured they pulled off a perfect synth.   You may not even have received the right compound - they may have produced a near-relative of drasticlly different potency or BA, and you can't be sure of purity.  So you don't know what you have (except  an opiod habit),and should go into this with maximum caution.  Ingest orally, find an effective solvent (water should work - unless you got the frog stuff), and start small, dosing up by increments.  Be prepared to get through half the material, before arriving - or not - at  a sweet spot - as you increase dose, if necessary, but never take hundreds of mgs at a time.  You migh get to a  full-blown morphin' power range....


But if you've been on pods at those doses for a while, and it's not te 30 - 40x times stronger stuff, it's not going to be that amazing even if 99% pure.  Pods contain a lot of alkaloids in addition to M & ccodeine, and the witdrawal can be as harsh as coming off pharms or street H - and much longer-lasting.  So if this is the 80%-as-strong or morphine equipotent stuff, it won't hit all that hard.  You have to treat it like potentially fatal, high-power uber-opiate, 'cos it's an RC from an overseas lab, and lots of people have died from those, whatever their tolerance, and this is a basically unknown substance.  But pod habits are as serious as H or morph (they are morph, amongst other things), and if you're on decent quality pods, your tolerance may be pretty high. They're also expensive, and seem to leave a permanent base tolerance - it goes down some, but not all that much, with abstinence.  I never had a daily pod habit, but owing to their long half-life, still went through withdrawals when I switched to pharms for reasons of access and economy - and I just got through 600mgs of morph over three days, with a day off inbetween, and over a gram of codeine plus potentiators and benzos in the mix. (That's context, not dick-sizing) I realise the above (and I'm still high, so forgive the rambling) seems contradictory, but you have to treat RC opiates as potentially much more potent than pods or  pharms - carelessness can equal death, especially when there are such wildly differing claims as to the potency of AH-7921.    


So go VERY carefully, leave plenty of time between redosing, start at 1mg and go up by small increments, but be prepared to be underwhelmed.  I've taken 100s of of mgs on morph while wearing fent patches, popping xanax and eating dhc (that's why I'm rich and famous - oh, yeah, that's right, my life's a fucking mess), but the only times I've come close to OD'ing have been from strong batches of pods, drinking tea impatiently because of the slow come-up.  And....the other bad news.  The same amount of morph proper would have cost a whole lot less at UK street prices, without going into specifics.  


So treat it like carfentanyl, because RC opiods can be anything at all (you have no idea, for example, how the thebaine in the pods you're taking will interact with AH-7921, they could radically potentiate each other), and *don't* eyeball doses - but you may find it was $200 you would have got a lot more out of spent on pods).  


Sorry for gibbering - I had a sleepless night, decided to finish off my opiates  at 4am, and 150mgs morph + 600 mgs codeine has me long-winded and babbling.  Those are obviously pretty high doses, and on the occasions I near-od'd from pods, they were doses of about 500mgs, so my tolerance may be higher and you might have 5 or ten wonderful experiences in tht gram...but I don't think it's been used enough in humans for anyone to give you a definitive answer.  (I'm not proud of my tolerance, I'm just very stupid when it comes to moprhia, and moving in with my mom in  a few weeks to be in an environment where I'll HAVE to detox) Given the extent of uncertainty, personally, I'd try to find a way to cancel the order and get a refund: or at least abstain from pods for a few days before sampling the AH - the long half-life of pods gives you a grace period before sickness kicks in.)  


So play safe, whatever you do, and hope you get something positive from the experience.

I know where you purchased this, but its because someone has yet to snip the pricetag you left. I really think you should do what the above poster said. CANCEL AND GET A REFUND. I am not saying its probably not infact what it is said to be, but why are you going to try a synthetic opio with Zero information on it. I was watching this supplier you bought this from as I to was interested in what the hell this was, but consider it like this. Do you Really need that? You have pods which I would much rather waste money on. I dont see this as being safe. I really think the supplier sounded a bit like a fiend as well and I am not burning on that I just think if you pursue this you should do it with scales, no other drug in system not even weed, and do Not do it if you cannot find a watcher. I know theres some shady research suppliers that noone would even suspect as being unreliable. I can tell you right now theres a lot of bad seeds and a majority of suppliers should be best avoided if at all costs. Unless you're buying something with information,data, and some kind of human history be prepared for the worse. I was pretty shocked this supplier actually finished this product up and is not distributing it to various customers which is really really risky for them. Just be forwarned.

If this is actually the compound it's claimed to be, I would utilise only oral admin. and be very careful with your dosing.


I strongly doubt that this compound is dermorphin-like, but I bet an opi-naive person can get incredibly sick off 100mg or less.

I am very curious about this. Too bad it is priced as if it were a Schedule I (not giving a number, just making reference). I wonder if it is a more sedating opioid vs a mania type opioid like oxycodone or high-thebaine content pod tea. If it's the latter I'll definitely check this out at some point as an occasional treat. I don't care for the sedating opis, I like the oxycodone-like ones that make me wanna write a 10 page manifesto and go into a problem solving loop LOL.

I used my micro scale tried 60 mg as a starter dose, then 70mg as bit later, some effect, feeling a bit more serene andd and anasthetic effect.   I have a high tolerance so don't know if this is low quality.

Okay, so you are recognizing an opioid buzz from 130mg in two staggered doses per your post (no other opioids in your system, or did you imbibe in some ppt this morning)? Just to be crystal ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I find the pods effect varying from sedating or energizing.  The former more likely if I go to bed after taking.  More energising when I'm at work, guess the caffeine of occasional Modadinil.  Though some pods make me wanna lay down and I often sleep a few hours, or sometimes wanna fet up after less than an hour and do things.


Did have a maintenance dose this afternoon, and some Etiolam.  I would have expected the AH 7921 to have had more effect.

Honestly, if the pharmaceutical companies were to look for a novel painkiller, THIS would be THE painkiller. For some reason it was **very** effective in killing pain for me, while you can't really get "high" or "stoned" on it. At most what you get is somewhat antidepressive opioid effect and a mood boost.

Had a few tries. Once 30mg rectal, doesn't work at all. Once 30mg sublingual. Once 50mg sublingual.


I'd say 40mg sublingual dose is good for start. Take care, it doesn't seem to like each other with your teeth. 


Effects were best after 50mg sublingual, I haven't tried any higher dose. Sublingual seems to be the way to go with this chemical. 


The effects include mood boost (sometimes **huge**, however, be careful about it. You may feel like being *completely sober*, while acting like you're totally on something due to that mood boost. It's not euphoria, however it's so 'subtle', 'inside of you', that I once forgot that I took this compound at all), opiate "content and calm" feeling in your head, little "warmth". Almost no body high whatsoever. The painkiller qualities are however... Amazing. Comparing to other opioids, this one would produce much subtler effects, not a really euphoric state that you'd want to achieve just for the sake of it, as it is with typical opioid addiction, **IMO.**.

I suppose you haven't tried AH-7921... It produces **no CNS depression at all**. Heart rate same as before taking. **No sleepyness at all, no any after effects or coming down.**


Tell me if you need anything else.

Disappointing for us drug-users, maybe yes. I had expectations, AH-7921 neither had met them or disappointed me. It's somewhere in between. 


For someone who wants to kill pain without risking big-time opioid addiction this could be a worthwhile compound to further investigate.

No, of course not! Pethidine and fentanyl where not RC's when first discovered in a lab by **researchers **working on new **chemicals** to be used as opioid analgesics.

I've read different versions of that. AH-7921 may be very unlike morphine-type opioids, but whether fentanyl or pethidine are more or less pleasurable than dope, it is a matter of taste.

Agree with above two posters. I've met people who loved opiates that everyone else hated, and vice versa. It totally depends on the individual. And with that in mind, I'm interested in AH7921. It's not cheap and the delivery cost is ridiculous (approaching a similar amount as the product itself), but I will give it a whirl because RCs are truly like Pokemon - gotta smash 'em all. 


I liked O-desmethyltramadol a lot the one time I managed to get hold of it. It's wasn't the strongest or best opiate I ever tried, but I liked it's clean and energetic high and thought it deserved to hold a place amongst the ranks of all other opioids. I guess I'm like a wine buff who likes to sample everything. 


I look forward to hearing more from the guys who have trialled it already... keep up the interesting posts![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Every post I have read about this drug the user has been let down. It's a waste of $. Sam,e with O-desmethyltramadol..unless you have zero tolerance there is just no comparison to H. Even pure diacetylmorphine I have read people were let down adn it just didn't compared to good east coat white powdere dope. 


While it would be suype rcool for there to be a good RC full agonist opiate, I don't see it happening any time soon.

Diacetylmorphine is heroin. I used to live on the east coast (and man do I miss that dope, or at least I would if I was using), and to hear you say that pure diacetylmorphine (i.e. pure heroin) doesn't compare to "good east coast white powder dope" makes no sense to me. Could you please explain?

*Edit: I think you are totally right man.. I mean the pure pharm grade and also street stuff.. both are derived from opium right? Maybe the chemical process used to purify/obtain the final product is different depending how pure or what type of dope like #4 or #3. I mean either way I would think pharm pure diacytel would still be the best product..  Hopefully someone who is not talking out their ass like me can chime in lol*


I don't have a good explanation lol..wish I did. Honestly you are probably right..but the reason I said that was I remember a few random posts, one regarding the heroin assisted treatment in Switzerland where you get 1 or 2 pharm grade diacetylmorphine injections daily. I thought I remembered people saying that the high was lacking/different compared to a good shot of street dope. 


It was something about street heroin containing more opiate-wise than just diamorphine base,the acetyl-codeine/acetyl-morphine/monoacetylmorphine/and more minor alkaloids like thebaine/oripavine etc.. Honestly i am not sure if there is any truth to that. 


Thinking back I remember these 5mg diacetylmorphine tablets popping up that a lot of people were trying out but I think people were mostly let down because if they were trying to sniff a solid dose like 50mg (which is around what you get in a street bag thats a .1) it meant crushign up mad pills and there was just a lot of inactive powder. If they were pure 5mg pills no binders or whatever it prob would have been a different story.


Maybe someone can confirm this.. but I don't think the heroin sold on the streets is made from pharmaceutical grade diacetylmorphine. Or uses the same proces a lab does to create diacetylmorphine. 


There is actually another site out of pakistan with a LOT of reviews on safeorscam, and they sell a kilo of powder diacytelmorphine for about half what the dea says a kilo of dope costs, or maybe less than half. In my head I was thinking whats the need for all the poppy fields and bullshit if you can buy pure diacytel pharm grade shit, cant you just make dope otu of that, or isnt it dope already? But if I remember correctly the street heroin is made from poppys etc.. 


Honestly I would love for someoen with better knowledge to chime in.. I am talking out of my ass. I really don't know. I am sure pure diacytel is fuckin ballin as hell lol. It was probably the 5mg pills people were just let down with.


The o-tram though I know has pretty negative reviews all over the web for opiate tolerant people.

I totally agree. Without or with a low tolerance O-Desmethyltramadol can be very enjoyable. In my opinion better than Tramadol because it lacks the nasty "Serotonin-fuck".


On topic: I'm gonna receive a 250mg Sample next week from a trusted vendor. I have a low tolerance from using Tilidin and Kratom once in a while, so I'll be very careful.


Is there data regarding the solubility available?

Very soluble in water. easily dissolved 50mg in 5ml; pretty sure 1ml would have done fine but I tend to go for the "more volume = better absorption" rule.


The batch currently available from a well-known UK vendor burns like fuck! Nasal, rectal, sublingual, injection, I would avoid. Eating seems the only option.


My bowels rejected the chemical twice due to irritation, I was in agony for 15 minutes after sniffing some. Dissolve it in wine seems to work, I will need to conduct further experiments  orally to confirm a dose.


Don't plug, sniff or inject this batch if you don't want to be in a lot of pain.

Thank you very much knockando. Especially for the warning regarding the corrosive nature of the chemical. Did you have to puke after eating or sniffing it?

Nevertheless the bioavailabilities via different ROA's would be pretty relevant. Although I hate sniffing, only plugged 2c-b once and will never shoot up^

No, didn't puke. Eating it had no undesired effects at all. Sniffing burnt to buggery, and it seemed like it would burn forever! I sniffed water to try and wash it away and relieve the pain, probably helped but I was still in agony for a good while after. Didn't seem to cause any actual tissue damage that I can tell, unlike camfetamine which gave me a chemical burn (sublingually). But this felt much worse (acutely) than camfetamine, and I'm happy to plug camfetamine, though I won't plug this again!


Unfortunately I can't say much about the desired effects. I'd drunk a bottle of wine by the time I'd finished my dosing. I am pretty sure I felt some opioid effects but I can't promise it.

Ok, that's good news. Although I read another report about sublingual use that only mentions extrem bitterness and a tingling sensation I'm still not sure if I should try this only other route desirable for me besides oral ingestion (probably butchering english grammar here). 


I've never used opiates/opioids when I was drunk, but the opposite, drinking on an "Opi-Buzz", always destroyed the fine high and just wastes you in an uncomfortable way. In my experiences at least. 

However, looking forward to more reports and I'll try to contribute as well.

Not touched opiates in about 5 months. Started off with a 0.5mg test dose yesterday (sublingual) and it is indeed fairly corrosive even at those levels. No noticeable effects other than a sore tongue. Tried 10mg orally later (wrapped in a Rizzla) also with no noticeable effect.

I received my sample today and the 250mg's won't dissolve in 10ml of water. Is the ratio too small? 


I'm gonna heat it up and stir more. If that doesn't work I will double the amount of water.


~1mg under the tongue did not have any effect but I felt the harsh nature. I won't sample it today even if it dissolves properly because my glasses broke in an unfortunate situation...one glass ~180€ -.-


€: Ramped it up to 50ml of water and it still wont clear up...

Yeah, me too. But the substance just won't dissolve and sits on the ground of my brownglass...


Obviously the AH-7921 is impossible to dose properly now so I do not intend to touch it in that form. It's a bummer since it "could" have been measured +/-10mg with my shitty scale but I wanted to go the safe route.


Any suggestions?

I managed to dissolve 250mg in 25ml 40% abv. whisky, with some shaking. You'll need more water.


Why is it impossible to dose now? Are you planning to inject?


I swallowed 5ml of my solution = 50mg AH7921, almost 2 hours ago. 


I'm not feeling much, if anything ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


But I am alive :D


EDIT: I realise my earlier "I dissolved 50mg in 5ml water" post contradicts these more recent findings. I was a but drunk "earlier" and probably not paying full attention to the completeness of the dissolution. Mind you I did heat it a bit, and I didn't heat this whisky stuff.

No, I just want to use it orally and since it did not dissolve properly (all the AH-7921 lays at the bottom) I can't dose this inhomogenous liquid. Do you really think that more water will do it? It seems that nothing has dissolved. The water is clear and the powder on the ground, after shaking it clouds the bottle up and settles again.


Tomorrow I'll try to add some Vodka because I don't think evaporating would leave a wheighable consistence. Never done that before.


I'd be glad for any advice.

As far as I think, the HCl salt should dissolve easily in water, while the freebase form should be difficult to dissolve.


DickTate, do you know if you have freebase or salt? It might be freebase if it is so difficult to dissolve in water. In that case the most efficient route of administration is smoking it.

Ask your supplier about it. The freebase is CAS# 55154-30-8 and the HCl salt is CAS# 41804-96-0.


I am also curious if the HCl salt could be smoked.

Thank you Burn it up. Then I've got the freebase (CAS# is on the label) which explains the difficulties.


Any suggestions how to rescue this valuable compound from the wet fangs of H2O?


I thought about shaking right before dosing but that would be pretty reckless since I've only got a low tolerance to Tilidin/Kratom.


€: I mentioned earlier that I definitely got the HCL because it is listed as HCL on the Vendors site but has got the freebase CAS# ![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)

You need to covert the compound from a freebase into it's salt form. The easiest way to do it would be add a few drops of vinegar to the solution you've got, that should allow it dissolve. Lemon juice would also work.


I'd also email the vendor so they can change it so others don't have the same problem ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Wow, 10 drops of lemon juice did the trick and it dissolved in like a few seconds ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Thank you, now I can start a low dose trial. Beginning with 10mg oral.


I'm gonna report later or tomorrow.

I dosed another 20mg two hours after the initial 10 and it had some effects though it is hard to describe. More of a head- than body high, little mood boost and all around feeling of well being but pretty subtle.


Urinary retention was noticeable and I slept like a baby for about 8 hours. More trials to come but not today.

Any thoughts on duration? I have no first hand experience with this, but I came across some dose/usage information written in code on a vendor's website blog... They do not explicitly comment on instanasal/oral/sublingual use, but I get the sense that this post was their way of recommending other ROAs to buyers who are complaining about the price/dose relative to the effect size/dose.


According to them, IV of their product (HCl) salt provides the best experience, but even as an HCl it requires a lot of work to dissolve at a reasonable concentration for injection (they mention injection grade bacteriostatic water, vigorous stirring, gentle heat, and a LOT of patience). They state that potency of the compound is second best when vapourized, followed by intrarectal administration. Finally, they state that IM is their personal preferred ROA, although they don't state why.

Any ideas about the oral bio-availabilty of this stuff  ? It's sounding like it's very low, and even if injecting is by far the most effective way to get much out of this substance, that ROA remains the one line I'm not going to cross.


EDIT: I've just found this info on another forum


Lipid solubility? - partition coefficient unreported but onset/duration similar to morphine & very active orally. The Ki isn't actually that great but the compound is 'highly lipophilic' so the concentration in the brain will be high compared with M.

I don't follow all the technicalities of that but if that info is accurate then it appears that the oral bio-availabilty of AH7921 is at the very least going to be higher than it is for Morphine.

Regarding oral bioavailabiliy: I am used to 200mg Tramadol/ 100mg Tilidine and 30mg AH-7921 produced a subtle but pleasant high 30min to an hour after dosing. I would not sniff it or plug (let alone shoot) it because its so corrosive (my tongue felt numb for pretty long). Never had morphine though so I can't compare the two.


The duration seems to be ok and not too short since I felt kind of an afterglow after 8 hours sleeping.


I will dose 30mg at once today and maybe bump it up a little.

You can't extrapolate anything about the bioavailability of oral AH7921 based on that information. Without getting too technical, the poor bioavailability of morphine is due to it having high first-pass metabolism (i.e. your liver turns it into an inactive form before it has a chance to get to your brain). 


Being more lipophilic means that it would penetrate into the brain faster than morphine. I'm not sure if this applies to every opiate, but in the case of heroin, being lipophilic means faster onset of effects (and thus the "rush").

I guinea pigged myself on this last night. After getting the all clear from allergy tests. I decided on 120 mg bombed in 2 rizlas, considering the reported caustic nature of the stuff. This dose was decided on for various reasons; other have felt nothing off 50mg, i have a high tolerance to morphine/all cross tolerant opiates, and am currently dependent on poppy pods. So 120mg down the hatch, about 3 hours after last eating any food.. Didnt feel anything much after 1 hour. After 90 mins felt slightly spaced out, and heavy/slow bodied (might just have been tired as didnt get much sleep the night before). I took the other 80 mg that was left (the remainder got stuck in the bag/on my fingers and i didnt swill it out with water as i would have done with other substances due to the caustic nature of this stuff. Again not much effect after 1 hour. Ate my evening meal followed by a few bars of chocolate, wondering if that would kick it in. Didnt really. Possibly felt a slight sense of well being/calm, might have been placebo. Pupils were not constricted. Fell asleep for a couple of hours. Felt quite slow and heavy. That was it really. First impressions not great. Either the chemical is not great for recreation or it was a poor sample, or higher doses are required.

Finally got the chance to play with this compound multiple times over the past 24 hr, and I give it a **big thumbs up**. I'll post an expanded experience report later today, but it is totally novel and unlike any other opiate that I've tried. The key is dosing it high enough, and using a good ROA. It definitely hits the right opiate receptors, but I'm absolutely convinced it has effects on the GABA system as well.

^^ Good thought, but not applicable at all here. Opiates are not anaesthetics (like lidocaine, cocaine, etc).  Their pain killing effect of opiates occurs in the brain and spine. Also the effects of long worn off, and there is no pain or signs of damage to m mouth & gums

Anyone have any thoughts if this substance could be useful for staving off withdrawls from other opiates ? For example if someone had run out of their other opiates, presumably this stuff would at least provide some relief (until the other opiate is obtained), even if the high itself from AH7921 so far doesnt seem to be that great  ?


(I might get a little more in as a backup for this purpose, apparently its also **very** good as a painkiller, so could keep a bit in stock for that purpose too. Also want to give it another chance to get high off, experimenting with larger doses/vaping etc)

[A report towards the end of the first page of this thread](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/602776-AH7921-Dosage) says it completely staved off w/ds from H.


[And I found it to be](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/499998-Designer-opioids?p=10728253&viewfull=1#post10728253) recreational at higher (>100mg) doses.

I've had the opportunity to try this novel opioid recently and I must say it was a very peculiar experience. I was very satisfied with it.


I tried 50mg sublingual.

The effects came on in about 15 minutes and I could definitely feel the opioid effects: anxiolytic properties, euphoria and a pleasant body high.


It is definitely an opioid with the qualities and effects you would expect from a substance like this. It's not as potent as I thought (I would say about 50-60% of morphine, not 80% as wiki states) but increasing the dose does the trick.


I will soon know the GC/MS results to see if it is real AH-7921. Then I will continue investigating with this substance.

I guess it all depends on your ROA, but with oral/sublingual dosing it's very hard to compare its potency to morphine, considering that Morphine has a very low oral bio-availabilty. AH7921 may well be less potent than morphine but if it has a higher oral bio-availabilty then this would surely compensate for that ? I suppose injecting is the only ROA where one could make a direct comparison of the relative potencies.


Please could someone explain a basic chemistry question to me.....If a substance is a hydrochloride, does that mean it's the freebase and that it can be smoked/vaped ? (I'm confused about all this freebase/salts/hydrochloride/ stuff, but I understand the theory that a substance needs to be able to heated enough to vape without being destroyed, and so turning cocaine into a freebase gives you crack cocaine which can be heated without destroying it ?)

The last time I studied chemistry outside of bluelight was high school, so this is my very basic knowledge (someone correct me if/where i'm wrong).


Basically chemicals are either in freebase or salt form. You start with the freebase and then turn it into it's salt form by adding an acid - for example adding hydrocloric acid gives you hydrocloride (HCL), and citric acid gives you the citrate form.


Standard powdered cocaine is Cocaine Hydrocloride (or Cocaine HCL). When you turn it into crack cocaine you're turning it into Freebase Cocaine. The freebase can take more heat (higher melting point?), so is vaped when smoked rather than burning.


It all depends though as many chemicals can take enough heat even in their HCL forms to be smoke-able (I think DMT is an example).


Freebases don't dissolve in water, which is why Heroin #3 (freebase heroin) is converted into Heroin #4 (often into the citrate form by adding lemon juice); and why you can't inject crack.

Have you tried smoking the HCl salt? It might be suitable for vaporising.


If not then you'll need to convert it to the freebase form.

Sublingually can't be good for your mouth. Diluted in water a tiny amount stinged and numbed my "undertongue". Don't wanna know what 50mg+ will do to that sensitive area :/

I am very interested in this substance but have not gotten the chance to try it yet.


I've read most every thread about it (including this one) and I'm curious about it for sure.  I've seen a few mentions of this but I thought I'd ask those that have tried it directly;


- How is this RC at combating pain compared to say Hydrocodone/Oxycodone?


The reason I ask if I have a low tolerance at the moment and if this stuff is effective for joint pain I'd be mighty interested in keeping a little around.  While I'm not very excited about putting a (mostly) untested substance into my body I've been curious about this particular RC for awhile now.   So, anyone using this for controlling pain with good results?

I did read somewhere (cant remember where but the info did seem reliable) that this substance is very good for pain control. Not used it for that purpose myelf though, as of yet.


Sounds like sublingual is the way to go for recreational use, even though others have warned about the 'caustic' nature, the effects of SL ROA didnt seem too bad to Raybeez. Guess it's possible the new batch might be cleaner and less caustic, obviously hope this will be the case.

Yeah, I also hope that will be the case when I receive part of the new batch. But due to reports of other RCs (MXE) killing your sense of taste if used sublingually on a regular base I would still be very careful about this.


However, I will probably report next week because I've used some Bupre in the last days and don't want tolerance to interfere too much.

I think there will be much more information about this one soon since it's more available now.

Bumping for more info. I've been waiting years for an opiate RC.


Anyone try vaping or injecting yet?

How do you guys that have done this sublingually cope with the excess saliva that builds up? I just tried 70mg (after an allergy test) sublingually, and by about 20 minutes my mouth was nearly full of saliva. I don't really feel that much either, so I'm thinking I might have messed up slightly.

There was once a forum that is now closed, where people reported vaping freebase AH-7921 was very effective.


As of injecting. Produces no rush. The compound itself kills any pain in me (physical, not what you're really looking for eh? ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) ), it'd have a future in hospitals maybe.

Tried this out and found it quite dissapointing. 75mg oral (no tolerance) produced a standard opiate high complete with itchiness and considerable sedation but no euphoria. Reminded me a lot of dihydrocodeine (DHC), which also tends to knock me out without producing anything in the way of euphoria. It also tasted like extremely bitter so I'd definitely recommend bombing it if you're gonna take it orally.


Take a reasonable benzo dose and add in a slight histamine release and that's AH-7921 in a nutshell imo.

Bumping this one, since I tried 50mg sublingually 5 minutes ago and I have to agree with the following qoute:

Nearly impossible to keep it under the tongue for longer than 5-10 minutes (is it even necessary to hold it that long?). When I opened my mouth to check the absorption saliva literally squirted out ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Also it is more than uncomfortable to hold it there regardless of the saliva production. Numbing and tingling is a little understated. It's not unbearable but definitely a little painful. To that degree that it should be worrying.


I will update regarding the effects. Until then I wash my mouth out.


Ok, despite the ugly administration this is the way to go. I feel a really good opioid-buzz, very nice and pretty activating which I like.

Pupils constricted. Clear- and Calmness. This could be a worthy O-Desmethyltramadol substitute if it wouldn't be that agressive.


I will smoke some weed in an hour or so. And will check my mouth in the evening and tomorrow.

Has anyone tried injecting this chemical? I heard it's pretty weak when taken orally or sniffed, so I thought of injecting it to test it's full potential. I can get hold of very pure AH-7921, with analysis provided, so I'm pretty confident with injecting this chemical. 


I have small-medium tolerance to opiates, using mainly opium (vapourized), codeine, DHC and O-desmethyltramadol (I.V). Never touched harder opiates

ive been trying out the sublingual method on my new delivery, just tried the amount of a dabbed finger tip to start with, and that left the area of my mouth it had been it contact with feeling like i had eaten raw pepper corns or something. Could imagine 100-200 mg doses administered this way being very uncomfortable. With my tolerance i may be needing that kind of amount, unless the sublingual ROA is very much more effective than bombing in a rizla.

Yeah, next time I will dilute 50mg in the minimal amount of water needed and try it with an oral syringe. Especially since the place under my tongue feels pretty fucked now. Can anyone tell me how  the sublingual absorbtion is affected by taking a liquid?


Regarding duration and side-effects: Around 6 to 8 good hours I would say. Side effects included urinary retention but no noticeable constipation.

THC synergizes really well with it.


Altogether I must say that I am pleased. Although it doesn't work well orally and is aggressive sublingually this has one advantage: Repeated intake on consecutive days could be too harsh for the gums^ But maybe diluted and converted to HCL is another story...we will see.

Only the NMR spectra. 


Update regarding sublingual use: I've got a white layer on the place under my tongue which hurts a little bit. Not too bad but I wouldn't encourage to use this ROA frequently. Especially since it numbs the whole area on contact so you won't feel potential damage suddenly.

Next time diluted and on the other side, maybe sunday. Have a nice weekend.

Read about a guy taking 50mg followed by another 120mg orally and getting nice and long-lasting effects.


Roughly 4 hours ago i did 50mg sublingual along with some water, got almost no effects so i upped the dose to another 50mg just a few minutes ago with less water. Gave me a very numb feeling around the tongue area but it's getting better atm. Used some mouthwater directly afterwards and drank a shitload of water.


I'm feeling the opiate effects are getting stronger now but not much. Will report back later!


This stuff is very aggressive on human tissue. Not that nice!

Tongue/Mouth area has been normalized after perhaps an hour or so. Everything's fine now. But i wouldn't take this often because of it's aggressive nature.


Right after the 2nd 50mg dose effects increased really fast and are still pretty strong atm. I should possibly add i had it a bit longer under my tongue this time. 


I don't think the burning/numbing sensation has something to do with purity btw.

Do you have any kind of tolerance?


So I "sublingualled" another 50mg yesterday and the effects were really poor. Nothing compared to the first trial which was one of my strongest opioid experiences yet (compared to Tramadol, O-DT, Kratom, Tilidine). It was like I always imagined Oxy would feel, really nice, warm, euphoric and energizing.


I don't think it was due to poor absorbtion since I kept it under my tongue for 10 minutes. Which isn't easy at all but who knows, maybe this time more of it got diluted in the saliva (and swallowed after 10min) and not directly absorbed sublingually.


I know I am somehow repeating myself but this compound is still pretty new and every bit of information might be useful.

Next time I will ingest 100mg orally because I never exceeded 75mg with my first sample on this ROA.

I've lost my notes, but I think I bombed around 200 mg orally, and took this along with my usual dose of Poppy Pod tea. Dont recall feeling anything extra atall from the ah7921. I think at that time i was in w/d though as I'd messed up my dosing due to a weekend stim binge, so it was probably just helping me to 'normalise' i think. Sorry this isnt a very useful contribution as my recollections of all this are pretty sketchy. 


So far this is looking very disapointing. The only ROA with any promise seems to be sublingual, and the latest report from Diktate questions even that, plus that ROA seems to fuck up your mouth pretty quick. Not sure I'd want to try taking 100mg plus via this route. Even if it might work well, in terms of good recreational effects, I dont think it's worth risking damaging your mouth. 


I'm not going to be getting into injecting so that's totally ruled out for me. 


Has anyone tried plugging ? Knock, You'd be the one to try this I guess, but you dont seem very impressed with this one either ? I'd be interested to hear one of your reports on a plugged dose, if you do go get more in and try that.


It's starting to look like this stuff may be only be useful for holding off WDs, or for tapering off Opis, or as a painkiller. I guess I shouldnt knock that. It might prove very valuable indeed for those purposes.

I had NO after-effects regarding my mouth - but even so i wouldn't take this one more than once a week. The 2x50mgs were pretty strong and long-lasting, i even felt them 18-22h after ingestion, not that strong anymore for sure, but there was still something going on.

Yeah it cleared up in about two days. No lasting pain or discomfort. Just feels strange texturewise.

But holy shit towards plugging this. That must be torture, you are one brave man!^

I've now taken 25mg and 35mg sublingually twice (this is the new UK batch, I don't really have an opioid tolerance at the moment). Neither time have I had particular problems with the tongue - it's not much fun but it feels to me bitter rather than caustic. Possibly larger doses would be more problematic - I imagine I'll find out.


Both times have been due to being in moderate abdominal pain and not wanting to wait for my prescribed Tramadol to kick in orally. Both times the pain was completely gone within about 15 mins (the first one was after consuming alcohol and etizolam, hence the higher dose the second time, although I had admittedly taken some diazepam earlier so perhaps it wasn't really necessary). Neither time was there particular euphoria, although I did perhaps feel slight contentment. 


I also somewhat foolishly vaped some aMT about 3 hours after the 35mg dosage because I felt tired (had taken a lot of stimulants the previous evening and not really slept). I vaped around 30mg of aMT from that point onwards repeatedly ever 2-3 hours for the next 15 or so hours (vaping is an incredibly inefficient ROA but feels so lovely). Didn't seem to be any negative interactions or ill effects. But then I have no idea what the half-life of AH-7921 is or whether a significant amount was still in my system.


**Update 2pm:** Just SLed 55mg. At this dose it was somewhat painful for the first 10-15 minutes but whether it's actually corrosive I cannot say. I could also feel the blood supply in my mouth - my lips actually began pulsating and I was worried I was having an allergic reaction, but I don't think I was. After 20 mins feels pretty much OK. I might even feel quite pleasant, actually...


Right, OK, so yesterday I took 55mg sublingually around 2pm. I went to the pub, played a couple of games of pool, stretched a gin and tonic over around three hours and still felt very little, so took another 35mg sublingually around 3.5 hours later. 


Immediately after this, I began to exhibit many of the signs of a slight opioid overdose: nausea, light-headedness, itchiness, drowsiness, shallow breathing, decreased heart rate (around 58 bpm). It was fairly unpleasant and I felt quite anxious as I realised that I have no idea of the dose response curve of AH-7921. It felt like it might be very steep.


I was conscious and made sure I was around people for the next few hours, as I continued to feel this way. Around midnight, I lay in my flatmate's bed as I felt I was about to go to sleep. He was watching a film in the room and I asked him to keep an eye on me. 


I lay there for around 2 incredible hours while experiencing a generally very pleasant, quite hallucinogenic nod. I felt my body rise up out of the bed and start to fly around the room, which was pretty cool. I then felt a moment of terror as I seemed to fall a long way, and was convinced I could hear my flatmate making vaguely menacing remarks, although he assures me that he wasn't. There was no nausea durng this period.


This stopped after a while and I went to my own bed. I had the sort of typical, slightly opiated sleep where your skin feels really warm and you feel slightly more conscious during your dreams, which are all pretty enjoyable.


Don't think I'll be messing with this recreationally again. It does seem very effective as a painkiller at low doses but the dose required for a slight nod entailed far too many adverse symptoms for far too long for it to be worth it.

Don't know nothing about your tolerance but the 100mgs i've taken sublingual in two doses were also pretty strong, but there weren't any signs of adverse effects. Perhaps i felt a little bit discomfort in my stomach but tbh it could've been anything else also, so wtf? The nod was nice, almost a lil' bit too strong (thanks to me, dosin' to high) and the day after i felt a bit agitated, but that's it! Nothing i wouldn't do everyday like, let's say Kratom, but it's better than i thought.


I'd agree on the point about the steep response curve.

Even though the shallow breathing and decreased heart rate could be worrying, these symptoms just sound like typical (albeit undesirable) side effects of an opiate, rather than an opiate overdose.


 I have taken up to 100mg of this chemical sublingually twice, and both times have been disappointed. Both times very little euphoria has been present, and both times the strong sedative effects came into effect about 1-1/12 hour after dosing. At the same time as this it produced strong nausea, not enough as to make me want to throw up but enough to make me have to shut my eyes. This chemical produces very few desirable effects in my opinion. I would be interested to hear of people's experience with vaping this material, as I have heard through third hand (so possibly bullshit) internet talk that it produces good results.


EDIT

I have a strangely strong natural tolerance to opiates, start small people

I've just ordered some of this to see what it is like for pain relief as a back up to prescribed MST Continus. I don't have much of an opiate tolerance taking 60-80mgs of MST a day.


Any pointers on a good medicinal dose and ROA ? is it really that unpleasant sublingually I'm quite tolerant of nasty tasting chems but not losing my mouth lining ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Jesus i'd forgot id even tried this one until reading this thread, can't have been good enough to make an impression then though i was on a mad one at the time, it kept WD's at bay but no recreational effects apart from that. Read in other threads its an excellent painkiller but shit recreationally. May try some more sometime since my systems clear to see what i think with a clear head

I think that is a pretty high tolerance (MST is morphine, right?). At least so high that the AH won't do much in terms of recreational effects. But the pain relief quality is really effective. And yeah it is pretty uncomfortable sublingually but manageable. But not often or repeated.


I have done another 60mg dose on the weekend and it was ok but nothing compared to the first trial which was amazing. I think tolerance develops fast with this one even if you skip more days in between. Maybe I will get this again but it is a strange compound and I don't get why Vendors sell this but no O-dt anymore.

Maybe because of the suspectful name of the latter.

I'm mainly interested in it's pain relief effects anyway, interesting that you say the tolerance rises fast, maybe that's only relevant for the recreational effects, I've had to persist with them MST to get over the hot sweats and the nausea.


I can't take Tramadol due to it's SNRI action as I'm taking another SNRI anyway so I assumed it was best to stay away from O-dt also, I have half a G if AH7921 arriving tomorrow so I'll be giving a it a cautious trial at some point this week.

O-dt has very litlle if any effect atall on serotonin. Completely different to it's parent compound. O-dt really isn't anything at all like Tramadol itself. You could say O-dt is 200 times better than Tramadol, in a recreational sense, as it has 200 times greater binding affinty at the opiate receptor than Tramadol does.


The main problem with O-dt at the moment is that no one seems to be producing it. Or at least no largeish vendors with a decent reputation are selling it.

Tried this for the first time last time night, it was smooth and sexy, if a tad underwhelming. Kinda like your first foray into the big wet world of pussy.

Took 40mg under the tongue and held it there for ~10 minutes, would have taken more but it was late and it would have been wasted on dreams. A mate came round and we jammed on acoustics for hours, the high was really nice... there was a subtle moodlift and I felt more empathy/sociability, along with greater music appreciation/(and perhaps creation too? Who knows, it's impossible to pick the two apart). So we got flowing and had some sexy jams. It was nice at this level BUT I sense more potential at a greater dosage. Much more. Will trial again soon, maybe at 70-80mg. I'm opiate-naive by the way, haven't taken anything for half a year (and that was just kratom). And maybe it's my batch, or maybe your mouths are made of paper, but mine didn't dissolve in a gooey mess upon contact. Little stingy, thats it. All in all I give it 3.5 stars (at that measly dose)... modification pending of course![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I gave this a go last night as well starting with a modest 30mgs held under the tongue for a few minutes before a thorough rinse and swallow.


It was a very fine clear crystals, tasted fairly vile and made my mouth numb but didn't really feel caustic.


Effects came on within 45mins, a little nausea and a definite feeling of sedation which built over the next hour or more, laying back with my eyes closed was pleasant but it was more like almost falling to sleep than nodding, although my experience with opiates is limited.


After about 2hrs it plateaued and the sedation fell away, the pain relief I was seeking did seem to be there and I didn't feel the need to take my dose of MST, which was good as I wouldn't have taken it anyway.


I slept well but felt unusually tired this morning some 12 hours after ingesting, will probably try it again but wasn't so keen on the odd sedation.

Yep, the lingering tiredness is a bit annoying but AH is at least much better as some may think. Btw, a high dose of kratom has almost the same lingering after-effects, so it's not that bad.

I read in a paper this is 80% the strength of Morphine when taken orally. This could mean it is very weak seen as Morphine has a rather poor bio-availability orally. But then again, the same might go for this compound too. So when taken via another ROA it could be great...

I can't tell if AH is really this worthless or if the reviewers all have high tolerances.  I'm perfectly happy with euphoria/mood lift without nods or sedation, so hopefully I'll find it more enjoyable than you folks have.  I'm getting some (hopefully) very soon.

In my opinion that tolerance level is so high that the AH isn't working. For comparison: I used to do 75mg of O-DT at max or 150-200mg of Codeine and I get a very pleasant turn of 50mg AH-7921 sublingually.

Just saying, it isn't worthless. Only if you are used to higher doses of other opiates/ioids and I think that 700mg of Codeine is a pretty massive dose.

I have never gained any high worth while from less that 400 mg of codeine and if I have taken ANY other opiate recently, I would need about 700 mg too. It is only a high dose if you haven't taken any of the stronger opiates really...

This is nice. I had my last dose of ODT on 27th Dec 2011and apart from a few weekend uses of Kratom or CWE Codeine haven't touched opiates/oids. While this shows its cyclohexanone affinity/ancestry quite clearly, it's really pleasant. Like a sort of upside-down MXE. Have now dosed at up to 150 mgs. in 12 hrs. I can't decide if I actually prefer this to ODT.

A friend and I tried this yesterday, my total dose over 12 hrs. was around 150 mgs., my friend around 70 mgs. We have no complaints. It was actually rather different and moderately pleasant.

2nd experiment, the day after last. Took the rest (~190mg) spread over about 10 hours? Diminishing returns and pretty intense burns... developed some sores under my tongue afterwards. I guess it is caustic after all. Not as good as the 40mg previously. Probably cause I gained a tolerance from the previous day. Better as a an occasional thing. Too bad my self-control is non-existent. Oh well, maybe for those special occasions.

Curious if anyone who is taking bupe for maintenance purposes has tried AH7921 yet? (Mostly interested in hearing from those maintaing long term at 2mg per day or less but any input is, or will be, appreciated)


If so:


Did you simply try taking the AH7921 without modifying your maintenance schedule? Or did you either slow down or stop taking your bupe for a period of time before dosing?


Was enough ah7921 able to find enough open receptors for you to feel it? How strongly did you feel it? Was it at all pleasant? Did it synergize at all? Dose, duration, etc?


I expect AH7921 to be a waste of time while on bupe but you never know...

 I would have to disagree on that one...but everyone's different, 'ya know. My fav is Dilaudid (hydromorphone hcl), but Pethidine (known on this side of the pond as Demerol...both are meperidine hcl), is very nice too...I can't remember if it was William S. Burroughs or not who said, "If God made anything nicer than Demerol, then he kept it for himself." 

 They don't use it much anymore (if at all) due to the accumulation of toxic metabolites...Fentanyl is nice, too, but doesn't last very long, IMHO...YMMV...

Why is everyone taking it sublingual? Im going to get some too soon, so cant i just dose it orally in a gel cap?? And what would be a good starting dose oral? I have no tolerance to opiates and ~30-40mg o-des (oral) gave me a good turn (so opiates hit me quite strong) 


I thought starting with 30mg gelcap should be okay?

The oral bioavailability seems to be very low and dosing via this route doesn't achieve the desired effects. At least for me there was a big difference.  

I would suggest to take the 30mg sublingually and maybe a 10mg booster later if it's not enough. But of course you can try the oral way. I think it's just a waste of material since the buzz is way less pronounced.

10mg, 15mg, and 20mg produced no noticeable effects for me with vaping. 


To be honest, this and camfetamine have been the two single most disappointing RCs I've ever tried. I'm not really into stims so I didn't care about the camfetamine, but the AH7921 was a disappointment because I basically appreciate all opiates/opioids and was expecting to find something good about it. But it's not easy to find good points with this one. I have a moderate tolerance to opiates (maybe creeping into the high end now), but I can still appreciate the mild pain relief and sedation of codeine or o-dt on occasion, but with AH7921 it just doesn't seem to do anything useful and I end up noticing the side-effects more than anything else. 


Stim-lovers have got lots of RC options to try (some good, some average, some terrible), as have those into psychedelics (and some of the RC psychs are excellent, not just crappy imitations but unique and deserving of their own place), but downers are still comparatively neglected - especially opioids. Etizolam's OK for coming down/sleeping but not really exciting or with any depth of its own. Methylmethaqualone was freaky weird and kind of fun in a pointless way: let's mess up our amazingly complex and beautiful brains for a short wobbly high. And while I do like o-desmethyltramadol, it's not particularly exciting. 


I don't want some mega ultra weaponized RC opiate that's all brute force power over subtle wellbeing. Let's have us something with the beautiful, subtle but powerfully mood-lifting effects of opium. Long lasting, chill, stoning goodness.... ahhh... to dream...

This is why it has no recreational effects for you. This will also be the case for MDPV_Psychosis or other Buprenorphine patients.


I took 60mg sl one hour ago (after 5 days without any opiate/ioid) and I feel great. In fact it reminds me of Bupe with its motivating and rather subtle effects but with a stronger "bodybuzz". Like I said in previous posts, there is something missing. As if it was no full agonist but it doesn't make it any less enjoyable for me.

I recommended sublingual in main thread.


I still do but double-check your sort before actually putting all the dose into your mouth. 50mg **HCl** (if I recall correctly) previously did no injury or discomfort when used SL, 100mg sulphate from another source proved to be caustic and caused some skin to 'die' inside of my mouth... I was very reckless. I swallowed the whole after a few minutes or so cause I couldn't hold it, was so irritating. Definitely AH-7921 (from what I felt after), but I wonder whether some batches could be contaminated with caustic residues.


A friend of mine reports IM of the same sulphate stuff. He has no outstanding issues so far with his muscle... Besides incredible pain at first after he injected.


Dunno, maybe it belongs more to the D&D.

I just vaporised AH-7921 in HCl salt form with success out of aluminium foil.


I used 20 mg of the substance. The vaporization produced a generous amount of dense white smoke which was very soft and mild on the lungs. No taste was noted until exhalation, in which a mild salty fabric softener taste was perceived; not bad but not good either.


The powder quickly turned into liquid form and started bubbling, generating smoke without leaving residue. Even if I put the flame too close, it just vaporised faster instead of burning and leaving a black residue as heroin would. It's easy to smoke in foil.


I now feel mild sedative and anxiolytic effects similar to a low dose of opiates/opioids. The 20mg must be the starting dose when vaporising this substance.


So far I like this substance. For the lowish quantities I have been taken it feels very good. I suppose we are just playing around low doses, it might hide more potential as we go further, but so far I am pleased. A good heroin alternative for these rainy afternoons with jazz and good books.


Let's keep the trials coming.

Sounds interesting. Must be better than oral bombs or sunlingual ROAs. I SL'd 100 mg the other night, and felt absolutely nothing apart from a stinging mouth.

Has anyone tried AH-7921 for opiate withdrawal?  I'm down to my last Percocet (was taking about 15 mg per day) and am going to use the AH to taper down.  


Would sublingual be the most effective ROA?  How does it compare to other weak opiates like loperamide and codeine?  Is it sedating like morphine or stimulating like oxy?  So many questions...

Although I never used this one for wd or taper purposes:


Yes sublingual is the best route. Unpleasant but certainly worth the tingles regarding bioavailability. I would not do this frequently and with high amounts though.

For me it was more on the sedating side but I have no experience with Oxycodone. Compared to Codeine it feels a little more clear and lacks some facettes of the opioid glow.

Nonetheless I think it will be useful for you. Maybe there will be "something missing" but that could also be helpful with your intended taper, like with bupe.


I wish you the best to succeed ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Being acidic/caustic doesn't mean that it's toxic, just that it's acid and you should take precautions with sensitive parts of your body.


What is the pH of your stomach? It can get as low as 1.


So: Acidity is not a measure of toxicity.

hey,

Ok I gave ah-7921 a try yesterday. I use 500mg codeine daily since 3 month.


The morning of this day, took only 160mg codeine when woken up.


After allergie test, 10mg bombed,

one hour and a half later still feeling nothing


50mg bombed added

one hour after slight opiate feeling


100mg bombed added

an hour after feeling great (had some weed + beer)


100mg bombed added

an hour after feeling the need to go watch a movie in bed, nose to the blanquet


100mg added

half an hour after i was sleeping


Waking up 7 hours later, feel like shit, can't walk straight, not hungry, bearable headache, puking every 40 minutes.

Bombed 70mg + 600mg paracetamol + 20mg codeine + a bowl of weetos and milk.

I feel way mor better, but not feeling like doing anything today, must go busking but can't find the energie.

Could be the codeine w/d.

That sounds like too much opiates to me... I'd definitely take a lot less next time.


I tried it myself for the first time yesterday and found it reasonably enjoyable - not very intense but gave me that motivated/vaguely manic mindset that I love.


However I've no idea if I'll ever take any more, I dosed sublingually (40mg, then another 30mg around an hour later), and although it didn't feel too bad at the time (it almost felt like a cocaine type numbness) my mouth now feels fairly sore over 24 hours later.

I hope you have a background in chemistry/psychopharmacology to be making a statement like that, although I do see your just trying to be helpful.  Much appretiated.

Oh *dharmabum* I was a heavy H user for a while, decided to stop, that's why i'm on a daily reducing dose of codeine. I'm at 500mg daily at the moment.

What i wanted to do there is replace my codeine by AH-7921

Doing that maybe i can guess how much ah-7921 is equivalent (not equipotent) compared to codeine, by judging if i have withdrawals or not.

Today i took 20 mg codeine because they are in the paracetamol pills.

But i'll let you know about my results.

Some opioids at low dose levels can be very much like this, I used to love O-Desmethyltramadol for cracking on with academic work / managing to act like a caring, helpful individual to all the absolute idiots I had to 'help' in my last public oriented job. Kratom and low dose Oxy can also be good for this. I haven't tried AH-7921 at higher doses but would assume it gets more sedating.


I'd warn you not to go overboard with the sublingual dosage method though, the area under my tongue is still mildly sore and feeling very rough in texture two days after taking some.

I think it is HCl (can't check my baggie at the moment but the vendor I bought it from in early-mid August is selling HCl at the moment), as I posted earlier I didn't really mind the sensations when administering it - my mouth has just felt burnt/irritated the following days after the effects wore off. I've never dosed Methoxetamine sublingually so can't compare.

^ This.  I'd also be keen to know of possible interactions with Benzos - particularly as the (limited) info available on AH-7921 seems to suggest that respiratory depression is not as severe as with other opioids.  Can anyone suggest if there's any likely disasters which could occur with moderate benzo use (about 10-20mg diazepam daily) and an AH-7921 dose yet to be established but for analgesia rather than getting nutted.  Cheers, wise people.

I'm finding it extremely difficult to get the dose right with this substance. Ive tried sublingual @ 100 mg to no avail, no effects just pain. Ive not got the hang of plugging, and im not going anywhere near needles, vaping a vapable amount (20mg or so) does nothing except make me wheeze, and i suspect a large amount would need to be vaped for any decent high, so not going there.....so that only leaves bombing. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)


 Its probably due to tolerance that i need to take amounts that i fear are approaching dangerous levels. I had been bombing 200 mg doses and not feeling much of anything atall. One day i became impatuient and did a 300mg bomb - still felt nothing !!!! A few hours later i stupidly became even more impatient and did another bomb on top @ 400 mg !!


Lets just say i felt it then alright. Was totally fucked. And quite worried about od-ing. But, well I'm still here and no 999 calls were made. I think my dose will need to be something like 400mg or 300 followed by 200 or something like that......still got a enough left to try and find my 'sweet spot'. Presuming that there is one....![:sus:](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/suspicious.gif)

ok. finally my 2 cents regarding this compound:


I'm experienced with psychoactives of all kinds, with 100+ experiences with various opiates/opioids (mainly poppy tea - DOC for some time ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) ). never developed a real habit from it though. for me opiates were and are more the special thing that I occasionally enjoy. over time I lost good sources and I even felt that opiates had become a little boring for me. nevermind: I still crave that feeling from time to time (and usually enjoy it, but had stopped actively searching for it for some time) so I decided to give this compound a go. so we have: experience? yes. tolerance? no.


first trial: 75mg SL. GOOD GOD. this shit tastes absolutely vile. chewing on ER codeine pills is nothing against that taste. and it surely *is* caustic. after a few minutes there was a definite sensation of HCl in my mouth - and this feeling lingered so badly that it kinda spoiled the experience. usually I'm pretty tough against stuff like that and tend to give things a second chance and experiment with roas (plugging is usually my ROA of choice..). but NEVER EVER would I choose any other ROA than oral with this compound. seriously. the feeling is that bad...

the experience itself was enjoyable but nothing special for sure.


second try: 90mg oral, 20mg booster after 90min. shit got excessive that night. I probably drank 5-7 beers during the first few hours - and yes. it does get euphoric, loved up, feelsgoodman. proceeded with some ketamine and after loosing that by being too fuckin high resorted to MXE. what a fucked up headspace. ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif) and coming down from all that shit took a looooong time of tossing and turning, drifting in and out of dream-/nightmareworlds for hours and hours and I haven't felt such a dirty and worn out and spread out (days) hangover in a long, long time.

sure it is my choice to recklessly consume all that shit but I'm usually a very responsible and 'in control' person. generally and specifically when it comes to drug taking...

I have a slight feeling that AH-7921 is unsatisfying in a way that sends you into moremoremore-mode. and that's an effect I absolutely do not like about drugs and when I feel it with an opiate I feel the compound is missing the point....


third try started 45min ago: 120mg oral. empty stomach. wake n bake style.

let's see if it's any good for those rainy, cold afternoons. need cigarettes!


€: 35mg more.

stuff is "nice". if you keep looking maybe "lovely" at times.

it is just way too weak. with not much potential.

just drink a strong coffee cause already at that dose (and low mental activity) I see myself zoning out and losing any focus. difficult to follow plans and so on (want to go out for 2h now. just don't make it)...

Hello.


I've heard this chemical is acidic/caustic, so I wonder how damaging it is gonna be to veins when injected? Is it gonna wreck my veins pretty quick after long-term use? 


Any facts about it's acidic profile? Please, let me know ASAP

I'm afraid I agree with freiherr Kreisler, above. AH-7921 is unthinkable by any ROA than oral(ok,I'd consider needles but I've never really been a fan of IV'ing opiates/opioids since I died once or twice) This just doesn't seem to work in small doses, so I think those who speculate that the oral BA is low are probably right. The 120-150mg range seems to be the sweet spot for me although YMMV, at that level it's really nice and after 5 weeks use now, I think the studies that show AH-7921 as being less likely to cause tolerance and dependence in pigeons and rats could be widened to include human beings.

jup. ~150mg oral sounds like the way to go. a rainy afternoon, cigarettes, a coffee and maybe a few beers later on, a good book in a coffee house. it's that kind of drug. (proceeding now ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) )


the comedown has been kinda rough every time I tried it but I'm not sure if it's the ah-7921 itself or the other the stuff I always ended up combining it with towards the end of the experience (last time a few beers and some ethylphenidate - definitely makes you moreishly reckless ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif) )

Ok, myself I find that  150mg oral followed by 50mg sublingual about 1 or 2 hours after does the trick. At these doses it replaces my daily use of 500 mg of codeine, witch represents about 50 mg of morphine metabolised, correct me if I'm wrong there. I do have the feeling that it is a usefull tool to tapper off opiates as it avoids the withdrawals with little high/buzz compared to other opiates. The taste is so harsh that it discourages to redose the sublingual tech (It defenetly hurts the mouth tissue) wich is a good thing for an opiate and it has a low oral bioavailability, so oral is a waste of matter, discourages as well. I like this compound at little doses. Maybe my way out of codeine.... I'll let you know.

Quite happy with this stuff now that I've found doses that work, orally. 150-200mg gives me a proper nod. It doesn't have anything like the broad spectrum of opiate goodness I get from a nice cup of poppy pod tea, or even from o-dt - no stimulation from this stuff, and not much in the way of lovely opi warmth, but it produces a very good and reliable nod at decent doses.

Apparently you didn't think hard enough. It's quite a stretch of the imagination to think that a 'corrosive' chemical would have a 'harmful toxicologic profile'. I'm not sure where your logic is...

Just to say, I think it is addictive and develops tolerance like any other opiate.

I Tried this a week or so back, i have a pretty high opiate tolerance, started with 250mg, with 100 added an hour later, waited 2 hrs, no effects, had another 250mg, mild opiate effects, had another 100mg, still mild opiate effects. Went to bed thinking this was better than a kick in the teeth but nothing to rave about. The next morning is where it gets interesting, i got up early (for me) 6.30am cause i had work  that day, i felt fine, went into work for 9 and made myself a coffee and started on construction work. 


Around 10 i started to feel a bit dizzy, by half 10 extremely dizzy and by 11 close to a nod. I had to sit the last half hour before lunch out because i was v close to nodding off, room was spinning and i was obviously in no state to do cunstuction work. We had the afternoon off anyway so i got a taxi home and gouched out for the rest of the day. I dont think i had any methadone that morning, if so it owuld've been a bery low dose, 5mg tops, very strange reaction and i havnt read any similar to it. Obviously it was a very daft thing o do taking a high amount of a unknown research chemical, but i did what i did, wont be doing it again (probably ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)) Doses may be off slightly as i have a terrible memory


Just thought id post my exp since every bit of info helps with a new chem like this without loads of info ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I went through a gram of this over the past week. I would bomb 75mg for work and 125mg for a night at home.


It takes a while to kick in - maybe 2 or 3 hours till peak effect. It lasts quite a while also - maybe 8 hours altogether.


The high is weird and somewhat 'dirty', somewhere between codeine and tramadol but with a mild deleriousness mixed in. It's actually close to codeine + promethazine syrup but with a serotonin-type sensation that is similar to tramadol.


It puts me in a very positive headspace (kind/gentle/patient) but there is not much euphoria per se. The bodyload is ok - nice for stretching and physical activity feels good. Pain relief was medium/low, comparable to tramadol.


I found it hard to focus on it, paticularly with my eyes (which felt kind of wobbly). There is a sense of looping/spinning some times and a bit of headache and motion sickness type nausea at times. It creates more drowsiness than tramadol but less than most other opiates.


The histamine release is HUGE. I've never been so itchy as the first few doses I took. I scratched my balls endlessly and my skin broke out pretty badly, even with an antihistamine in combo.


I mixed it with alcohol and cannabis. The cannabis seemed to be greatly potentiated by it (the cannabis high was very profound and overpowered the AH - not what I was looking for but if you like heady highs you may find it useful). With alcohol I got drunk faster and felt more delirious than usual.


In summation, I would rank AH as better than kratom and CWE'd AC&C tabs, but worse than all other phram opiates I have tried. Too many side effects, not enough euphoria - that's imo.


Edit (Update):

My sample is labelled with the freebase CAS. Oral bioavailability seems good - I don't need to bother with sublingual. I tried vaporizing 20mg and it was not effective (easy to smoke, tasted like detergent, no tangible effects at 20mg). I combined 75mg oral with 3mg etizolam and had a fantastic nod.

I have found that taking cimetidine shortly before ah7921 massively potentiates it. 200mg doses and lower can now be felt, without the cimetidine I'd need at least 400mg. AH also combines very well with poppy pod tea and etizolam. This combo is a case of 2+2+2+2=40. The whole is far greater than the sum of its parts.

can anyone suggest a starting dose + ROA for someone with absolutely no opiate tolerance? (i haven't found someone who's tried it who doesn't have some kind of opiate tolerance, so not sure what to do)

I would go with 50mg orally (after an allergy test) just to be safe. If that is not enough redose 25mg or try 75mg initially the next time.

Have fun.

I was gonna make a new thread but i'll ask here, would the acidity of AH-7921 make it too unsuitable for IV/IM use? I'm particularly interested in IV, if the bioavailability is so much better when sublingual than oral, it could be great IV. But would it be worse for your veins then gear with a bit too much citric? Is it one to stay away from completely when injecting? Cheers for any help/advice when i get some, hopefully someone with knowledge of similar things, i mean if people can inject whiskey, why not this? And would it burn to fuck haha

Cheers

Hey everybody, thanks to a AH-7921 tapering down, I've ended my codeine habit that came from quitting heroin !!!!

3 weeks off now, I still have some hard nights sleep and am still craving for opies but when it happens, I just re think of how shitty and depressed I was compared to how strong and good/better I'm feeling now. I'm happy, I just wanted to share this with you and give hope to people wanting to stop something they don't want to do anymore. There are stories in witch we don't want to be the hero(in) anymore.

laveruberlue, that's fantastic! Well done ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) It would be cool if you could describe the process in a little more detail to help others in your situation which might consider doing what you did.


I just wanted to make another comment as regards AH-7921 and tolerance. So far I had been using this substance with a little previous tolerance to opiates. And doses about 100mg did the trick to get some good opiate nodding pleasurable effects.


However, I tried it again some days ago with completely zero tolerance and the experience was overwhelming. And I only used 50mg! So people, if you have no tolerance, start low on this one. I didn't expect such a drastic difference in dosages with or without tolerance. The thing is that 50mg with no tolerance got me nodding like crazy, slowed my breathing quite a lot and gave me some very strong nausea which has made me to be throwing up for the last 20 hours.


So guys, if you have no opiate tolerance don't go further than 50mg on your first trial.

I'm just using this substance as something to top up my daily intake of opiates. I don't seem to be getting any good effects from it, apart from maybe some relaxation, and relief from WDs. 


I'm tapering down off poppy pods and I don't really want to buy another box of them. There's so many pods that have 'gone off' in the boxes at present and my months wages are never enough any more, so I'm constantly dipping into my dwindling savings account. So if i cant complete my taper before this box of pods runs out, I think I'll switch to AH to complete the process.

I tried Ranitidine instead (cimetidine is rx here) and there was no effect. Etizolam definitely combines well though.

^Maybe for you but that can't be generalized. As you can see lots of people here find it useful. I for example am very pleased with 50mg doses. If you are used to stronger opiates it is pretty obvious that it won't work.

The painkilling properties alone are amazing so even if it does not get you high it has a purpose.

Does anyone knows if AH-71 is acting on serotonine ? Because i found it to be somehow close to tramadol.


Also my last trip lasted for a very long time, i was able to feel the product event 20 hours after the drop, am i the only one ?

Nah, i definitwely showed real signs of being under the influence next day afternoon at work, at a building site too so hard to knock off and go home, i was almost gouching on my feet, i had no idea itd last that long. As with serotonin, not a clue but i and many others have felt there is no line between this drug and recreational effects/dose until you get to nodding kinda dose, no pleasant relaxation in the inetrim like with odt and a huge variety of other chemicals, especially opioids where there is a variety of good therapeutic and/or recreational effects to be had at doses all the up to a 'nodding' dose

What is for you a nodding dose ? I've barely no tolerance rigth now and approx. 100mg doses was a little bit speedy, kinda tramadol like.

I can't say anything on nodding doses since I usually avoid taking that much. But I wanted to add that the second batch of a well known vendor is slightly less corrosive than the first which I sampled 6 months ago.


It also seems to be more active via the oral ROA. Can someone comment on this?


However, I'm gonna quit opioids next year with the use of 50mg oral doses since I was satisfied with that amount every few days back then. Kinda like a short Bupe taper if that makes sense.


€: Just saw that the second batch is the HCL and the first was the freebase.

Do you get any recreational experiences other than pain relief? by most accounts its nod or nothing, with a very very very slight opiate feeling in smaller doses, and thats from people with no tolerance. I found it did nowt to me, even building up dose, until it sedated me to fuck and had me nodding half the next day, not opiate euphoric nodding though, just nodding

Yes, in doses from 50-75mg sublingually I had a few good and a few weaker experiences. Orally though it was more subtle but today I sampled the new batch with 50mg capsuled and swallowed (after my usual allergy test procedure) and it is very pleasant but not too strong.


I have to mention that I often smoke some cannabis after the opioid's effects peak so that adds a lot synergy.


And I think that AH might be useful as a taper tool because it lacks typical characteristics of full agonists but still makes me content. I would like to hear some opinions on that.

For me, there were no effects at all unless id taken enough to nod out, and if rattling or trying to slowly detox, itd be likei dunno an 8/500 co-codamol to come off a 2 year gear habit, with the plus side that if i neck a whole box it will k.o you. Not sure if it would work physically, for for the psychological side its not even in the same league as bupe for opiate replacement, or meth obv which i prefer :D

It was nod or nothing for me at first but the last three or four times I've had a pleasant opiate glow off it that lasts for ages, dosing around 200-250mg. Close to a nod at 250mg right enough, and anything below 200mg is nothing, so it's a smallish window. I've come to like this stuff a fair bit now, although I prefer every other opi (well, I'm not counting codeine, but I can't say I remember codeine, 18 years ago I tried that) I've tried I no longer think it's a complete waste of time or money :D

Hi!

Now I'm on around 150 mg of AH-7921 and it feels really good, for me it's a clean and warm opioid high with a little less euphoria. But some people find this drug with dissociative effects too. Anyone else find it dissociative?

I find it like a strong opiate, so it's weird...

Can someone tell me if it's worth shooting up? Does it have a rush? If I wanted a dose that has the same potency as 200mg morphine IV, how much should I take? Is it even possible for me to be satisfied with this opiate if I need 200mg morphine IV to feel great?


I know this is corrosive, but is it really worse than shooting #3 heroin mixed with ascorbic acid? If not, then it's worth a try.

I was planning on it a bit ago but 10 mins looking into stories of how corrosive it is put me off, even smoking it brought my tongue out in blisters, and sublingual had others mouths burnt raw, aye itl be much worse than gear with vit c, vit c isnt particuarally bad for your veins is it? Plus the dose you'd have to inject with that tolerance would be insane, doubt itd be worth it for ya and definitely not from a HR point of view

This was my main concern after reviewing this thread as I tried to select a ROA. Initially I would have tried intramuscular injection, being introduced to this procedure through interest in ketamine. And although a solution of a hydrochloride should be less damaging to tissue than that same chemical as a dissolving solid, I didn't want to take muscle damage as my initial risk. I have the impression that the tissue damage is due to a contaminant, not AH-7921 itself, since most posts of sublingual use in the thread do not mention tissue damage.


What I decided to do was convert 26 mg of my small sample of AH-7921 HCl into the base by mixing its solution with a little boiled sodium bicarbonate solution, extracting with toluene and evaporating the extract in a glass bulb pipe with air from an aquarium pump. This worked very nicely and the material vaporized without darkening, and gave mild effects reminiscent of buprenorphine which began as I was vaping and have been fading over the hour since. I have limited opiate experience since I don't enjoy opiates much, but find them helpful in dealing with pain or the side effects of other drugs. One other idea I wanted to suggest is that trying to vaporize the hydrochloride may not be effective with this substance, despite vapor being produced, because elimination of the amine group (decomposition) seems likely based on the structure.

Went for a 100mg iV.  The solution was not easily soluble, but with some vigorous stirring, heat, and a touch a prop gylcol, it dissolved almost completely.  I was pleasantly suprised. Right after injection, a familiar opiate rush ensued.  My muscles tightened then a wave of euphoria followed.

So I notice within 30 seconds after heating the solution it will begin to solidify.  I didn't notice this the first time I shot it, but on my 2nd shot as I was plunging the solution went from clear to white and the rig jammed up.  Should I be concerned about the potential health effects this could cause?  The veins I hit seem to be in okay condition, but it still kind of freaked me out.  Could this cause thrombosis?

^ The only way I foundd this particular substance worth doing was via IV.  At 150mg I experienced a rush somewhat similar to dilaudid/heroin.  So yeah, though on the pricey side, I recommend acquiring some while you can.

Can anyone inform me about potential dangerous combinations with this one except the obvious CNS-depressants?


Since it has a somewhat dissociative effect I guess there are other mechanisms of actions instead only selective µ-affinity.


Thanks guys.

I had the chance to try this chem recently and really liked it,i`ve used opiates for years on and off and have had most of the different types,so when i hear people saying that AH-7921 is not very good i really don`t understand it.


Maybe people are under dosing or just getting bunk product,but with my experience it`s definitely accumalative and stays in the system for long periods,the nod is unreal and the general opiate feeling for me is like morphine or Heroin but lacks the typical euphoria and warmth,although there is some warmth there,it`s way more mongey too.

What doses are you using? What ROA? If you have tried sublingual or intranasal, did you notice any corrosive effect most everyone is talking about?

So many mixed reports on this one!! I have a sample on the way and even thought i've read all that I can find about it, im really not sure exactly how to approach it! (other than start small and work my way up of course)

Also, what does "mongey" mean? I believe I have seen this used a few times, but not sure exactly what it means?

I am curious about this as well. This info came from a respected US vendor who somewhat recently closed shop due to a death. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) They synthed their own chems and were all of HIGH quality which I tried.

Has anyone had any success with IV, IM or vaporized? I don't think these guys would have been putting out this information if it wasn't correct. They seemed to know what they were doing. ?

Mongey is like very sedated,to the point of dribbling or being totally vacant. The sweet spot for me was 150mg orally,i tried 50mg sublingual but it tastes really chemically and pretty horrid,it does burn but not like others have experienced,for me it burnt and numbed a bit like chillies do.

Just received my G sample. 10mg dissolved very well in .10ml distilled water. I didn't think it was very soluble @ 100mg/1ml?

Stuff is VERY bitter @ 5mg allergy test sublingually. 

Also received a G of mxe (or what I hope to be at least) and I have a feeling that they will be crossing eachothers path at some point in my body, not at the same time but likely to overlap.

Has anyone tried this combo or have any input on the safety of this combination?


EDIT: Got 50mg to dissolve with no issue in distilled water. No heat, just a little stirring.

This cant be right, can it???

Ok, so I had let that solution sit in a spoon for a few hours. The outside edges had turned somewhat gelatinous? When I dumped it out and wiped the spoon off, where the solution had been sitting, the actual color of the spoon had changed!! WTF!??! There is now a noticeably darker spot on the spoon where the solution had been. This cannot be normal? I don't think this stuff will be goin amywhere near my body unless someone can explain why this is something I shouldn't be worried about. I have never seen anything like this before. Is it really THAT caustic??? Who knows if this is even AH-7921.

 Wow, just a reminder of how fuxin scary the RC market can be. :/

Oh ok, I took it you were telling me to go find some hydromorphine instead of messing with this. My bad!  

Yes, hydromorphone may go into solution with h2o very easily as it is a known property.  From what I have come to understand through my research online of others experiences trying to get ah-7921 to dissolve in h2o have not been very successful. I understand many drugs a really very water soluble and many are not. It sound like this one is not,  so when I see what I have been told is ah-7921 dissolve easily in room temp distilled water,  whereas every other report I read has required at least hear and stirring, it makes me question whether this substance is in fact ah-7921.

Well i put some AH-7921 in some coca cola and it fizzed like a mofo,i was left with what looked like a frothy coffee,except it tasted like battery acid lol. I believe it is soluble and is somewhat caustic but not that caustic that it would be harmful...Lets face it people drink Coca cola every day without harm,have you seen what Coca cola can do to a dirty coin over night? And also our stomachs can handle very acidic and caustic substances.


I wouldn`t worry too much.

Do you have any AH-7921 left?? If so you should try to throw ~10mg in a spoon with a little water and let it sit for a few hours and let me know if the color of the spoon changes where the solution sat.


I tried about 50mg sublingual for about 5min and this morning when I woke up, the whole underside of my tongue was coated in a white layer of what I assume to be dead skin. My tongue didn't look red or inflamed or anything like that, just a layer of dead skin on bottom of my tongue and along the back/bottom inside gumline.


Also, I believe I felt a nice subtle lift from that dose, even tho I spit it out (was kinda scared to swallow after seeing the spoon thing and how it made my mouth feel) after only letting it absorb for ~5min.


Dosed 60mg oral about 45min ago. Eyes feeling a bit droopy and I have not had to take my daily kratom dose as my pain is almost completely nonexistent, which is awesome! Might have to just keep this around for pain issues. Might try to top it off with some morphine later to see if it works well as a potentiator. I cant imagine using this chemical in any way other than oral. Also tried just a small amount IV to see if it would burn, and it did burn as well as leaving my skin a bit red around the site, about the size of a nickel for an hour or two. No noticeable psychotropic effects other than maybe pain relief.

Honestly Stretch,don`t worry too much about the caustic effect of AH-7921.If you put Amphetamine sulphate under your tongue for a period of time you will notice that it also burns or can burn.


AH-7921 is great as a potentiater of opiates and also has sedative and pain reduction qualities itself,imo AH-7921 is underrated,i think it`s because people are looking for it to be something it`s not.I take Kratom daily and have found that i don`t have to take it when i have AH-7921,but if i do take it it`s in much smaller amounts and it also has a much stronger effect,i can nod on Kratom when on AH-7921.

Hey Stretch, what dosages did you use for oral ingestion?


Damn, haven't done any opis for nearly two weeks and already thinking about getting some again ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)

I used anywhere from 20-100mg. 100mg is was almost too much for me. A little too sedating and stupefying. Gonna try 75mg at once next go and see how that goes. I think medium dose along with few grams of some quality kratom will be really nice. Last night I found it works REALLY well with etizolam. I actually felt a lot of euphoria. Moreso than either of these has given me alone. 


DOes anyone else notice they get a really raspy voice from this? Like moreso than most opiates? It might have something to do with this sickness I cant shake but I know it is not that alone.

Extended use of large doses will lead to unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. I was dosing 250-350mg every day or two for probably six weeks, maybe a bit longer, with the odd binge. I stopped and immediately fell into withdrawals, including:


1. Severe night sweats. Waking up several times during the night drenched in sweat. This also led to me oversleeping by ridiculous amounts, like 14 hours.

2. Lethargy during the day

3. Sensitivity to cold. Even wrapped up warm I found going outdoors very unpleasant.

4. Apathy.


Recommencing AH7921 doses at about 100mg helped a lot with 1. and eradicated 2, 3 and 4.


I am investigating other treatments, like clonidine for the sweats, sleeping aids, and mild stimulants for the lethargy and apathy. But in the meantime I am back on the stuff, at reduced dose, with the intent to taper.


It's no joke of a drug!

Did you experience some skin issues in the face? Because I suspected the AH to be the culprit a while ago and they are gone since I don't take it anymore (for now).

Can't you switch to another opioid or is this the only one available for you. As it was for me after my Tilidine source went dry...

However, take care.

Skin issues? I have bags under my eyes and a bit of skin discolouration from years of abnormal sleep and drink/drug use. Other than I haven't noticed skin issues that I would relate to the AH.

Yeah he locked himself out of his account and his registered email address, went through several more accounts and now has disappeared. He has been having a hard time with too much benzos. I'm in touch with him on Facebook though. I messaged him yesterday to see how he is, but he's not replied. He was talking about going on a BL sabbatical, maybe he's doing that. If I hear more I will post, probably in the [EADD Gibberings](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/667155-Gibberings-CXXVI-Post-moar-Kenny-says-so) thread. Or here if you want me to?

Thanks for the info. Maybe it was just my diet at the time.


And I just wanted to know if he is ok when I saw his crossed username. I will check out the Gibberings-thread so this one does not get cluttered.

Ive skimmed through this thread but cannot find anyone commenting much on my original question (quoted below).


I am on bupe and have been for years. Down to .5mg to 1mg per day. Running out of bupe soon and doubt i can afford to see my doctor as well as refill my prescription.


Just wondering if i would have any luck substituting or supplimenting my bupe with AH-7921. I'm not looking for any recreational effects whatsoever anymore, strictly just need to maintain so i can get though the day. I'm three years into my bup treatement (without relapse) which came after 10 years of heavy daily opiate abuse. I don't want to screw up but I'm broke and simply cannot afford to see my doctor again for awhile.


Any experience here? Timing, doseage or recommendations? Thanks in advance.

From my experience it works very well in that particular case. My tolerance was also around ~1mg of Bupe a day and ~100mg AH-7921 oral (or 75mg sublingual...) were enough for one day of feeling good.

The long duration is a big advantage with this one. 


So you could definitely try it. I would be interested in hearing about that if you intend to do it.

Not much mention of snorting it on here, I just snorted a small amount, about 30mg, it burned a bit but not too much, would you recommend oral doses after this instead? I plan on dosing once more tonight, I think I'll do a 120mg bomb or something around that area.

I have some on the way and will be experimenting with first combining suboxone and AH-7921and then actually replacing suboxone with AH-7921 until I can get enough money together to go see my doctor again. Ill let you know how it goes....

Considering how it feels in the mouth when sublingualed I never bothered with snorting. It must feel terrible with the right amounts needed even though it numbs the areas a little bit but the taste and tingling sensation...brrr. But if someone here sniffed around 75-100mg I'd be interested in how it was (how sadistic, eh?).

Good luck with your plan. I will have some next week to taper off 1mg Buprenorphine. Again...

It is very useful for that purpose and for pain management. Let's hope this one will stay around for a while.


I am also interested in the details how it works pharmacologically.

Im hoping to go the other way, from about 100mg - 150mg of AH per day to 8mg of buprenorphine. (Clinician said this was the average starting dose.) Does this conversion sound about right ?

No. It sounds terribly wrong. Try 1-2mg first and work your way up. From what I've read 8mg subutex will be overkill for this AH dosage. Doctors in general do not have a single clue about buprenorphine dosage. They understimate the potency of this chemical.

I have a modest quantity of this compound. From a friend I heard about AH-7921 that it is mostly interesting for combinations or purely for actual analgesic purposes. Apparently it potentiates and/or changes the nature of the high of other opioids.

He combined it with codeine... I have oxy myself. Does anyone have experience with that combination? I wonder what a dosage indication is of potentiation of oxy. Of course I will try AH-7921 on its own first following that unwritten rule.


It shall only be oral for me. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

You are right but 1mg will be enough to substitute 100-150mg AH-7921. Don't take more than that the first time blueelephant.

My oxy tolerance is slowly rising but I don't have that much experience with it so far. Can do 30-50 mg though 20 mg was plenty in the past, yet 10 mg still gets me going.


I have only 250 mg of AH-7921 and it is not necessarily economical to only try to get my oxy to last longer, but I am interested in synergy. Maybe 50 mg of AH-7921 and 10-20 mg oxy will be interesting but of course not before I test the waters first to get a feeling for it by itself...

Fuck, ive just had/having a mad panic attack from a small morning dose of AH7921. Has this happened to anyone else ? I think maybe i did something stupid when wasted, like transfer the contents of the baggie into a container with something already in - definately feels like cannabinoid. And now im approaching the last of my supply, all the cannabinoid must have somehow settled, even though i regularly shook and mixed the container....All very strange. Have had a few anxiety attacks from it recently too, but this mornings has been one of the worse i can remember.


Its only just sunk in, whats happeened to Mugz too, and is very unsettling and upsetting. I wonder if what happened to Mugz played its part (I know im a fucking drama queen sometimes, but im pretty fucked up now, when i had to leave the house to go to my course the panic started and i couldntnt go, but is subsiding now. Im gonna have to buy a bit more ah to test if its the stuff itself, or if ive contaminated whats left of my supply.


Wasnt sure whether to post this is the Mugs RIP gibberrings thread, as it might be out of place there, so im posting it in the AH thread. ![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)

I've always wanted to find some RC opioids...now that i have, i'm left with so many questions.


Not to mention i'm kind of a HUGE FUCKING PUSSY when it comes to taking untested drugs...although i'm sure some FDA approved drugs have worse side effects than illegal drugs etc...


Research Chemicals scare me though..just with the name.


I could have used some of this for the 20 page research paper i had to write..my back hurted so bad. At least it's over now..

Im back but thanks for your concern. Knock pretty much summed it up. I think it was when i ordered 2g of phenazepam powder that things really started to go wrong. I didnt have any problems measuring the dosage, due to disolving it in MPG but Its feels so nice I was taking more than i should have been, as the supply seemed so plentyfull. It has prominent side effects for me on all sorts of mental and physical functioning, eg l completely lost my abilty to type for a few weeks (my fingers just couldnt find the right keys, what had come naturally and nimbly was gone) I can only guess that was what caused an increase in my fucked up-ness, as everything else stayed pretty much the same.


But im better now, apart from only having 3 hours sleep since Wednesday night, thanks to 3,4-CTMP. I didnt think anything could be stronger and harder on the body than MDPV, but i think this stuff is.


Back on topic for the AH thread, any1 else get anxious or panicky on it ? (a new 500 mg bag arrived this morning, so im already testing my contamination theory. It seems to be correct so far).

Hey mdb, good to have you back ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) But dude, lay of the Phenaz. I had some crazy things happening with only 100mg (although not nearly as bad as you...) and I also dosed properly, no eyeballing etc.


If Etiz aren't for you and you need an RC-Benzo I suggest trying out Flubromazepam since it seems to have a half-life around 30h and is similar to Phenazepam, but not that big recipe for desaster.

(Of course it would be better to leave them alone, or if not possible at least the uppers which often lead to more downers & so on). Sry for moralizing.

-

Btt: Never had anything like that with AH. It always made me happy and content.

Hi ppl I havnt read the whole thread so il just tell u what smim thinks of AH . Swim found the best roa to be iv, and while on 20mg methadone daily he would iv 250mg and sometimes more to get a very pleasant stone an nodding of aswell. I read it was 80% strength of morph ,this might be true for pain management but if u want to get high u need alot more than that. Swim thinks AH is great, its much cheaper than morphine and when iv'd it doesn't give the horrible pins and needles and histamine release feeling that morph does. Swim has mixed AH with oxy, morph, bezoes ,weed and incence all with no adverse affects. The only thing that worries me is i can't find any real info like toxicity and long term affects . Also swim never tried snorting as there is no point cos it just goes down back of ur throught and swim got nearly no effects from 250mg oral. Overall swim gives Ah7921 a big thumbs up and will begin to stockpile some before the online RC castle comes crumbling down.


Piumo

Okay so i`ve been using whole leaf Kratom for nearly a year then found out about AH-7921,what a mistake that was.My tolerance to the Kratom was way through the roof and thought adding the AH to the mix might make things better,it did,but then i found that the Kratom started to have no effect at all as my AH dose increased,so i ditched the Kratom.


Then i was given a small stash of Oramorph,about 300ml which i used alongside the AH,what a powerful combo that was,then the Morphine ran out...Then the AH went up,and i got 200ml of black market Methadone,you can see where i`m going with this.


So now i`ve consulted my doctor because i can see how out of control i`ve become and he`s recommended using Buprenorphine @ 24mg a day,i didn`t want to go down the Methadone programe route as i`ve done that before,about 14yrs ago to come off Heroin and that was a fookin nightmare. I`ve been on the Bupe for two weeks now,but fuck i want to get off this shit now,it don`t really do jack shit apart from stopping me from getting ill...Well i suppose it does do what it`s meant to do.


Why am i posting this? Just to say that AH is not to be fucked with,it is most definitely a powerful opiate. Be careful guys.

Hello all, I started playing with AH today and am "relatively" opiate naive as it has been awhile.  I tried 100mg sublingual 5 hours ago with little effect. 


When I tried to dissolve it in bacteriostatic iv solution, it was clearly not soluble as has been reported.  How the poster above is getting 250mg shots is beyond me.


After reading the DMSO solubility, which isn't great,  I am experimenting with DMSO/AH solutions on my skin.   With 100mg AH in 2ml 70% DMSO solution, I am slowly applying it to my wrist via q-tip as it absorbs.  I can taste the DMSO now, and started applying it 15 minutes ago or so. Histamine itch is present.


Ill update this later if anything novel occurs.

I would just eat 150mg and if that doesn't work 200mg. I didn't feel anything until I got to about 200mg. I mean, it's fairly cheap (at least where I am) and absorbing it through your skin sounds like a real faff! Do you not find it irritating? It was certainly irritating to my rectum.

Since I started taking Paroxetine 20 mg/day, almost all opiates do little for me. But I find AH7921 very potent, I'm nodding at 80 mg. Very dreamy the next day after I dose, seems like NMDA antagonism.

IDK how somebody can take it sublingual, it's extremely caustic.

^No, as you can read in this thread oral has a low bioavailability but works and sublingual is stronger but (if you got the freebase) pretty unpleasant. The HCL is better but still numbing and corrosive.

Sry but trying to quit opiates but not the needle doesn't make any sense in my mind.

Eh? I could just repeat everything DickTate said. Where the hell did you get this idea from? I don't understand how you could reach that conclusion if you read even just the posts on this page.

Ah, I understand now. The needle fixation. Never IV'd myself so I wasn't thinking about that. Maybe it is a step towards weaning off IV use of harder opis, but maybe it's just a way to prolong the habit!

I tried this stuff orally and sublingually & all I got was a burned tongue.  Got a nasty propoxyphene feeling from it which makes me wonder if it's equally bad for the heart (QT prolongation).  just a 6th sense but I don't have a good feeling about it, plus it doesn't get me high.

I love the (possibly delusional )feeling that i've developed very fine skills in various drug related preparations. Like i can now measure ah7921 to the exact mg using a cocktail stick or match and sliding it out from a tupper ware container. I love being able to do this. The fuckin plastic baggies make this impossible though.

Ok i should hav elaborated on dissolveing. So to start with the drug was in freebase form ,which I found from experience and from the cas number. So obviously the freebase wouldn't dissolve in water even with lots of heat. Infact we needed to add vinegar (acetic acid) and even then it would need heat but it would dissolve. But I found it needed a lot of water because sometimes it would precipitate out of solution upon cooling, I'm not sure if this was caused from not enough acetic acid or the acid was just to weak. In the end for a 250mg shot I added 1ml vinegar an 2ml water then heated till boiling and crystal clear, which didn't take long , then I would filter and inject still warm.

Next time I will try make HCl salt which I think will be more stable than acetate salt.

Just found this bit of info on caymanchems.com


 AH 7921 is an N-substituted cyclohexylmethylbenzamide classified as an opioid analgesic with high addictive liability. It acts as a selective μ-opioid receptor agonist. Minimal oral effective doses for complete pain suppression by AH 7921 are 1.25 and 13.8 mg/kg for canine and rhesus monkey, respectively. This product is intended for research and forensic applications.

Ok so I hav a bit more info about  this stuff, specificly dissolving it. Ok so I know the first order was ah7921 freebase and neaded vinegar and lots of heat and ,well  I use 3ml of water .

So now from a different vendor I hav ah7921 hydrochloride , and after some experimenting the result was a bit odd. So I started at 150mg ( this was a medium dose 4 me cos I'm on 20mg methadone daily and also recently ,with the help of a friend, devoured 10g of AH.) So 150mgs ah7921-HCl in the spoon and start to heat ,so pretty soon its boiling but still milky an not all dissolved ! After a minute bubbling away its clear and totally dissolved but still wants to precipitate out, this suprised me as I thought HCl salt would be more stable an soluble than acetate . So next time its bubbling away again taking some time, so I take it of the heat while its still milky looking . Now this is odd , I slowly drop only 4 drops of vinegar and within 10 seconds its all clear! with no stirring ! 

It's got me a bit baffled, all I can think is that the ah salts are not very water soluble.

Anyone know/think what's going on hear? Maybe another easy made/obtained acid would make a more soluble salt, I will try citric and tartaric acid next time I hav freebase.

Too bad this chemical isn't really water soluble.  I tried a variety of methods to try to get a clear solution, but nothing seemed to work.  I've had the chance to IV it multiple times and it can produce one hell of a rush, but the damage it does to your veins isn't close to worth it.  It's been 2 months and the injection site is still rock hard and the vein is completely ruined, though it is slowly healing.  Anyways, do not try to IV this one, it's just not worth it.

Not water soluble? I beg to differ, but maybe you have a freebase and I had a salt?

I found a gram of this in the mail the other day and I can definitely say that 40-45 mg plugged in 2-3mls of water did not make me shit my guts out the way any amphetamine/PEA or even 20mg ritalin would, to say the least of the cathinones my ass has known and loved. maybe you all are using too much vaseline or something. 


also, this stuff works at that dosage for me, but it's kinda nauseating. maybe that's more having to do with all the methamphetamine i've been taking, and my not having ate since yesterday. this feels a cross between tramadol and codeine i'd say, with less side effects of either but still not quite feeling like a full on opiate. i'll keep plugging since that seems to be the most effective ROA. good luck dumping expensive dosages down your throats boys and girls, this one's meant to be snuck in through the back door

Just to be clear when I said my bowels rejected the drug I was not talking about a come-up shit. I meant the chemical irritated the walls of my rectum sufficiently to cause an urgent expulsion. No faecal matter was passed. No vaseline used. It was a response to chemical irritation.


Individual variation may play a part here, for example some people find ethylphenidate intolerable in their nose but I'm OK with it, although I do find it unpleasant.

EDIT: i apologize for the lengthiness of tnis post; mods if you think it belongs in TR plz comment so, and I will move it. i put it here bc there is not enough research on this chemical yet, and found a few aspects of this chem quite promising.. Thx :D


Ok, so I received a 250 mg sample of this chem last week.  As a chronic pain sufferer due to a car accident in 2011, I was eager to try this in hopes of finding an alternative to traditional opiates such as oxycocdone, which i am prescribed to. I abstained from my usual 30mg oxycodone 3× daily and took no other meds as well that day to rule out any possible drug interactions.

I began w taking a toothpick and sticking the tip of it in the bag to pull a few mgs out to an allergy test. The taste was absolutely vile, and 

as stated on here pretty often, it was most certainly caustic, with just a few mgs leaving me with a blister under my tounge where i placed it. I then attempted to vaporize 10mg, as i had read by several was their preffered ROA. it burned quickly, and had a horrid chemical taste that was untolerable after one small puff, so i did not even attempt to finish vaping. No noticeable effects other than slight numbness of the mouth and a horrible taste i could not shake. yuck!

Finally, I measured out a 100mgs put  it in a capsule and swallowed. At this point, I was in moderate opiate withdrawal and hurting worse than usual. I began to feel inital effects in about 30 min. i felt a bit oddly stimulated for the first hour, which quickly faded away into no noticeable effects other than wanting to lie down and rest. I did notice a significant decrease in pain, however; and all signs and symptoms of w/d subsided. rest came easy and i fell asleep about 3 hrs into the experiment. slept well and uninterrupted for 7 hrs which is rare for me, as opiates tend go severely disrupt my sleep. 

 I awoke refreshed and feeling very little pain,even  less than i felt when i fell asleep. In fact i felt so well, that I skipped my first two doses of 30mg oxy the following day. It seems it indeed does stay in the system a while, bc mornings are the worse for me, and usually I take something w breakfast for pain relief. Finally around 24 hours after having taken AH and nearly 48 hrs since having taken any oxy, I took my first 30 mg of the day. It affected me way more than typical, I even got a decent nod off of it, which i thought was crazy. My mood was overall more positive and sociable. I was in more than usual good spirits, leading me to believe it may possess some mood altering effects.

so here we have a chemical completely different in structure from opiates, that is both an effective long lasting pain killer, a mood enhancer, and effective w/d tool, though hardly any CNS effect to speak of.

I was all in all quite pleased with my findings. The only potential drawbacks to me were how corrosive it seemed to be at such a small initial test, and the obvious fact that afaik, there is not much, if any,  documented medical research to speak of outside of the rc scene. I the corrosive nature of it wasnt so evident, and we knew more about it as far as tolerance and toxicity, Id be inclined to do much more in depth research as it no doubt shows promise. I still have ~135 mg left that i will research under the same conditions sometime next week to further validate my findings.


Any one else tried it and experienced next day potentiation of opiates, or a decrease in opiate tolerance as i have? It clearly was not placebo as i have been on 90mg oxy a day for years now, and should have been sweating and sore from having not taken a single dose in almost 48 hrs. 


Typically,long lasting pain meds used to combat withdrawal, such as methadone or bupe, increase tolerance significantly. Where as Ah-7921 seemed to potentiate, or perhaps decrease my usual tolerance. I plan on ordering 500mg tt test this more accurately and see if there is any additional increase in my meds effects that last longer than just the day after. If so, this could be very useful to say the least.


Very interesting stuff indeed.More data is def needed on this chemical. Hope this helps some.

I have some food for thought.... If AH-7921 is around 80% strength of Morphine and most people are comparing it to street H, which is 4 to 5 times the strength of Morphine when pure (2 - 2.5 mg H = 10 mg Morphine when metabolised according to several on-line conversion charts). Would a 50 mg dose not be considered small? I have a small tolerance to H (200 mg usually being a bit too much). UK brown is 45% - 53% pure on average according to government tests at the end of last year. So take it as 40% (to under-cut the alleged purity) and that means around 80 mg of a 200 mg bag is Diacetylmorphine. Morphine being 4 - 5  times weaker than brown, then that means a dose of of 320 mg of Morphine if 2.5 mg H = 10 mg Morphine. AH-7921 apparently being 80% as strong as Morphine means that an AH-7921 dose would be more like 400 mg for the equivalent amount of morphine in out systems. Hell, even is street H is only 20% pure, then it would still require a 200 mg dose of AH-7921 to be realistically compared to each other...


I realise this is just the amount of it that would be metabolised to morphine and there could be other things at play after ingestion. But given the above, are we not all taking too small a dose and saying that it is weak and useless?


Is what I say even a valid point, or is there something at play else that would simply make my point moot?

Yes typically I take 200-250mg and I am not a hardened opiate user by any stretch. Oral.

Has anybody else noted that you don't get 'pinned' pupils? I have little tolerance & felt it (but nothing euphoric) but eyes were not affected. Two real junkie mates shot 150mg each and said 'couldn't FEEL it but I didn't rattle for 12 hours'.

i used to need 300 mg to feel anything. Ive tapered down to 35 now. I took 150mg last night as a treat/relapse/call it what you will.


Astonishing euphoria and a big warm mellow high off just 150mg last night, along with some etiz and noids. Almost up to odt levels. I reckon my opiate receptors and endorphins have apprecaaited the lower level of caining  ive subjected them to in recent weeks. They thanked me for it last night. it was wonderful......


Id steer clear unless u hvae very low tolerance, or your using it for tapering or w/e. Its so good to have knocked that tolerance on the head.  The jumping off part doest seem so straightforward now tho.


the fact that ive finally got a tolerance low enough to be able to actually get high off it, makes it harder to quit. What a fuckin carry om. Honestly.

Hey guys,


mdb: Like I suggested, I would switch from the AH to Kratom and then taper down that way. Was the easiest of my WD-trys regarding symptoms, even if I only made it 4 days...


knock: with a low tolerance 75mg sublingual was my standard dose to be pleasantly buzzed and productive. But yeah, oral it would need around 125-150mg.

-

Damn, day 11 and I could easily start again next week. Which I won't.

I always IM'd 75-200mgs. I have a natural tolerance to opi's unfortunately. I can't say i've found much from AH, though admittedly i've only used it about twice alone. I always combined it with MXE into the IM shot. It surely was a crazed come up, great for the pain I was/am in. Thinking of getting more for that reason. Seriously miss the proper +ODT that certain RC compaines with brillant reps had. Oh well though, probably for the best because AH isn't nearly as compulsive as ODT.

Can you be certain of that ? Certain that it doesnt give the opiod receptors just enough of what they need? That could be all they need. We dont know the active doses to we ?


Admittedly, all this is sounding more and more like clutching at straws. 35mg must be at least borderline placebo if not the mildest possible dose. I believe it'll be singnificantly easier to jump at 5 mg than 35mg though. 


You missed the good bit of my post about how my opi tolerance has dropped so much. That 150mg last night was so nice. Did 150 tonight, no where near as pleasurable an experience. Isnt it weird. 


Ze Taper must continue tomorrow as planned ! Might not be too bad as if you are correct ive just had a very low dose two night binge, which shouldnt trigger much in the way of WDs, youd have thought, in theory ?


Hope im making sense. Hows my bitcoin doing.......

I was trying to encourage you by showing you how small your problem was ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) You've done well though, no doubt.


AH has always been a bit hit or miss for me, 300mg should get me nodding, but sometimes I've barely felt it. I think stomach contents have a lot to answer for.

I most certainly have pin point pupils right now from AH, I done a 175mg +/-5mg shot IV and it is a really pleasant buzz, much better than codeine, but much worse than brown. Directly in the middle of both those I would say...

You need to take those numbers with a large grain of salt. The % Str figures are generated in a test tube using pieces of Guinea pig intestine. The %str is a relative measure of how much the opiate inhibits the contractions of the intestine segment, as this is an indirect indicator of Mu-receptor biding affinity [I think the Guinea pig intestine does not express the other opiate receptor subtypes].


At best, the %Str number is a measurement of the relative constipation induced by the opiate.

Based on what I've read/seen, the %Str is also a good predictor of analgesia induced by the opiate (and the %Str is often validated in animal pain studies).


But I think the correlation is very weak between that number and how euphoric or intoxicating a compound is.

This seems like a waste of time...


Who really knows the true strength? Is the freebase smokable?

Hey I'm a long time user of AH-7921, I posted on some of the first few pages of this thread last year, suggesting sublingual administration as the best ROA. I lost my bluelight L/P/email though ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


Anyways, for those who are IV'ing this compound, could you describe how you're able to solubilize it? I'm working with the freebase, and in contrast to other recent posts, I find acid doesn't work to keep it in solution (A hot, solubilized solution will still precipitate upon cooling). Also, I thought I would share some solubility data that I obtained from a professional neuroscience company that is studying it.


> For longterm storage,we suggest that AH 7921 be stored at -20C where it should be stable for at least two years. AH 7921 is soluble in organic solvents such as ethanol, DMSO, and dimethyl formamide, which should be purged with an inert gas. The solubility of AH 7921 in these solvents is 11, 3, and 10 mg/ml respectively. 
> 
> 
> 
> Ah 7921 is only sparingly soluble in water-based buffers. For maximum solubility in aqueous buffers, AH 7921 should first be dissolved in ethanol, and then slowly diluted with the aqueous buffer of choice. AH 7921 has a solubility of approximately 0.5 mg/ml in a 1:1 solution of ethanol:saline (phosphate buffered pH 7.2) using this method. We do not recommend storing the diluted solution for more than one day.

That's what human Guinea pigs are for. This GP and others posting to this thread have reported 100-200mg to be a reasonable dose (in my case I prefer SL). It only burns the underside of my tounge the first time I use it. My skin peels off sort of like when I burn the roof of my mouth on something hot.


After that, the burning doesn't happen again with repeat dosing, unless I take a few weeks off.

Lemon juice or ascorbic acid. The only issue being, as soon as the solution cools down, the AH precipitates and re-forms it's freebase form and separates from the water in the pin. Just suck it up and wack it while it is still hot, the chemicals in the blood stream will then ensure it stays in a liquid form and stop it precipitating back once again. I encountered your issue when I made up a dig and then went to get a drink, came back and it had separated (this took about 2 or 3 minutes to happen)!  


I find 175 mg the perfect dose via this ROA too by the way. As for my opiate tolerance, it is rather small at the moment. 200mg street H, but very rarely.


Also, I have been drinking 3 or 4 pints of lager during my sessions on AH the last few times and it does really improve the euphoria a lot...

^ Thanks for this. I have some new interesting experimental data to report.


Subject's tolerance: 

Tapering down from an IV H habit that he picked up ~3 months ago. Has cut back from 6 bags(~200-300mg)/day to 3 bags/day in a single shot. The H doesn't get him high, just gives him a dizzy rush ~10min and stops him from getting sick. Last use of H was 20 hr ago (3 bags). Subject sublingually dosed AH-7921 as follows: 50mg 8 hrs ago, and 100mg 2 hrs ago.


Dissolving Method:


Two diff IV preps were made side-by-side. Method A as described ^^^ above by adrandell116, using sterile IV-grade saline and vinegar. Method B - 50mg AH-7921 was placed in a sterile cooker, and 0.20 ml containing 0.10ml 70% isopropanol and 0.10 ml sterile IV-grade distilled water. A bit of powder dissolved immediately without heating. Then 0.80ml distilled water was added (total 1ml) and the mix heated.


**Of note **, the powder in Method B dissolved before the liquid was boiling, where the powder in method A required a full boil. Just to be safe, Method B was cooked to boiling also.Method B was chosen to proceed with. The mix was injected hot, but very gradually. Only 0.8 ml was used, 0.2 ml left behind. 


**Of note**, after the injection was finished, I glanced over at the two mixtures. Mixture A had come out of solution. Mixture B was still perfectly clear. Either the distilled water, the isopropanol, of the combination made a HUGE difference to the solubility.


Effects:

IV'd 40 mg of AH-7921. It produced a STRONG rush - more intense than the 3 bags of H he's been doing, and DEFINITELY more Euphoric. There is also an ever so slight trippy quality. Tracers seen around trees blowing in the wind outside. 15min later and back baseline (== feeling the 100 mg dose of AH that done sublingual ~2h ago == no where close to nod-land.)

Raybeez2, do you mean that all 6 bags would amount to 200 - 300 mg? That is one and a half bags for me locally if it is the higher weight margin, so I bloody hope not! It would be cheaper for you to pack up and move home down to where I am and maintain your habit, than it would if you were to keep buying 4.5 bags extra to get the same amount of brown where you live. Haha.


Off topic I know, but I had to get an answer to this... :/

can you remember how much ah you were taking when you switched, and how much kratom did u take to taper, and was it a quick taper from then on in ?  Sorry to bombard you with all these questions. I'll be back down to 100mg tonight i think, then 50mg the next night. Hopefully the cunts at the prescribing clinic will have changed their mind and will give me some subs (i think theres been a bit of arse kicking going on behind closed doors there - the way im suddenly being asked to try thrm again) - theyve seen what happens whgen they dont help - i hit a brick wall and relapse. I'll speak to them tomorrow.

I was on ~75mg sublingual when I switched to ~7g of Maeng Da Kratom. And yeah it was quick. Over 3 or 4 days only Kratom and then jumped off. One day was pretty bad but the rest was mild compared to my recent cut off from 0,4mg Buprenorphine. Restlessness & Insomnia being the main symptoms and a little diarrhea but nothing serious.


No problem with your bombardement, I'm glad to help ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Iirc it was more like 2 heaped teaspoons. And yeah, I only took it once a day. Sort off as a replacement and to have something to consume even if it did not affect me the whole day. More like a psychological thing.

its a very unexpected thing thats happened to me. My lowering of tolerance has made this drug enjoyable at 100mg to 200 mg and it no longer just something to send me to sleep. Its gonna be doubly hard to quit the stuff now im enjoying it again, and life feels good again.....

This is unfortunate. Then try to switch to kratom without AH-taper? Are you taking it orally or sublingual?

Hm, I got my Bupe at the first day, why is this so damn hard in other areas? 

But I think only a fast Bupe taper would make sense in your case or it goes higher up the ladder again...


€: For me its day 13 and I took 2mg Lorazepam today and saturday. Only 2mg more left which is good. No access anymore but I think I will get some Gabapentin as a backup.

So where would people rank this among other opiates? Does it come close to morphine/hydrocodone? Or is it just a mild codeine/dihydrocodeine type opiate? I know it's not anywhere near oxy/heroin but if it's better then codeine then i'll be willing to give it a try.

It depends on the ROA. It has little to no use via any, apart from IV in my opinion, but IV is not for everyone.

I have to disagree with you. I think PO is a perfectly acceptable ROA for this compound.


I've tried this compound twice so far with almost 4 months between the two trials and no other opiate use whatsoever, which also includes no kratom use or any other non-morphinan opioids.

My first try was first 5 mg, for checking any adverse reactions, followed by 20 mg an hour later, not much happened on that trial. This week I tried 55 mg PO and after a couple of hours (2-3) I definitely got into a nice opioid buzz.

And from reading the first couple pages of this thread, I seem to remember that for an opioid naive person a dose between 20 and 75 mg was recommended, which seems fairly correct to me, based on my two trials.


The two peculiar things that I noted about this compound (and I note sure if this is already discussed in thread) is the slow come-up and the long duration. Like I said the come-up lasted between 2-3 hours and the duration was almost around 12 hours before I was back to baseline. Has anybody else (that is fairly opioid naive) also similar experiences with this compound? I'm really curious what the reason for this could be, perhaps some active metabolite(s)?

Whoever said a few pages back that withdrawal from this shit is no fun, wasn't wrong. I'm on day 6 and still feel like shite.I was dosing up to 350mg per day for about 4 months, so that excessiveness might have something to do with it... The w/d is nowhere near as intense as from, say, ODT or H but I think with the long half life of AH-7921 this is going to be a long haul. Does anyone think kratom would help? And the real problem is: I've still got 10 grams of this horror sitting on my bedroom shelf, God help me!

Me, I think. I definitely said it at some point in this thread anyway. Keep going, it doesn't last too long! Well, your habit is a bit bigger than mine was (250-300mg over a month or so), so maybe it'll last longer, but my w/ds were over in a couple of weeks. I ordered a little stash of clonidine to help after a week of horrible, sweat-drenched, sleepless nights, but by the time they arrived the w/ds were pretty much gone and I didn't have to use them. Yes, kratom can help. Try 6-7g of Red Vein Borneo for a fairly long-lasting but mild aid. White Vein Sumatra doesn't last as long but you feel more like you've taken a drug - although you'll be totally functional ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Does the duration seem to shorten vastly after a week or so of constant abuse? I find this happens with opiates a lot, but not always.

Well I didn't find any diminution in duration after several months of abuse.

Hey folks, 


New here.  Been following Bluelight for ages, but had not registered until now.


The many mixed opinions in this thread have compelled me to procure some AH-7921, in order to see for myself.  The information here is invaluable, and I want to thank everyone for taking the time to share their experience with others.


It's been suggested to me in another forum that the caustic properties of the polar molecule AH-7921 might be neutralized or greatly reduced by way of its dissolution into 99.9% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), itself a polar molecule that is extremely well tolerated by human tissue. The resulting solution would, in theory, by suitable for intramuscular injection, affording a high degree of bioavailability with minimum risk to muscular tissue (and epithelial tissue as well, by avoiding other ROAs like sublingual and intranasal).


I have a great deal of experience with intramuscular injection, but only with distilled water + ketamine.  I'd love to hear people's thoughts on AH-7921 + DMSO for intramuscular injection, as I would prefer a maximum degree of confidence before attempting it.

Ironically it looks like the CRI have had a turn around and will now prescribe me buprenorphine/subutex to get off the AH after all the efforts ive put in myself. Someone with a heart seems to have stepped forward. Someone somewhere must have had words with the Dr who turned me away cos AH didnt show up on his poxy test. It could have been anyone of 5 different workers. I seem to have ammased a small army of workers, all women, all on my side. The one male in the story apart from myself turned out to be a cunt.


The ironic thing is that im on taper attempt number 4 now; BUT i have it figured out this time, and i know where ive been going wrong. Ive been cutting too slowly from the high doses - so from to 200 mg to 195, and then reduce another 5 the next week. As you can imagine this took fuckin ages. By the time i was down to 50 mg or so i was fuckin sick of tapering. I had several relapses during, and then would slowly taper down agaain. Ive found theres no need, i can have a fucking 350mg blow out 1 night. then taper down to like 200,175,150,125,100. Itll be 75 tonight. When i get down to 50 ill switch back to 5mg decrements (is that a word?).


Dont know for sure yet if im gonna be given subs. I know fuck all about them. Not gonna start reading up on them until i get the prescription in my hands. I think they wanna do it over 4 or 5 weeks; like .8 1 week, .6 the next etc etc... I thought bupe tapers could and should be done very quickly ? I was hoping to use them to taper off in 5 days. Any comments from anyone familiar with buprenorphine/subutex ?

Hey mdb, great to hear you are getting some professionell help ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

But as you said, I agree with tapering as fast as possible. I was on 1mg for over a month and that was definitely too long for my previous habit. Buprenorphine is so potent and can just hook you as bad as AH or even worse although being a partial agonist.


I can't say much more but I think 4 or 5 weeks would be too long not just because of the long and drawn out WDs but in general. More like 1-2 weeks max in my opinion. That said I am not that familiar with Bupe-detoxes. Only personal experience.


Btw, after 18 days I consumed some Tilidine again in the idiotic illusion of maybe using once in a blue moon...

Not regularly but still unbelievably stupid. This defies my character so much since I am a very rational person :/

Just take my stupidness as an example how not to behave during the Paws. Good luck and success with your taper, my PM-box is always open.

Are you saying you dont think you'll be able to be a "chipper" then. Im pretty certain i wont be able to either. Unless it  was a one off chance meeting to acquire just 1 nice dose of something interesting.


Drugs have a way of getting through defences like intelligence and rationality. The part of you that craves them will have done this (it happens to me every time i stopped smoking). If youve already taken it, just put it down to a mistake, but dont beat yourself up, youve done great, one mistake is nothing. You might have made things harder for yourself in PAWS though. If it increases cravings again for a while remember all the toughness, effort and sweat you put into getting clean. You dont want all that to be for nothing.

As we all know "once in a blue moon" can easily become "once a month" then "once a fortnight" etc.

Yeah, pretty much the same for me. I appreciate the kind words. My future tactic is just to take 300mg Gabapentin if the cravings get bad again.


Oh, I forgot to mention that my switch from AH to Bupe was very easy, nearly unnoticeable. Maybe a little encouragement for you.

That is very encouraging. Can you remember how much AH you were using just before you switched. Also what dose of bupe did you start on, and how long did your taper take ?.....

it is simillar to morphine - pretty low on euphoria, so you need to find a dose high enough to get you high, but if you take too much it will just send you to sleep. That came to be its main attraction for me - on my last taper i got stuck on 35mg. For 9 days and nights i got an hour or 2 sleep. I couldnt take any more as i was going stir crazy. I do not cope at all well with a lack of sleep.


I went back on it with a vengeance for a few days. Started off with some poppy tea and AH and i was completelty fucked. It forgotten the first harm reduction rule of opiate tapering or quitting - remember your tolerance will have dropped a very long way....

No need to apologize. I was using about 75mg sublingual or between 100 & 150mg oral once a day. Then started on 1mg Subutex (first also sublingual, later sniffing if possible) and kept that dose for about two weeks and then reduced to 0,8 for one and to 0,4 for another week (this time only nasally...) before jumping off. Maybe a few days more or less in between so it is not 100% accurate.


But I don't know if you will be good with 0,8mg if you have to take it via sl. Obviously the snorting is contraproductive so I'd advise against that and try it the more reliable way even if the BA is lower.

yeah, i hear you can get a buzz of it if you snort it your first one or 2 times. The oral bioavailabilty is 10 % which is fuckin abysmal. SL is 30 %.


I dunno if i'll be good on it either. It all sound very confusing atm. You take 2mg every time you feel wds, and keep topping up every half hour until you feel better ? I could use a whole weeks script in one day ! ? ![:sus:](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/suspicious.gif)

That maybe a procedure for heavy Heroin addicts etc. Even if redosing after half an hour doesn't make sense at all because Buprenorphine takes way more time to act.

Do you think AH works better as a potentiator maybe? So for a user of 30mg Oxycodone a day or a few bags of heroin. Dosing some AH beforehand and then using less than what you would usually use? 


People have mentioned it having a strong rush IV'd , so I could imagine it going well with heroin or hydromorphone.

Around two weeks since I stopped cold on this. I'm still feeling it in the evenings, a bit chilly and aching but it's getting better all the time.I can now thoroughly endorse Knock's statement that w/d's from AH-7921 are BAAD.

All this talk of 1mg bupe. Is that a low dose? My mate takes 12mg a day and has to go get it each day so he doesn't chomp it all at once. 


IV of AH is pretty awesome, to whom above asked for clarification! My choice ROA every time for it.

i cut my taper from 75mg to 50 mg last night. Today is the first time ive experienced any kind of wds during this particular taper. 


I feel totally knackered and achey, and a believe its a sign of the minor beginning of wds. As i may get to switch to sub soon, im not sure if theres any point torturing myself, because I'll have to go into wd then anyway. I'll take my 75 early today, i mean as soon as my breakfast has digested in about 3 or 4 hours and then have another 75 later on tonight. 


I may decide to stick to 75 until i hear if the quacks are gonna give me subs or not. If not then I'll start making very gradual cuts. 75 down to 70 etc. On my previous failed taper the wds kicked in around 50 - 35 mg so its slightly worse this time, for some reason. 


The main question is if you are switching to subs is it worth going through days of wds beforehand ?

For Buprenorphine maintenance it is a relatively low dose but it still equals around ~30mg Morphine. 12mg/day on the other hand is a very high dose.


mdb: I would just stick to 75mg as well. Like I said at the same dose my transition to 1mg Subutex was very easy so why cutting further down if it gets uncomfortable? I'd save my energys for the final step.

cheers for the second opinion, im very glad it confirms my own. This agency is taking fuckin ages to make its decision. Hopefully it'll be yes to a subutex script. Initially i got a "NO GO" as i tested negative but about 6 weeks ago my GP advised me to try again, and they are re-assesing everything. There is some hope but im not banking on it.


I dont want to start a 'war' with you Mr Tate as you have been very helpful, supportive and friendly. But i don't really agree that banging on about the WD aspect of AH is derailing the thread. Anyone who uses AH too often might at some stage be looking for info like you, Knock and even myself possibly have provided about the many aspects of using AH.

No offense taken. Even if I have been registered for a longer time I only participate regularly since last year so I'm not that familiar with the off-topic definition here at BL.

So you are right. As long as the mods don't interfere^^


If you have enough AH left to stay at 75mg until the decision is made you have no problem. Just don't prolong the Bupe-taper.


Have a nice weekend. Summer is kicking in here and I guess we can use some natural endorphins.

Sampled this one again after some time...just 25mgs via sublingual admin. It was a different batch than the first two times which must be almost a year ago. It's still caustic stuff, but not as bad as the one i sampled before. And what should i say, except: damn! that was nice ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


But tbh, i shouldn't have this 'fluffy evening' because i actually was in the midst of a sucky opioid wd... I definitely tapered down to fast when kicking the opis a few days ago, so it didn't took long before i felt much worse than expected.


Since AH-7921 seems to have a somewhat long half-life (or afterglow, whatever), i'm trying to taper down with it, hoping to get out easier this time.


I'm having a question which is not really related to this compound, but i hope it's ok to ask it here? If i taper and consume during the WD's, does this 'reset' or just prolong the withdrawals?

yeah summers the best time to quit anything i reckon. Maybe not so much so in the UK where we havent had a proper sunny summer for about 7 years. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) Imagine how depressing and freezing cold it would be trying to quit in the middle of the winter. 


I should have enough to last until they decide.

I always found it prolonged the withdrawals, but. At the same time lessened the intensity of them slightly too. So you may have to deal with it a little longer but with less of an issue. Of course, this is my experience from H and not AH-7921, but I assume the same for withdrawal off any opiate really.

Hmm, a useful reminder. Those doses in themselves I would regard as low to medium; certainly for anyone with a tolerance. Just goes to show that the whole is more dangerous than the sum of the parts.


But I take issue with the NEVER COMBINE THESE DRUGS sentiment. There are plenty people who DO combine these drugs and have done for a long time, come and speak to them in EADD. If you tell them YOU WILL DIE they will say I HAVEN'T YET, they will be *right*, and they'll be disinclined to listen to anything else you have to say. The arguments about cannabis scare stories leading to distrust are just as applicable to other drugs. There is clearly a safe dosage range for such combos, as people have obviously found out for themselves, so it would be better to document and spread the facts.


In fact we have mydrugbuddy right here! And me, occasionally.

Right on cue: I think you need to know your limits with the individual drugs to start with. Ive taken 700mg of AH (i couldnt feel anything off 300mg so after an hour or so i took another 400mg), at the point when my tolerance was at its highest. I was absolutely fucked when all that finally hit me. I rarely go above 300 these days, as my tolerance has lowered due to general tapering all round. Ive taken Etizolam doses of 30 something mgs though not at the same time as a huge dose of AH ! Ive pushed things to the limit and have been lucky to remain living about 4 times. Ive taken AH or other opiates and Etiz and alcohol at the same time. But at lower doses of each. About a month ago i was taking 20mg of etiz a day and 150mg of ah. ive now tapered down to 100-75mg of ah and 11 etizolam every evening,


The important  thing is to start very low if you're going to combine these sort of substances. For example take half your usual dose of each to start with and see how you feel. You can gradually increase things. The main thing is not to jump in at the deep end. There's far too many people in The Shrine Sub-forum already..


Im not a good example, just telling it as it is, or as it has been for me. But I have a drugs problem - i cant get enough drugs ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) No, seriously I do have a drugs problem and am getting proffessional help. I believe that my doses are or have been near extremely high and not normal, so should not be regarded as the norm. Thats one of the problems with extremists like me, it can encourage others to think thats normal. Well thats what happened in my case, i was too easily led.


You're visits are becoming rarer Knock. You used to be on EADD or OD practically all day or night, every day or night......

Last night I was smoking some crack. After I run out I usually make sure I have a little bit of brown on hand, to nullify the horrid come-down. But as I had a few grams of AH lying around, I thought I would see how it faired up against a crack come-down.


I did notice that for the first half of an hour after I took the AH-7921 (100mg IV). I could feel the opiate buzz, but I also still felt horrid in the usual way one does after crack. After this half of an hour (I wasn't looking at a clock, it could have easily been more or less time). I began to fell absolutely amazing. Far better than if I had just taken the AH alone and well, obviously better than a crack come-down. This was the first time I obtained a fully fledged nod from AH-7921 and in all honesty, it is probably my best experience to date with AH-7921.


I will be partaking once again next weekend hopefully with more and better crack!


******EDIT: I just took my largest dose yet 450mg and am glad I didn't go any higher! I have been sick twice so far. :/ I feel awesome though...******

Keeping in mind that the therapeutic dose for Etizolam is in between 0.5 - 1.0mg, 5mg sounds like a rather high dose to me.

Just tell them you have a unique learning curve, where you make a slowish start, but then you'll make a massive leap forwards, and catch up even overtake everyone else. As a psychology undergrad i found out that i do have exactly that sort of learning curve, and that it's very unusual.

I came to this thread with a bunch of questions about ah7921 and after about 1 hour of reading this thread i have a whole lot more. Seems as this drug's said potential is to relieve pain or wd symptoms from other opiates but still many people are having a really hard time withdrawing from it. Also seems that for each ROA mentioned to be the most efficient there is someone that says the exact opposite. I have very brief opiate experience tramadol, codeine, morphine 10 & 20 mg (IM) and 5 & 10 mg oxy all on separate occasions and i liked them but never enough to go on binges like i do with dissociatives. I got a sample of this from a good source & i would like an opinion on a decent dosage & ROA ...i have no opiate tolerance & 20 mg of morphine IM were more than plenty when i tried that ... 100 mg oral ? at 10% bioav that would be 10 mg out of which at 80% potency it should be the equivalent of 8 mg morphine ? i would be ok with the equivalent of 8 - 10 mg morph. is my train of thought here correct ? please correct me if it does not work like that

also i have seen someone post about IMing this alongside MXE. Is IM a viable option as a ROA  ? would a combination of this + MXE (both low dosage) be dangerous ? since everyone is speaking of how caustic this compound is, would it not be painful to IM it ?

In your calculation, you forget that morphine only has a bioav of just over 30%, also I think you confuse potency with affinity. I understand the 80% potency as 8 mg morphine is equal to 10 mg of AH-7921. 


As for you ROA and dose, my first try (with real effect) was at 55 mg P.O. and this felt almost equal to the same dose morphine P.O.. So as an opiate naive person I would advise against going over 75 mg for a first try.

I'm also aware that I might stand alone in this opinion, but it really worked fine at that dose range for my and a friend of mine. If you choose to go for the P.O. ROA, for me and my friend it had a come-up of around 2-3h.


And keep us update about you experience..

^ I agree with Poelster. 100mg oral could be too much without tolerance so I'd go for 50-75mg.

It could be also relevant whether you got the freebase or the hcl which you can check by the CAS#.


I would definitely advise against injecting AH-7921 intramuscular.

And remember that this compound lacks some of the desired opioid effects and, as Poelster stated, takes a very long time to peak.

I'll be receiving a 100mg sample of the hcl form. I'm currently researching how to get the most out of this. Tolerance is not an issue so oral dosing should suffice. How would vaporizing the hcl work out? Searched through the thread and it appears there is little concrete info about that, or the search isn't working properly. Curious about this one, my last experiences with opioides was with methadone and od-t which I both enjoyed.

An empty stomach will hasten onset. I took 320mg last night and it hit me after an hour. Quite strong, made me drowsy and sent me to sleep along with 70mg diphenhydramine. I don't feel comfortable saying I have a large tolerance because I don't think I do but I must have some.

".......but still many people are having a really hard time withdrawing from it." Truth (emphatic cough). It's taken 4 weeks to get this crap out of my system, and at some points all I could think was "Oh God...how much longer?" The temptation to just have a "small dose" was there all the time. I think I'm finally clear now, so Never Again...untill the next time, eh?

For those who have got off it, and been through a hell of a month withdrawing from it, would you really pick it up again ? 


I'd like to say i wouldnt. 


Ive got just about enough AH to taper off, but im stuck on 75mg. Every time i try less  than that and im fucked. CRI please say yes to the subs this time, or im gonna have to be spending my bitcoins buying random doses of subutex and somehow devising my own taper. Very far from ideal indeed. Last resort is just fuckin cold turkey it, and jump off at 75mg. I feel shit on less so why not just feel very shit....


I cold turkeyed when i ran out of odt, 4 days of physical w/d and then paws hit (bleakest emptiest depression i can remember and i had to source more opiates. This is a problem indeed now. Im attending counselling and other support groups, and have learned a lot and become mentally stronger. Also had an important epiphany on MXE. I can only hope to be able to cope better with  PAWS if it hits again, after a month of physical WD. Fucks sake. What a mess.


Oh and i have a full box of decorative  poppy heads too. Dont know what the fuck i'll do with them. 


Just once, not possible.

after allergy test i measured out 50 mg and dumped it in a cup of hot tea that i drank about 1.5 hours ago. WOW this is very very nice im glad i didn't take more since 50 mg is plenty for me (i have 0 tolerance for opiates) i feel floaty and happy and music sounds blissful. I will definitely work on my album today since this is the perfect mood for me to compose some deep melodies. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


would this be ok to combine with a little methoxetamine ?


edit

 have another question, the ah made me kind o itchy. Would taking 10 mg loratadine to remove the histamine itch be dangerous ?

best to take a new generation non drowsy anti histamine rather than the older ones which slow down your CNS. If you have no tolerance.


I hated the itch at first but grew to love it. The itch you get off Codeine is not pleasant though.


Not sure about the mxe combo. Hopefully someone else will know about that.

I tried some of this a bit ago sublingually, and it destroyed in the inside of my mouth.  My tongue was all white, and I couldn't taste things correctly for a couple days.  It was like I burnt my mouth very badly.  The back of my bottom teeth have been quite sensitive for the past couple days as well... A bit concerning to me!  Anyway, I ordered some pH strips to see if it makes solution acidic, and the answer is no.  pH = 7 when mixing 5mg into .6ml of water.


It really didn't want to go into solution... Could I have the freebase version, and maybe that's a reason for the burning?  Thinking about trying add a bit of an acid to a solution to see if it will help it dissolve.  Maybe that's what causes the burning. Or maybe AH-7921 is just caustic...

I did the pH test some time ago with the same results, posted on here. Also I had no problem dissolving mine, so it's not a salt/base thing. It irritated my rectum but I've been eating it for a while with no (obvious, acute) issues, other than the miserable sweaty WDs.


Poppy pods are far superior if you can get them.

I received 1g AH-7921, supplier indicated it was the HCL salt, but it was labelled with the freebase cas 55154-30-8, I've sent an email querying this, if it's a labelling error or what.


I threw about 50mg into a spoon and could not dissolve it with 0.5ml of water, tried a few drops of lemon juice (and 0.4ml 40% vodka)... slightly better (about 5 drops juice) eventually i just threw it into a glass of water and drank it down.


I'm on methadone (80mg) so i don't expect any effect at this dose.


Anyone had similar results? I'm pissed I left my HCL acid at my old residence, otherwise I'd look at converting it to HCL (but I'm unsure if it's base or hlc salt as the vendor stated...)


EDIT: of course I did an allergy test with about 5-8mg placed on the tongue. Slight numbing of the tongue, and bitterness, but this stuff does not seem as caustic as others have stated here... not in my sample at least.


I have propylene glycol coming, and I might pick up some 99% ethanol tomorrow and check solubility in that. (Here in australia Methylated alcohol/Methylated spirits is actually 99% ethanol, according to the MSDS. I suspect because the aboriginals have a history of DRINKING it because it's cheap)

I might just save my 1g AH-7921 for a rainy day, being on the methadone program it does nothing for me.


I've got about 900-950mg left.


I also bought some 0.001g scales which will help with dosing (at least of etizolam, beats me dipping a knife in for a dose, lol )


I did try and smoke (from foil tsk tsk) about 30mg and it liquified nicely. I might make a 'meth pipe' and give it a go from there.


I might have to miss some methadone doses for me to feel the effects though1


EDIT: snorted/plugged/smoked the whole bag (1 gram) over 1 day - we'll see how we go. bear in mind i have 80mg methadone blocking opiates!


EDIT (days later): nothing.

Im not interested in its recreational value just its analgesic value. I am on 20mg norspan but nowhere near strong enougnh and they wont put me up. so I buy as many subutex and suboxone tabs and films as possible. cant get enough to store away. I break/cut it up for breakthrough pain and thats every day. use extra 4-6mg a day. I dont take any other opioids/opiates ofcourse due to both bupe and noloxone. the noloxone works jusy as well for me as subutex and its about 1/2 the price. got 15 more subutex 8mg coming I will be using up the suboxone starting with the strips first then tabs before I switch back to tabs.

The worst of the AH-7921 is not their utility for pain is that it produces dysphoria and hallucinations in a suspiciously similar to many agonists kappa.

See for example the resemblance of this molecule and Spiradoline

Ive had a few anxiety attacks from it. About once evry ten days of taking it. I thought maybe id got some cannabinoids mixed up into it, but judging from Aleph, it can just give bad effects occasionally. A simillar thing happens to me with speed, usually i feel on top of the world, but occasionally i can be plunged into the foulest of moods. Its all very mysterious.

Dunno what your guys problems are with this?


It's a damn functional opioid with zero side-effects when used properly. I've never taken it 10 days straight, just as i wouldn't take any other compound. When i take AH 7921, it always offers a decent long-lasting buzz without making me too distracted to do whatever's on that specific days schedule.


That said, after taking some beloved MXE yesterday, i took a buzz off of just 25mgs via sublingual route ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I dont know for you guys, but for me AH-7921 cause serious skin eruption and rash, mainly in the face and little in the back. I also get some invulontary movement while withdrawal. The withdrawal is real pain too, like potent opioids.


Another weird thing that happen with that chemical, is that when I take it before going to sleep. When I wake up, half of my hands are completly numb like if I would have sit on it for a while and no blood where able to go to the hands. What is really weird is that HALF of the hand is numb. I take Quetiapine (Seroquel) for sleep, meaby it is cause by the mix, I dont know, but I was scared the first few time it happened.

It can certainly produce a strongish histamine release, I took some two days ago and spent most of yesterday scratching away. And agree the wds can be unpleasant.

If your little and ring finger are numb but your other fingers are OK then it's probably a [compressed ulnar nerve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_nerve_entrapment). It's happened to me before. I mentioned this to my doctor and they told me that drunks used to get it all the time because of the wooden seats in drinking establishments, they would get drunk, pass out and sit/slouch in one position on these hard seats and get pinched nerves.


If it is this, then it's because you're falling asleep in a bad position, and not moving in your sleep.


edit: It's not an issue once or twice but a damaged ulnar nerve can leave you with serious problems.

knock, how long would you say a 200mg dose lasts for? 


Back of the napkin calculations based on LogD lead me to suggest, maybe 4-6 hours? Half an hour to an hour oral onset?


**NSFW**: 


LogD@pH 7.4 (Chemspider predicted fat solubility, larger=more fat soluble=longer duration)

Clonazepam = 2.5 (8hours+)

Methadone = 2.2 (roughly ~8-12 hours)

Levorphanol = 1.7 (~6-8 hours)

Pethidine = 1.6 (2-4 hours, metabolically labile ester)

AH = 1.5 

Oxycodone = 1.2 (~4 hours)

Morphine = 0 (~3 hours)


And, does this little doodle look right?


![wiqroqv.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fwiqroqv.png&hash=bf1041fcf0985208de518e6abc8725dd)


The claim of "80% potency of p.o. morphine" actually means that it's only ~27% as strong (orally) as an equivalent IV dose. So with oxycodone at "1.5x morphine" and 90% BA, worst case... it's **only 17% as potent as oral oxycodone**, by weight


At least on paper. I'd like to be corrected. Given a 5 kg rhesus monkey and the quoted dose of 14mg/kg for pain control, that's a reasonable dose of 70mg oral AH per monkey. (If one naively assumes that the same figure applies to a 60kg human, one would need a whopping 850mg of AH for pain control. Seems a little... much.)

If we assume monkeys and humans share similar responses to equal doses of opioids instead, doses between 50 and 250 mg then seem about right for a back-of-the-napkin calculation. (fudge factor of 0.7x to 3.5x)

A lot longer than that! I took 250mg at 11pm on Tuesday and was still feeling it on Wednesday evening. This stuff last for hours and hours. Stuff I have anyway. In me! Oral onset is about 45 minutes when consumed in water solution. I've been in the habit of dosing with a gelcap but that can take a couple of hours to get started ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif) Think the gelcaps I have stick in my gullet.


And yeah I would say that there is analgesia at 250mg. I don't (consciously) take it for pain control, but I have cervical spondylosis that can be painful and it doesn't bother me much on 250mg of AH.

That is interesting since I too had a lot more skin irritations, small pimples etc but no rashes. Mainly in the mouth sorrounding area.

I always wondered if it was due to the AH I took back in the days. 


Another reason for me to stay abstinent I guess^^


knock: I never had a big histamine reaction on doses between 50 and ~125mg sublingual.


€: So oral consumed AH-7921 has only a potency of ~0,17? Did I get that right?^^

the freebase is about 17% as potent by weight relative to a dose of oral oxycodone HCl. (27% to IV morphine).


any idea about differences in bioavailibility? my gut sense tells me this is well absorbed orally. the patent specifies both oral and parenteral (IV/IM) doses between 5 and 500 mg. 


i want to punch whoever wrote that.

Oh thanks sekio. I didn't read that properly.

So its potency is about 0,27 which explains the relatively high doses needed via oral ingestion. Interesting.


Now I'd really like to know the BA for the sublingual ROA 8)

I don't think the BA of sublingual is any higher than that of oral; TBH - just that the onset is faster. But this is just based on anecodtes from the internet, I haven't actually seen anyone compare them.

From my experience and comparison trials it is higher. But I only can estimate, maybe around 40%. And there is the undeterminable absorption factor of cause.

This stuff is generally weird. Not bad, but for me tolerance to the (limited) recreational effects occured pretty quick.

On the other side 75mg sublingual could hold me through 1 1/2 pretty pleasant days, so yeah ![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)


But it is an efficient painkiller and taper tool as well as a neat toy for those with little to no tolerance.

DickTate, does sublingual dosing not burn? I'd be very happy to use smaller doses as it would save money, but every ROA I've tried other than oral has caused extreme irritation. And when I've made a solution and drunk it, I've felt burning on my tongue.

I use this chemical insufflated, and it is very smooth, no burn at all and it gives me a much better effect then those of oral.

BUT,

The first batch a got from a vendor burned alot it was like snorting capsaicain.


I dont know why but between the batch from the first vendor and the one I get from the vendor I use now is very different in that matter. The first one burned really bad and that one is very smooth, no burn at all.

Yes, that's exactly what's happening. Unfortunately it seems there are not only a lot of vendors mislabeling the freebase as the HCl and vice versa, there seems to be quite a lot of confusion as to what exactly it means to be a "salt" or a "freebase". 


The freebase is an alkaline compound which is totally insoluble in water, hot or cold, unless an equimolar amount of acid is added. Since it's basically insoluble in water (less than 0.5mg/ml when in 1:1 ethanol/water) you won't measure the pH of the compound; it will appear at 7 all the time because there's very little dissolving in the water.


Freebase is soluble at a few mg/ml in solvents like DMSO, ethanol. Probably THF, dichloromethane, chloroform, dioxane, maybe even ether too. Practically insoluble in water, soluble in acidic water (turns into a salt). You will probably be able to force some amount of AH into solution with very vigorous heating and stirring but what I'm trying to get at here is: don't try to dissolve the freebase in water, if you get it dissolved it won't stay that way for long.


The HCl salt is a slightly acidic compound produced by neutralising the alkaline free base. As knock pointed out, should be almost instantly soluble in water, and should stay that way. The pH of a solution of this should be much more tolerable, too - but it will eventually corrode metals and stuff like any salt would. [Don't store it in a steel spoon overnight.](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/666567-AH-7921-solubility)


People reporting problems dissolving the compound in water and "this burns on insufflation", "this tastes corrosive", "can't get it to stay dissolved" etc... you probably have the freebase. For your own good stop putting it on your rather sensitive mucous membranes. (Not that the salts won't burn either - they will be a hell of a lot smoother) And also, don't inject it!!


See, for instance comparisons of amphetamine sulphate (a white, crystalline, water soluble, slightly acid powder) versus amphetamine freebase (a corrosive alkaline water-insoluble organic liquid that stinks like piss).


The usual methods exist for turning one compoud to the other. 


**Salt --> Freebase. **

Dissolve salt in water, add some sodium carbonate (as a solution, preferably) to raise the pH to about 10-11, and then filter off the freebase that's crashed out.

**

Freebase --> Salt.**

Dissolve the freebase in a solvent of choice (probably dichloromethane, chloroform.. somethin polar but aprotic - hexanes, etc won't work very well cuz ah freebase has shit solubility) and add a solution of e.g. citric acid also dissolved in a solvent, or gas with HCl, or add HCl in solution and recover the water layer with your HCl salt dissolved in it and evaporate to dryness.


You can also just boil the shit out of the freebase in a solution of e.g. vinegar, or 1% HCl. Eventually it will all dissolve, then just evaporate the water off.


Oh, the HCl to Freebase conversion rate for AH7921 is 0.90.

The salt is undoubtedly corrosive (I would be hard pressed to find an amine salt that isn't), but much less so than the freebase. Perceptually, the threshold for what is considered "corrosive"/"burning" varies between people though - so it's not a good metric for determining what you have.


The easy test here is: can you dissolve more than about 10mg in 1ml, with nothing but gentle shaking? Salt form. Otherwise, freebase.

When I wake up, half of my hands are completly numb like if I would have sit on it for a while and no blood where able to go to the hands. What is really weird is that HALF of the hand is numb. I take Quetiapine (Seroquel) for sleep, meaby it is cause by the mix, I dont know, but I was scared the first few time it happened.

This happened again and I get scare, can it really be a "compressed ultar nerve" if it ONLY happen to me when I take AH-7921 before sleep or in the evening ? Quetiapine (Seroquel) cause low blood pressure, if combine with AH-7921 could it worsten the low blood pressure and cause this ?


It is not cause be falling asleep in a bad position. 


This morning I woke up and I felt that it was serious, I felt like the blood was unable to circulate. Can I lose my arm ? I'm really scared now, I will have to stop using AH-7921 if this can cause serious illness like this.

^ Yeah, i know this. Sometimes it's whole hand/lower arm that's numb and i think it's because i've usually very low BP, and when i've taken an Opioid, it's much worse (as with alcohol or other downers in general). I then often sleep in, lying on my stomach with my hands above my head and i get this.


I think it's because of the furthermore lowered BP and the fact that in such a deep sleep, that you don't recognize the bad position you're in anymore, so you won't change it (as you would normally). 


Note to me: when intoxicated, sleep on your back/side, rather than your stomach!

I'm going to try not taking Quetiapine, since AH-7921 make me fall asleep pretty easy. If its only the mix that cause that it should not be a big problem to correct this issue. I will report tomorow.


The next day EDIT:  It happened but much less severe and disapeared almost instantly after moving my arm. So, I assume that it is cause by AH-7921 and worsten by Quetiapine.

From quoted reports from other forums in post #13:


> 20mg was than administered intranasally, burn was no worse than MXE but had a definitively noticeable lingering burn on the nostril and back of throat for around 6-8 minutes. Multiple things were used in an attempt to alleviate the burning sensation such as drinking water, water mixed with baking soda, and milk. None of which seemed to provide any long term relief, I would suggest against this a ROA for any trial. (20-/+5mg insufflated)

From what you've stated it sounds like the person described in post #13 probably had the freebase, which would explain why baking soda didn't help, but in another post in this thread you recommend only oral administration for this chemical (presumably independently of whether one's AH-7921 is a salt or not). Then there's Knock's experience ... Assuming one used something like baking soda or vinegar to dial the pH up or down to more or less neutral, and that it still caused pain upon IN, IM, or IR administration, what properties of a neutral AH-7921 solution would still be capable of causing the sensation of burning? A cursory search only comes up with VR1 binding like capsaicin, though that only creates the sensation of burning and doesn't cause tissue damage like a proper chemical burn. I doubt that's what's happening here, but then what?

So this AH-7921 acts like an opiate correct? I was confused about it.

Also, IV? Any rush? How does it feel when injected?


I'm on 30mg of Oxy a day roughly. What kinda dose do you think I should try? Like 50mg to start? First round will be insufflation.

Then I want to try to IV it. Should I use half of what I felt comfortable with above? Say I enjoyed snorting 50mg and got a good high. I should wait a bit then IV 25mg for the start.

Correct? I don't know anything about this substance yet but its on my hitlist for sure.

Due to the the corrosive nature of this substance I would strongly advise against IV. And if you are used to Oxy I think this won't be satisfying as it lacks some components of the classic opioid effects.


Scotsman: One gram is a lot. If you had problems in the past I'd recommend to buy less so the possibility of getting hooked again is lower.

Like 250mg. I have been abstinent for about one month but I know if I had access to a larger amount I would be in the fangs very quickly...

I've had this EXACT problem twice on AH-7921. The first time, I fell asleep with my 1 yr old in my arms in a rocking chair. When I woke up, my arm was pinned to the rocking chair and my hand was completely numb. I had total paralysis of my radial nerve, causing me to be unable to grip or flex my wrist (giving me "wrist drop"). It took 4-5 months to recover. I went for nerve conduction studies, and was told that it was a compression injury of the nerve.


The second time, I was sleeping funny on my shoulder. I fortunately woke up to pee, and realized that my 4th and 5th fingers were totally numb (ulnar nerve). It took about 2 weeks to heal, but could have been way worse if I hadn't woken up.


The first time was my right hand, the second time was my left hand. Both times, I fell asleep on AH and seroquel. It is totally due to compression injury, not neurotoxicity.

Yeah, I found a way to dont get the numb hand during the night, I put a pellow under both arm and it seems to lower compression, I have no idea why the AH-7921 cause this tho its total mystery. I still wake up at night many time because of other symptom, sometime its dry mouth, sometime dry eyes, sometime I have difficulty breathing because my nose is stuffy. (I snort AH)... Im still trying to tapper... but DAMN its so hard, I dont have enough discipline. I also have pain which I cure with AH so I always find reason to take some ... yeah ...

I know what you mean the first batch I got from the first vendor I tried felt like this but the AH-7921 I buy from the vendor Im buying now doesnt fells corrosive at all but it taste pretty bad tho

About the dose, ~15 to 35mg, 2 to 5 time a day.

I first thought the dissociative effect were meaby NMDA antagonist effect but its probably ĸappa agonist effect, ĸappa is reported to be dissociative and unpleasant and most of AH-7921 analogues are potent ĸappa agonist.

ex:   BRL-52537  ,  GR-89696  ,  ICI-199,441  ,  ICI-204,448   ,   LPK-26   ,   U-50488


And it could very well explain AH-7921 lacks of euphoria.

My dose hadn't changed, but I started getting anxiety attacks while on it. I also got munchies, and had bloodshot "stoned" feeling eyes for hours after the effects of the AH wore off. I did not experience any of these effects with my 3rd batch.

Well I've still not found *that* batch that I was looking for ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif) but I got another couple of grams last week and indulged extensively over the last few nights and there was no anxiety whatsoever, just full-on trippy/dreamy nodding that lasts well into the next day.

I just tried this for the first time today and I've got to say it definitely went above my expectations, but damn this stuff is more caustic than I was anticipating. I'd been reading about it for a while and figured it just burned a lot when snorted which with most chemicals I am fine with, I almost always snort my 2cs, and dpt. 4fa and 4-meo-pcp are the only ones that are to much for me snort 90% of the time, but AH-7921 probably just got added to that list. It burns bad in your nose, and sits there for a little while, clogs your nose up and all that but what it does to the back of your throat is even worse, I went through about 120-140mgs (lost count as I kept weighing out small doses ranging from 12 to 25mgs since it was my first time doing it and wanted to work my way up. But anyway so far the back of my throat feels like I swallowed a lit cigarette and I've hacked up 2 bloody flem balls, and it not blood dripping back from my nose, my nose feels fine now but Its definitely from the back of my throat its pretty sore.


But other than that I'm really surprised buy this chemical. I want expecting all that much but I actually caught some nods off this. My opiate/opioid tolerance is zero at the moment, all I've had this past month is 600mgs of tramadol and a sub, which when I get a strip I cut it into 4-5 pieces and it last me 3-4 days. But I was just wondering for people who have snorted it and tried sublingual, how do the doses for IN and sublingual match up? How much would you do sublingual to equal a 40mg dose done IN?

If you're getting internal bleeding... I don't know what to say! Don't do that, and sublingual is going to burn too. Snorting it put me in literal agony, eyes streaming. The worst pain I've ever had from any drug. 


But I've had no problems swallowing the stuff in a gelcap, and I've swallowed probably 10-15 grams of the stuff since I started using it. It takes a while to come on with food in your stomach, but I've found that drinking fluids after consumption seems to hasten the onset. I reckon it must "wash" the drug through the stomach quicker than if left to be digested along with food. You might start with 50mg oral. 250-300mg gets me nodding but I have a bit of a tolerance. Tolerance develops pretty quickly, I found, but also seems to reset pretty quickly too, which is a blessing.


You can also dissolve it in a drink and the onset is rapid, but it tastes absolutely foul and feels like you've just drunk some nasty industrial solvent. I eat kratom, drink poppy tea and have munched MDMA crystal in my time, but this stuff takes the biscuit. A particularly horrible biscuit. So if you do that be ready with something nice to drink as a chaser.

yes this stuff is very caustic, sublingual and insuflation and plugging are definately out. The only painless ways of taking it are either putting your dose in a gelcap or putting your dose inside 1 or 2 rizlas and then wrap the rizlas up very tight and neck it with a swig of water. Several times ive had the rizla stick or come undone at the back of the my throat and that fuckin burns so have plebty of water on standby so you can have a second attempt, the best way is to kind of chuck the rizla bomb into your mouth, then instatly take a swig of water, the next instant tilt your head back and gulp. You have to do all this very quickly if using the rizla bomb method or it gets stuck in the back of your throat and starts unravelling. Once the stuff is actually in your stomach there is no pain atall.


I dont know about drinking it in a glass of water like Knock mentioned, but I'd rather avoid particularly horrible biscuits that could also possibly burn your throat and mouth on its way down.


I dont know about IV or IM-ing this stuff. I dont IV. But I could imagine things going very wrong and causing a lot of pain, so i'd reccomend anyone thinking of trying that idea not to.

It looks like im the only one who can snort this stuff without any pain, I probably get sinus tolerance from snorting Tapentadol (The most painful chemical I ever snorted). My sinus tissus have probably ticken.


BTW I would like you know what you guys think about what I written a few post above :

I doubt because it structure is not related to any other standard opioids but I think bluelight doesnt allow drug test question for the simple reason that WE CANT REALLY KNOW.

50mg dissolved in 1ml water with average heat and average stirring, using a little citric, for IV. tasted bitter on the tongue but no more caustic than other chemicals and probably less bitter than ketamine, my regular DOC. went in fine though did notice a small amount of what seemed like muscle tension. this came from the uk's number one RC vendor, quality and purity 100% guaranteed. initial rush like a less strong pins and needles effect of morphine, short lasting, but definitely active. i am not a daily opiate user but have used opiatges frequently ranging from regular dhc and oxy usage to occasional heroin usage. vein looks fine at the moment.


EDIT: Pupils NOT pinned as you would expect with regular opiates.


copied from post i made in IV thread, as this seems more active and may be of more use to people.

I was unable to get a reply from another board. My ROA is oral. What dose would folks recommend for pain and then of course for recreation? I'm trying to stay away from Mexi Pharms and could use something that isn't MT-45, Tapentadol or Tramadol.


Right now I'm using Vicodin and Oxy and wish not to make this old habit return.


Thanks for your time

Yeah I vaped the HCL it didnt work well and tasted like crap... had a slight opiod rush but nothing compared to sliding an oxy 30.....


Basically as interesting as AH7921 sounds on paper, forget about it. It's honestly a desperate attempt at an opiate and there would be better ones but AH7921 is extremely easy to make apparently. also tells you something about the quality of the lab it may come from since it doesnt take much of a scientist to synthesize it...

damn was getting my hopes up.


Curious if it is worth vaping if you have no tolerance to opiates and if you can bare the taste. I think I want to avoid Nasal insufflation but want a fast onset.

It's certainly a two-dimensional opioid, not a three-dimensional one. But if you're sniffing it, and if all you're getting is nausea, then I have to say *you're doing it wrong*.

I think it would be bearable if mixed with some weed and smoked "qualude" style.


It would have a decent rush for people not tolerant, the first time I took it was okayish, it seems like if you get tolerance from anything at all (including the AH) the very small magic it has goes down drastically. 


It sounded so good on paper though, a semi strong opiod with dissociation?? but it just didnt live to the hype for me. and im one of those people who actually liked 2-meo ket (underhyped for sure), etaqualone, methylmethaqualone (basicly the ones oldschoolers hate on) even though many considered them to be flops

Not good, but not as harsh as others. Most chems dont hurt too bad on the lungs, but thats what scares me is its hard to tell what damages and what doesnt. Like I LOVE mxe vapour, but who knows...


Oh and about 2-meo-ket. It's best in small bumps over the course of the night. not in giant rails. also make god damn sure your tolerance is down, i noticed after a two week dissociative break it kicked my ass. but when I had tolerance to mxe a .7 oral bomb of 2-meo-ket just made me a little drunk and gave me brain zaps from hell the day after

It's basically a slightly stimulating K with no K-hole in sight. but its a decent semi-functional dissociative high. for sure. And it mixes well with Methylone.

it seems strange that with such a profile that AH-7921 wasn't commercialised. 


The lack of euphoria coupled with effective analgesia makes it seems like the sort of drug the medical establishment would be clamouring over.

This shit is weird (Ah-7921, I mean) for me. 


It doesn't do much of anything by itself due to my opiate tolerance, but it works great as a potentiator for other opiates. 


One thing, though. If I use it, even small amounts (50mg as a potentiator) for more than a couple of days in a row, I get pretty bad nausea, which lasts for a day. 


I threw up the other day for the first time in years, and this was before I had dosed anything. I had used AH-7921 for three days in a row alongside my usual dose of morphine. It worked great everytime. Then, on the fourth day, before dosing, I woke up feeling seedy. It got worse and I puked twice and felt gross all day. 


I didn't dose it again and was fine the next day and onwards. 


Anyone else have an experience like this? 


(dosing was oral, BTW - between 50 and 80mg per time at the same time as the morphine or H).

What do you mean dose it "properly"? Smoked it - horrible and nothing. Didn't try snorting due to feedback on here. Nor sublingual. 


I tried oral doses of the drug itself three times; 50mg, 80mg, 130mg. Got nothing noticeable. 


Combining it with other opiates gave a noticeable boost, though.


When I can get it (which is hardly ever), I can comfortably enjoy 140 -180mg of oxycodone (orally). Morphine via IV between 80-120mg is good. Even codeine still does something for me at 800-1,000mg doses. 


But I figure that if I go up to 130mg of AH7921 and the only stand out feature is nausea, then something isn't right. The batch is good. I am sure of its purity and quality. 


I think this drug just doesn't agree with me. Strange that it's so effective in small amounts as a combo, but even then once it accumulates, I end up feeling really ill.

Thnaks for your input halif, always interesting reading. 


I too am curious about poteniation, i was thinking mixing of using etiz to potentiate the ah. 


Would the etiz help add to the euphoria or just make me more relaxed/depressed

Not sure about that one, AFA. I know that AH potentiates codeine, morphine, and... well just about any opiate/opioid. But not sure how it would do with a benzo (or thienodiazepine if we want to get wanky and technical in the case of etiz). 


Like I was mentioning, I just find it weird that I can't use it for more than a couple of days in a row, even small doses, before getting sick. 


It's like it accumulates and irritates my system quite badly, which is a damn shame because I like the quality it has of potentiating things without 

'colouring' the effect of the primary substance. In my experience of mixing it with other opiates, it just seems to feel like you've taken a good 30 - 40% more of the original opiate you wanted in the first place. 


Ahhhh.... still waiting for a proper, decent opioid RC to get out and about. Something that isn't weird and atypical, or dangerously potent like the fent analogues (which were still the closest thing to a decent RC opioid IMO despite the stupid high prices), or good but overpriced - like o-desmethyltramadol. That was pretty good stuff, just not affordable for someone with a tolerance.

Exactly. I require **200mg** bare minimum to get any effects. I am in no way a hard-core opiate user, AH7921 is the only drug I've had proper withdrawals from, so if you have any opiate experience it is no surprise it didn't work for you. **You are underdosing**. You will not get effects from 130mg, if you're like me. It is not enough. Take more! The fact you're not getting anything from this drug is your own fault, you haven't eaten anything like the minimum recreational dose.


Some people seem to get by on 50mg doses, I don't understand that, they are weirdos, I think they're lying actually. If you are normal, like me, then follow my advice :D. 50mg never did anything for me, nor did 150mg, only 200mg+.


In the name of HR, everyone should start off low and build up as maybe me and Halif are the freaks, but don't stop at 130mg you idiots, keep going until it works, because it does.

OK, you've lost me here. I get severe nausea from this drug if I take over 100mg. Just AH itself. No other opioid makes me nauseous unless I take a huge dose. I don't know why, but there's something about AH that doesn't agree with me. It's not just a bad batch - it's happened with different batches from different sources. 


So... why would I keep upping the dose if it makes me violently ill? 


Why is it that on this board we are constantly giving advice based on OUR SUBJECTIVE experiences and assuming that because it's true for us, it will be true for everyone else? 


I may as well tell someone who gets sick from 60mg of oxy to take 180mg because that works for me.... 


I know it's not a tolerance thing, because AH isn't as strong as the opiates I use every day. There;s something about that drug in particular that causes a bad reaction in me.

You're right. It's not for me. It may be that I have a stomach issue which the AH is irritated by once it builds up, because I'm fine with small potentiating amounts for a couple of days.. .then it's pukahontas time. 


But who knows? I'll just stay away from it. 


I'll be curious to hear if anyone else experienced anything like that, though. So far I haven't heard anything like it.

I've played around with this chemical for the last week or two and have come to conclude that its virtually useless, at least recreationally for me. I have an opiate tolerance, however its not that enormous by any stretch of the imagination, but even its humble size has rendered this chemical not even worth experimenting with farther. Doses above 300 mg oral and 150 mg smoked have resulted in lackluster experiences. If this chemical could produce the type of high I was looking for, that which many other opiates provide me with sufficiently, I expect those results would have been achieved based on the corresponding peripheral side effects noted. This is just not the opiate for my receptors. Shame, because I had hopes for this one. Though I will say other opiates were definitely potentiated by it and it made the benzos I'm on daily feel more sedating. I quite enjoyed MT-45 and acetyl-fentantyl with opiate tolerances, and without an opiate tolerance I'd recommend kratom before this. Hope others find chemical more useful the I have.

danharper01@ dont put to much hope on the 99,2% pure HCl salt, I used AH-7921 and Etizolam both pure above 99% and for some reason I had to go to the hospital and they found Barbiturate in my urine and both drugs came from the same vendor which I really trusted because he is very underground, impossible to find without a plug... even with that now I know that RCs vendor put crap in their drugs. The % pure means nothing. And to be honest AH-7921 doesnt worth it, It a weak opioid that induce VERY STRONG withdrawal, probably because of its long half-life or anything else that is unknown because the drug have no studies on right now.

I'm sick of being on something that could prevent me of using opiates, even in case of injury, which is suboxone. It's like it removes me from the choice of doing them or not. Is this thing a prospect in case I want to cut suboxone usage or it would mean I'd need to take massive doses that would cost a lot of money (I get my suboxone for free). 


I'm crossing fingers!

Suboxone will likely remove any effect for any opioids im not sure about high dose though but I dont think its a really good idea mostly if you want to try AH-7921 which will bring a lot of side effect in high dose.

I'd stop the suboxone before doing any other opiate obviously.

finally felt something real nice the this one. i had iv'ed 2 30 mg oxycodone earlier and had just shot another 15 mg Right before I began my session with AH-7921, so my tolerance was a bit up there for the day at least. anyways 180 mg of ah7921 was plugged, just to add this was less then was also 3 hours after a shot oR 2 of mdma, so I was still pretty stimulated. I got the drug where needed to be, I won't lie the feeling of needing to evacuate the bowels but i held strong with this one, but i held strong within 20 minutes the high began  I also used 4 tagamet to see if that would increase the effect and and 2 hours into the experience when i was comfortable with the effects began administering 100 mg pRomethazine to good effect. been high the last 10 hours off it or so though its kind plateauing.

I'm guessing that 1g bag was not consumed in one day.


500mg (probably 400mg) would have me nodding for hours and fucked well into the next day. And I have tolerance, been using the stuff pretty regularly for months.


If Nicklazz snorted 1g in a day.... ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

WTF you did not snorted 1g in a day, either your stock was 10% pure or you bullshit more then a mythoman.


@@@ : DO NOT SNORT 1G of the SUBSTANCE, PLEASE DO NOT. 50mg snorted is enough to make you nod for a few hours. IM totally serious and this is a public safety post !!!


Anyone who read my post about AH-7921 KNOWS that im VERY experienced with this substance.

Aye I've had withdrawals from it too, not as bad as you though, no puking, just constant hot and cold sweats and feeling like shit.


I don't use daily though (any more, I had been when I got WDs). I have at least one day off between doses. Usually only one or two right enough, and very occasionally I'll have it two or three days in a row, but I'm pretty good at the "no two days running" rule. Last dose was four days ago, not had any WDs, maybe just a bit of an "intestinal clearout" ![:sus:](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/suspicious.gif)

Where does the "snorted in one day" come from? ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


I did snort it over days, a week maybe, just wanted to point out I did snort it all, and I can take the pain.

It's psycholgically addictive too. I weened myself down to 30mg; at that dose it probably wasnt doing anything physically. But i could not stop taking it. Im trying Bupe now and it seems that this is gonna be a more successfull route to get off the stuff.

I took ah and seRequel together and experienced no contradictions between the two, though serequel is an atypical anti psychotic so I'm not really sure the difference.

risperdal is also an atypical...expect extreme sedation(also brain sedation ha!)....personally I was given a big handful of 4mg pills of risperdal, but i'd use 1mg by breaking half of an half during freebase smoking comedowns...worked like a charm.

I do suffer from constant pain and I think that the figure of 70% morphine is about right but as for subjective euphoria, I found very little. I think it could be a valuable aid for people wishing to get off opioids because it means you can deal with the physical and the psychological issues separately. No high, but not sick. Once you get used to life without the mind-altering effects and the massive depression that some people get (and the thing that makes it so hard to keep clean). I know methadone is supposed to do this but I think methadone is much more addictive and some people find it makes them depressed.


Just my 2 cents.


I guess the fact that it's a British design is unusual. I cannot think of any totally synthetic opioids invented in the UK.

I thought there was no high but it's a learned high (just like many) and also you can nod from it and get all the visuals so there's no point pretending it can't be recreational, I'm afraid ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Saying that AH-7921 is not addictive would be false also it does get you high and getting off AH-7921 is probably harder than any typical opiate like morphine, oxycodone or hydromorphone. Half-life play a big role into that and AH-7921 last forever.


And like knock said it can make you nod for hours very easily.

Sounds like it's in Talwin territory, which I immensely enjoy (no kidding, must be the lack of Naloxone in ours). It's the opiate my suboxone clinic are considering hinting at because I have proven I can use opiates responsibly to them now and they are refering me to a pain clinic. I was pretty happy they chose it!

A 100mg bomb of AH-7921, combined with 1 5mg pellet of flubromazepam creates a a lovely, relaxed, long lasting high indeed :D Im not a huge fan of either on there own, but when mixed together are great.

Just thought I'd add my own thoughts:

- 90mg (oral) is a nice amount with low tolerance, makes for a strong lost lasting typical opioid high that's still lasting after 13-14 hours when you get to sleep, and leaves you feeling nice and warm the next day when you wake up.

- Nodding is pretty to achieve on such a dose when you lay down and relax. I think another 30-40mg on top of that dose and you'd be nodding whether you liked it or not.

- Very nice nods and very nice dreams when you go to sleep. Some of the best nods I had from any opiate.


I'm not surprised that a lot of people try 50mg and are disappointed and give up. I'm the kind of person who still loves 150mg Codeine etc, and 90mg+ AH was certainly the best dosage range for me. Someone with an existing tolerance may need a significantly larger amount.


To anyone considering trying this, I'd recommend first a 1mg allergy test, then something like 20mg just to ensure they aren't sensitive, and finally a day later jumping in at: 50-60mg if you have a low tolerance (i.e. 150mg Codeine), 80-100mg if you have somewhat of a medium tolerance (300-450mg Codeine), and say 140mg+ if you have a higher opiate tolerance (all oral doses).


QUARE - you mentioned getting off it being especially hard because of the half-life. The half-life if anything should make it easier to taper. Drugs that wear off very fast can be a pain because you can't really taper, and you'll notice you're getting sick and waking up in the middle of the night, and every few hours - with something long lasting you have a longer time span from each dose before the dose drops down, so you don't have to worry so much. Just make sure you time your doses in a taper right.

yeah i think alot of people haven't given this a proper chanse.

it's my favorite opiate(quite high right now off 150mg+ 10mg mxe and 2-3mg ur-144)

i need 200-250 codeine for a nice high and take morphine about once a week at 150mg a night divided in 30-50mg nasal doses. i much prefer ah-7921 to morphine - much much longer lasting less in your face euphoria but stronger in a way, much more social high. overall a great opiate for the ocasional user. 

For a daily IV heroine person im sure it will do nothing more than keep withdraws away.

ps. ( i can feel it from 50mg but its subtle 100 is already noticible and 150 quite strong and 200 is nodding for me. i do opiates max once a week if you take opiates seldomly start from below 50mg just to be sure)

AH 7921 Just tried this substance for the first time. In the past i've taken diazepams and lorazepams. Me and bro started by vapeing 20 mg ea. Didnt really feel too much so we went ahead and done 100 mg ea in capsules, felt as if this stuff is quite a slow burner we was also drinking some red wine. My friend came over and we popped into town it wasn't untill i got back that i felt the stuff. Around an hour and 30 mins. Not much europhoria what so ever although heavy eyes as if sleepy coming in waves. though this did not last long so we proceeded to do another 150mg capsules and smoked around another 50 ea. Smoking it gives you a nice buzz feel a little light on the feet. It was the same again for me but hit my bro it hit a little harder. He hasnt been feeling to well so i guess thats probably why. Still drinking red wine he ended up throwing up! i wasnt feeling sick at all untill he mentioned it though we had just got some vodka and mixed with some energy drink. Funnily enough i threw up at the same time. I wouldnt advise mixing with alcahol. Well at least not alot! it could be a recipe for disaster.  Interesting substance but i probably wouldnt buy again.

This substance seems undervalued produces euphoria but not as much as other opioids. For other effects like snooze or analgesia is similar to other opioids.

or take a smallish oral dose earlier to get some painrelief and not feel the plug? 

i was amazed how strong the burning sensation from 3meopcp in the nostril was when i took it by itself, i had been always taking it in combo or at the tail end of mxe and never felt it burn until then.


How long have you been taking it to get to 350mg dose? how much did you need in the beggining, do you feel your tolerance still raising or have you reached some sort of platoe(ive been reading you use 350mg for some time now)?

in the beginning I needed 200mg, but that was just to feel anything at all. 350mg is a fairly strong dose (though didn't make me nod last night, guess that was because I lost some when I went to the lavatory)


I don't take it often enough to increase my tolerance much, really. That was my first dose in a week. 


I don't find 3-MeO-PCP anything like as burny as AH. It does irritate the nose a bit, but I usually plug it now. Never feel anything when I plug it.


I was thinking last night how AH seems to be very much an "in the head" opioid for me. Not sure it would give much pain relief with oral pre-administration.

Dont worry about your rectum knock, I put so much stuff in my nose and I dont have sign of sinus cancer yet lol. Anyway after trying snorting Tapentadol HCl, I would highly suggest against plugging it ! lol


One thing I dont understand, you say you take 200mg to FEEL something ?... I snort 50mg and I nod for the rest of the evening and wake up with my  labtop on my knee and a bowl of chips crashed on the floor then tell my self, wtf why Im I still there in my game this is exactly where I started when I opened it.

I hope it's not burning a second hold in my arse. logic dictates it's not, I mean it's not burned a hole in my stomach or my veins or anywhere else so I can't imagine why it would cause long-term physical damage... maybe I should add some lidocaine to numb my bum :D

Hard to say really but I just thought I'd point out the flaw in that logic. Our stomach is designed to handle large amounts of stomach acid without being eroded away - take some of that same acid and apply it to the tissue in your nose, under your tongue, or in your rectum and the effect is quite a different one. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


I think it's pretty clear there's likely to be some damage over time with regular use of one of these ROAs, the question is just whether or not it'd be significant enough to warrant avoiding an ROA, or if switching ROAs every so often to allow for tissue recovery would be all that's necessary.


If you can live with a slower onset maybe highly diluting your dose and apply it in small amounts at a time would be beneficial and lessen any damage if not avoiding most/all of it? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

It's pretty much moot since I plugged again a few nights ago and the pain was really quite unbearable! Not doing it again ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


I've certainly not noticed any problems at all with long-term oral dosing, and I understand what you're saying about stomach acid and I've said as much myself (to persuade myself that it was OK to eat it :D). But once it's absorbed into the blood stream, surely it's no longer in an environment which is set up to cope with stomach acid? This is what I don't get. Surely if it burns the rectum, nose and mouth, then it should also irritate or damage blood vessels, the brain, the liver etc,

Im no biochemist, but I did study to be one for a little bit before running out of money and energy. From what I understand... it can be somewhat caustic to the inside of your body, but keep in mind that  Cocaine directly kills heart cells. And out of the hundreds of drugs available, most of them burn when snorted or plugged, and can cause uneasiness in the stomach when ingested. Under that logic, 80% of the drugs on the market can damage the inside of your body (vessels and such.) And I havent heard too many reports of people dying from burned up blood vessels. However I HAVE heard a fair amount of reports of people having heart failure from the direct damage cocaine does the to heart. (not the stimulating damage, the direct molecular damage from the chemical itself touching the heart walls.) 


Since there have been hundreds of studies done on coke, we know how it affects each different type of cell, from flesh, to heart cells, to stomach lining. However AH-7921 has not had a SINGLE physical study done on it. What that means it, for all we know AH7921 could be killing your brain cells in droves! And after you ingest another gram youll be officially brain dead. Or perhaps its EXTREMELY toxic to your liver and kidneys similar to alcohol and tylenol. Or perhaps its not very bad for anything except flesh (nose, rectum, exposed tissue.) We honest DO NOT KNOW! Thats why sites like bluelight exist, to gather harm reduction information as best we can. Always take caution, and if you start to notice something out of the ordinary (like people in this thread saying their skin broke out) I would quit immediately. 


Im sure ingesting LOADS of a very caustic chemical, for example something with the burn of 2c-e, but the potency of cocaine, would cause some problems internally, but also remember that these chemicals get highly diluted in the blood stream and affect each type of cell differently.


Like I said take this with a grain of salt, Im just making inferences from what I know. Id say you are safe, and by that, I mean treat it like any other drug. Every drug will have negative effects on you, whether it is physical or mental. Just be moderate, and if it burns REALLY bad then stick to oral dosing. Your stomach lining is stronger against caustic and acidic chemicals, but your nose and your rectum are not. Personally, Ive withered away a fair amount of my septum that i will never get back from snorting so many caustic drugs. Be warned.

My order of 3G's just arrived today. Started out with an allergy test of about 1mg an hour ago, no reaction. About 10 minutes ago, I used about 50mg (snorted about 5mg just to see what all the fuss was about, put a couple milligrams on my tongue, and wrapped the rest in a piece of tissue and swallowed it).


Didn't really start to burn until a few minutes ago, and I can definitely see what you guys mean when you say not to snort this stuff. I only put a few MGs up the nose (and very slowly too) and even that feels a bit annoying.


Will keep you all updated on the effects, if any. By the way, my tolerance isn't that high right now -- in the last week or so, I've been taking about 200mg of Tramadol a day.

Update... this stuff has been a bit of a letdown for me. After my first dose of 50mg yesterday at work, I didn't feel any real noticeable effects... anything might have been placebo. 


Later on in the night (about 10pm) I parachuted about 80mg after starting to feel minor withdrawals from not having any tramadol since 8am that morning (minor headache, some body aches). Also took a few Ibuprofen at this time as well. About an hour later I did notice a mild sense of calm and very light euphoria for a short time... my headache was also mostly gone. Don't remember much else, as I fell asleep not long afterwards. I do recall sleeping pretty well, which may have been helped by the AH.


In the morning though I did notice that the slight withdrawal feeling had returned (about 8am) and so took about 100mg of the AH. It wasn't until at work at about 10am when I started to notice the withdrawals fading away and a slight calm feeling. I then redosed about 50mg at about 11am to try to increase the feeling. Unfortunately it didn't seem to do much.


Overall, I have to say that while the AH does do a decent job at staving off withdrawals, it doesn't seem very recreational to me. Its effects seem to be very subtle and in the background. It's not a "get-you-high" drug, it's more of a "calm-you-down" drug. It's not completely useless like some are making it out to be... however, tramadol does a LOT more for me recreationally than the AH-7921. Your results will vary of course, that's just my experience.


I will continue to try out the AH as the tramadol continues to leave my system, so I can see what it's like without any withdrawals in the background.


Also I should mention that contrary to what I read in a previous post, this stuff DOES cause pupil constriction.

Have you read the thread? I have never been a user of strong opiates, just o-desmethyltramadol, poppy tea and AH7921. I need 200mg+ of AH7921. 150mg won't cut the mustard for a lot of people.

Could someone point me in the direction of some accurate information regarding the half-life of this substance.

I find lots of hearsay that it has a long, or very long half-life, but no actual scientific papers or the like.

Hello!

For how long period do you think you can use this without getting withdrawals?

I used Saturday, Sunday, Monday and then had a break until Thursday(I used again on Thursday)

I have never had withdrawals before; do you think I can use again  today (Friday), and be withdrawal-free if i take a week long break after this? Or will I experience some withdrawal during the weekend?

I understand everybody is different; different neuro/biochemistry etc, but just as an estimated guess?

Also, if withdrawal should occur; how long after last use will it set in with this substance?

Thanks a lot! ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

In my experience, I have avoided withdrawals by having a day or two off every day or two. That's taking it for months on end.


I got nasty withdrawals after a week or so of daily use.


The breaks are the important thing it seems, to me.


It probably also comes down to individual biology, but I reckon if you used again today and had a break you'd not have serious withdrawals.


It's a very long lasting drug, I reckon wds will come after 24 hours or so.


Remember this is a caustic, untested substance and we're guinea pigs.

There are no scientific studies on this drug at the moment. Though behing an experimented user of this substance I can tell you that if I dont take it for a while like 2 months exemple. The first day I try it I can snort like 100 mg in a time line of 4 hours during the evening without nodding. Then the day after I take 25mg and nod constantly.


I suggest that the half-life is probably longer than 12 hours.


It remind me of Phenobarbital, I take huge amount the first day and I dont feel much than take less the next day and im completely fucked up.

I have to add,


An error I did alot with this substance is not wating long enough before redosing resulting in lost of effectiveness of the product and in virtuous circle redosing again. This is probably something alot of people here do too i guess. You better take a lower amount and accept that its all what AH-7921 can do. Also increasing the dose increase the side effects.

Just got 1g of this... yesterday (it's Krimbo here now, so Merry Krimbo to you all ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)~![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) ) and, after quite a lot of research (even just that section on it's Wiki page about it being an included substance in Japanese I just ended up vapourising ~10mg or so...

I know - **Eyeballing is bad!!!** But I had a 50mg free sample of MDPV (as I ordered over £XX on my order of 1g of MDPV and 1g of 2-MeO-Ketamine [A.a.M.A.P.K.A***.Methylketamine )that I tested for allergic reaction and finished the 50mg - Scraping out the baggy aside - in doses that I approximated and was fine.


So yes - As someone said on an older version of this thread - There is a great deal of smoke / vapour produced when doing so though, as the legitimately used term in this case, SWIM from before, I wasn't that displeased with the taste: Don't get me wrong, it's not nice or owt, but not intolerable.

Anyhoo! I wasn't expecting much but I got a very slight, nice warm feeling, a tinsy bit of nausea and the all too known calm sensation. I'm just going to have a slightly higher dose now (Good thing about smoking / vaping is you can control your dose more easily as the effects hit very quickly) and let you know shortly how it effects me ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I don't know how big a tolerance taking 150mg Thrice Daily of Codeine and the odd smoke of decent gear (every fortnight or so) constitutes as, but I'll give it a try when everyone's fucked off from our Krimbo festivities ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Cheers **knock**!

It'll be at least what I've got. My tolerance comes from 5g kratom per day, plus ancient daily o-dt use, plus occasional poppy pod tea.


I never felt anything till I took 200mg.

It sounds like mine might be a bit lower tbh man.


Put a bit of a larger dose on the foil, taking short bursts of toots and waiting a bit inbetween. LOTS of vapour / smoke!

It's a strange Opioid... It's nice but lacking in some aspects ![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)

^ Knock makes a good point. Even when 150mg of Codeine would satisfy me I needed 90mg~ of AH-7921. If I was dosing opiates with any sort of regularity I'd use 115-130mg, and if I was dosing every day then > 150mg.


Has anyone here had two batches, one a shiny crystalline texture similar almost to fake snow or to how IAP looked - the other a fine flour like powder? 


If so did you notice any differences between the two? 


I know the crystalline one was the worst thing I ever snorted or tried to take sublingually, while the floury one.. still pretty bad but actually bearable via these ROAs.

have recently tried this substance again... no opiate tolerance at all, nor any experience 


doses were all oral, 50mg and another at 70mg a week apart. took a couple of hours to feel anything, and the effects were not that pleasant to demand a quick repeat. the best part of the whole experience was the comfyness of it all, provided i didnt move too much (got dizzy fast on it), and the sexual endurance it allows.


the problem i have is that i get weird flu like symptoms the next day, as well as stomach discomfort, though i have no current medical issues in that department.... am i alone? anything i can do to mitigate that?

I have access to this and gelcaps from the health store (since its apparently so caustic). What do people here think of the idea of using it as a way to get rid of suboxone? Sure suboxone kinda works, but I think to really get off opiates, or at least drastically reduce my tolerance, i'd need a weak full agonist like that. I have access to it for very cheap so...if I can get rid of the  monthly appointments at the ORT clinic I will do it. These days I take 6mg in average, my dosage is 10mg a day but I only take that once a week, when I take the dose I gotta take in front of my pharmacist. The pharmacists knows it's silly btw, since apparently a lot of other canadian provinces, not sure about QC yet, but any doctor can dispense suboxone now. So I have 2 choices really.


What does people here think of making 225mg gelcaps to take once a day after not taking suboxone after 48 hours ?e


Thanks as usual.

With that Buprenorphine-Dosage you wont feel anything from 225mg AH-7921.

And generally I think it is a bad idea to switch from Bupe to a full agonist if you really want to get of the opis.

Well of course i would wait before I am sick before going at it. If I only use orally I am fine, trust me. I only realized I had a life-disturbing problem is when I was shooting up Dilaudids all day. Before that I never had anything making me need prolonged rest or even spending more than 6 hours at the hospital in my life (those 6 hours some rare days were for when I needed antibiotics NOW for bronchitis/stuff for the flu, being under observation for 3 hours during a flu once I think.


Switzerland, Austria, the Czech Republic, France, and some others are alright for using oral MS-Contin (which junkies know they can't slam anyway and therapy is 30 days inpatient, with a lot budget than my own country I bet) first in high doses, I guess a 200mg red rectangle would do the trick, then a bit less etc., the continus formulation of the pill allowing for a much easier withdrawal than motherfucking compounds that have such a high affinity (which ultimately means modifying) for your mu receptors so much it tosses away naloxone and makes it so that if I get hurt in any way that would warrant some painkillers, I'd have to be put on fentanyl (a drug I never did and never wanted to touch ever) or high doses of Demerol where yeah you'll get unconscious but the ride to there is not pleasant at all unless some antihistamine is used at the same time, which a doc out of 3 will do.

The Daily Mail article states:

Tests showed he had 4.46mg per litre of blood in his system, almost five times more than the usual fatal dose of between 0.81 and 0.99mg.

**What a load of bollocks**. higherconciousness should have **died** with 5mg in his bloodstream, but instead he enjoyed himself 30 times that quantity. I have plugged 150mg and lived, let's assume I only got 50% bioavailability. Even then, I should be dead too, as only **5mg** a fatal blood concentration assuming I have 5 litres of blood.

For a person in pain not looking for euphoria this does the trick.   Waiting days for a dental appointment?  This is useful


80mg dissolved in 1 ml PEG + a pnich of calcium carbonate (pH~7) +1 ml h2o RA.   Its a god send and it helps when there is no opium, PST, PPT around.  Sure there is no euphoria but mix it with a little hydo or oxy for that.  I think this one is useful and a lot of the naysayers at first were to keep the popularity down,  obviously it isn't a party drug or one to become popular but it is useful.  I do wish more human studies had been down.


A guy I know accidentally had his scale set wrong and took over a quarter gram,  it turns almost dissociative like.  I mean falling huge bruises the next day not feeling a thing,  the pain killing properties are amazing.  But at these high doses be very careful one can turn into a complete em-basil,  doing embarrassing thing,  just stay in bed if you need that much pain killing.  There is also a tendency to black-out or forget what happened under a high dose.  I use the term high dose relatively as obviously a high dose to a 0.5g heroin user want do much vs a guy you pops an oxy now and then.

You are probably suffering from the effects of the drug rather than withdrawal symptoms. If you're eyeballing lines, let's say you're doing 150mg at a time, an average of 825mg a day? pretty much overdose territory, especially considering the very long half-life, you're just piling todays dose upon quite a bit of yesterday's dose.

So about 300mg a day? That's more reasonable, though at the high end if you don't have much tolerance. I was worried about you! Still a bit worried, and scared, about this picture ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Think more like 200-250mg a day. Have not got any symptons since, but have done AH since that. only got like 20mg back I think, so really not hoping im getting WDs when its out of the body.

ugh, I think this makes it obvious this compound should be put in gelcaps and taken that way, not snorted, not eaten outright like most rc's, it's what I've been saying since the beginning, if it's so caustic, buy empty gelcaps, they sell bags of 1000 at my local health store and I live in probably the last metro area of Canada, so this isn't big and rather isolated :/

Unless everyone's snorting USP-grade 99%+ pure Ah-7921 (they're not), it should be considered that impurities and contaminants might be responsible for any physical damage caused by any particular sample.

This must explain why everybody here says this chemical is painful to snort while my AH-7921 doesnt even burn a little. I must have the purest batch ?

I think there is also the possibility that some people have a salt while others have the free base.

I have to remove this because I gave some of my AH-7921 to a friend and I told him to snort it. It was so painful for him that he pass the next 30 minute in the bathroom pouring water in his nose.


It seems I have snorted so much drugs that my nose tissues must have thicken or something.

Do you know why amine salts sting? I have always wondered if this pain was indicative of tissue damage.

There's a new epidemic happening in my city, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where "fent-heads" prefer

fentanyl to heroin any time of the day, and pay up to 100$ for a 100mcg patch,-thats one dose for a non-naive user...


My plant has some personal experience with fentanyl, and it says that 

"whatever you mean by garbage, its at

best your own opinion. 

Fentanyl is a powerful first-line opioid with same recreational properties as morphine in terms of euphoria, rush,

Received 250mgs of this today.  Did an allergy test.


Then I dosed 25mg's via insufflation, I'll see how it goes.  


I don't have much of an opiate tolerance.


0:00 Dosed 25mgs via insufflation


0:05 Should have listened to the people that said it burns, because yea this burns.


0:15 After about 15 minutes of pretty agonizing burning in my nostril and in the back of my throat, it is beginning to subside.  Won't be snorting this stuff again.  I feel kind of light and floaty.


0:30 I feel good right now.  When I walk, I feel like I'm floating.  Honestly, from what I've read, this is better then I expected.  Previous opiate experience includes Poppy Seed Tea (usually around 1 pound per dose), codeine that had caffeine in it (caffeine always killed the buzz), and oxy.  I haven't done oxy in over a year now though, but I can say that this is probably comparable to 10-15mgs of it.  Again, keep in mind my memory of the oxy high is a bit fuzzy because I haven't touched it in so long.  I'd say that this AH is better then poppy seed tea thus far though imo.  I'm also slowly sipping a beer right now, going to go have a cig.


0:50 Still feel about the same right now.  I checked my pupils and they are pretty pinned.  Enjoying this, just finished up some work really quickly as well and was content in doing so.


Alright, so I'm back like 7 or so hours later.  I re-dosed another 25mgs via sublingual consumption at about the 1h30m mark, and then I took another 25mgs via sublingual consumption around the 5 hour mark.  Overall, I've had a pretty steady high, still feeling pretty nice right now.  Just chilling, no major euphoria or anything, but in general feel like the analgesic effects are pretty prominent and that the overall opiate effects are still felt pretty consistently.  Feel a nice combo of chilling yet still being focused.  I've seen people say that AH feels like a mix between a noddy opiate and a stimmy opiate like oxy, and I'd say that yea, that pretty much explains it.  A nice little novel chemical, pretty satisfied.

Every time I take this compound I get visual's reminiscent of a psychedelic. Not just only the CEV's  but wall's breathing and swirling persian carpet imagery, the whole nine . Kind of scared me at first because I wasn't expecting those effects out of an opiod. I just took 60mgs of it around 20 minutes ago after not partaking in any for about a week, I did have some poppy seed tea this morning about 1/lb of seeds and 150mgs of tramadol throughout the day. So I didn't really wanna dose too high on the stuff. I have a tolerance for opiates and easily do 5 stamped bags of heroin IV in separate shots throughout the day. But lately I've just mostly been mostly just maintaining on tramadol. I still do get some good effects from this compound though, all the stories of horrid side effects keep me from using it often.

I despise this substance. Very little euphoria/nice opiate glow to speak of, uncomfortably long duration, terrible comedown that leaves me throwing up every time.  This stuff is getting flushed down the toilet where it belongs.  I wouldn't take this shit even if it were free.

So we have established that it has a really long duration, good.  I've now read that 25-50mg is a good starting dose with no tolerance.


Now the next question, how does it compare to other opiates? Would you recommend this substance to others?


Is the long duration enjoyable or is it more of a hangover feeling?

If you read back through this thread you'll get very mixed opinions, which is natural of course. But since you asked how it compares to other opiates, and since I'm a bit of a connoisseur when it comes to opiates/opioids.... here's my opinion on AH7921: 


Basically, it doesn't compare to other opiates or opioids. That's my short and definitive answer. 


It feels quite unlike any opiate I've tried to the extent that had this not been labelled as an opioid, I would easily have believed it was something else entirely - possibly a novel dissociative. 


It should be noted that I have a fairly hefty tolerance to opiates, and my preference is for the "classics" derived from the opium poppy (so, heroin, morphine, codeine). But I have found something to like about nearly all the opioids I've tried (tramadol has a unique charm to it if you're tolerance is low enough, oxy is fantastic, DHC is OK), but this one is just different and IME lacks virtually all the qualities of what an opiate/opioid should have. 


I have tried it around a dozen times from three different batches which all produced similar effects and side-effects. Basically, the side-effects were the most noticeable aspect of the experience for me and included a headache and nausea to some degree every time I used it. 


The closest I got to getting use out of this one was taking a moderate dose as a potentiator to another opiate. However, more than two days use in a row and I would always get a strange and ominous stomach ache which is quite unlike anything I've experienced before. 


Conclusion: if you have lots of experience with different opiates/opioids and are hoping for something with a decent opiate feel to it, you may be sorely disappointed. Or extremely disappointed. But as I said at the start, everyone's different.

They already have buddy, and they ban them as soon as they come out. However, there are definitely a few legal full-agonists out there. Out of respect for the forum though, you'll have to do your own research. As I wish I could provide you with a couple legit vendors, with legal full opioid-agonist rc's. Most people are afraid of the analog laws though. Seems after some extensive research, I found that not one person, has been charged and convicted, under the analog act; not one person. (This only pertains to the U.S. though). My personal experience with AH-7921 was very, and I mean very similar to about 10-14grms of premium bali kratom, not even as much stimulation from 120mg of AH-7921, as 10-12grms of maeng da provides. The euphoria is absolutely comparable to kratom. It's present, just not that of fentanyl or dilaudid or oxycontin. Nonetheless, it is an opiate, with some definite opiate qualities; including a great feeling of relaxation, some euphoria and very little stimulation. If you're a kratom user than(imo) you will probably like this a lot. If you're a heroin, fentanyl and morphine user like myself, than this absolutely will have an effect( if your vendor's good) but it won't be satisfying to the experienced opiate user. -Thanks, DjChem

Probably not, or minor. But I'd certainly take a break. If have any loose stoles take 2-4mg of immodium (loperamide).

So I have given this substance a go several times now.


It was a while ago when I IV'd it.  I found it burnt to sniff, so I didn't really want to sniff it.  I did an initial allergy test and then tried 10 mgs which did nothing.


Long story short, I found 100 mgs IV to produce desired effects.  I did work my way up and go about this in the safest manner I could, but I really see no need to put down every dose I tried until I found a suitable one, but I was careful and highly recommend that if you must ingest these sort of compound to use great care.  Also its best to find a reputable dealer.


I should mention my AH7921 was in salt form and water soluble.  I am not sure if a bit of heat was required as 100 mgs is a large amount to put in 1cc of water, but it was done.


I was pleased with the effects as I was in pain at the time and the pain was relieved.  So I really see this substance as a painkiller.  I do not know if it is addictive and I really won't be able to figure that one out as I get an RX for pain medication and that is not something that is going to stop.  I am just trying to find a way to alleviate the breakthrough pain which is a bitch. 


I will say this though, please err on the side of caution as you only have one life.  A dose that barely gives one person a buzz could easily kill the next person.  


For example, I have a very high opiate tolerance, but my father cannot take an oxycodone 5mgs tablet without puking as it is too strong for him.  Me on the other hand, I was given the equivalent of over 300 mgs of morphine a day for a long time.  My reasons for switching to a different medication are irrelevant to this thread, but it was my choice.


It really doesn't have a rush, but is an excellent painkiller and last for a bit.  It also seems to fight off the sickness of opiate habituation a bit.


So I just tried smoking 20 mgs.  I felt a mild mood elevation and well the taste was not horrid.  I put it in a cigarette as I do not own a vaporizer.  I find that to be an ok method because I put tobacco back in and long before the flame hits the compound its already melting or whatever.


It does have a bit of an aftertaste, but its really nothing a stick of gum could not handle.  I wouldn't say it is gross just so much as a chemical taste of sorts.


I have tried the cigarette method with AF, BF, 2-fa, 2fma, and 4-fa so yes it works ok.  If you put too much in it tends to turn into a chunk so its best to spread it out a bit.  I might try it with a glass pipe.  I am just trying to find an effective ROA that does not involve needles.  There is no way I am going to plug, sniff, or put it in my mouth if it burns.


So my take on AH-7921 would be that it won't really get you high, but it will kill some pain and elevate your mood (IE a small sense of euphoria).  It's good for someone like me as I have chronic pain and am not really seeking to get high, but since I only get ER medication, I could really use something for breakthrough pain or when my medication is not cutting it.


I am going to try mixing AH-7921 with some AF and see how that works for pain relief.   I find AF a really good pain reliever with a heavy knod and no euphoria so I am hoping that mixing the two together will give it a bit of euphoria as well as make it last a bit longer.  


I find AF a good way to get well in the morning and I think AH-7921 might be a good idea for that as well.  I suppose I would compare it to tramadol but a bit stronger.  I personally do not pay very much for this compound, but I suppose like any drug its worth what you are willing to pay for.


After I try smoking this substance a few more times I will update.  It definitely needs to be spread out and I am thinking if I mix it with AF that may solve the problem and I will give it a go with the roll your own cigarettes.  I personally do not smoke anything off of tin foil as I do believe it causes some health problems and well since I already use drugs, I do not think I need to make things worse.


Now the doses I discussed would be way too much for some ppl and I highly suggest to do an allergy test.  Like the smallest amount you can do orally and work your way up.  I am no doctor, but after reading through half this thread I did not see anyone else who had smoked it so I thought I might as well give it a go since I have already IV'd it.


I will update more as I research this compound.  Once again mine was in the hcl salt form and not the freebase, so I am guessing there is a bit of a difference.  It is a powder.  I am not going to give up the vendor, but I will say they have a great reputation.  Also, I will not source to anyone under any circumstances so please do not even ask.


So please do not take this as medical advice as it is my own personal experiences. I am a bit hesitant about putting my doses up these days.  I really do not want anyone to think that just because it did not cause me any harm, that it won't cause them harm.  But the way I see it is if you are gonna do it anyways, you might as well hear first hand from someone who has already done it.  So please stay safe and really I decided to use this compound as a last resort, so if you do not need it maybe it is best that you not even mess with it.

I haven't dug through this entire AH 7921 thread so forgive me if I'm repeating common knowledge. One of the virtues of Bluelight is its focus on harm reduction, so I thought I'd suggest Vitamin E for people who have found themselves regularly using AH 7921. How I arrived at this is a blur, but in some thread somewhere somebody suggested AH 7921 was fat-soluble. At the time I read this I had been experiencing frequent nausea in the mornings after taking AH 7921 (usually ~100mg sublingual, 160lb male). I understand nausea is a common side effect. Knowing Vitamin E is fat soluble, I decided to take 400 micrograms with the AH 7921 and another 400 the morning after. Like everyone else I have no idea what I'm doing to my brain with this substance, but the Vitamin E seems to have cleared up the nausea. Or maybe my body has adjusted to the presence of AH 7921 and the vitamin E/reduction in nausea thing is just spurious. Anybody with better understandings of biochemistry have any input on the relationship between Vitamin E , AH 7921, and nausea?

Kind of scared me at first because I wasn't expecting those effects out of an opiod. I just took 60mgs of it around 20 minutes ago after not partaking in any for about a week, I did have some poppy seed tea this morning about 1/lb of seeds and 150mgs of tramadol throughout the day. So I didn't really wanna dose too high on the stuff. I have a tolerance for opiates and easily do 5 stamped bags of heroin IV in separate shots throughout the day. But lately I've just mostly been mostly just maintaining on tramadol. I still do get some good effects from this compound though, all the stories of horrid side effects keep me from using it often.

My experience with AH 7921's immediate effects has been more along the lines of a weak version of hydrocodone/oxycodone, but the WDs had dissociative hallucinogen properties. After about a week of daily use (~100-140mg/day) I ran out a couple of days before I had to do some extensive traveling. Around 30 hours after my last dose I woke up with some standard WD symptoms (i.e. sneezing, yawning, teary-eyed allergy kind of stuff) and what I can only call "dissociative hallucination vision." The first 12 hours of WDs felt like I had taken a very mild dose of something dissociative (i.e. DXM) and my vision was slightly distorted as if everything had a blue tint (much like a side effect of Viagra that I experience) and continually shifted position in my field of vision. It wasn't incapacitating -- just odd, slightly obnoxious, and very unpleasant. Other WD symptoms included mild nausea and general feeling of malaise, which affected me well into the following day. All WD symptoms were gone by around 70 hours after last dose. Though I experience AH 7921 much like a weaker opiate of the codone variety, some of its WD symptoms are unlike any of the standard things I have experienced from other opiates. It makes me wonder why some users report the dissociative effect as a main effect whereas with me it was or appeared to be a WD symptom.

To be honest, does it compare to opiate ? Absolutly not, I was taking it because its a sedative and I like behind sedate but AH-7921 doesnt come with euphoria, though it can produce the longest enjoyable nod.


Do I recommend it to others ? Absolutly not. From my experience, I always get severe gastritis when I withdraw after long term use. I lose a lot of weight and now they found at the hospital that I have liver laceration. My stomach hurt like hell all the time.


AH-7921 is going to kill you, its poison straight to your brain.


Also all of you should check out my thread before considering consuming the chemical. [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/689803-The-AH-7921-Side-effect-and-withdrawal-WARNING](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/689803-The-AH-7921-Side-effect-and-withdrawal-WARNING)

There is a wide range of views. My question would be [no prices]  is this stuff worth the price people are paying? I've seen several sites and they seem to price it like H!


In February, it showed up on the UK drug early-warning system so expect the ACMD to step in soon.

Hi, I am new here and I am new at this. I just bought 500mgs from a vendor. I should have probably read more before I bought. I have read through this thread pretty thoroughly, but I had a couple of questions:

1. How do I know if a vendor is reputable?

2. Are there instructions to test for allergies? 

3. What would a good oral dosage be? I am thinking about taking the whole batch t once.  I have had experience with opioids. I got off tramadol’s in June.

4. Any other info that could help with this experience?


Thank you!

Hello all, (I AM REPOSTING THIS HERE AS I THINK I POSTED IT IN WRONG PLACE)

Ok so heres how i got on with it. I Got some of this today after a long wait Thanks postie :/ My first impressions of it are if it is as its been listed at and its at least 98% pure that its about half the strength of morphine via the IM route maybe 60-65% at most. It also seems very acidicy so i wont be IM'ing anymore of it. I also have doubts thats its form is Hci because it does not seem very water soluble and became more water soluble after adding some pure vitimin c powder. I did 50mg as my first dose IM'd and it gave some noticeable opioid type effects but they was short lived around 2.5-3 hours long.


Also stirring it up with cold water reminded me of trying to prep MST Continus / MS Contin for injection. Its deffinatly poorly soluble in water like morphine unless the form is freebase and not Hydrochloride salt as stated so i will only be experimenting with this AH-7921 in oral routes or Plugging in the future with the rest of it. 


I think it would come in handy in hard times if i was Withdrawing etc but Ive come to the conclusion that it seems to give a spaced out feeling thats ok but nothing special and that while its better than codeine Intramuscula Injected AH-7921 is not in same league as oral pethidine or oral morphine. 


Im still intrested in trying U-47700 so i will keep my eyes out in bluelight for reports on this AH-7921 vs U-47700 and reading other peoples opinions on it but I can see why AH-7921 was shelved in the past and not studied any further due to the amount of other more promising synthetic opioids being researched and discovered at the time. 


Thats my opinion on AH-7921.


Peace and ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Only relation between ah and u 47700 (aside from chemically) is the withdrawal, but ah was still worse!

I never Ivd anything so cant comment on 1 vs the other but I can't see either being healthy!

U 47700 is rediculously recreational and the most fiendish thing I've ingested!

Ah was boring and about on par with codeine, though I enjoyed it wasn't anything I'd reccomend.

Tread cautiously

Vendors need to stop selling this compound.... since vendor discussion isn't allowed, I can't name the vendor selling something that is harming people. I read a heartbreaking thread posted this week on another site. An individual and his GF were experimenting with it... he passed out after his dose, when he came to, he saw his GF was unconscious as well, and when he tried to wake her up, she was cold to the touch. Paramedics could not revive her.


I don't have very many more details than that. The dangers of this compound is probably too high for the extremely low benefit it provides. Nobody knows if the compound received was what it was supposed to be a or did the vendor pass off a random chemical and labeled it as such.. Breaks my heart to read these incidents occurring ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Hello to all, long time no post...

Just wanted to keep you updated about what happened after my tapering off ah-7921 to end my codein extractions addiction due to my past heroin addictiction (p.08 of this thread). 


So I managed for 3 months to stay clean (and away from bad things for me as benzos, opiates, amphs, meth, PVs) during the time i lived in Canada BC. Letting me enjoying life with some very nice localy brewed I.P.A, wonderfull weed ( - carried by 2 gay quebec really sweet but wanna be bad ass bikers living on a floating house on a marine port full of high tech japanese tourists, easiest, funniest and best stash supplying conditions on earth in my life for me as for now ! - ).


Anyway ; After getting my ass kikked out of the country of the red leaf caus' no working visa even though i found some undertable work (dish washing, gardening, busking, seducing ;-) ....), 6 month visa over, back from where I come from, "douce france"... But I knew my demons where still waiting for me in the land of the toxic-fromage (cheese) and crashed again into Héroin (probably 1,5 gram of 5% to 10% diamorphine street brown to tan powder) after a romantic deception, and the very one that made me fly over the atlantic and the north canadian grand wild to not die from autodestruction with drugs, all of them...


Back to starting point again but looks like i've grow a bit clever, realising that my "romantic deception" of these 4 last years is nobody else than the girl of my dreams and the woman of my life, I'm now on a bruprenorphine program 8mg a day, and i can say i'm clean of heroin since 1 year and a half and i don't feel at all like noding, my daily worries are what am i gonna cook her tonight, if i shave too often will she remember that i used to be a too scary freak  to imagine a future with.


AH-7921 can be a tool for junkies like i am in some conditions, but i can't really see the recreational value to it, considering the risks if the person who takes it doesn't really know himself and his fiendish attitude to intense products. Seems like this thing overwhlms the opiate receptors meanwhile it just tikkles the hot cosy calm and creative sensations that we junks try to have all the time.


I'm no hippy saying to hug trees to feel better,

but since i understood love is not a house you win at the bingo one lucky night, 

it's more a lovely house you want to build day and night

with a person you trust, without feeling it as a labour.


Not saying i'm not thinking about and taking any drugs any more

Let's say one has to find other interets in life


hope this helps


sorry for sharing all the useless details

A shame that this has vanished from the RC-market. Not as unfortunate as O-Desmethyltramadol but now everything there is are the Fent-Analogues and this U-47700.

Isn't u-47700 derived from ah with better effects? Ah was not a very fun opiate at all and had some scary side effects I read, like hair falling out or serious skin problems.  


Also, 1 batch I had back in the day made my brain feel like it was overheating and on fire, very neurotoxic feeling, I flushed that stuff.


Rc opiates for the most part is some really uncharted territory, I advise just staying away, fent analogues are a death wish and u47700 hasn't proved to be safe with long term use.

My main countrymen distributors of merry toys asked for chemists to make them some of this again, it was the only reason they don't have it anymore, nobody is making it in bulk or they didn't like price offers they had.


They got MT-45, fwiw, I never tried it, I once asked if I could use a weak (both this and MT-45 are 80% strength of morphine orally) full agonist to get rid of suboxone (it's not like it's a flawed idea, they do it in more enlightened countries in Europe especially using oral MS-Contins, and if what you need is a dose in between 100 and 200mg, well they script you a 100 and a 30 and 15 (i dont think theres weaker ms-contin than 15mg). A shame for them they don't have Kadians, the only XR morphine stuff with a dose in between 100 and 200, and strangely the one I had the most back then (the 130's) but that will do and is better than using methadone or suboxone in all cases (they can start you with a 200mg MS-Contin, to those who had these red rectangles of peace of mind and body know that if you have them in large jar, it doesn't matter you can't shoot them (although I *heard* that all that needs to be done to destroy MS-Contins gelling is salt water, never could try though, but the people nuts enough to homebake H with all kinds of morphine pills use this apparently....because I'm not sure shooting saline rapidly (they give it to you by drops) is a good idea.

Hey pbuilder, I think you are confusing it. The skin and hair stuff were with this ominous MT-45.


The AH I had back then was pretty good as I remember it. The only thing were some dissociative properties at higher doses but I only took >100mg doses and had no problem with that.

In fact it had a very long duration. Oh, and it was pretty caustic, so snorting/plugging were no option.

I have tried this on three occasions, it is slightly less potent than morphine with a weird feel to it, maybe a kappa opioid agonist or a NMDA receptor antagonist to some degree?

I have tried this one (AD-7921) over a year ago. My dose was 200mg oral, this compound take about as long as Dextromethorphan to produce effects 1 1/2 hours. The high is weird compared to most opioids. It caused itching, pin-point pupils, but had some effects latent to Dextromethorphan or a Kappa opioid agonist like mild dissociation. It was not as euphoric as morphine or oxycodone, but did cause mild euphoria, the effects last about 10 hours in total. I tried it three times before this using smaller doses. It's not the best out there but I enjoyed it to some extent only the higher doses though. I liked it way better then Tramadol because of higher overall potency, I tried fentanyl and prefer AD-7921 over fentanyl because of more euphoria and lower cost. I think the potency is around 50% of morphine. This compound seems to have a higher oral bioavailability then morphine 20-40%, there's no way I would inject a unknown substance because of the risks of a sloppy synthesis or cut with other RC opioids.
