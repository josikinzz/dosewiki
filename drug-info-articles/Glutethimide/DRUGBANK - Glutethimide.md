# Glutethimide
*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB01437*

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenylpiperidines. These are compounds containing a phenylpiperidine skeleton, which consists of a piperidine bound to a phenyl group.

### Background

Glutethimide is a hypnotic and sedative. Its use has been largely superseded by other drugs.

### Indication

For the treatment of insomnia.

### Pharmacodynamics

Glutethimide, like the barbiturates, is a hypnotic sedative. It was introduced in 1954 as a safer alternative to barbiturates but was soon determined to be just as likely to cause addiction and withdrawal symptoms.

### Mechanism of Action

Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-1
Agonist
GABA(A) Receptor
Positive allosteric modulator

### Absorption

Variable

### Metabolism

Hepatic. Glutethimide is almost completely metabolized.

### Half-life

10-12 hours

### Toxicity

In adults, death has been reported after 5 g. The usual lethal dose is 10 to 20g, although survival after a dose of 28 g has been reported.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Glutethimide is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Acenocoumarol
The therapeutic efficacy of Acenocoumarol can be decreased when used in combination with Glutethimide.
Acetazolamide
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Acetazolamide is combined with Glutethimide.
Acetophenazine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Acetophenazine is combined with Glutethimide.
Agomelatine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Glutethimide is combined with Agomelatine.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol.
Take with or without food. The absorption is unaffected by food.

### Mechanism of action

Glutethimide seems to be a GABA agonist which helps induce sedation. It also induces CYP 2D6. When taken with codeine, it enables the body to convert higher amounts of codeine (higher than the average 5 - 10%) to morphine. This combination of effects enhances sedation.

### General Function

A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that catalyzes the side-chain hydroxylation and cleavage of cholesterol to pregnenolone, the precursor of most steroid hormones (PubMed:21636783). Catalyzes three sequential oxidation reactions of cholesterol, namely the hydroxylation at C22 followed with the hydroxylation at C20 to yield 20R,22R-hydroxycholesterol that is further cleaved between C20 and C22 to yield the C21-steroid pregnenolone and 4-methylpentanal (PubMed:21636783). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate and reducing the second into a water molecule. Two electrons are provided by NADPH via a two-protein mitochondrial transfer system comprising flavoprotein FDXR (adrenodoxin/ferredoxin reductase) and nonheme iron-sulfur protein FDX1 or FDX2 (adrenodoxin/ferredoxin) (PubMed:21636783)
