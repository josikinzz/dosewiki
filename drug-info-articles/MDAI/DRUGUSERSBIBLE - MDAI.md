## Subjective Experience

As MDAI was my first ever research chemical, it will forever hold a special place in
my heart. Purchased from a well known head shop, it came as 100mg of powder,
tucked away within a gelatine capsule.

These were naive and reckless days, and at the time I had little grasp of what to
expect, other than some sort of pleasant experience. Fortunately, in terms of relative
risk, MDAI is not particularly problematic, so I had chosen to dip my toe into fairly
benign waters.

I dosed small: perhaps half a capsule. It was mild and it was indeed pleasant, albeit
in a non-intrusive and generally weak way. I had, of course, barely reached threshold.
However, I gained confidence from the exercise: I had taken an RC, survived, and
actually enjoyed it, albeit superficially.

Life continued, but I still had another 100mg capsule burning a proverbial hole in my
drawer. I had binned the rest of the first capsule.

The day came upon which I finally decided to try the full monty. Down the hatch it
went, and I waited in some trepidation.

This was a significantly stronger experience. After an hour or so I felt a very nice
uplift, with yes, an empathogenic edge. I felt good.

Shortly thereafter, I recall walking to a takeaway for some food. Sitting across from
me, as I waited, was a woman: a stunning woman, possibly the most beautiful
woman I had ever seen. I was well aware that this must be a bi-product of the MDAI,
as I tried not to stare.

This took me by surprise. Can drugs really do this? Indeed they can, and I liked the
feeling.

Over the following months I bought and consumed a couple more capsules, but then,
suddenly, the head shop had no more: apparently there was a problem with
manufacture in India. Instead, I was offered a branded product called Sparkle-E,
which included MDAI, and was claimed by the vendor to be a good substitute.

The other ingredient was in fact Methiopropamine (MPA), which consequently
became my first research chemical stimulant.

As the MDAI shortage took hold, Sparkle-E soon became MPA + 5-MEO-DALT; as
was the world of branded legal highs. This, of course, is another story.

Downstream, circa 2015, MDAI re-emerged via a new lab, allegedly in China. As is
frequently the way with such chemicals, in terms of effect it never again seemed to
reach the wonderful high of those first few experiments. Somehow, whether
perceptually or in reality, the body appears to adjust and move on, beyond what one
could attribute to tolerance.

The magic dissipated, but the memory remained.
