## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 1,4-benzodiazepines. These are organic compounds containing a benzene ring fused to a 1,4-azepine.

### Background

Lorazepam is a short-acting and rapidly cleared benzodiazepine used commonly as a sedative and anxiolytic.
6
It was developed by DJ Richards, presented and marketed initially by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals in the USA in 1977. The first historic FDA label approval is reported in 1985 by the company Mutual Pharm.
15

### Indication

Lorazepam is FDA-approved for the short-term relief of anxiety symptoms related to anxiety disorders and anxiety associated with depressive symptoms such as anxiety-associated insomnia. It is as well used as an anesthesia premedication in adults to relieve anxiety or to produce sedation/amnesia and for the treatment of status epilepticus.
12
Some off-label indications of lorazepam include rapid tranquilization of an agitated patient, alcohol withdrawal delirium, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, muscle spasms, insomnia, panic disorder, delirium, chemotherapy-associated anticipatory nausea and vomiting, and psychogenic catatonia.
12

### Pharmacodynamics

The effect of lorazepam in GABA-A receptors produces an increase in the frequency of opening of the chloride ion channel. However, for its effect to generate, the neurotransmitter is required.
8
The anticonvulsant properties of lorazepam are thought to be related to the binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels in which the sustained repetitive firing gets limited by the slow recovery of sodium channels due to the benzodiazepine effect.
9
The effect of lorazepam seems to be very compartmental which was observed with a different generation of sleepiness and a dizziness effect.
10

### Mechanism of Action

GABA(A) Receptor
Positive allosteric modulator
GABA(A) Receptor Benzodiazepine Binding Site
Ligand

### Absorption

Readily absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of 90% when given orally. When intramuscularly administered a dose of 4 mg, lorazepam is completely and rapidly absorbed and achieves a maximal serum concentration of 48 ng/ml in 15-30 minutes. When administered orally, the time to attained maximum concentration is observed to be of 2 hours.
12

### Metabolism

Lorazepam is hepatically metabolized by CYP450 isoenzymes and extensively conjugated to the 3-0-phenolic glucuronide.
12
This is an inactive metabolite and is eliminated mainly by the kidneys.

### Half-life

When administered parentally, the registered half-life of lorazepam is of 14 hours.
12
Following the administration of 1 mg of lorazepam in healthy adult male volunteers and using a multi-doses equation based on a one-compartment model, the average elimination half-life of lorazepam was estimated to be 11 hours and 8 hours for sublingual and oral doses respectively.
11
The absorption half-life was calculated to be 55 minutes for oral doses and 15 minutes for sublingual doses.
11

### Toxicity

The LD50 observed by oral administration in a mouse is of 1850 mg/kg.
16
When an overdose administration is registered, signs of CNS and respiratory depression are rapidly observed. An overdose stage can result in profound sedation, deep respiratory depression, coma, and death.
12
When overdose is observed, it is recommended to administer emergency symptomatic medical support with attention to produce an increase in lorazepam elimination.
13
There is no evidence of carcinogenicity nor mutagenicity. At doses higher than 40 mg/kg there is evidence of fetal resorption and increase in fetal loss.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Lorazepam is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Abacavir
Lorazepam may decrease the excretion rate of Abacavir which could result in a higher serum level.
Aceclofenac
Aceclofenac may decrease the excretion rate of Lorazepam which could result in a higher serum level.
Acemetacin
Acemetacin may decrease the excretion rate of Lorazepam which could result in a higher serum level.
Acetaminophen
Lorazepam may decrease the excretion rate of Acetaminophen which could result in a higher serum level.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol.
Limit caffeine intake.
Take with food.

### Associated Therapies

Anesthetic premedication therapy

### Mechanism of action

Lorazepam allosterically binds on the benzodiazepine receptors in the post-synaptic GABA-A ligand-gated chloride channel in different sites of the central nervous system (CNS). This binding will result in an increase on the GABA inhibitory effects which is translated as an increase in the flow of chloride ions into the cell causing hyperpolarization and stabilization of the cellular plasma membrane.
12
According to the binding site of lorazepam, we can observe different activities as the binding in the amygdala is known to help mainly in anxiety disorders while the binding in the cerebral cortex helps in seizure disorders.

### Volume of distribution

The reported volume of distribution of lorazepam is 1.3 L/kg.
13
It is important to mention that due to the lipophilicity of lorazepam, it does not redistribute as fast in the brain.
14

### Protein binding

Reports indicate that 85% of lorazepam administered dose is protein bound.
13

### Route of elimination

When a single 2 mg oral dose is given to healthy subjects, 88% of the administered dose is recovered in urine and 7% was recovered in feces. From the excreted dose in urine, the major form is the glucuronide version that represents 74% while only 0.3% of the dose is recovered as unchanged lorazepam.
13

### Clearance

In vivo
studies with lorazepam have shown a clearance rate of 5.8 ml.min/kg.

### Curator comments

Benzodiazepines modulate GABA(A) function by binding at the interface between alpha (α) and gamma (γ) subunits. Of the 6 α-subunits, only 4 (α-1, -2, -3, and -5) participate in the formation of this binding site. The above target is a collection of all α- and γ-subunits that are known to participate in the formation of the benzodiazepine binding site.

### General Function

UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) that catalyzes phase II biotransformation reactions in which lipophilic substrates are conjugated with glucuronic acid to increase the metabolite's water solubility, thereby facilitating excretion into either the urine or bile (PubMed:16595710, PubMed:18719240, PubMed:23288867, PubMed:7835232, PubMed:9295060). Essential for the elimination and detoxification of drugs, xenobiotics and endogenous compounds (PubMed:7835232). Catalyzes the glucuronidation of endogenous steroid hormones such as androgens (testosterone, androsterone) and estrogens (estradiol, epiestradiol, estriol, catechol estrogens) (PubMed:16595710, PubMed:18719240, PubMed:23288867, PubMed:7835232, PubMed:9295060). Displays glucuronidation activity toward several classes of xenobiotic substrates, including phenolic compounds (eugenol, 4-nitrophenol, 4-hydroxybiphenyl) and phenylpropanoids (naringenin, coumarins) (PubMed:7835232). Catalyzes the glucuronidation of monoterpenoid alcohols such as borneol, menthol and isomenthol, a class of natural compounds used in essential oils (By similarity)
