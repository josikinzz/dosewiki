## Subjective Experience

Welcome to the world of nootropic stacks. A stack is a combination of two or more
supplements that have a synergistic effect on cognitive functionality and/or
motivation. Stacking is a widely practised approach to nootropic medication.

This particular combination was highly cited at the time of testing, but was generally
used as part of a daily or regular regime, which is outside the parameters I set for my
personal safety. As a single dose experience, it was hard to distinguish its effects. In
other words, it invoked a mild stimulation, with a possible clarity that could easily
have been a placebo effect.

## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: 350 mg
- Light: 500 - 1200 mg
- Common: 1200 - 1800 mg
- Strong: 1800 - 2400 mg
- Heavy: 2400 mg +

**Duration:**
- Total: 3 - 5 hours
- Onset: 45 - 90 minutes

**Aniracetam** ( **Draganon** , **Sarpul** , **Ampamet** , **Memodrin** , **Referan** , and systematically as **N-anisoyl-2-pyrrolidinone** ) is a [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) agent belonging to the [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) family of drugs. Although it is one of the first known and synthesized derivatives of [piracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piracetam) , its research and efficacy in humans is limited.

Aniracetam is readily available and sold through online vendors as a dietary supplement in the United States. Dosages are nearly fifteen times those of [noopept](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noopept) , making it less potent while offering comparable benefit.

Supplementation of aniracetam tends to be in the dosage range of 800-2500mg taken over the course of a day, either in two to three evenly spread dosing periods, such as three doses of 400mg or 800mg.

Aniracetam has protected against [scopolamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Datura) -induced amnesia both in rat populations and in human populations, suggesting it can aid recovery from [deliriant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriant) intoxication and other typically cognitively impaired states by preserving adequate levels of acetylcholine as a primary mechanism.

## Chemistry

Aniracetam is a pyrrolidinone compound of the [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) family, and has an additional anisoyl ring with a methoxy group at the lone para position. (replacing the amine group of [piracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piracetam) ) with an O-methoxy group on the furthest binding point. Its structure is dissimilar to that of [oxiracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Oxiracetam) (which is quite similar to piracetam) and [pramiracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pramiracetam) (a fairly unique structure) Aniracetam is related structurally to [nefiracetam](/w/index.php?title=Nefiracetam&action=edit&redlink=1) .

## Pharmacology

Aniracetam is thought to increase [acetylcholine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acetylcholine) release within hippocampal cells. As acetycholine is involved in the function of memory, this could potentially account for its [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) effects.

In addition, aniracetam has been shown to modulate AMPA receptors, GABAergic neurotransmission, and dopaminergic neurotransmission.

## Subjective effects

In comparison to the effects of other nootropics such as [noopept](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noopept) , this compound can be described as focusing primarily on physical stimulation over that of cognitive stimulation. ***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** ### Sensory effects
 
- Although these effects are not universal, certain people may experience sensory enhancements under the influence of this compound. 
- **[Acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Olfactory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Olfactory_enhancement)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The effects of aniracetam are anecdotally reported to foster creativity and holistic thinking as well as reducing anxiety and depression. 
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
- **[Mindfulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)**

### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: Aniracetam](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Aniracetam.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

Several studies suggest that this substance is safe even when high doses are consumed for a long period of time. although it is worth noting that the exact toxic dosage is unknown. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried aniracetam within the community suggest that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly. However, nothing can be completely guaranteed.

Despite its presumed safety, it is still strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Lethal dosage

The median lethal dosage ( [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) ) of aniracetam has not been officially published as it has low abuse potential, but is not known to be harmful in its recommended dosage.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

The chronic use of aniracetam can be considered as non-addictive with a low potential for abuse. It does not seem to be capable of causing psychological dependence among users, although this fact has not been confirmed or supported by clinical studies. Tolerance to many of the effects of aniracetam develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Aniracetam may presents cross-tolerance with all [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) [nootropics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) , meaning that after the consumption of aniracetam certain [nootropics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropics) such as [coluracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Coluracetam) and [piracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piracetam) may have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .* Aniracetam showed nonselective MAOI activity in a rat study. Aniracetam and [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs) are a potentially dangerous combination. It is likely that MAOIs could increase the effects of aniracetam unpredictably. Taking this chemical while on prescription MAOIs is strongly discouraged.

- **[MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs)** - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , and some [antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressants) .

## Legal status

As a member of the [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) family, aniracetam is currently legally available to buy and sell in most countries. However, this may vary by region.

- **United Kingdom:** Aniracetam is illegal to produce, supply, or import under the Psychoactive Substance Act, which came into effect on May 26th, 2016.

Aniracetam (brand names Draganon, Sarpul, Ampamet, Memodrin, Referan), also known as N-anisoyl-2-pyrrolidinone, is a racetam which is sold in Europe as a prescription drug. It is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States as a prescription medication or dietary supplement. Despite the FDA's lack of approval, the drug is readily available over-the-counter in misbranded dietary supplements.

## Medical uses

Aniracetam has been used to treat dementia following stroke and in Alzheimer's disease. Results from human clinical trials were published in 1991 (one multi-center placebo-controlled study and a follow-up) and in 2011 (one open-label study).
It has undergone a larger number of experiments in rodents; in a 1982 experiment on rats and mice it was found to have a variety of psychoactive effects, improving learning and memory that was otherwise impaired experimentally. It has been identified as a nootropic drug due to these memory effects. A 2001 study reported that in mice it has modest effects similar to an anxiolytic.

## Pharmacology

Aniracetam has been shown to positively modulate the AMPA receptor.
When ingested orally aniracetam is quickly broken down via first pass hepatic metabolism.  The primary metabolites of aniracetam are N-anisoyl-GABA, (70–80%), 2-Pyrrolidinone and p-anisic acid (20–30%). There is some preliminary research suggesting that N-anisoyl-GABA and to a lesser degree p-ansic acid may contribute to the stimulatory effects of aniracetam in rats. Further work in rats suggests that N-anisoyl-GABA may contribute more to increasing acetylcholine release than aniracetam itself. For instance, a study  using the forced swim test in rats found that the two metabolites 2-pyrrolidinone and N-anisoyl-GABA alone yielded similar anti-depressant effects as aniracetam itself. The authors of the aforementioned study hypothesized that the metabolites work by increasing levels of dopamine and by stimulating the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.
Plasma concentrations are generally in the 5–15 μg/L range for aniracetam and 5–15 mg/L range for N-anisoyl-GABA, a pharmacologically active metabolite, during the first few hours after oral administration of the drug. These two plasma species may be measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

## Synthesis

The drug was first made in the 1970s by Hoffmann-La Roche. Synthesis can be accomplished by reacting 2-pyrrolidone with anisoyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine.

Alternatively, gamma-aminobutyric acid can react with anisoyl chloride. Ring closure can be accomplished in the presence of thionyl chloride.

## Legality

### Europe

Aniracetam is available by prescription in Greece (brand names Memodrin and Referan) and Italy (brand name Ampamet), where it is indicated for mental function disorders.

### Australia

Aniracetam is a schedule 4 substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (February 2020). A schedule 4 substance is classified as "Prescription Only Medicine, or Prescription Animal Remedy – Substances, the use or supply of which should be by or on the order of persons permitted by state or territory legislation to prescribe and should be available from a pharmacist on prescription."
