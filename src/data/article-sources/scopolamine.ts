## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as beta hydroxy acids and derivatives. These are compounds containing a carboxylic acid substituted with a hydroxyl group on the C3 carbon atom.

### Background

Scopolamine is a tropane alkaloid isolated from members of the
Solanaceae
family of plants, similar to
atropine
and
hyoscyamine
, all of which structurally mimic the natural neurotransmitter
acetylcholine
.
4
,
6
Scopolamine was first synthesized in 1959, but to date, synthesis remains less efficient than extracting scopolamine from plants.
6
As an acetylcholine analogue, scopolamine can antagonize muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) in the central nervous system and throughout the body, inducing several therapeutic and adverse effects related to alteration of parasympathetic nervous system and cholinergic signalling.
5
,
9
Due to its dose-dependent adverse effects, scopolamine was the first drug to be offered commercially as a transdermal delivery system, Scopoderm TTS®, in 1981.
4
,
5
As a result of its anticholinergic effects, scopolamine is being investigated for diverse therapeutic applications; currently, it is approved for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness and surgical procedures.
7
,
9
Scopolamine was first approved by the FDA on December 31, 1979, and is currently available as both oral tablets and a transdermal delivery system.
9

### Indication

Scopolamine is indicated in adult patients for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness and for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) associated with anesthesia or opiate analgesia.
9

### Pharmacodynamics

Scopolamine is an anticholinergic belladonna alkaloid that, through competitive inhibition of muscarinic receptors, affects parasympathetic nervous system function and acts on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. Formulated as a patch, scopolamine is released continuously over three days and remains detectable in urine over a period of 108 hours. Scopolamine is contraindicated in angle-closure glaucoma and should be used with caution in patients with open-angle glaucoma due to scopolamine's ability to increase intraocular pressure. Also, scopolamine exhibits several neuropsychiatric effects: exacerbated psychosis, seizures, seizure-like, and other psychiatric reactions, and cognitive impairment; scopolamine may impair the ability of patients to operate machinery or motor vehicles, play underwater sports, or perform any other potentially hazardous activity. Women with severe preeclampsia should avoid scopolamine. Patients with gastrointestinal or urinary disorders should be monitored frequently for impairments, and scopolamine should be discontinued if these develop. Scopolamine can cause blurred vision if applied directly to the eye, and the transdermal patch should be removed before an MRI procedure to avoid skin burns. Due to its gastrointestinal effects, scopolamine can interfere with gastric secretion testing and should be discontinued at least 10 days before performing the test. Finally, scopolamine may induce dependence and resulting withdrawal symptoms, such as nausea, dizziness, vomiting, gastrointestinal disturbances, sweating, headaches, bradycardia, hypotension, and various neuropsychiatric manifestations following treatment discontinuation; severe symptoms may require medical attention.

### Absorption

The pharmacokinetics of scopolamine differ substantially between different dosage routes. Oral administration of 0.5 mg scopolamine in healthy volunteers produced a C
max
of 0.54 ± 0.1 ng/mL, a t
max
of 23.5 ± 8.2 min, and an AUC of 50.8 ± 1.76 ng*min/mL; the absolute bioavailability is low at 13 ± 1%, presumably because of first-pass metabolism.
5
By comparison, IV infusion of 0.5 mg scopolamine over 15 minutes resulted in a C
max
of 5.00 ± 0.43 ng/mL, a t
max
of 5.0 min, and an AUC of 369.4 ± 2.2 ng*min/mL.
5
Other dose forms have also been tested. Subcutaneous administration of 0.4 mg scopolamine resulted in a C
max
of 3.27 ng/mL, a t
max
of 14.6 min, and an AUC of 158.2 ng*min/mL. Intramuscular administration of 0.5 scopolamine resulted in a C
max
of 0.96 ± 0.17 ng/mL, a t
max
of 18.5 ± 4.7 min, and an AUC of 81.3 ± 11.2 ng*min/mL. Absorption following intranasal administration was found to be rapid, whereby 0.4 mg of scopolamine resulted in a C
max
of 1.68 ± 0.23 ng/mL, a t
max
of 2.2 ± 3 min, and an AUC of 167 ± 20 ng*min/mL; intranasal scopolamine also had a higher bioavailability than that of oral scopolamine at 83 ± 10%.
5
Due to dose-dependent adverse effects, the transdermal patch was developed to obtain therapeutic plasma concentrations over a longer period of time. Following patch application, scopolamine becomes detectable within four hours and reaches a peak concentration (t
max
) within 24 hours. The average plasma concentration is 87 pg/mL, and the total levels of free and conjugated scopolamine reach 354 pg/mL.
9

### Metabolism

Little is known about the metabolism of scopolamine in humans, although many metabolites have been detected in animal studies.
5
In general, scopolamine is primarily metabolized in the liver, and the primary metabolites are various glucuronide and sulphide conjugates.
5
,
6
Although the enzymes responsible for scopolamine metabolism are unknown,
in vitro
studies have demonstrated oxidative demethylation linked to CYP3A subfamily activity, and scopolamine pharmacokinetics were significantly altered by coadministration with grapefruit juice, suggesting that CYP3A4 is responsible for at least some of the oxidative demethylation.
5
,
8

### Half-life

The half-life of scopolamine differs depending on the route. Intravenous, oral, and intramuscular administration have similar half-lives of 68.7 ± 1.0, 63.7 ± 1.3, and 69.1 ±8/0 min, respectively. The half-life is greater with subcutaneous administration at 213 min.
5
Following removal of the transdermal patch system, scopolamine plasma concentrations decrease in a log-linear fashion with a half-life of 9.5 hours.
9

### Toxicity

Scopolamine overdose may manifest as lethargy, somnolence, coma, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, convulsion, visual disturbance, dry flushed skin, dry mouth, decreased bowel sounds, urinary retention, tachycardia, hypertension, and supraventricular arrhythmias. In some cases, overdose symptoms may appear similar to those associated with withdrawal following discontinuation. However, withdrawal symptoms such as bradycardia, headache, nausea, abdominal cramps, and sweating can help to distinguish between these possibilities. Overdose management primarily involves the removal of all transdermal patch systems combined with symptomatic and supportive care. Ensuring an adequate airway, supplemental oxygen, establishing intravenous access, and continuous monitoring are recommended. In cases where patients have swallowed one or more patch systems, it may be necessary to remove them or administer activated charcoal.
9
Animal studies revealed an oral LD
50
of 1880 mg/kg in mice and 1270 mg/kg in rats, and a subcutaneous LD
50
of 1650 mg/kg in mice and 296 mg/kg in rats.

### Mechanism of action

Acetylcholine
(ACh) is a neurotransmitter that can signal through ligand-gated cation channels (nicotinic receptors) and G-protein-coupled muscarinic receptors (mAChRs). ACh signalling via mAChRs located in the central nervous system (CNS) and periphery can regulate smooth muscle contraction, glandular secretions, heart rate, and various neurological phenomena such as learning and memory.
2
,
3
mAChRs can be divided into five subtypes, M1-M5, expressed at various levels throughout the brain.
3
Also, M2 receptors are found in the heart and M3 receptors in smooth muscles, mediating effects apart from the direct modulation of the parasympathetic nervous system.
4
While M1, M3, and M5 mAChRs primarily couple to G
q
proteins to activate phospholipase C, M2 and M4 mainly couple to G
i/o
proteins to inhibit adenylyl cyclase and modulate cellular ion flow.
3
This system, in part, helps to control physiological responses such as nausea and vomiting.
9
Scopolamine acts as a non-selective competitive inhibitor of M1-M5 mAChRs, albeit with weaker M5 inhibition; as such, scopolamine is an anticholinergic with various dose-dependent therapeutic and adverse effects.
4
,
5
,
6
The exact mechanism(s) of action of scopolamine remains poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that M1 (and possibly M2) mAChR antagonism at interneurons acts through inhibition of downstream neurotransmitter release and subsequent pyramidal neuron activation to mediate neurological responses associated with stress and depression.
7
Similar antagonism of M4 and M5 receptors is associated with potential therapeutic benefits in neurological conditions such as schizophrenia and substance abuse disorders.
3
The significance of these observations to scopolamine's current therapeutic indications of preventing nausea and vomiting is unclear but is linked to its anticholinergic effect and ability to alter signalling through the CNS associated with vomiting.

### Volume of distribution

The volume of distribution of scopolamine is not well characterized.
9
IV infusion of 0.5 mg scopolamine over 15 minutes resulted in a volume of distribution of 141.3 ± 1.6 L.
5

### Protein binding

Scopolamine may reversibly bind plasma proteins in humans.
9
In rats, scopolamine exhibits relatively low plasma protein binding of 30 ± 10%.
5

### Route of elimination

Following oral administration, approximately 2.6% of unchanged scopolamine is recovered in urine.
5
Compared to this, using the transdermal patch system, less than 10% of the total dose, both as unchanged scopolamine and metabolites, is recovered in urine over 108 hours. Less than 5% of the total dose is recovered unchanged.
9

### Clearance

IV infusion of 0.5 mg scopolamine resulted in a clearance of 81.2 ± 1.55 L/h, while subcutaneous administration resulted in a lower clearance of 0.14-0.17 L/h.

### General Function

A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of sterols, steroid hormones, retinoids and fatty acids (PubMed:10681376, PubMed:11093772, PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317, PubMed:14559847, PubMed:15373842, PubMed:15764715, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20702771, PubMed:21490593, PubMed:21576599). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds (PubMed:12865317, PubMed:14559847, PubMed:15373842, PubMed:15764715, PubMed:21490593, PubMed:21576599, PubMed:2732228). Exhibits high catalytic activity for the formation of hydroxyestrogens from estrone (E1) and 17beta-estradiol (E2), namely 2-hydroxy E1 and E2, as well as D-ring hydroxylated E1 and E2 at the C-16 position (PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317, PubMed:14559847). Plays a role in the metabolism of androgens, particularly in oxidative deactivation of testosterone (PubMed:15373842, PubMed:15764715, PubMed:22773874, PubMed:2732228). Metabolizes testosterone to less biologically active 2beta- and 6beta-hydroxytestosterones (PubMed:15373842, PubMed:15764715, PubMed:2732228). Contributes to the formation of hydroxycholesterols (oxysterols), particularly A-ring hydroxylated cholesterol at the C-4beta position, and side chain hydroxylated cholesterol at the C-25 position, likely contributing to cholesterol degradation and bile acid biosynthesis (PubMed:21576599). Catalyzes bisallylic hydroxylation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (PubMed:9435160). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of PUFA with a preference for the last double bond (PubMed:19965576). Metabolizes endocannabinoid arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide) to 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid ethanolamides (EpETrE-EAs), potentially modulating endocannabinoid system signaling (PubMed:20702771). Plays a role in the metabolism of retinoids. Displays high catalytic activity for oxidation of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinal, a rate-limiting step for the biosynthesis of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) (PubMed:10681376). Further metabolizes atRA toward 4-hydroxyretinoate and may play a role in hepatic atRA clearance (PubMed:11093772). Responsible for oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics. Acts as a 2-exo-monooxygenase for plant lipid 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol) (PubMed:11159812). Metabolizes the majority of the administered drugs. Catalyzes sulfoxidation of the anthelmintics albendazole and fenbendazole (PubMed:10759686). Hydroxylates antimalarial drug quinine (PubMed:8968357). Acts as a 1,4-cineole 2-exo-monooxygenase (PubMed:11695850). Also involved in vitamin D catabolism and calcium homeostasis. Catalyzes the inactivation of the active hormone calcitriol (1-alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3)) (PubMed:29461981)

### Specific Function

  "wikipedia": `# Scopolamine
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopolamine*

Scopolamine, also known as hyoscine, or Devil's Breath, is a medication used to treat motion sickness and postoperative nausea and vomiting. It is also sometimes used before surgery to decrease saliva. When used by injection, effects begin after about 20 minutes and last for up to 8 hours. It may also be used orally and as a transdermal patch since it has been long known to have transdermal bioavailability.
Scopolamine is in the antimuscarinic family of drugs and works by blocking some of the effects of acetylcholine within the nervous system.
Scopolamine was first written about in 1881 and started to be used for anesthesia around 1900. Scopolamine is also the main active component produced by certain plants of the nightshade family, which historically have been used as psychoactive drugs, known as deliriants, due to their antimuscarinic-induced hallucinogenic effects in higher doses. In these contexts, its mind-altering effects have been utilized for recreational and occult purposes. The name "scopolamine" is derived from one type of nightshade known as Scopolia, while the name "hyoscine" is derived from another type known as Hyoscyamus niger, or black henbane. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.

## Medical uses

Scopolamine has a number of formal uses in modern medicine where it is used in its isolated form and in low doses to treat:

Postoperative nausea and vomiting
Motion sickness, including sea sickness, leading to its use by scuba divers (where it is often applied as a transdermal patch behind the ear)
Gastrointestinal spasms
Kidney or liver spasms
Aid in gastrointestinal radiology and endoscopy
Irritable bowel syndrome
Clozapine-induced drooling
Bowel colic
Eye inflammation
It is sometimes used as a premedication, especially to reduce respiratory tract secretions in surgery, most commonly by injection. Common side effects include sleepiness, blurred vision, dilated pupils, and dry mouth. It is not recommended in people with angle-closure glaucoma or bowel obstruction. Whether its use during pregnancy is safe remains unclear, and use during breastfeeding is still cautioned by health professionals and manufacturers of the drug.

### Breastfeeding

Scopolamine enters breast milk by secretion. Although no human studies exist to document the safety of scopolamine while nursing, the manufacturer recommends that caution be taken if scopolamine is administered to a breastfeeding woman.

## Adverse effects

Adverse effect incidence:
Uncommon (0.1–1% incidence) adverse effects include:

Dry mouth
Anhidrosis (reduced ability to sweat to cool off)
Tachycardia (usually occurs at higher doses and is succeeded by bradycardia)
Bradycardia
Urticaria (hives)
Pruritus (itching)

Rare (<0.1% incidence) adverse effects include:

Constipation
Urinary retention
Hallucinations
Agitation
Confusion
Restlessness
Seizures

Unknown frequency adverse effects include:

Anaphylactic shock or reactions
Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
Rash
Erythema
Other hypersensitivity reactions
Blurred vision
Mydriasis (dilated pupils)
Drowsiness
Dizziness
Somnolence

## Overdose

Physostigmine, a cholinergic drug that readily crosses the blood–brain barrier, has been used as an antidote to treat the central nervous system depression symptoms of a scopolamine overdose. Other than this supportive treatment, gastric lavage and induced emesis (vomiting) are usually recommended as treatments for oral overdoses. The symptoms of overdose include:

Tachycardia
Arrhythmia
Blurred vision
Photophobia
Urinary retention
Drowsiness or paradoxical reaction, which can present with hallucinations
Cheyne–Stokes respiration
Dry mouth
Skin reddening
Inhibition of gastrointestinal motility

## Route of administration

Scopolamine can be taken by mouth, subcutaneously, in the eye, and intravenously, as well as via a transdermal patch.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacological effects of scopolamine are mediated through the drug's competitive antagonism of the peripheral and central muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Scopolamine acts as a nonspecific muscarinic antagonist at all four (M1, M2, M3, and M4) receptor sites.
In doses higher than intended for medicinal use, the hallucinogenic alteration of consciousness, as well as the delirium in particular, are tied to the compound's activity at the M1 muscarinic receptor. M1 receptors are located primarily in the central nervous system and are involved in perception, attention, and cognitive functioning. Delirium is associated solely with the antagonism of postsynaptic M1 receptors; currently no other receptor subtypes have been implicated. 
Peripheral muscarinic receptors are part of the autonomic nervous system. M2 receptors are located in the brain and heart, M3 receptors are in salivary glands and M4 receptors are in the brain and lungs. Due to the drug's inhibition of various signal transduction pathways, the decrease in acetylcholine signaling is what leads to many of the cognitive deficits, mental impairments, and delirium associated with psychoactive doses. Medicinal effects appear to mostly be tied to activation of the peripheral receptors and only from marginal decreases in acetylcholine signaling.
Although often broadly referred to as simply being 'anticholinergic', antimuscarinic would be more specific and accurate terminology to use for scopolamine, as, for example, it is not known to block nicotinic receptors.

### Pharmacokinetics

Scopolamine undergoes first-pass metabolism and about 2.6% is excreted unchanged in urine. It has a bioavailability of 20-40%, reaches peak plasma concentration in about 45 minutes, and in healthy subjects has an average half-life of 5 hours (observed range 2 - 10 hours). Scopolamine is primarily metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme, and grapefruit juice decreases metabolism of scopolamine, consequently increasing plasma concentration.

## Chemistry

### Biosynthesis in plants

Scopolamine is among the secondary metabolites of plants from the Solanaceae (nightshade) family of plants, including henbane (Hyoscyamus niger), jimson weed (Datura), angel's trumpets (Brugmansia), deadly nightshade (Belladonna), mandrake (Mandragora officinarum), and corkwood (Duboisia).

The biosynthesis of scopolamine begins with the decarboxylation of L-ornithine to putrescine by ornithine decarboxylase. Putrescine is methylated to N-methylputrescine by putrescine N-methyltransferase.
A putrescine oxidase that specifically recognizes methylated putrescine catalyzes the deamination of this compound to 4-methylaminobutanal, which then undergoes a spontaneous ring formation to N-methyl-pyrrolium cation. In the next step, the pyrrolium cation condenses with acetoacetic acid yielding hygrine. No enzymatic activity could be demonstrated to catalyze this reaction. Hygrine further rearranges to tropinone.
Subsequently, tropinone reductase I converts tropinone to tropine, which condenses with phenylalanine-derived phenyllactate to littorine. A cytochrome P450 classified as Cyp80F1 oxidizes and rearranges littorine to hyoscyamine aldehyde. In the final step, hyoscyamine undergoes epoxidation catalyzed by 6β-hydroxyhyoscyamine epoxidase yielding scopolamine.

## History

Plants naturally containing scopolamine such as Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade), Brugmansia (angels trumpet), Datura (Jimson weed), Hyoscyamus niger, Mandragora officinarum, Scopolia carniolica, Latua and Duboisia myoporoides have been known about and used for various purposes in both the New and Old Worlds since ancient times. Being one of the earlier alkaloids isolated from plant sources, scopolamine has been in use in its purified forms, such as various salts, including hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, and sulfate, since its official isolation by the German scientist Albert Ladenburg in 1880, and as various preparations from its plant-based form since antiquity and perhaps prehistoric times. 
In 1899, Dr. Schneiderlin recommended the use of scopolamine and morphine for surgical anaesthesia, and it started to be used sporadically for that purpose. The use of this combination in obstetric anesthesiology (childbirth) was first proposed by Richard von Steinbuchel in 1902 and was picked up and further developed by Carl Gauss in Freiburg, Germany, starting in 1903. The method, which was based on a drug synergy between both scopolamine and morphine came to be known as Dämmerschlaf ("twilight sleep") or the "Freiburg method". It spread rather slowly, and different clinics experimented with different dosages and ingredients. In 1915, the Canadian Medical Association Journal reported, "the method [was] really still in a state of development". It remained widely used in the US until the 1960s, when growing chemophobia and a desire for more natural childbirth led to its abandonment.

## Society and culture

### Names

Hyoscine hydrobromide is the international nonproprietary name, and scopolamine hydrobromide is the United States Adopted Name. Other names include levo-duboisine, devil's breath, and burundanga.

### Australian bush medicine

A bush medicine developed by Aboriginal peoples of the eastern states of Australia from the soft corkwood tree (Duboisia myoporoides) was used by the Allies in World War II to stop soldiers from getting seasick when they sailed across the English Channel on their way to France during the Invasion of Normandy. Later, the same substance was found to be usable in the production of scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which are used in eye surgery, and a multimillion-dollar industry was built in Queensland based on this substance.

### Recreational and religious use

While it has been occasionally used recreationally for its hallucinogenic properties, the experiences are often unpleasant, mentally and physically. It is also physically dangerous and officially classified as a deliriant drug, so repeated recreational use is rare. In June 2008, more than 20 people were hospitalized with psychosis in Norway after ingesting counterfeit rohypnol tablets containing scopolamine. In January 2018, 9 individuals were hospitalized in Perth, Western Australia, after reportedly ingesting scopolamine. 
The alkaloid scopolamine, when taken recreationally for its psychoactive effect, is usually taken in the form of preparations from plants of the genera Datura or Brugmansia, often by adolescents or young adults in order to achieve hallucinations and an altered state of consciousness induced by muscarinic antagonism. In circumstances such as these, the intoxication is usually built on a synergistic, but even more toxic mixture of the additional alkaloids in the plants which includes atropine and hyoscyamine.
Historically, the various plants that produce scopolamine have been used psychoactively for spiritual and magical purposes, particularly by witches in western culture and indigenous groups throughout the Americas, such as Native American tribes like the Chumash. When entheogenic preparations of these plants were used, scopolamine was considered to be the main psychoactive compound and was largely responsible for the hallucinogenic effects, particularly when the preparation was made into a topical ointment, most notably flying ointment. 
Scopolamine is reported to be the only active alkaloid within these plants that can effectively be absorbed through the skin to cause effects. Different recipes for these ointments were explored in European witchcraft at least as far back as the early modern period and included multiple ingredients to help with the transdermal absorption of scopolamine, such as animal fat, as well as other possible ingredients to counteract its noxious and dysphoric effects.
In the Bible, there are multiple mentions of Mandrake, a psychoactive and hallucinogenic plant root that contains scopolamine. It was associated with fertility and (sexual) desire for which it was yearned by Rachel, who was "barren" (infertile) but trying to conceive.

### Interrogation

The effects of scopolamine were studied for use as a truth serum in interrogations in the early 20th century, but because of the side effects, investigations were dropped. In 2009, the Czechoslovak state security secret police were proven to have used scopolamine at least three times to obtain confessions from alleged antistate dissidents.

### Use in crime

Ingestion of scopolamine can render a victim unconscious for 24 hours or more. In large doses, it can cause respiratory failure and death. The highest prevalence of misuse seems to be recorded in Colombia. Unofficial estimates there put the number of annual scopolamine incidents at approximately 50,000. A travel advisory published by the U.S. Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) in 2012 stated: One common and particularly dangerous method that criminals use to rob a victim is through the use of drugs. Scopolamine is most often administered in liquid or powder form in foods and beverages. The majority of these incidents occur in nightclubs and bars, and usually, men, perceived to be wealthy, are targeted by young, attractive women. It is recommended that to avoid becoming a victim of scopolamine, a person should never accept food or beverages offered by strangers or new acquaintances, nor leave food or beverages unattended in their presence. Victims of scopolamine or other drugs should seek immediate medical attention.
Between 1998 and 2004, 13% of emergency-room admissions for "poisoning with criminal intentions" in a clinic of Bogotá have been attributed to scopolamine, and 44% to benzodiazepines. Most commonly, the person has been poisoned by a robber who gave the victim a scopolamine-laced beverage, in the hope that the victim would become unconscious or unable to effectively resist the robbery.
Beside robberies, it is also allegedly involved in express kidnappings and sexual assault. In 2008, the Hospital Clínic in Barcelona introduced a protocol to help medical workers identify cases. In February 2015, Madrid hospitals adopted a similar working document. Hospital Clínic has found little scientific evidence to support this use and relies on the victims' stories to reach any conclusion. 
Although poisoning by scopolamine appears quite often in the media as an aid for raping, kidnapping, killing, or robbery, the effects of this drug and the way it is applied by criminals (transdermal injection, on playing cards and papers, etc.) are often exaggerated, especially skin exposure, as the dose that can be absorbed by the skin is too low to have any effect. Scopolamine transdermal patches must be used for hours to days. 
There are certain other aspects of the usage of scopolamine in crimes. Powdered scopolamine is referred to as "devil's breath". In popular media and television, it is portrayed as a method to brainwash or control people into being defrauded by their attackers. There is debate whether these claims are true.

## Research

Scopolamine is used as a research tool to study memory encoding. Initially, in human trials, relatively low doses of the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine were found to induce temporary cognitive defects. Since then, scopolamine has become a standard drug for experimentally inducing cognitive defects in animals. Results in primates suggest that acetylcholine is involved in the encoding of new information into long-term memory. Scopolamine has been shown to exert a greater impairment on episodic memory, event-related potentials, memory retention and free recall compared to diphenhydramine (an anticholinergic and antihistamine).
Scopolamine produces detrimental effects on short-term memory, memory acquisition, learning, visual recognition memory, visuospatial praxis, visuospatial memory, visuoperceptual function, verbal recall, and psychomotor speed. It does not seem to impair recognition and memory retrieval, though. Acetylcholine projections in hippocampal neurons, which are vital in mediating long-term potentiation, are inhibited by scopolamine. Scopolamine inhibits cholinergic-mediated glutamate release in hippocampal neurons, which assist in depolarization, potentiation of action potential, and synaptic suppression. Scopolamine's effects on acetylcholine and glutamate release in the hippocampus favor retrieval-dominant cognitive functioning. Scopolamine has been used to model the defects in cholinergic function for models of Alzheimer's, dementia, fragile X syndrome, and Down syndrome.
Scopolamine has been identified as a psychoplastogen, which refers to a compound capable of promoting rapid and sustained neuroplasticity in a single dose. It has been and continues to be investigated as a rapid-onset antidepressant, with many small studies finding positive results, particularly in female subjects.
NASA agreed to develop a nasal administration method. With a precise dosage, the NASA spray formulation has been shown to work faster and more reliably than the oral form to treat motion sickness.
Although a fair amount of research has been applied to scopolamine in the field of medicine, its hallucinogenic (psychoactive) effects as well as the psychoactive effects of other antimuscarinic deliriants have not been extensively researched or as well understood compared to other types of hallucinogens such as psychedelic and dissociative compounds, despite the alkaloid's long history of usage in mind-altering plant preparations.
