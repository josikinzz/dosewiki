EXPERIENCE EXCERPTS #
 
[14 mg oral] "Pulse is accelerating [...] no fear or anxiety [...] emotional openness, alertness and wide-awakeness [...] subtle enhancement of color and depth perception [...] very very mild effects on heart rate and breathing [...] Drifting attention span [...] Sensual body energy and great curiosity [...] Stronger visuals with eyes closed than open [...] very colorful flowing waves and organic landscapes [...] details in wood-grain textures and interesting fabrics are swimming about in the way I've seen again and again from 4-substituted tryptamines and psilocin analogues [...] I feel like a god, powerful and attractive [...] tactile hypersensitivity can be felt [...] My pupils are fully dilated [...] I'm trembling [...] I have the feeling that time is slowing down and then speeding up again [...] positive, uplifting energy in the body." -- [Exp 76397](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=76397)
 
[17 mg oral] "I was feeling extremely sick [...] had to control my breathing as to not throw up [...] suddenly extremely cold even though my palms were clammy and the rest of my body was hot [...] heart was beating extremely fast [...] I much feel better [...] had a stomach ache [...] I was sweating to death and clammy [...] The walls were twisting and turning)..." -- [Exp 91175](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=91175)
 
[18 mg oral] "I felt a little giggly [...] anxiety began to set in [...] Nausea began to set in [...] my heart-rate and breathing felt strange [...] I began to have very negative and sad thoughts [...] begin to see the typical rainbow-fractals that looked really similar to what I've seen on shrooms multiple times [...] feels very similar to shrooms but a little different [...] I have very deep, and introspective thoughts regarding our existence..." -- [Exp 91567](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=91567)
 
[27 mg sublingual] "Some time dilation [...] Intensification and bleeding of colors. A strange effect of straight edges seeming to flow to the right, into themselves [...] quite like 4-AcO-DMT [...] Very good closed-eye visuals [...] Bright colors, very complex designs [...] All the colors of the rainbow in spiralling, fractal patterns which changed at all times [...] It reminds me of the spiral fractal in MilkDrop (the visualization program for Winamp) [...] The overall vibe was very friendly [...]" -- [Exp 63399](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=63399)
