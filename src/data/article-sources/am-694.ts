## Subjective Experience

Plant materials infused with AM-694 appeared on the market shortly after the
demise of the original spice (typically JWH-018 and JWH-073), circa 2010.

I sampled two such brands, and contrary to the usual flow of synthetic cannabinoid
development, which is to create stronger and stronger compounds, I found these to
be weaker and more benign.

They were psychoactive, certainly, but there was less of a punch. That isn’t to say that
they were necessarily inferior, but were instead, less intense on initial consumption.

I should note that I didn’t redose with this or any other synthetic cannabinoid. My
modus operandi was to toke the material once and once only, rather than to top-up
over a prolonged period.

Finally, some recent reports suggest that AM-694 may metabolise into the highly
toxic fluoroacetic acid when consumed orally. This RoA should therefore be strictly
avoided.

AM-694 (1-(5-fluoropentyl)-3-(2-iodobenzoyl)indole) is a designer drug that acts as a potent and selective agonist for the cannabinoid receptor CB1. It is used in scientific research for mapping the distribution of CB1 receptors.

## Pharmacology

AM-694 is an agonist for cannabinoid receptors. It has a Ki of 0.08 nM at CB1 and 18 times selectivity over CB2 with a Ki of 1.44 nM. It is unclear what is responsible for this unusually high CB1 binding affinity, but it makes the 18F radiolabelled derivative of AM-694 useful for mapping the distribution of CB1 receptors in the body.

## Metabolism

Pathways of metabolism include hydrolytic defluorination, carboxylation, and monohydroxylation of the N-alkyl chain.

## Legal status

### Finland

AM-694 is scheduled in the "government decree on psychoactive substances banned from the consumer market".
