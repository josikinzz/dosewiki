**Morphine **was first isolated from opium in 1805 by a German pharmacist, Wilhelm Sertürner. Sertürner described it as the Principium Somniferum. He named it morphium - after Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams. Today morphine is isolated from opium in substantially larger quantities - over 1000 tons per year - although most commercial opium is converted into codeine by methylation. On the illicit market, opium gum is filtered into morphine base and then synthesized into heroin. [[1]](http://www.drugrehabamerica.com/FAQ-morphine.htm)

**IV of MSIR 30 mg.... important question!**


I'm really new to IV.. I really don't like needles anywhere near my veins actually. But I can't help the rush I get. Even though I can never register ![:X](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/mad.gif)


**ANYWAYS.. after I crush it up and put it in the spoon with the water do I need to heat it before cotton ball 'n syringe.**

maybe some general information about arterial shots and abscesses? how to avoid abscesses, what to do if you think you missed a shot, when to go to the doctor, etc.


also, maybe this could be expanded to all opiate pharmaceuticals? questions about oxy prep seem to be very common as well, and it's all the same procedure.

These are my revisions to this faq:


**Routes of Administration**


EDIT: Oral BA is higher is ~25%

EDIT: Intranasal is lower, like ~20%


**Preparation for Insufflation for morphine tablets (snorting)**


ADD: The pill coating needs to be removed. This can be done by using a pairing knife, or some type of scrapping device.


**Preparation for Plugging Morphine Tablets**


EDIT: Preparation in bold spelled incorrectly ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) .


EDIT: "*5) Get into a comfortable position, laying on your side down on the ground. *"

This step could be removed, because it does not matter what position you are in. Once the fluid is inserted, all is good.


EDIT: "*7) Start inserting the syringe slowly, until you reach about 2 knuckles deep (your finger is deep within the borderline now isn't it pal?)*"

Only the 'tip' of the needless syringe needs to be inserted. Inserting it two knuckles deep is completely unnecessary.


**

Preparation for IV**


I don't 100% agree with the preparation method. I think it is impossible to write a "one size fits all" FAQ on prepping morphine IV. It heavily depends on what brand and formulation the morphine is in.

I coulda sworn that Hannibal once said that morphine's BA was the same for both oral and rectal.  Not that I believed him, though

If you can not register, DO NOT SHOOT.  No matter how well you have prepped your solution or how 'pure' your solution is, injecting pills into your veins is bad as it is, injecting it into a muscle is just asking for an abscess and/or other serious complications![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

this is before you insert the syringe and solution.

i've always read to have it in this far to make sure and be certain that you're in there far enough, i'm going to leave as a guide for the moment

yes, you're exactly right, i hadn't added that in yet.


could you guys give me an idea on what type of morphine pill can and can't be prepped for injection?  ie ones that don't gel up etc.


i've always used MsContins and never had a gelling problem (and i've seen people who agree) yet there is conflicting arguments from people.  The only other formulation I've used are Kadian capsules.


Thanks guys and keep the feedback coming![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Kudos about stating the bioavailability of the different routes of administration. I had the feeling that it was not worth while to snort morphine. I am shocked that the BA of plugging is so high. I'm going to get an oral syringe soon. Twice the high? Fuck yes.

**banging**


well im a downer person i love morphine and 2 days ago i decided to try banging it. i heard all the hype about it and my girlfriend showed me how to iv a while back this was my first time with needles ever i was bye myself and i normally take 40-60mg oral to feel good so i figured 30mg would be a good dose to try so i rigged it all up found a vein stuck myself registered and injected all of it. i pulled the needle out and almost instantly i was at a state of well being but it olny lasted about an hour or so...i didnot enjoy it as much as the im i did the next day but my question, is there  anyone who likes oral injestion more than iv or am i alone on this

hm...i think they're called Pulmonary Granulomas. basically it's the binder stuff that wasn't filtered good enough accumulating in your veins. so think of little grains of sand in your bloodstream, you'll feel it. it will hurt like hell.

first of all: pills are made to eat

Secondly: IV, don't IM


but, since you insist...you ought to invest in some micron filters if you're going to do this, and that will work out better for you. you'll be less sore, and you'll have a better rush and all that jazz.

Just snort tiny amounts until you get a buzz, and youll know its heroin.


If its tar, it will be sticky, look like a raisin, and smell like viniger

I would also like to know your source for the rectal bioavailability, as the [Bioavailability/Half-Life thread](http://bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=266339)states that it is the same as oral.

to the guy that was IMing heroin, please dont shoot pills, espcically if they work fine for you oral, also, if your going to shoot pills IV them, do not shoot Im, IE into your muscle, this is MUCH MUCH more dangerous then IV, and has no rush and comes on just as fast as oral.

i'd read somewhere before that it was around 60+ but was a little skeptical myself.  and after looking through a few more articles then 60+ is definitely too high.  that article has a range from 12%-61%, with a mean of 30%.

well, one of the things that pushed it up higher was that IIRC, the studies have pills administered whole. I mean, they're suppositories, but still. Whereas most drug users doing it will administer via liquid, which I'm sure enhances absorption.


Obviously there's no studies of this, but I'd think that it's probably on the higher range.

**IV preparation of MS Contin (mallinkrodt)**


Okay, I've been a lurker on bluelight and opiophile for the past few months (pretty much when i started IVing, and I've been really bothered by the methods of preparing MS Contin (and TEEVA oxycodone ER or any other "gelly" pills) shots that have been suggested.


Here is my method...


What you will need:

-Mallinkrodt MS Contin (or the ABG kind or any other kind of pill that may gel up, I use the 30mg and 100mg tablets)

-A piece of glossy paper (i've been using the manual that came with my nintendo DS, lol)

-1cc insulin syringes, 31 guage (all that is available here in KS)

-A table spoon (i like measuring spoons cuz they're thin and and i don't have to worry about spilling my shit)

-Cigarette filter or wheel barrel filter (i have never seen a wheel filter in my life, cigarette filters work fine for me)

-water (kansas swamp/tap water works great...)

-electric range stove, the coil kind (because it doesn't leave all that carbon black all over my kit)


1 - Remove the coating of the pill with a damp napkin or tissue


2 - fold the piece of glossy paper and put the pill in the fold of the paper and crush with a lighter (i've found that rolling the paper back and forth like a joint gets the powdered pill to come unstuck from the paper). You should be left with a paper chute with finely crushed pill in it.


3 - turn your electric range on to about "6" or "7"


4 - add about 1.8 cc of water to the spoon (without adding the powder yet), set it on the burner and wait for it to begin boiling

Step end of the needle so you'll be ready to draw up the solution, because you need to draw it up fast


6 - just as the water starts boiling, drop the powder in with your paper chute you made


7 - let it boil for about 3 or 4 seconds, stir it once or twice with the plunger of the syringe and let it boil for another couple seconds


8 - draw the solution up as quickly and efficiently as possible. if you do everything right you should end up with a minimal ammount of gel at the bottom of the spoon. if you do end up with gel, don't freak out. you're going to need to add a little less than a CC, maybe less and boil it with the gel for a few seconds, as long as it takes to get the water kinda cloudy again. push the gel that's left to the edge of the spoon and draw up the solution with a clean filter (meaning... just leave the cotton you used before in the spoon with the gel and ignore it and use a clean cotton because if you get the syringe in the gel, you can clog it really easily)


9 - if you're lucky and quick and patient, this should leave you with a cloudy, off-white looking solution in the syringe. whatever gel is left in the spoon DOES CONTAIN DRUGS, and therefore you should save it till when you run out (i scrape all mine and stick it on the inside of a jar that i keep). just take the gel from maybe 7 or 8 pill you've done and boil the fuck out of it, push the gel to the side, and draw up the solution. i've got shots from doing this that were easily 200mg and gave me pins and needles in my head like you wouldn't believe. good if you have a couple of days wait for whoever's script to get filled.


10 - ??????


11 - Profit! 


And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how I've been kickin' it for the past 5 months

Eww god the thought of shooting up mscontin gives me the willies. That's as good a way to lose a arm as any. Also all the MS IR's ive seen in canada are made by purdue and gell up on contact with water. Well the 30mg ones gell up anyway cause just to test it out i put a crushed up pill in water and it gelled right the fuck up as bad as a mscontin.


 There are some morphine instant release pills not made by pudue that may be somewhat safer to inject but they are not common.

Hmm honestly the only one i know of is statex morphine instant release tablets that come in doses of up to 50mg's ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif). They are made by pharmascience. I don't even know if they make em anymore because i used to get the statex suppositories and the pharmacy couldnt find them for me. Well they are listed as active so they are still made but finding them is another matter.


 Promethazine is a OTC product thats still made in canada but good fucking luck finding it


 Id love to get morphine instant release 50mg tablets. Damn.

10 mg: Each round, blue, bevelled-edged tablet, scored on one side and marked with "PMS" on one side, contains 10 mg of morphine sulfate. Nonmedicinal ingredients: lactose, magnesium stearate, cellulose, FD&C blue No. 1 lake.


I just put the 10 mg tablet ingredient list cuz those are the ones I have....Does any body see anything in the list that would cause it to Gel?And Does anybody know the specific ingredient(s) that they use to make pills Gel?

I don't see anything there that act's as a gell. But i have no idea how safe shooting those pills would be either. Hell shooting pills is not safe period. But some pills are "safer" to shoot then others such as abbott brand dilaudid's.

^i haven't heard of 50mg tablets before but i do know Kadian and Kapanol have 50mg capsules with the little wax beads inside them.  Kadian were the first type of morphine i shot.  Kadian are available here in australia and i know Kapanol are available in America and probably elsewhere.

I Used To Get The Pink 25's Regularly and never came across any of the IR 50 mg's.

I Was Almost Thinkin The Statex Morphine Pills I Have Right Now Might Be Similar to the Pharmascience Dilaudid's I used to Get..Similar Shape and size...and markings......I'm Going To compare the ingredient lists of the 2.....Cuz the Hydromorphs we're IV'able

Isn't there an Ethex morphine IR 15 and 30mg as well? The way I've seen them talked about, it wouldn't seem that they gel, but I suppose the pill formulation may have changed in the last year.


What is up with Purdue using the "for real" time release on morphine and not oxycodone? Is it just because the oral BA means they'd be supplying dudes with massive amounts of IV doses and abuse would be more enouraged? Is is a patent or licensing issue related to the continuous release?

I usually snort oxys/roxys, but today all I could get my hands on were some endo morphine ER 60's (E655/60).  I don't really like morphine, swallowing them does nothing for me, I snorted the first one and besides making me gag (HORRIBLE TASTE!) it completely clogged my nose up.  I attempted for the first time plugging one, I crushed it up, threw it on a spoon, it completely gelled up so I cooked it, moved the giant pink mass to the end of the spoon, and plugged the water that was left over.  Is this right?  There was alot of pink waxy stuff left over, do you usually get that much left over?  I have been searching through the threads for the past hour and kinda cobbled together this method of ingestion.  What is the most effective way for taking these particular pills, in your opinion, besides shooting it.  I'm not really into that.  Is it worth it to "plug" over just swallowing the damn thing?  I can't bear to think of snorting any more.  I bought a bunch of these, any advice?

Plugging method- Simplified for the lazy.


Crush pill, add 5ml warm water. Stir 2Mintues take 10ml Oral syringe 

Draw up solution, lay down on your left side, lube with water based lube, Vaseline if you have to. insert 3 quarters of the way withe a 10ml syringe that's about 3quaters of the size of your middle finger, inject liquid. 


If you hit the sweet spot effects should be felt almost immediately. There is no need to stay laying down, you are free to get up and move around. If the effects are not noticed after 10 minutes, the shot was either to far in, or not enough. Take a shit before hand if you can.

It feel like MSIR 30mg tabs are quite commonplace for BT pain/pain patients, with Roxane and Ethex being the more common brands IME.  I am pretty sure neither of those gel up judging by their chalky consistency, but I can't say for sure, as I have not actually mixed water in with the powder before.

Just Wanted To say That I've confirmed that the Statex Dont Gel.I let a couple Oxycontin 10's sit in some water,drew it up and filtered through cotton a couple times,then used that water to prepare 5 of the 10 mg Statex....They Did leave a little bit of blue powder in the spoon and on the cotton,and tinged the solution but Dillies do that too.

I am pretty sure neither of those gel up judging by their chalky consistency, but I can't say for sure, as I have not actually mixed water in with the powder before.

Right ! they dont gel but if you do not use a real filter (No cotton or cig butts) that chalky shit will be in your lungs in the form of a idiopathic pulmonary granuloma and you will put the idiot in idiopathic when they biopsy this and it reveals that your lungs are full of pill binders!

**Avinza ( Info ) dont be scared.**


Ok so I mite be the first one to slam these but somebody has to try. Follow directions to a T. 


1. Use the crisping method, this means to crush all the little beads up into a fine powder. Then place onto a magazine in a straight line so only a little comes out at a time onto a piece of aluminum foil. fold the magazine into a V so there is a small point at the bottom and so the two tops dont lie up together( get that ) hard to explain. Then tap the powder out slowly onto the A. foil and make sure no to make clumps but to spread out evenly just enough not to see the a. foil between the powder. (that is the most important part of it, if u mess it up it wont crisp rite. And oh dont use a spoon or anything else doesnt work at all just burning the shit. Now when crisping take your time it will start to get a wierd color at first then will start to change to a light brwish. u are getting there at this point. You want it dark drwn but not black. When you are doing this you will see what im talking about by applying the powder on evenly and not in clumps. 


2. After crisping take credit card and start to scrap off the goodness. yes the aluminum foil will rip if you are to ruff but once u get the hang of it you will be able to get real ruff with it and not rip it. ( just like your gf's and wifes lol) 


3. Then crush all that up and use for whatever you want. Blowing will burn a lil still for a short time only a min. MIXING use a 1/4 2 start with a shot of water if not enough go a stronger. PLUGIN use 1/2. And for SLAMMIN use a 1/10 or 1/8th. Be careful.


120 here is what have been used. I like it all using whatever technique. Friend showed me just thought id pass it along. I tried slamming it and it gives a hell of a rush like dilly. not hardcore only use 1/10 of pill and last 30 mins. head rush less. doesn't last long that way but mixing or blowing does. and plugging will set you way back in the chair.

man how good does weed mix with morphine...they were meant to go together.  i took 60 milligrams today, smoked a gram of good bud and was high for hours and hours.  oxy and weed don't blend nearly that good.

**Morphine Prep**


So i recently got my hands on 100 15mg mscontins. I usually snort all my pills but since morphine has a low b/a for the nose and I dont IV, I deceided to take up plugging (for morphine only). The guide on here says use 10 to 20 mls of warm water. The only needless syringe i have access to is 5ml. I have had great success so far with the smaller amount of water but i have noticed that alot of the M doesnt dissolve completely with just the warm water. My question is would heating the water/morph mix like people do when they're cooking up tar dissolve it better giving the buzz a quicker onset or can the heat some how destroy the pill?


Many Thanks

please search for the morphine mega thread in the future and ask the question in there.  depending on how much and exactly how you warm the water you can actually end up trapping more of the morphine in the wax matrix.

^^Sorry about that. I searched for plugging and morphine. Im a bit new so i didnt think to check out the mega threads, but i'll make sure I do before making a new thread next time I have a question. I normally use 4 to 6 pills in 5 mls of water, which works alright but i know thats probably a bit uneven in the powder/water ratio. So should i try a small amount of heat, or would i be better off manning up and doing two separate shots?

I know this is morphine mega thread but I figure adding to my earlier question in this thread would be more accepted than making a new thread(sorry if im mistaken). Would mixing a ratio of morphine and adderall in a needless syringe work out? Would they both dissolve and produce a nice speedball. I ask because i very much enjoy mixing IR addies and oxy powder together and railing it

^ Yes, that would work great im sure.


Its important to remember the best (safest, highest yiedl) method to get morphine pills for IV is the cold water and 3 ml per pill method stated on heroinhelper.


However with this method it takes 3 shots per pill unless you have a huge rig.


Adding heat will stuff more in a smaller amount, but also melt binders and fillers into your shot. (unhealthy).


Overall. Dont shoot pills. Ever. If you must, Micron filter, No heat.

Hey Chris here is a site alot of PPL use. [http://www.gpzservices.com/](http://www.gpzservices.com/)


Good luck and at leat you are researching it first. I cant tell you how much it sucked the first time I IV'ed 30mg ethex MSIR. I crushed it up finely and mixed w warm water and shot a small amount up particles and all. I nearly died. Sweated from every pore in my body. That was years ago before I had any medical training and not I look back at that and think ....How am I not dead yet? Sites like these would have been a great resource for me years ago or so.

not much man, snorting morphine has a pretty low bioavailability plus you gotta give more info than that. how much oxy/other opioids do you do to get high usually? also, what brand and type of morphines are these?

**Plugged morphine doses**


I just plugged 120mgs of morphine. I have mild-moderate opiate tolerance. Yesterday I plugged 60mgs, and felt great but it wasnt the extremely sedating, noddy high that I was desiring.


I'm not sure if the dosage information for morphine is for oral or IV / plugged (oral biolavailability is only 30% ), so its a bit difficult to get a sense of what a safe dose is.


120mgs plugged should be fine for somebody with medium opiate tolerance, correct? Some websites list this as the LD50, but seeing as I took 60mgs yesterday and didnt feel the effects particularly hard, I should be fine from 120mgs, right?

i wouldn't go doubling your dosage!  plugging it is one of the better ways to take morphine and you will get a lot more out of it.  slowly bump your dose up by 10-15mgs at a time.  


please use the search engine next time.  i'll merge this into the morphine mega thread for you.

I doubled my dose because last night, all I got was some itching and that nice "Everything is alright" feeling for a few hours, then I dozed off.  I was really desiring a deep, sedating nod.


I doubled my dose because I figured that coupled with the tolerance built up from 60mgs yesterday, 120mgs would be enough to get me there. 


I just made this post because I have heard conflicting things about a 120mg dose. Some sources list it as the LD50. Is this true?

it most certainly could be true, especially for someone with zero tolerance.  take someone with no tolerance and have them plug 120mg of morphine and im certain there would be an Overdose.


please don't go doubling your doses exponentially like that, it's asking for an OD.  look after yourself.


maybe you could try some kind of opiate potentiator with the 60mg dosage to get the sedation and nod you like?  that way you're, in the short term, avoiding raising your tolerance and you're left with some morphine to titrate your dose upwards to where you feel comfortable.

Heh, drank a huge glass of grapefruit juice and took a benadryl last night, still didnt do much. Maybe my tolerance is much higher than I thought, because up until last night, 60mgs of rectal morphine would totally put me in a sweet spot.


Its been about an hour now, and I'm still not feeling particularly strong effects (the effects are definitely there, and very enjoyable, but I take opiates to nod, not for the "high").


I'm not so stupid as to take another 60mgs on top of this, but I may take a couple percocets to boost it, if I'm still not feeling anything strong after another hour.

^just because you haven't run into any problems yet doesn't mean that you won't. when we say its very dangerous, its b/c it is dangerous, but it doesn't mean that your gonna get an abcess the first time you do it. you have obviously lucked out so far.


the reason IMing pills is worse than IVing pills is because pills have a load of inactive drugs mixed in with the active drug and when you inject those into the muscle, your body cannot really get rid of them so they stay stuck in your muscles and can cause major infections. when you IV these, at least they go thru your veins and your body can do a decent job at trying to get rid of these inactives. plus, alot of these inactives are water soluble and will go into the solution even if filtered, which is why its recommended to filter with a micron/wheel filter so it can filter out most of these. this is also why its recommended to NOT heat your solution cause this aids in these inactives dissolving into the solution.

^using boiling water will more than likely degrade some amount of the morphine.  i would avoid it at all costs.


merging into morphine mega thread.  please use the search engine before posting, there are a bazillion guides online for plugging.


edit - added in transdermal morphine study link in OP

I noticed some folks brought up the 50mg instant release morphine, Statex...nobody ever mentions these on BL, they must be a solely Canadian product? Oh man i used to get these things like clockwork...now when i see them(rarely) it's a gift from the gods!

sure, or just room temperature.  though i'm not sure whether the pills you've got are going to gel or not.


i'd simply go with the 2.5mL syringe as well.

LOLWUT?  i specifically said "im not sure if your pills are going to gel or not"  and in the plugging guide in this thread i've said something to the extent of "not all morphine pills are going to work, some gel up".  you fucked it up, don't blame us.

So then maybe you should have just swallowed the pills so you could have enjoyed them.

Plug it all, or its not even worth it. 

I had no tolerance and plugged 45mg, wasnt to impressed :S

Its good though, but only worth injecting or plugging ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

have fun.

edit: IF you eat if you might get a HORRIBLE HORRIBLE stomache ache. Just warning you, some people do. Plugging it has like, 5% higher BA and you wont get an upset stomache. Plug is the only way duddde.

everytime i do morphine i usually get fronted about 9 or 10 15mg ms contins.... and i usually plug all of it except 30mgs, which i put up my nose*(even though the B/A isnt great), it just seems like having the powder in my nose satisfies the urgent need to get high and then a half hour later im nodding out like crazy from the plugged dose

That is why you experiment with lower dosage first when you try something new. You could have done that and saw that it gelled up and ate the rest.

**Morphine sulfate - harsh nausea/indigestion?**


What could be done to prevent a strong nausea/stomach cramping from taking a 30mg generic MS Contin as prescribed? It didn't even seem to have much of a pain killing effect either, could something I've eaten make it not work? I take Asmacort and fish oil capsules daily. Thank you.

Assuming you aren't allergic to morphine, serious nausea and stomach cramps from such a low dose are very very uncommon. You are clearly having a non-standard adverse reaction to your medication, so the best advice we can give you is to discuss the issue with your doctor ASAP.

Pepto or any antacid would help with the indigestion. You could try that.

don't iv pills, unless you want talcosis and a whole bunch of other problems

and there's really no way to break them down in such a way as to get only the morphine out of them

i would just plug them, using an enema and a solution

Can anyone give me some advice on this?


These morphine pills . 30mg purple. Apparently it's not safe to do anything but eat them becuase when moist they gell.

Does this sound right?


What is recomended for ROA of these things? I hate that i have to settle for morphine right now.

Well I haven't seen any responses to my questions yet... so I'll just ask the most important one once more.


**Guys, for making PPT, which pod type, in your opinion, is the "best"?**


Personally, I'd like the type that is generally suspected as having the highest amount of morphine and/or least amount of thebaine. Of course this is all speculation but based on your own personal experience with the different types of pods (if any).. which do you prefer as the best choice given the different types out there - Turkish, Dutch Oval, Arizonas, Tasmanian, Giganthemum etc. **?**

^ You'll probably need to take at least twice as much morphine per mg as you do oxycodone (assuming you're taking the morphine orally) to feel good effects. I'm guessing the right dose for someone who takes 60mg oxy would be somewhere around 100-150mg morphine (and still maybe more). BUT don't go and take any amount without a little more research or input from others. Its been a long time since I've taken morphine.

thanks johanneschimpo, You've always had the answers for the few questions I've asked here. 


I decided not to get any. IV seems like the only way to go, and I've never gone down that path.

that's the generaly response, but remember we are a harm reduction site.  people are going to go about it whether they like other peoples opinions or not.  we're here to facilitate in helping them do it the safest way possible, causing the least damage possible.


i don't advocate shooting pills, but i ocassionally IV them myself so it would be hypocritical of me and a lot of other BLers to just shun people down with this kind of question.


as for how to IV this pill i dont know how to.  i'll merge this into the mega  morphine thread.

**Morphine Sulfate?**


Hey guys, today I was given some Morphine Sulfate 15mg pills (#54 on one side of the tablet and #733 on the other half). I was curious to see if these were worth taking recreationally and was curious about what dosage I should start with. I have around 12 of these pills and was wondering if anyone has had experiences with this drug.


help is much appreciated,


thanks

Yes they are worth taking.  


Depends on your opiate tolerance, try one to two of them if you have a low opiate tolerance.

Thanks for the quick response, I appreciate it. As for opiates and tolerance goes, the only thing I have done recently would be rather small doses of Hydrocodone 5mg (Most I've taken was 6 at a time and my tolerance was pretty built up to this point although it's not as much as these 15 mg pills). I'm also taking Wellbutrin XL 300mg daily and couldn't seem to find any reports on the interactions between the two drugs...should I be alright?


Also, should I just chew em up?


Sorry for all of the questions, just wanna be sure.

You should be fine with wellbutrin.  


I would start low with these, if you take four to six of these it will be a lot more intense than four to six 5mg hydrocodones.  


I would just swallow whole, if you want to chew them up you can but I don't think its necessary.


The first time I took morphine sulfate (no opiate tolerance, long before I was using heroin) I tried 30mg and drank a few beers, it was a pretty intense, enjoyable experience.

So I popped 30mg last night and felt quite a comforting buzz with a slight euphoria. After about 30 minutes or so I took another one and I was pretty much good for the night, lol. I found myself spacing out a lot and just feeling very mellow and chill. I enjoyed morphine a lot more than I did hydrocodone, however the morning after is a different story. 


Thanks for the help, Capt.

**Question about opiates!!**


Alright so I just got 8 blue Statex(morphine, 5mg I think), And i was planing on trying them to tomorrow and smoking some pot.

Since I've never tried morphine i was wondering the effects and how they are mixed with pot or alcohol(I want to try some tonight but I drank about 6 beers). I'm pretty experianced with drugs already(MDMA,acid,mushrooms,cocaine,speed,ketamine). So my questions are how many pills should I take, does weed go well with it(obviously it does i just want to hear your opinons), and can i drink alcohol with it(since i'd like to try one tonight)


cheers.

i'd start with around 20mg if you've no opiate tolerance.  morphine has a low oral and intranasal BA and unless you're IVing it is pretty shitty for recreational use imo.  weed mixes with it great, there wont be any bad interactions there, but i would avoid taking alcohol with it your first time because it may cause you to get sick.  even then limiting alcohol consumption on opiates are good idea because of CNS depression.


how are you going to be taking it?

Thanks for the reponse leftwing, I plan on taking them oraly, maybe snorting a line just to try but probably not(unless the high is stronger, from my experiance snorting pills mdma for example is a waste). I will only be picking up weed tomorrow so i'll deffinitly be smoking a joint tomorrow with the pills. 

My main question for now would be, i drank my last beer about a hour and a half ago and have been drinking water since then would it be okay for me to take a pill and relax listen to music or whatever and if so how many should i take?


Thanks for the responses.

again it'd try only 20mg, but you're honestly better off not having any beer in your system so you're fully able to guage the morphine high.  dont expect to be drooling all over yourself the first time either because again the BA for morphine is pretty poor compared to most opiates.  if the pills are extended release you'll probably want to crush them up to defeat that.


good luck

Skip the beer it only fucks up the high and increases respiratory depression. Alcohol does not add to the high at all in my opinion.

**How do you know if you've overdosed?**


This past weekend I took about 150-200 mg of morphine orally over the course of 24 hours, with about a 60mg 'tolerance'.  I didn't sleep for the first 24 hours, but then I passed the FUCK OUT.  I had horrible nightmares and I didn't leave my bed for 48 hours, except for a piss or two and some water.  I wasn't planning on missing work, but the effects of the morphine had me sleeping (and one time puking) through Monday.  Today I managed to make it to work, but I was still nodding, even after literally sleeping all fucking weekend.


My question is this:


How do you know when to call it quits and go to the fucking ER?  What are the obvious signs of Morphine overdose (if there are any outside of sleeping and puking)?

If your friend IV'd "kapanol" for 3 years and has fucked kidneys, I'm sure that's not the only organ that's fucked.  


I'm sure the talc (which is an inactive ingredient in kapanol) is clogged up in his lungs.  


If you IV "kapanol", then I would get 0.2 micron filters to filter out the talc.  If you can't do that, don't IV it because even if the solution is clear (and it's not apparently), the talc will still be there though you cannot see it.

I had horrible nightmares and I didn't leave my bed for 48 hours, except for a piss or two and some water.  I wasn't planning on missing work, but the effects of the morphine had me sleeping (and one time puking) through Monday.  Today I managed to make it to work, but I was still nodding, even after literally sleeping all fucking weekend.

**Morphine Suppository Dosage**


I am curious as to what would be a good recreational dosage when taking Morphine suppositories. I have 12 of them, and they're 20 MG each. I know that since it's a suppository, it'll bypass my liver which usually breaks down a lot of the Morphine. This is why I'm unsure of a proper dosage. Any help is appreciated.

I tried morphs for the first time today.  After iv, within 30 seconds I got a familiar Heroin rush, but then a very strange burning almost pins and needles feeling, VERY intense.  That was fine, but what wasn't fine was for about a minute or two my head felt like it was full of blood, like I was hanging upside down, any idea why?  thanks.

This is called a histamine reaction.  This is common with IV morphine.

**Was this an overdose (morphine)?**


Okay I acquired a morphine sulfate Extended Release 60mg pill (small orange round with boxed "M" and "60" on opposite side).


So I cut the pill in half, took one now-30mg piece and crushed it very thoroughly. Then mixed it with some hot (not boiling-- not burned when touched either) Gatorade for 10 minutes to be sure to defeat the time-release.


I then drank the gatorade about 2 hours after eating a small plate of rigotoni.


After about a half hour later I felt pressure all over the back of my head/upper neck. I wouldn't call it 'pain', just very uncomfortable and awkward pressure in the head. Eventually after an hour this turned into head-nausea (you no what I mean, nausea located in the head not stomach) that almost make me puke.


The weirdest thing is however, is that I didn't fell any of the psychoactive opiate effects of the morphine (but I did get very itchy throughout and drowsy towards the end)... I just didn't get the familiar opiate euphoria or anything that resembles it except the itching.


I am pretty sure I [slightly] overdosed. But why didn't I feel any of the morphine's signature effects (it seems I felt its side-effects only)?

ive never goten a good euphoria off MScontin ive always just goten itchy as fucking hell... and somewhat sedated...


as far as the nausea... because of your dose id gues you dont do opiates much at all... almost every time i start on another opiate bender i get the kind of nausea your talking about... my eyes just dont seem to work right... the room kinda looks a little off... and i end up throwing up every 30 minutes or so.. this generally starts the next day though...


as far as calling this an overdose... *shrug*... does it really matter? why dont we just call it an overdose... so next time maybe you will be a little bit more careful? i mean its not like the rigotoni did this to you... right?

**MSContin difficulty**


Recently I scored a lot of 60mg morphine sulfate extended release pills by Mallinckrodt manufacturer. I have tried it about 3 times, with at least a week between each try. To ingest it each time (except the third), I crushed it up and dissolved into just-below-boiling fruit juice and stirred for at least 5 minutes to ensure the defeat of the time-release wax. I then drank this on an empty stomach.


The first time I took 30mg at once. This was a bad experience. I was hit with head-nausea, and a very uncomfortable feeling of pressure in the back of my head between the ear and the spine on both sides. I was also very itchy, but did not feel any of the familiar opiate euphoria.


The second time I took 15mg. This was disappointing. I was still noticably relaxed, but still had the awkward head-pressure, but this time no nausea. Also I did not itch very much this time, and still felt little to no euphoria.


The third time I snorted about 15mg. This was better than the last two. This time there a little more euphoria, and I had some nice pins-and-needles sensations in my arms, and the head-pressure was minimal.


Is there something about consuming morphine orally that effects one differently than when snorting (in a qualitative way)? The snorting experience was a lot better for me than oral, and I can't understand why because oral has better BA than snorting. Why do you think this happens?


p.s. please don't flame me over my low doses. I am naturally opiate-naiive and I have not developed tolerance ever. thanks

Morphine has a high first pass metabolism which means a lot get destroyed by the liver if you take it orally. Routes that bypass the liver are ideal.


The best way to take those particular pink waxy morphine pills is to booty bump them. Look it up if you dont know.

Dont snort morphine, it's BA is low enough orally. I beleive plugging is the best way that doesn't involve a needle. There is a morphine MEGA thread that will probably answer all of your questions.

The oral route may metabolize morphine into something that is more likely to release histamines, which could explain why you got alot of negative side effects via the oral route. Of course, morphine is well known for its proportionately high histamine release side effects versus other opiates, but I'm not sure if thats due to the morphine itself or some of its metabolites.

i've got approximately 60mg morphine and it'll be my first time trying it.  I have done opiates in the past, but it's been a long time so I'm thinking my tolerance has gone down quite a bit.  Any suggestions as to how much I should take?  And I'm either going to eat it or snort it...plugging and IV is just not for me...so out of the two methods which one do you guys prefer?

Buddy122:


break it in half.  eat one half on empty stomach.  wait one hour.  if you feel fine after then, you may take the other half.  you might throw up the next day if you end up eating both, but you should be fine as long as no other decent amount of OTHER drugs/alcohol are involved.


the only reason to snort morphine is to maybe have it kick in faster, but all you have to do is crush the pill fine into powder by placing it between two objects and crush it collecting the peices and put the powder on something like a playing card (ace of hearts maybe?).  fold the playing card and pour on your tounge and chase it down with water.

This is an interesting concept. Does anybody know the method of morphine's action on histamine? Is the histamine reaction a result of morphine or morphine-byproducts (e.g. from oral metabolism)?


Also, would plugging reduce the histamine reaction. What would be the best way to get around that damn stubborn was matrix (which I assume is necessary for plugging). I assume that dissolving in water is need to plug, but the wax does not dissolve, even in boiling water. How to get around this?

It's a result of the morphine itself, but I'm not sure how to explain it most properly.  I think someone else could better explain it.


Codeine has the worst histamine reaction from what I've heard.

The morphine binds to receptors on the surface of mast cells, which are antibody-containing cells responsible for allergic reactions (and inflammatory reactions in their normal course of duties). In response, the mast cells recognize the morphine as a "foreign object" or an "invader," and release their contents of histamines, which lead to the reaction as the histamines bind histamine receptors. Since morphine and other opiates do not trigger the release of IgE antibodies, however, they do not cause true allergic reactions. Different opiates have different affinities for mast cell receptors, which would account for the widely varying differences in histamine release between opiates/opioids. Since morphine and codeine are so structurally similar, it makes sense that these have histamine reactions similar in strength.

[This paper](http://depts.washington.edu/druginfo/DTT/2006_Vol35_Files/V35N4.pdf) has a great wealth of info on the opiate histamine response. According to this page, morphine and other opiates do not actually bind opiate receptors on the mast cell surface (which is what I thought and what some other sources say), but in fact bind the IgE antibodies studding the surface of the mast cells. But for whatever reason these antibodies are still not release as per a normal allergic reaction, so somehow the mast cells must be able to differentiate between an allergen/foreign body in need of antibody response and a foreign body which causes release of histamine, but not of antibodies.

thank you for your quick response.  so judging by this i'm guessing that 30mg is a good starting point.  i'll definitely just eat the pills then, i dont want to unnecessarily insufflate anything.  thanks.

^ Yes 30mg is a good starting point for oral admin.  I wasn't suggesting insufflating the crushed powder, but I do see why you would be concerned with accidentally insufflating it, if you attempt method I described (which is a method similar to parachuting the morphine).

so it's been roughly two hours and i've done all i had...i feel ok, just ok.  more lightheaded and dizzy than anything.  no nausea.  my arms feel kinda achy though, idk if that has anything to do with it though.  maybe this stuff will blow my mind when some more time passes, we'll see.

Just an update the day after taking it: besides a nice body buzz for about an hour, I had a bad exprience with it. I stayed pretty nauseous the whole time I was on it, ended up throwing up before I fell asleep. This morning I was still sick at work, ended up leaving early. Anyways, I'm guessing opiates just aren't for me. Oh well, chalk it up to experience.

Yeah unlucky Buddy.


I'm the same, tried codeine (3-4 times), poppy tea (once) and oxycodone (6-7 times) and all opiates make me do is feel like I've tried to drink 200 shots of scotch and smoke 19 cigarettes at once. Ugh. The sickness I feel from consuming opiates reminds me of the flu. Why does this happen to some people?


I'm praying I don't need pain management in the future and get a nice IV shot of morphine in the hospital or something. Maybe the sickness and dizzyness would take my mind of the pain though, har har

buddy - to avoid nausea in the future try a small dose of an anti-histamine like diphenhydramine or promethazine.  though those two are sedating which might not sit too well with you.  there are alternative 2nd generation anti-histamines  as well which have no sedation as a side effect.

yeah, that's pretty much exactly how i felt late last night and all day today, it was like a really BAD alcohol hangover...and i was extremely exhausted.

hmm, i will have to look into this.  I'm not opposed to trying more opiates in the future, i just might have to start out with a VERY small dose because I hate feeling the way I did earlier...but I'll remember to try some anti-histamines with it as well.  And the sedation factor shouldnt be a problem as long as I've gotten enough sleep and plan to be awake while on it.  Thanks.

a small dose of 25-50mg of either should suffice.  just dont make the mistake of dosing too much of promethazine because it will cause you to go through a delerious state for a short while.  some people (who probably aren't the full quid in the first place) actually find it enjoyable but it's far from it.  if you wanna trip out use a conventional drug like LSD or DMT etc.

**Morphine Sulfate**


So I got my hands on some morphine, this syringe like thing says "Morphine sulfate injection USP" it says 4mg/mL. I'm deffinitely not going to IV this shit or inject it into my muscles, as a matter of fact it doesn't even have a syringe so I couldn't even if I wanted to. My question is; is there any other way to ingest it or am i just screwed?

Is it in some sort of solid self-contained tube? If so its an auto-injector and it should have some sort of needle inside. If you aren't consuming it that way, you could just break it open and consume the liquid any other way, like swallowing it. However, no [normal, healthy] adult, or kid for that matter, would feel anything from 4mg of morphine.

Thanks for the quick response and welcome guys. I have about 10mg and a bunch of dank, should be feeling nice tonight :D And it's in a thin tube with no syringe or anything, it just has that rubber thing in the end of one side which I believe is where they stick the needle through to to take as much as they need.


I was reading up and I guess 10mg wont do much if I orally ingest it, can I plug it?

Oh ok yeah, when you said 4mg/mL it reminded me of some auto-injectors I've seen but it sounds like you just have a vial. Find a good way to break it open without eating pieces of glass and you're set. Be safe and enjoy.

I hate to say it, but I really doubt you'd feel much of anything from 10 mg, even without a tolerance. You could try plugging it or putting the liquid into a spray bottle and squirting it in your nose, those would help a bit more of the morphine absorb than if you simply drank the liquid. I commend you on your choice not to IV it, but I doubt you'll get too much out of the experience due to the small dose.

So, 10mg (or did you mean 10ml?). Either way, that is not too much for a single oral dose.

If you're patient, your best bet would be to trade this to someone who is comfortable with needles, as sterile, IVable drugs are valuable to those who desire them, so you could trade up for something that will be worthwhile for you, some pills or something like that. Something that could get you high, perhaps even more than once.

How many mL is the vial? If it's 4 mg/mL then you definately should know how much mL it is so you can measure how much you take. If it's a 100mL vial and you have no tolerance then you probably wouldn't want to drink more than 1/8 of the liquid at one time.

^ Oh wow, good catch. That one slipped by me because I kept thinking of these 4mg/mL (1ml total) preloaded syringes I used to see. If its a vial with a rubber seal at the top its most likely 5-10mL. If it was smaller it would probably be a snap-top ampule. 

Well I hope he reads this before plugging it, it may be too late. I hope he knew how many mL he had. Well if he had 1mL he wasn't going to feel a damn thing so maybe he will actually feel it.

**Okay, Okay....so they gel up....**


By now its well documented that  MS-Contins will gel up when introduced to any moisture. Still the gel has to be good for something. Of course I have a selfish interest to this question. I have dozens of Malinkropft 15mg and 60mg MS extended release; And every month I'm prescribed dozens more. I have tried it all short of injecting (with all that junk in the pills, it's just plain STOOPID to attempt it) Now, I must confess to doing something STOOPID myself...I still snort them (the 60mgs anyway). Yes, I know the Biosomething or other is horrible by this ROA but, it still works. I get a buzz and it keeps me from getting sick. So question... Who likes these things? What do you do with them? Make tea? Just swallow? Squirt up the pooper? Chew? Snort? Parachute? What do you use to potentiate? What works best for you and what do you like about them?


Best, Zoot

For a hard core opiate addict that prefers H or Oxy at the least, they never really tickled my fancy...  I have found them to be good for keeping me well...  I have found, also, that they are best plugged or parachuted...  Snorting seemed to create tooooooooo much gel/snot and I swear I'd end up horking it down my throat anyway.

The biosomething (bio availability) of insufflation is horrible compared the oral route. I really don't like the ms contins at all. I have to take at least 150mg+ to get a decent buzz and as far as roa I just take the coating off crush and parachute. As far as potentiation there are a few threads here that cover the topic extensively; tagamet comes to mind just off the top of my head. Anyway, welcome to bluelight hope you can find all the info you're looking for. Save up your morphine pills and turn them into diacetylmorphine lol.

You can snort MS contin with an increased bioavailability (BA) when you combine the morphine with chitosan.  By itself, morphine has a very poor bioavailability.  


Some people would prefer to plug the MS contins, others just eat them.  If you can get chitosan, I would snort them, but not regularly.


Plus, this is a self-serving thread, so I'm going to lock this as you should probably take your medication as prescribed.  Well, instead of locking this, I'm just going to merge it into the Morphine Mega Thread and FAQ because that way you can still talk about morphine sulfate.  IMO 60mg orally with no tolerance = should render you pretty high.

**MS Contin dosing question, please help!**


I have recently detoxed off methadone and now have a basically non-existent opiate tolerance. For example, I can feel a slight buzz off two 7.5mg Vicodin at this point. Is there any chance of overdosing or getting sick from taking a 30mg MS Contin with a tolerance this low? I wouldn't be crushing it, just swallowing the pill. I'm weak from the recent detox and other physical problems and don't want to take any chances.


I appreciate any answers, I have no experience with MS Contin!

I was detoxed 3 months ago off methadone, I take 30mg mscontins for severe internal organ pain. The only thing I noticed was the first night I woke up and had a headache. Btw be very careful, it took me about 3 days before I was just using them like my ol addict self - hope it works out bro. I would recommend taking 15mg and waiting, I mean you can always take some more - have fun trying to take it out after tho! ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

Morphine has a piss poor oral BA like 30% so you will get like 10mg if your lucky into your system, again OP dont get your hopes up thats not a big dose and with past use it wont phase you much IMO.

Cool, honestly at this point I'm pretty much just taking it for pain relief but it would be nice to feel a buzz. Wish I could take 15mg and wait and see, but the pills are 30mg and I don't want to crush them and get it all at once (this time, anyway!).

Despite morphines rather shitty BA i find that it still get's me pretty damn fucking high at the right dose. Seems to work better after awile for some odd reason. With no tolerance you might feel something off a 30mg MScontin but you won't feel much. Becareful you don't become readdicted to opiates because it could easily happen with morphine.

Oral morphine is compared to oral hydrocodone 1:1, meaning that 30mg of hydrocodone = 30mg morphine for analgesia.


30mg of morphine will not produce significant CNS depression of concern or overdose.

Thanks to everyone for the advice. I took 30mg this morning and as predicted it didn't do too much, felt drowsy with a slight opiate buzz. The biggest bummer was that it barely addressed my pain issues. I guess next time I'll try crushing it and swallowing it that way. I'm not used to dealing with time release pills, but from what I'm hearing it sounds like 30mg wouldn't be at all dangerous to take when crushed either, right? I suppose I can always take half and go from there...this whole plugging thing is sounds more and more tempting, though!

oral morphine is completely fucking useless whether its crushed or not.  crush it and snort it.  that's the only way you'll get what you're looking for.  i always shot morphine but i don't recommend that.

The first time I ate a 30mg MS Contin (the only time I had it) I was pretty high for four hours - this was before my heroin use and ORT though.  


We have a morphine mega thread, so I'm going to merge it in there.  


I don't think 30mg morphine orally will be too much for someone without a tolerance - you may want to try half of it, but the whole thing won't be "overwhelming" at all.

On many of those ER morphine pills, the wax matrix can be quite a bear.  With some brands, you can crush them up, mix in water, and you're STILL left with an ER solution!

JC's link did the explaining as to "why" in a scientific way - and from what I can tell, you combine chitosan with the morphine to insuffulate it.  I don't know how easily you can insuffulate a part of a chitosan tablet, and I don't know if there's any easy way to acquire chitosan by itself, or how easy it is to insuffulate it.  


I mostly used heroin, which already gets a 50% intra-nasal BA without any help from anything else.  Maybe some seasoned morphine users could point out some tips for chitosan use for snorting morphine?


I also hate when search engine results from the archive yield a white page - sorry about that.

Snorting has a lower BA then oral unless you combine the morphine with chitosan. Oral morphine will work fine if you take the right dose. Everyone is different because even though i have a pretty big tolerance i like oral morphine over any other opiate except hydromorphone. Actually i prefer it to hydromorphone overall because of the fact that the duration of snorted dilaudid is so fucking short.


 With morphine you can take abunch and nod in and out for hours.

***I get these scripted to, I usually snort them if you don't get them wet they do crush into a nice fine powder. Then snort little lines, It works great, in fact I get just as high snorting them as I do plugging. Trick is just don't get them wet before they get into your nose.

It might be just me and I know how to do it but I also don't get a plugged nose with a lot of gel. 

Also I was on oxy's for 4 years and I'm glad I switched to Morphine. It works a hell of a lot better for pain relief, and that is my ultimate goal..***

***I don't plug OC's, there better just eaten or snorted. And as far as plugging Morphine, I get just as high snorting my Morphine as I do plugging. So I saved my ass and gave up plugging. There was no difference at all, Plus I love snorting.

When I did plug I would crush up the pill, then put the powder into the syringe. Then add a very small amount of water, Then I shook it up real good till it was mixed throughly. Then Plugged it. kicked back and waited for that beautiful Morphine high%).***

I'm glad to see someone recently asked about Oral Morphine. I have been formerly addicted to hydrocodone but currently have a tolerance that 2 10/500 makes me feel the full effects, pinpoint pupils and euphoria warmth etc. I never liked to get really sedated or I guess generally fucked up from opiates, more just to have a positive feeling and slight nod/euphoria. Now I know orally it does not absorb as well but, considering that dose stated above I was considering splitting a Kadian 100 into three and moving up a few mg at a time starting at 30. I know morphine is more sedating than hydrocodone, and I do plan on drinking some caffiene as I usually do anyways, I am hoping that will give me a lift. For the small beads, outside of the capsule are they still time released? I am experienced with prescriptions but not this type of capsule, so I figure either way if I put it into a cup and drink it with gatorade or something it won't matter.

**morphine question..**


say someone who is totally me was Rx'ed avinza (45 mgs) and knowing about the shitty bioav of oral morphine chose to shoot it instead (was nice), but being the addict they are ran out a good 10 days before script can be refilled...i'm right that the kick would be way worse since more of the actual drug was in body in active form? like 45mgs is not 45 mgs depending on how ya did it w/d wise right?

Your question is rather vague, but yes your WD will be worse because you had higher levels of the drug in your system.  


This could have gone many different places, so I'm going to merge it into the Morphine Mega Thread.


No one responded to your thread, so it's not going to fare better outside of the mega thread.

bump - this is simple logic , but I think simply :D - since we know the bio availability of morphine sucks, your body only takes in X amount. Now when you shoot it the absorption is, obviously, terrific! So your body is now used to that amount of absorption and when you come off of it, well, you're coming off of more than if you munched it instead. Please correct if I'm wrong, but this seems to make sense to me. I love any opiate but normally it's just good ol H / OC  / hydromorph for me, so not much first hand experience on this one.

**been lurque'ing for awhile now**


well, i've been lurking this site [and this thread in particular] for awhile now, thought i'd finally get registered and get in on all this...


i guess you could say i have a small opiate tolerance, w/ vikes only for the most part up until a few months ago. what was typical was 2-3 vikes, a drink, and i'd be good to go. til i read up on the dangers of liver toxicity from mixing w/ alcohol... so i cut that element.


 a friend of mine stumbled upon some 100 mg kadian and started sharing the wealth. here's how they've gone: 


1st try: opened cap, poured half of the beads into some applesauce, 30 mins fell fast asleep and that was the end of that.


2nd try: opened cap, poured all beads into applesauce, chomped em up w/ front teeth (didn't wanna get them all ground up in my molars -gross), didn't feel much for about 4-5 hrs, fell asleep, woke up and was all out of it. wouldn't say necessarily "euphoria," but felt floaty, kinda like how i feel on 2-3 vikes. 


3rd try: wasn't planning on taking anything. was in parking lot for a club, had had a couple drinks, friend offered a 100 mg kadian again, popped it w/out thinking. felt hammered in club, didn't think about dangers of mixing morph& alcohol, had maybe 2 more drinks inside. came home, felt fine, passed out around 3am. next morning, waking up to throw up - totally uncontrollable; i've never gotten so sick in my life. fell asleep in a cold& hot sweat, alternating every 5 mins. woke up again every 20-40 mins just to throw up. nothing to throw up, but still getting violently sick. fell asleep for an hour or two, drank sips of water, threw them up minutes later. this business went on LITERALLY until darkness fell, so i'd say 9am-7pm. finally was able to get to bathroom to wash up. had terrible nightmares the whole time (and i hardly EVER recall any dreams, ever). freaked myself out - was this withdrawing? od'ing? how do you know when to head out to the ER? i've never felt my body trip out like that. my gf had the same effects, and she has a much lower tolerance (she'll only take 1/2 the 100 mg kadian, and then she doesn't feel it - takes a whole one, and she throws up a couple hours later and feels like crap). 


4th or 5th time: floaty, more euphoric for sure, upped dosage to 1 dumped into an applesauce then half of another an hour later in the applesauce. 


lately: NOT mixing with alcohol or anything, for that matter. spooked myself into thinking i nearly od'd that night when all we could do was throw up and sleep the next day "/ just done 1.5 or so, don't wanna push the envelope and get myself sick and all that... 


am i missing out by jus taking the 100 mg kadian orally? reading about ppl plugging it, but ugh idk bout all that... is it that much of a difference? i guess i should add that i'm about 115 lbs, and the gf is about 105 lbs, so maybe that's relevant. sorry this is a long winded post - like i said, i've been lurking here for awhile w/ tons of questions/comments, so this is like a summation of everything i suppose. 


any advice, comments, whatever is welcome. 


thanks,

jus another newB

good idea to take a break. Kadian is a interesting drug in the way its extended release mechanism works. go to the kadian website to learn more there is a video that is fascinating on it. 


Any how kadian 100mg is strong to start with for people with low tolerance. Since you took it orally it goes into the stgomach and begins releasing morphine slowly overtime based on where it is in the digestive process. It is designed to release 100 mg over about 12 hrs. However alchohol has a very bad effect on the mechanism as it speeds up the release of the morphine from those plastic balls and you begin to absorb more morphine than intended at 1 time. Also when you combine this with the effects the alcohol will have on you this is a bad situation as any cns depressants mixed with opiates can lead to death. 


morphine has a tendency to cause more intestinal side effects thans say oxycodone does and as such this is most likely the reason for the nausea and vomiting you experienced. Also the rapid rate of absorption of the morphine will cause this also and mixing morphine with alcohol. All in all be lucky this did not happen in the club as you would have been kicked out and cops or abulance called!! I personally dont like to mess around with Kadian as a recreational if I did I would be in heaven as I have a shit tonne(for me only-sorry). Unless you want to chemically dissolve the polymer coating the morphine is encased in and then wheel that and shoot it up Kadian is nor a great rec drug unless you use it orally at levels you are tolerated to.

-What form(s) does PMS-Morphine Sulfate SR come in?


60 mg

Each orange, round, sustained-release, film-coated, biconvex tablet, imprinted with "P" logo on one side and "60 mg" on the other side, contains morphine sulfate 60 mg. Nonmedicinal ingredients: cetostearyl alcohol, D&C Yellow No.10 Aluminum Lake, FD&C Yellow No.6 Aluminum Lake, FD&C Red No.3 Aluminum Lake, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, lactose, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol, talc and titanium dioxide.

-


So this crap contains talc, which I know is the worse thing one can inject right ? Like the people who inject ritalin often end up with talcosis iirc.


I have good filters but i have no idea if the talc will follow through it anyways, so i'm asking for confirmation about this orange thing that DOES NOT gel-up once put in water, but i just ended eating the liquid, I had read about the fillers before, just wanted to see if they gelled up like MS-Contins....


Well, those things seems like hopeless to IV. They do not gel-up, but I played with fire using the simple filters given with the injection kits here in canada inside the Stericup. I a small pain in my lungs for 5 mins after injecting half of these 60mg. I don't understand how i could crush the beads of M-Eslons 15mg without any ill effects but not with these generic ms contins. Never doing it again, it has to be talc. Only things I had injected before were Abbot brand Dilaudids, PMS- hydromorphone and MSIR 10mg. All those things did not contain talc.

Fuck those filters they gave you thats more designed for H not pills. Please IF YOU SLAM PILLS>>>>>>>> WHEEL THEM FIRST. I cannot tell you how important this is. 


You can buy REAL filters designed for pharmaceuticals that filter on the micron level. This is the only way to shoot pills and not do real damage. If you use the Search Engine you will find alot of discussion on filtering many diff types of pills and where to get the filters.

hello everyone,

I am wondering if anyone knows if the 60mg morphine extended release pill by watson (ABG 60 orange) will gel up with contact with water? i want to plug or possibly IV this pill if i can get micron filters but dont want to waste it if it will gel.

im not sure on the ABG, but if theyre like most other morphine pills they're likely to gel.  i would recommend plugging it.

it is still morphine so it should work as the problem with IV'ing pills is the gel blocking your veins. but i've never plugged anything so im not 100%

yes they will, you have to do this, pay attention, take the outer layer off by sticking in your mouth and then wiping the rest off with a napkin, then crush very good until its a fine powder, then take the powder and put in a big spoon, and this is THE IMPORTANT PART, take a lighter and put the flame to the bottom of the spoon FOR 15 SECONDS ONLY, this will seperate the morphine from the wax, REMEMBER do not add water yet only heat up the crushed powder, then after you have heated it the powder will be kinda sticky/waxy, then take the powder and put it in a big spoon or a shot glass and add 150 ml of COLD water, then your gonna wanna mix the hell out of it for 30-45 seconds, after you have done that let it sit in the water for an additional minute, then you take a cotton and throw it in and pull it up, you may have to add a lil extra water to get a full rig, you should have atleast 80-100cc. then YA BANG IT AND GET THEM PINS N NEEDLES!!! REMEMBER DO NOT HEAT THE PILLS IN WATER YOU WILL COMPLETLEY FUCK UP THE MATRIX AND U WILL HAVE TO SHOOT WAX AND THATS A BAD THING. ENJOY, lemme know how it works, I have tried every single method and this one works better than all of them out of 60mg you will get 50-55mg out of it which is pretty good! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

**Morphine Tablets 90MG**


I have access to a number of 90MG and 30MG morphine tabs by MS CONTIN...whats the best thing to do with them?


Snort, pop, shoot?!?


I don't want to waste them or take too much.


What is a good starter dose?!?


I have a high tolerance for opiates...

As we all know, pills are horrible to shoot.  Don't do that.  Snorting morphine does next to nothing, really low BA (around 10% if i remember correctly). Oral is your best bet with these unless you want to plug them (although i realize that's not for everyone...)


Honestly I can't tell you doses as I do not know your tolerance.  Just start low and work your way up I suppose


EDIT:  also, although I know little about the topic, i have heard these are among the worst pills to try to shoot as well i guess they're a pretty dirty shot, as if shooting pills wasn't bad enough.

if you dont IV, then plugging is your best bet.


what is a high tolerance to opiates?  we cant give you an estimate without knowing that.


also, mscontins dont come in 90mg, well not in australia anyway - i just double checked MIMS.  there are 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 100 and 200's.  are you sure theyre not a generic?  


anyway ill merge this into the morphine thread

**Sublingual MS Contin**


Do you think this is a good way to take this? If you chew it up and let it sit under your tongue, it stays there for a long time without dissolving and getting swallowed. The only thing is that it makes me really sleepy.

Sublingual bypasses the liver for one thing. It has poor absorption either way.

It doesnt really give me the rush that I get with sublingual oxycodone, but it does give me one hell of a nod. Maybe this is the answer to my opiate insomnia. Whenever I try sublingual MS Contin (Chewed up but kept under tongue) I fall asleep.

30mg Morphine might be a good starting dose for you I think. You can always increase the dosage. 


Is this time release or IR?

thats pretty interesting.  i may just give it a go, everything is indicating pretty good results, well i think so anyway.  i should mention that while it is thought that morphine can be efficient via the SL route for break through pain (specifically cancer, going on most reports i read) there is not a lot of pharmacological data supporting the theory.  there is also only a limited amount of clinical data surrounding SL morphine.  


were you using IR formulas or ERs crushed up?  ive never heard of a SL version being prescribed before.

that seems to have me thinking crushing up some MsContins i am scripted for breakthrough pain is worth a shot.


what sort of tolerance do you have?  any idea on a dose you would use to ease your pain threshold?

ah, whats your tolerance to opiates in general like?  can you give us a comparison?  morphine doesnt have a great oral BA, but 100mg isnt exactly a small to dose by any measurement.

sorry man, missed this earlier.  i get the mundipharma mscontins here in australia and while you can have problems with them gelling up (leaving in solution to long, not enough water in mix, adding heat, etc) i dont have a problem prepping them for IV or plugging solutions.  with plugging youre usually using a few mLs of water minimal and even with a couple of pills (say 4-5mL) this is plenty.  im not sure on the Purdue brand MsC's though so i cant say for sure.


i would use them orally > snorting but plugging > oral and ultimately IV > plugging.


with that tolerance to be safe i would begin with a starting dose of 30-40mg and work your way up from there.

I have been using MS Contin. Under the tongue seems to work pretty good, especially when you combine it with oxycodone. 


With most IR drugs, they break apart and you swallow them before they have time to absorb. With the MS contin chewed up, it just stays there like candy with the texture of rice that wont dissolve, so it increases the duration of sublingual contact.


I imagine that the effects might be slightly different. when morphine enters the liver it is metabolized into various other opiods, but sublingual bypasses the liver but still lacks the instant rush or BA of IV morphine.


How does morphine interact with Dilaudid? I have some Dilaudid I would like to use before my tolerance is gone. I am a legitimate pain patient btw and dont want to ruin my tolerance too quickly or else I will be regretting it, but I do like to have a little euphoria in my life once in a while. I have heard mixed reports about Dilaudid being bad if you mix it with oxycodone, lowering seizure threshold and all that, but what if I just use the morphine for 12 hours until the oxycodones half life is over and then try 4mg of dilaudid with 15-30mg of MS Contin still in my system?

It looks like there is some debate about the absorption of sublingual morphine....it certainly does not seem to be a rapid onset. I dont know if IR morphine would absorb much better sublingually. It seems to have pretty slow sublingual absorption, and yet I suspect it does absorb and with the time release MS Contin this slow absorption does add to the total absorption if you are willing to spend 20 minutes or longer sucking on one.


Its probably not ideal for a rapid alternative to GI administration for breakthrough pain, but it seems to help it go a little farther if you are looking for moderate duration and like to nod.

**First time**


I usually use oxycontin and oxycontin only. Bad news...my hooks all unreachable. I've come across some morphine tabs. Bad news, they are only 15mg...I'm on a steady diet of 2-80mg of oc daily. I'm thinking the only way these 15mg morphine tabs are gonna help me out is by IV. Any ideas? I've never shot anything before, I'm nervous..think I can get past it. Just wanted some feedback...is snorting it worth it or should I go IV?

Well since theres no sense in snorting morphine due to it's lower intranasal BA compared to oral the only other ways worth taking it are by plugging it and injecting it. Injecting pills is VERY dangerous by the way but injecting most morphine pills especially MScontins is fucking suicidal. Or atleast a bad idea unless you want to lose a arm ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif) .


 Now purdue name brand MS IR's gell up just like the various brands of MScontin that much i know and they go all the way up to 30mg's too. They make 30mg morphine sulphate SR's (various generic MScontins) and without a better idea of what the damn thing is i can't tell you if it's going to gell.


 Do you know if they are SR's or IR's? If you know the type and brand of the pill you can get the product monograph and see if there is any inactive ingrediants that would make it gell.

I would have to disagree with you about the whole suicidal, losing an arm thing.  If you know how to IV properly you wont have any problems.  I have literally shot up morphine a good 50 times and never had any problems.

Most morphine gels up, the only way i found to get past this is to get the water to boiling in the spoon and then add the morphine powder while still boiling.  then throw in a cotton and filter.

Yeah, the hysteria over banging MST's is a bit over the top a lot of the time.


If you know what your doing then its very easy to get rid of the gunk.


If you have a load of MST's, then all you need is a homemade buchner filter and drain-unblocker (sodium hydroxide) - and you can have yourself pure morphine sulphate in less than an hour.


Countries like NZ have a huge MST scene, as there is no smack available. They had these pills well and truely sussed decades ago.

**Novopharm morphine sulfate SR**


Rather then make a new thread i thought id jack this one ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


This is the first time ive gotten or even seen this brand of mscontin. One thing i noticed about the non medical ingrediants is that they seem not as bad as say ratiopharm ones. They also have much less non medical shit in them.


 I have the 60mg ones and was wondering if they would be at all safe to inject with a micron filter or even filtered very good through cotton.


 The non medical ingredients are: Colloidal Silicon Dioxide, Hydroxypropyl

Methylcellulose, Lactose Monohydrate, Magnesium Stearate and Stearic Acid.


 The coating of the 60's which will be removed of course contains: Opadry II Orange 85F13953

Polyvinyl Alcohol - Partially Hydrolyzed

Polyethylene Glycol 3350

Talc

Titanium Dioxide

FD&C Yellow #6/Sunset Yellow FCF Aluminum Lake

FD&C Red #40/Allura Red AC Aluminum Lake. All that shit will be scraped off though if i do decide to bang them.


 Since i have never IVed morphine (only dilaudid) i was wondering if it was safe at all with these pills. I know they arent as safe as name brand dilaudid not by a long shot but how bad would it be to inject a few of them?


 Any info especially someone who's had this brand before would be much apreciated.

I had some 100 mg morphine pills that gelled up.  I simply used extra water and tried to mix as little as possible. The more i mixed, the more it gelled. I would take a cotton and squeeze it into the solution, hold the cotton down and suck up.  You have to be patient as it bubbles, but it sucks up eventually.  If it doesn't, add a little more water.  You're probably going to have to change cottons too.  Just be sure to scrape all the gell off it first.    Whatever is left I eat, or you could plug it.    

Inject slow though, that much morphine at once is almost a painful rush, even w/ a tolerance.  

I never did try to do an alcohol extraction, so that might be a better route.  But, I don't know.

No smack in NZ, how horrible.  You guys are so close to the South Pacific too.

If they're purple then yes, they do.


I think IR only comes in 10mg (blue) and 25mg (not sure of colour...never had), however I'm not 100% sure.


The slow release morphine are the most commonly  seen as nobody with a habit wants them other than as a last resort.

 The MS IR's come in 5, 10, 20 and 30 i think. Ive only had the 10's and 30's myself and they are both white. These are the purdue ones which seem to be the only fucking kind available here. 


 I like MScontins personally and they are great for my chronic pain and to keep me from getting sick. It's not like dilaudid where im always thinking about my next shot or snorting a line it's just take some in the morning before i eat of course and some 10-12 hours later.


I want to IV some morphine myself because id like to get a post rush high and you don't get that with dilaudid. It's just all about the rush with dillys. I bet mixing hydromorphone and morphine in one shot would be fantastic ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) .


 I would like to know if those novopharm brand morphine sulfate SR pills are reasonable to inject. Ive only gotten injections of morphine from a doctor before and the most ive ever gotten is 15mg's in one shot. It helped my pain and with the anti-nausea drug i stopped puking but other then some drowsiness i never felt much from it except relief. A 60mg pill IV would be a damn nice shot ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) .

**Newbie here..... any help appreciated**


I just got some 15mg morphine sulfate IR tabs... my tolerance to opiates isn't very high.  i don't usually take more than 20mg of hydro or oxy.  


so i started carefully with the MSIR, and took one 15mg tab to start.  felt nothing.  how many should i take at next dose to feel great?

first off, how did you dose?  orally?  if so morphine has an extremely low BA (~30%), so i would assume it to be safe to double that since hydro has a high oral BA and 20mg gets you nice.


look up an opiate equivalency chart, they can be of a good guide, even though they're relative to therapeutic doses.

well, normally i would have just taken it orally.... but after reading several threads about its low BA, and my HELL NO stance to anything intranasal, i decided to route the back end ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)  my 1st time doing so, so not sure if i did everything right.... but it's been over 30 min and still nothing  ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)  i think i'm starting to dislike ole morphine.  lol.  but perhaps i just need more mg.

oh yeah what kind of morphine do you have? the IR's or ER's? i had the instant release. if you have the ER's i think you might possibly need more morphine.

**MSIR Vs MSSR**


Hey,


It 's easy to prep 12 hour MS  caps, just dump beads into spoon and melt which leaves a low volume of clear solution, and a little wax from the beads coatings-which is easily removed.


Whats the best deal with the 10@20mg MSIR tabs? there easy to crush, and remove the thin film coating, but that leaves prolly 180-190mg of excipients and only 10-20mg MS. whats the best way of getting to the MS?


Thanks

to anyone who has problems with the ENDO 100mg MSER tablets, the green/blue ones.. i found the best way to break them down. i usually put one whole tab into a spoon, add around 1.5cc sterile water, heat until it just starts to lightly boil, then use the plunger end of rig to crush up pill, and before the wax surrounds the crushed pill, you can draw up at least 60-80mgs (estimate) before it turns all into wax. i know its not the safest, but hey, it worked for me.

^heating it is only further trapping the morphine in the wax matrix and allowing more of the binders/fillers solute into the end solution.

Okay,,, quick question: Can you still plug them if they gel? If you can foreseeably get the gel up there, that is? Or really, can you just get the coating off and "put a pill up there"..? I mean, it will dissolve eventually into gel, right? Is this still effective? Just curious, have a bunch of the jelly ones, and they do nothing orally, and nobody like jello snot, right?

Love y'all,

**200mg Ms Contin IV**


Well I know you shouldn't IV pills but hey some people do right. Im familiar I was just wondering if the following inactive may cause extra damage namely the bold ones:


hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose 	 	 

lactose mono hydrate 		 

magnesium stearate 		 

polyethylene glycol 	 

**silicone dioxide** 

**titanium dioxide** 

**triacetine** 

FD&C blue #1 	 	 

D&C yellow #10 lake 		 


Now I assume the silicone is the "wax" that the morphine is trapped in.


Also is the cold cook method still the best way to bag MS Contins?

The pills are grey so this makes sense right?


triacetine seems to be a plasticizer so maybe thats the wax?

Magnesium stearate is not good, but it's also not very water soluble.  


I have no experience with injecting morphine (heroin yes, morphine pills no), so I am sorry I won't be of too much service here.

Soap scum in my veins?  


It says no water soluable BUT maybe a simple cotton filter might put a layer of protection?

MScontinns can be a pain-they gel up and all. Thoes 12 hour caps with beads are better, the beads melt and the wax on them can be removed, and filtered more cleanly.

**Few opiate IV questions**


Ok I just have a few questions about opiates. Please only people with true experiance/ valid info respond. First let me start out by saying that where I am from Oxycontin, Roxis (30mg percocet), and Morphine are pretty relatively avaliable. I have been doing Roxis and Oxys for a while now and can tolerate quite a bit.


My question is mainly projected toward morphine. I have acess to 100 mg boxed "M" "Gray Ghost" morphines. My buddy attempted to shoot one recently and he told me that he got very little usuable liquid from it and it geled up. After a little research I found out that it is because they are Morphine Sulfate Extended Release tablet (MS Contin). Now I know that there is a chemical formula for extracting the morphine but im NOT interested in that method. 

I have heard that if you just dissolve the pill in a spoon, let it sit for 5+ minutes, put solution into barrel (with a piece of cotton in the bottom), push the solution through the barrel, repeat process, and then put final filtered solution into a clean syringe it is ok for IV use. I KNOW that there is NO safe way to shoot pills, especially MS contin (so please DO NOT LECTURE ME I know enough about drugs to realize the risk), but I have a heck of a tolerance and the roxis/oxys are getting too expensive. I've heard Morphine is just as good to IV and it is quite a bit cheaper mg for mg. Sooo....

1) Does the cold water extraction work well enough to make a MS Contin solution that can be shot ?

2) Morphine are cheaper (but this isn't a price thread so lets not get started there) mg for mg than roxis and oxys, but is the high just as good mg for mg ? 


Informative, knowledgable, and worthwhile post only please.

you don't ever want to add heat to any pill when you're prepping for IV.  if you've got the patience with the beads, split them open and meticulously empty the morphine out of them![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)


use micron filters!

When injected, morphine and oxycodone are probably equipotent in terms of recreational dosing.  


I have only tried IVing oxycontin once, and I never injected morphine (outside of partially hydrolyzed heroin).  So I don't want to tell you if your process on preparing MS contins for IV is viable or not.  


However, there's probably an easier way to prepare them which would allow you to save more of the active ingredient.  Take a look inside of my [micron filtering mega thread](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=481622).


Eventually this thread will be merged into the morphine mega thread.

If one was generally into IVing and had a choice of the following:


MST CONTINUS (Manufactured by AGP) : Content: Morphine Sulphate : Tablets 30mg 


MAGNUS MR (Manufactured by AGP) : Content: Morphine Sulphate : Capsule 30mg


Which would be the better option?

I have the 200mg endo morphines. They look like vitamins. Say E followed by 3 undetectable numbers on one side and 200 on the other side. I broke one and half and added water to it and cooked it and got a decent rush (100mg probably less) what is the exact best method for these pills? I have been searching all day lol


IV use only , I know the dangers etc etc.. Thanks guys!

I'm a mostly responsible narcotic use, never IV anything etc...I have a disc herniation, along with a few bulges, and lifelong stuff like AS, DDD, scoliosis, I've spent the last 10 or so years dealing with daily pain...since this acute injury that has caused intolerable pain, I've been bounced from doc to doc to doc for 2 months with each one writing me a few days prescription, and sending me away.  I've spent thousands of dollars.  I FINALLY saw a PM doc for first time today, and after being on oxycodone IR for a month, and Norco for 2 before , with them both working great for me (i told him this as he asked) and he gave me Embeda.  This shit scares the hell outta me from what i've read.  i'm thinking of calling him tomorrow and telling him i won't take them and he can have em back...it does NOTHING for my pain...i'm just nauseous and feel lethargic, have a headache etc.  i don't know if it's the dose or what (never taken morphine before) but this sucks.  Any advice for my situation/how to get the doc to just put me on what i've been taking?  also...if ya don't mind sharing how to get rid of the naloxone, i would be eternally grateful (i'm very inexperienced at this kinda stuff FYI, but after hours online, this is the only thing i've found that could possibly help me/figure out why this is doing nothing for my pain and making me feel like shit.  sorry for any nOOb faux pas...PM me if you think you can help/have been in my situation.

Whats the dose? Your taking the pill orally right? I've never heard of a opiate type drug with naloxone in, apart from suboxone, i dont know why they would put it in. But I would guess the naloxone is inactive anyway, so perhaps you just don't react well to morphine.


Tell your doctor about the symptoms and you know it is the drug causing it and he should move you onto something else. Call him right away.


EDIT: just seen its got Naltrexone in it, not naloxone.

I have been telling them since last thursday...it's not tuesday...giving me the run around...i'm on 30mg twice a day...i'll admit...just because they basically felt like sugar pills...i took 3 (90mg) and same thing....nothing...is it common for people to just not react well to things that end in morphone instead of codone?  i mean, this is supposed to be a strong pain killer, but does everything but even touch the pain at all!? id be happier with a few percs a day if that was my choice.  i was on 20 mg of oxy/hydrocodone ir (switching) every 4-6 hrs and that was working fine, and i saw a new doctor, i think he just took one look at me and decided i was a junkie and could not be in pain (young, tats etc) when i had 10+ years of records with me.  i had to call my PCP to intervene or get me seen by a new doc in the clinic/vouch for me or something...i only see this as a limited treatment until my body heals enough to the point its tolerable as it has been for the last 10 years without narcotics.  

90mgs of it...and i did not get a single sensation in any way that i had taken an opiod.  ![:!](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/argh.gif) i'm hurting and these fucks seem intent on making me wait another few weeks again before MAYBE giving me something else.


UPDATE: I have another appointment with this guy at 8am tomorrow (next option was over a week...wow...so much for them giving a shit...) I'm going to bring those pills and tell him to shove them (not literally).  I suppose its worth giving it another shot/the earliest i will get in with any doc . Anyway, i was wondering if anyone had some insight as to how to approach this guy who seems to think there is "no reason" i need to be on "these drugs" (referring to the oxycodone ir and norco i had used previously with great results! and he gives me morphine that costs my insurance 400$....)  He also said he will only give me "narcotics" for 2 months...then i'm done as he does not believe my injury coupled with multiple conditions could not possibly hurt past that.  i obviously need to straddle a line of playing stupid and knowing what i've researched (which is by no means unreasonable?) just looking for any help i can get! I don't feel like things  got off on the right foot with this guy and we need to get past assumptions and develop an honest rapport.  hopefully this guy is welcome to giving this another shot from a different standpoint.   Thanks guys!

hey guys


I was wondering the same question as someone else posted earlier


these pills have rph on one side and either 30 or 60 on the other, they are oval/eliptical, the 30s are purple and the 60s are orange/red, they have a coating that to time release pressed, are these indeed morphine for sure, they are old and i believe they are, however their potency is greatly reduced


these are canadian btw

so, if a buddy has a daily dose of 360 mg of oxycodone,oral, the equivalent would be somewhere near 500mg morphine, oral as well, to achieve similar effects? Seems like a stretch

^ Morphine does have a shitty bioavailability. I would take it easy though just to be careful.


ETA: Also, like the narcotics converter warns you, you need to take into account incomplete cross-tolerance which on that calculator says is usually 25-75%. Maybe google can shed some light on incomplete tolerance between oxycodone and morphine.

Getting some 50mg kapanols - plan to IV and need some dosage advice. Am not a regular opiate\opiod user but seem to require higher doses than most friends without tolerance.


Last time I did morph I did 300mg rectal and was very disappointed. Barely a nod with an awful hangover the whole next day. I know some people who say they'd rather take codeine than eat morph, but love the stuff IV.


With this in mind would I right to bang 50mg or do people recommend less??? I don't want go to the effort of filtering a shot properly with micron filters just to end up getting teased - in other words I want to be well wasted but obviously would like to keep breathing.


Also would eating a phenergan beforehand lessen the histamine reaction???

^^Yeah... but its a very controlled chemical and the prospect of engaging in activities that pose serious legal consequences isn't desirable to many people including me.

Yes and no. I tried morphine properly for the first time today in the form of Sevredol 50mgs. IV'd 2 of them and it was a lot better than I expected. Same sort of rush, but I don't feel like I've just had heroin, can't put my finger on it, but something just isn't quite as good.

Sweet thread, 


I only got bout halfway through so far, but haven't seen mention of Chitosan for intranasal potentiation.


If you can isolate morphine from your pills (CWE), and combine your nasal dose with this substance Chitosan it increase bioavailability by something like double.


This might have been mentioned already but if not yeah, look it up... Chitosan ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Re Ext Release Morphine: Would This Approach Do Any Good ?


I have other medications in capsule form that you can easily  open them up by just pulling or screwing the capsule open.  Once this is done I could take the powder form of whatever medication is in it out.  If I then crush the ER morphine tablet into fine powder and then put it into the now empty pill capsule and swallow.  Once the capsule is dissolved it would release al off the crushed ER morphine tablet.   Does anyone think this will do any good?

thanks guys.  realize I will be devastated if not adding heat gives me nothing.  Ive only got 12 of these and I've gone through 4 already.  I'm thinking if I get 100 of them, I could possibly make them last longer if I could get by on 8 a day.

if they're not suitable for a safe IV preperation you can always use them rectally, the next most efficient way (apart from IM).


but since you're using them for pain management i urge you to use them the way they're meant to be - swallowed.  


i'll merge this into the morphine mega thread where i think there may be some talk of this particular brand.

I promise you 100% adding heat is doing you no good


it is far more likely to HARM your dose than it is to help it.. this is for 2 reasons.


1- Heat kills morphine.. too much can kill your dose


2- the heat is cooking out all the nasty binders and fillers and making them smaller... hence less of them being filtered out and more of them in your veins.


Morphine is very soluable.. as are most opiate pain killers.  Therefor heat is not needed, it does absolutely nothing for you, and carries risks with it as well

thanks again for the info guys.


it worked, did a 60mg shot, no heat and got a good rush. still water and gunk in the spoon. do you think if the water left in the spoon evaporates the morphine goes with it, or could I add more water to the dried up pill in the spoon and get more out of it?

you could try adding some water and refiltering.. or just eat whats in the spoon


chances are that you got almost all of the morphine out tho-- it is water soluable wheras the fillers arent... that is mostly what is left behind.

I agree I wouldnt take your pills orally.. all I was saying is if there is residue left in the spoon after shooting (not enough for another shot) you could eat it just so its not going down the sink.


Glad it worked out for you though.. good luck

I was wondering if anyone knows the difference in doses needed between IV morphine and anal morphine.  I just got a full months script of the 15's, and rigs are hard to come by here and mine is getting dull so I'm thinking I'm gonna have to ass these pills and want to know if I do the same 60mg dose I would IV or do I have to do more to reach the same effects. 


just to let everyone know I generally do 60mg shots of morphine, so I'm looking for the same feeling but I'm gonna have to start hooping them or whatever its called.

Hello, i am new to bluelight and i have a question. I recently got some roxane 30mg Morphine IR's(white ones) and i read this to choose the ROA that would be best as of now. I decided i wanted to plug these , problem is i have no syringe. So what i was wondering is if i just plugged the pill as is would it give me an effect at all? I mean it had to dissolve at some time, wouldn't it give me a high? If there are any more methods of plugging without involving a syringe i'd like to hear them. Thanks in advance :]

you should be able to get an oral syringe no problems from walgreens.  I think they're even free, if not they can't be more than a quarter (cause thats what I pay for rigs with needles).

**ABG morphine prep guide**


Lately the ABG ER morphine pills are the only pills I have been able to get on a regular basis. I have read a few IV prep guides here and there but always founds something a bit off about them. My guide, if followed, works without fail using only a 1cc insulin syringe, ice cubes, a spoon, saline solution (little bit of salt+water..), and cotton/filter wheel.


Disclaimer: Shooting pills is ALWAYS a dumb ass idea, no matter what. If you have yet to try it - keep it that way. 


First you remove the coating off the pill(s). After they have been rendered nude put them someplace where they can dry a bit. Once dry, crush them directly in your spoon and then use something (plunger rod from an old rig works great)to further break up the large clumps. Now, place 4-8 ice cubs in a cup, add a dash of salt, and fill with water till the cubes are barely floating. I usually do this step first to save time. You need VERY cold water for this to work right. Once the water is cooled place your rig in the water and draw up a full 1cc and let the rig sit, submerged in the water, for 30-40 seconds to further remove heat. Take the now freezing cold water and introduce it to the crushed up pill debris. Stir and 'poke' the clumps for 15-30 seconds until it looks like all the water has penetrated the powder and you are left with a slightly cloudy solution sitting in the spoon. Once you are this point there is 2 things you can do: 1. place spoon in the fridge for 10min or 2. hold an icecube on the bottom of the spoon to keep the solution cold for 10 min. After the 10 min, stir again, and draw the solution through a filter/cotton and into your rig. IF you did it right, meaning it never got above 40f in the solution, you should have a perfectly clear liquid in your rig that has almost all the morphine dissolved in it. You can figure out what to do from here......


A further few disclaimers about this guide:


1. Morphine is Highly soluble in cold water.

2. Cold water stops the gelling agent

3. waiting the 10 min is key because it give the morphine time to migrate from the pill matrix to the water

4. I use saline solution because salt lowers the freezing point of water, allowing temps to drop further down.

5. I typically use 3-60mg ABG's per shot, per rig. I find adding 1.5cc of water to the spoon to be ideal as I recover 1cc and the other .5 is locked in the goop.

6. you can repeat the process on the goop and get a second, but weaker shot. A 3rd go round is pointless.


have fun guys/gals

about plugging tablet, when you just want to redose with an MS IR why do you crush it ? Can't you put it directly into your arse ? 


or does it hit harder when crushed ?


because I already try that and it' worked like a charm. but if it hit harder when crushed I'll buy a needless syringe.

I heard you can heat pills if you keep it below 70C. There is a sweet spot where the wax melts but the morphine wont dissolve.

I have little blue 15mg morphine sulfates


I'm going to plug them but not use a syringe..


Should I take the coating off before I do it?  Should I crush it up or will it work whole?


And are these a good combo with Valium?


Thanks BL

I'm so confused about the biaA % of railing IR Morphine pills in comparison to oral ROA.


A lot of people have said intra-nasal ROA of Morphine is a waste, esp when its M-sulfate and not M-HCL which is absorbed much better when railing.  


I think it all depends on the individual; I feel 20mg (IR) Morphine intra-nasal ROA to hit harder and longer than taking 20mg Oral ROA.  Does wonders for my pain mngt as well.  


Anyone else experience this? thx

For me when Oral use seems a bit more potent than Intranasal, but try PLUG IT up your arse ! First time I did that I was a bit desperate but It worked fucking well and much better than Oral !

Who here has tried multiple forms of time release morphine? Without crushing them or trying to defeat the time release?


How would you compare them?

Just wanted to post a new (and better) way of snorting Mscontin or regular morphine that I just recently found.


First with mscontin you need to crush them up and then dissolve in warm water in a spoon ( it will turn into a waxy ball of goo in the water).


Then you have to heat it but dont let it boil, and once you see the whitish foam start to come off the wax start moving the pieces apart with a paperclip (try to break it up a little) and once you've done that move the waxy pieces to the sides of the spoon.


Then you suck up the liquid with a eyedropper or oral syring and squirt it up your nose, since the morphine is in very warm water it will be more water solubule (sorry for bad spelling) and you will get a much better high then you would just snorting the powder trust me.


Then if you want you can also eat the wax thats left on the spoon, it will taste like regular wax since all of the morphine has been taken out of it.


And if its just IR morphine just dissolve in warm/hot water and squirt it up your nose, you get a really nice rush from it and im almost positive you get more than 30% bioavailability.


Have fun :D

After I do a shot of the IR morphine I save whats left over in a little medicine cup. I get the 30mg IR morphines. If you put together like 4 or 5 of the left over shots and do it up like you would a regular shot you do get somewhat of a rush. Not as strong as a regular shot but it works if you have no pills left. So I always save my scraps bc yes there is still some morphine left in the stuff left behind. But its deff not worth doing a wash with just one or two pills. Its got to be 4-5 or more of them. and thats for the 30's.

Now as for the time released ones I find it a huge waste of time and pills for that matter trying to beat the wax shit in them. I just chew and swallow them. Unless someone knows a fool-proof way of beating the waxy shit. And im not about to cook it bc heat ruins the morphine. and I have also read that the wax actually traps the morphine inside it when water is added. and yes I have tried a few times to beat the wax and I just dont feel that comfortable injecting wax into my veins.

**What causes the 'pins & needles' rush?**


So I am curious as to what causes the 'pins and needles' rush/feeling you get when injecting morphine? 


I have read through this mega thread and have searched and searched but cant find the answer. What I got from what I did read was thats its a histamine reaction. Not too sure if that is correct tho. Or would it be its the histamine in the morphine that gives this type of rush?


Either way whatever it is I love it. Some people do not but I sure do! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


What indrediant or what causes this heavenly feeling when morphine is injected?


Anyone that knows I would sure love to hear you knowledge on this. 


Thank you!!

It seems some people like Morphine while others dont. I myself like it as I tried it for the 1st time. 50mg SR orally & enjoyed the sedating feeling very much. I actually like it more than oxycodone. Oxycodone is also good for pain but is good when you're at work or need to do stuff & what not. Morphine is good to chill out & just watch a movie or roll in the bed with your partner.

Yeah man.....morphine also lasts twice as long for me than oxycodone or hydrocodone, dont know if thats the case with others. The only down side for me is it makes my body feel like jello. If you take morphine, make sure you will be relaxing at home but I do find driving on a sunny day very nice or if someone else is driving, I like to take in the scenery as long as its sunny out, amazing!

Is it safe to plug the generic ABG Morphine Sulfate ER (generic for MS Contin) pills? Would there be any weird side effects or dangers due to the other non-morphine ingredients, or can I just crush the pills into a fine powder and plug them?

**Prepping morphine pills for IV - best method**


Firstly, sorry if this is old news, but I find this to be a vastly superior method and yet I couldn't really find anything on it. If this is already common knowledge or something, let me know. But as it stands I thought it could be very helpful to some.


I used to get morphine for very cheap, sometimes free, and I was looking into how to IV them. After much internet research, I came to the conclusion that the best way was to use cold water and not cook the pill. I found this to be a very poor method, as it was still very gelly and took forever to draw up into the rig. When I would try to shoot the gelly mess, I would indeed feel the morphine, but without fail I would get a quite bad cotton-fever-ish sickness that would have me weak, shivering, and cursing myself for trying doing it. I tried this method probably 6 or 7 times, with small variations, and sure enough, sick every time. Cotton fever was a pretty rare thing for me, so I know for a fact it wasn't that. Even when I would thin the solution by adding enough water to make 2 full syringes, it still got me sick. I would rub a little bit between my fingers and it would be all slimy and sticky. I used to shoot OP oxys too, using the method of cooking the pill without water until it turns brown, and etc., and though the result ended up being a much thicker and heavier gel, even that still never got me sick like the morphine did.


So I gave up on IV morphine having only gotten it once in the hospital, and started to simply IM the gelatinous goop. But we all know, IV morphine is a hundred times more effective than any other ROA (snorted or IMed, anything less than 100 mg was worthless, and it would take 200 to be really worthwhile, even after weeks of no use, but IVed, a mere 10-15 mg would be enough to have me on the floor if I hadn't been doing it too regularly), so I asked around, and one of my friends let me in on a simple yet crucial detail. Most pills (at least all the ones I've come across) will gel up at first contact with water. This is why it's relatively ineffective whether you cook it or not, in the normal fashion you'd cook a pill. When exposed to boiling water, however, it will not gel up, but rather just absorb in the hot water, much like any normal pill. Once it's gelled, it's gelled, and hot water won't make a difference at that point. So, what you must do is:


1.) Put the water in the spoon/cooker (don't worry about using an excessive amount), and heat it until it starts boiling. 


2.) Drop your pill in, while still holding the heat source under the cooker. You should notice it just dissolves in the liquid with no gel whatsoever. You can crush up the pill, or not, and scrape off the coating, or not. I find it doesn't make much of a difference except it takes slightly less time to dissolve completely when you crush it, but I usually just keep the coating on and drop the pill in whole. 


3.) (Work quickly here) It's important that you drop in your filter as soon as you take the lighter off the spoon, and draw it up while it's still nice and hot. If you let it cool, it will turn to gel. You should also notice that once your liquid is drawn up, the remainder of the pill has formed a hard gelly mass in the spoon, so you can see all the waxes and stuff that you didn't draw up. Discard that; basically all the morphine should be in your rig at this point


4.) Squirt a tiny bit of the liquid onto your finger, and rub it. There should be no slimy/sticky/gel in there. It should feel just like water. Taste it; it should be bitter (but if you're shooting morphine you already know opiates are bitter ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

So you signed up for this site in 2005, but posted this. First of all, never ever cook your pills. Pretty much everything there you posted is wrong, no offense, just saying. Here is a thread you should read like it's the bible before you break out the needles ever again. More to come. That thread may even convince you to just stay away from the needles, unless you would literally give your arm to bang morphine. I decided there were safer ways to get high myself...

How is everything I posted wrong? I've done this many times and it worked like a charm. Why never cook pills? I usually never did unless I had to. Thanks for the link; I actually haven't shot anything in quite some time now, but there is plenty of good info there.


And yes, I know about micron filters and I understand they are much better. I never bothered because regular cotton always worked fine and never caused any problems for me, in the 5 years or so I was shooting.


So would anyone care to try this, or tell me if there's some reason this is a bad idea (moreso than just shooting pills in general, I mean)?

Well, heating pills puts far more into solution than the drug you desire. Micron filtering does as the name implies, and removes contaminants that are smaller than you can see from your solution. You might not think these are dangerous, but over time, they are. There are blood vessels in your body that are smaller than you can see, and thus catch these particles. They can cause some very bad things over time. I'm sure you got high man, you injected morphine, its all the other stuff thats very bad for you, and just because you can't see it doesn't mean it's there. Your method is what causes the pictures of blue fingers, and gangrene in the thread I linked you. We don't encourage dangerous methods of injection, this site is about harm reduction. This is why I told you most of your post was wrong, its nothing personal, it just is.

This is true, micron filtering really should be done if you are going to be injecting from tablets, syrups, etc.

I think if the OP has a method that makes the solution less gelled (and thus has a lesser proportion of filler material) then it IS reducing harm as compared to, say, the way I used to cook morphine when I got it in pill form (cook till goop and keep adding water till you get 100 units, re-heating with the cigarette filter popping around in the spoon [yikes]).  The OP's method isn't perfect (wheel filters are better, cold water extraction is better) but it can reduce harm if people are overcooking and want to reduce the harm they're doing to their bodies.  People are right to point out there are better ways to do it, but harm reduction is a spectrum.  Also:  not everyone has a credit card to order micron filters over the internet.


I'm not saying it's a good method, but I would cut the OP some slack.

Sounds like the OP is shooting mscontins. If you don't filter these right and get out the gel you are going to end up with atleast a abscess and i don't even wanna think about what all those particles can do over time. Sadly i get these and there is a way to prep them so the resulting solution is clear of any gel, sticky feeling when rubbed on your fingers or anything like that. But the important thing is as said above is to ALWAYS use a micron filter. I am stuck with mscontins and after cooking them and then micron filtering them twice there is much less crap in them then if you used a cotton filter. Also micron filters soak up less of the drug but more of the particles ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


 MScontins and the generics are the worst for injecting though. Well the worst ive had anyway. Kadians and m-esslons are not exactly great either but are easier to deal with then mscontins.

when I used morphine people used to hate the Canadian generic football-shaped 60s, but they cooked up super easy for me.  once the pill was heated in water and crushed all the filler stuck together and all the morphine was in the water.  they probably didn't need heat, what do I know?  the nice thing about the heat was it made all the (visible) filler join into one big blob.  junkies assumed the morphine was in the big blob of filler (which was obviously too thick to suck into a syringe) and paid extra for ms contin.  a wheel filter would've been better to use, but I'd never heard of them until after I stopped injecting and came here.

 Ya the ratiopharm 60mg generic mscontins are a bitch to prep right enough. The coating is thick as fuck and there's alot of wax in them. I used to occasionally shoot these too but not often since i usually had dilaudid name brand 4mg pills when i had these. The wax separates from the morphine when heated and if you do it right you won't taste any morphine from the wax you scrape off.


 A micron filter is pretty much a must for shooting any pills but when it comes to mscontins you absolutely have to use a micron filter. I would be very surprised if cotton filtering got out all the wax. 


 I am assuming micron filters would get out all the wax but anyone who knows better please feel free to correct me ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

Cotton filtering then micron filtering would be best for the pills that gel, although I do not inject them myself.  


If anyone has successfully micron filtered these pills they can say so, I just haven't done so myself.  I am pretty sure MS Contin's can be micron filtered though as I do believe I have heard of a friend who did this.

Yea, I would filter, filter, then filter again with these things. Waxy pills are notorious for abscesses which is why I didn't shoot them when I was in the needle works. When you irresponsibly shoot these pills, it's not IF you will get an abscess, but WHEN. You can be a pro with the needle, but you will still miss a shot every now and then. My father can hit a vein in the dark, and even he was known to miss on occasion. I just stayed away from them, wasn't worth it.

 Out of all the people around here who shoot these pills i am one of the few i know who hasn't gotten a abscess. I have kinda partially missed shots from mscontin type pills since i can usually feel the burn of morphine if it's out of a vein at all i have only maybe 3 times or so have missed the whole shot. I have never gotten any complications but i am really really glad to now have a fuck load of micron filters.

I know everyone says don't heat pills,but unfortunately if all you have is MS Contin and a 1 ml barrels,heat is infact needed.it is a horrible nasty solution to inject,but hey,some of us can't get H or afford an OC 80 when we could get several M 100's for the same price.


My advice would be not to bang MS Contin at all,its one of the worst pills to shoot(physically that is)The rush is great and everything,but I know I'm going to have health issues when Im older due to daily IV MS Contin abuse.

The pins & needles is basically a massive histamine reaction.

In my case it feels literally like someone poking every inch of your body with a needle repeatedly.

Often times this is accompanied by massive itching & burning to the point of being painful.

Though this may be because of the doses involved.

Another point that lends credence to the histamine idea is that oftentimes one turns red after a shot.

This redness oftentimes moves from the injection site up the head & then down to the feet.

The redness is accompanied by the pins & needles in the affected areas.

Another point of note is that the pins & needles is dose dependent.

If your using a regular insulin syringe (1cc) your dosage is limited & as such it might not be overwhelming.

Now if your using say a 3cc barrel & as such can dose higher then your much more likely to experience the pins.

As as far as I recall morphine's solubility is approx 65mg per ML.

I don't have the time to double check that figure at the moment but it's close enough.

Once you move onto the larger barrel size & the increased dosages that are available as a result,

chances are you'll really get the pins & needles.


Personally I'm not to keen on the full pins & needles effect.

As such I take hydroxyzine or a similar anti-histamine prior to my shot.

If I time it right I can reduce the histamine reaction (pins & needles) to a pleasant sensation.

As opposed to being intense to the point of being painful that I would experience otherwise.

Or if I take the anti-histamine to early it sometimes completely eliminates the pins & needles entirely.

If I want a wake up call then I might skip the anti-histamine as the pins & needles definitely gets my attention. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Otherwise I'll take my anti-histamine & go.


Considering that the anti-histamines reduce/remove the pins & needles I would assume it's mostly a histamine reaction.


Hope that helps answer your question.


Note: Obviously this all applies to IV usage, your not going to be getting a rush &/or pins / needles with other ROA's.

^ No problem.


Glad that I was able to be of assistance.

I've recently returned to the forum & am getting back into the answering questions & helping others mode.

Just happy to see that I can be of use. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Also it's good to see you don't use syringes.

Keep it that way, it's a road you don't wanna go down.

Sorry I just have to throw that in there, as I feel obligated to warn against that route.

Even though I use it myself, it's a love/hate relationship that dominates one's life.

So there's some HR for this post, so it's something more than me saying glad to help ya. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I don't get the "heat ruins morphine" idea because when raw opium is processed into morphine they boil the shit out of the opium with lime and something else, filter it and dry to get morphine. it's already been boiled vigorously so how can cooking a pill ruin the morphine?

**IV MS contins nothing works....**


i have 30 mg mallinkrodt morphins and other forums have all these ideas to iv them but wtf they dont work at ALL. salts supposed to keep from gelling... uhh still gelled like a bitch. heat will seperate the wax and just "push the wax aside" ha ya ok its even worse now just a huge spoon of gel. keep adding more water... ok well now i have like 4 shots to do of water... but all the morphine is stuck in the GEL. i dont get how people are claimin to get around the gel? they must be repeating what they heard cus iv tried it all and all those ideas dont work. i also tried crisping too. didnt change the amound of gel at all. why say these theories work when theyre pointless.


has anyone actually been successfull at IVing ms contins that knows what actually works?? thanks

They're not meant for IV usage. People are probably injecting the gel anyway, which is very unsafe. 

You need to get some micron filters if you want to safely use pills via Iv route.

u cant even get the gel into the needle if u put ur life on it. morphine is very addictive of course pharmocoogical companies/FDA, whatever are gonna make it abuse proof...

**All these years never IV'd, amazing**


It amazes me that all the years I was trying / doing every imaginal drug out there that I never IV'd. Had the opportunity several times, "China White " I think it was called. I fear with my addictive personality I would like it too much and having it wind up being a problem. BUT if just once and only once I'd like to try some really good H, or I've heard Dilaudids are supposed to be good too. I get 120 of those a month for breakthrough along with 120 MS Contin 100's which seem to be a regular hot topic within these posts. So I guess what I'm asking is has someone here had a similar story and went ahead and and just just bit the bullet and tried it to put the allure to bed and walked away and called it good.

the one's that get worse with heat eh?Well the way I do these is:


Crush pill into very fine powder


Put it in a spoon WITHOUT water


Heat the spoon from underneath and stir the powder


Make sure the powder doesn't burn but get's brown and crumbly


if you have an ice cube,touch it to the bottom of the spoon to let it cool down,it's very important you let the spoon cool to room temperature(or cooler)


when it's cool have add a little more then 1cc of cold water,ice water is what I use. Stir it up,and throw in a cotton and suck it up before it gels.Then after that shot you can add another cc of cold water to the left over gunk,mash it around with the plunger and filter.you have to do the wash quick to to avoid major gelling.


After the first ,ix it will gel a little bit if your not really quick,but no where near as bad as adding heat or not crisping.

Also,don't be alarmed,but because you crisped the pill,the shot will be amber.This is the method I use for Purdue MS Contin which gel in the way you ddescribe,and are actually the only brand that give me any real trouble when prepping for IV use.


But anyways,moral of the story is,like I said,these sou nd like they gel exactly like the purdue brand,and I shoot those all the time.I use the 100 mg tablets though,

thanks ontario guy ur the only one so far who didnt post a useless post.... im not curios why they put in the gel and i knowww its not good for you but thats not what i was asking....


anyways ya i pretty much tried what u said already i just didnt do the part where u use the ice cube to cool down the spoon. does that really make a big difference? and also when i add more water, cuz theres too much gel, and start stirrin it then it just causes more gel haha. but ur sayin be quick to suck it up. i just figured ud have to give it a decent amount of time for the morphine to dissolve in the water...

my rattie girl only ever had the 60's (the orange ones) but she would take off the orange shell and crush them very fine and put the powder in a little container and put cold water and stir and it would gel but she would put a wad of cotton INTO the gel and filter up the liquid from the gel and then do this several times not adding much water each time.  Each pill made about 4 doses this way for her and her bf.  


back then she didn't know it was bad to do this.  if she had them now she would plug the gel  :D

Yes I have been successful many timeswith these. Very easy process and no need to burn the pill. 


Take coating off pill and crush pill into very fine powder and set it to the side.


Put a cap full of water into spoon and heat it to a strong boil(no pill only water)


Once boiling put lighter down and pour pill powder into hot water


Add 5 more seconds of heat 


Set spoon down and throw a little larger than normal cotton into mix and draw back while it's still hot... This method works so well you will have zero gel left behind in spoon. Key is doing everything while still hot. Let me know how it works man


Ps... Everyone knows shooting pills is not good for you.. Just tryin to help the op out thanks

Doing a shot while still hot is INCREDIBLY dangerous and stupid.  Just because things dissolve when heated, doesn't mean they stay dissolved when cooled down.  Once the solution cools down, (in the syringe, in your body, etc) the dissolved solids will precipitate back out of the solution and now be floating around your circulatory system, and after long term use can cause major damage.


Opiates are completely soluble in COLD water.  Adding a little heat does NOT kill bacteria, or aid your shot in any way.  It is purely dangerous and uneducated; I don't care how well it "works" for abuse proof morphine pills.  In the name of harm reduction, shooting pills without a micron filter is not safe at all.

I agree, at first when I read that I thought he was saying it worked so well that ALL of the gell was left behind. Then I read your reply and I was shocked when I re-read what he wrote. How hard is it to picture what would happen to this oh so crude solution once injected? The analogy I think of is like trying to shoot a candle, so you melt the wax, somehow get it into a large gauge needle and shoot it...you'd better hope you blood is hot enough to keep that wax/gell (almost the same thing! Look at what addiction does to people! Would anyone EVER try to shoot a CANDLE?) hot long enough for your body to figure out what to do with all that shit...and even if you live, and don't loose a limb or develop a pulmonary embolism, if you keep using ms-contin in this manner, I can't see you NOT developing horrible health problems within a short time span. I know you didn't ask for lecture, but sometimes I wonder...Where do we draw the line with Harm Reduction? Assisting someone in doing something dangerous to help them do it less dangerously is one thing, but teaching someone how to do something that is potentially and probably lethal is quite another. 


If we really want to help this guy do this safely, we will tell him he needs a micron filter (although I wonder if you can even get that shit through one, never tried). If he says he can't get one because he doesn't have access to them, or whatever, then we've done our part. This is where I wonder if the line is drawn, because what this community has suggested is harmful. It's better for him to give up shooting them and be forced to find another ROA then to begin an intervenous wax regime. The only piece of possibly helpful information I can add is after you turn that pill into a syringe full of gel, take another syrindge, rip the needle off, shove some wet cotton down the back of the syringe to make a crude filter. This is the 'backloading method' and I use it to iv subutex when I need new microns. Push the gel through the cotton filter several times, and God willing you may remove some of the gunk. Good luck buddy.

If you care about your life/limbs at all, don't fuck around with IV'ing MS Contins. They will gel up all the time. If you heat the solution, it will turn into liquid but it will harden once you shoot it and there is a good chance you'll lose that limb. Fuck MS Contins dude, they are worthless. I ate 160mgs before and barely felt anything

The key here is to follow the instructions above using boiling water in spoon, add powdered pill, heat a little more and then suck through cotton, BUT then you NEED to let the solution cool properly and completely and THEN micron filter.


No one should ever be shooting hot solutions, let alone shooting hot because it will gel once cooled!!! This is just plain crazy!!!  If there is nothing left in the spoon where the fuck do you think the gel went???


Really this should never be done with MS Contin, but people are going to do it, and I have to admit that I have done it with the Ethics brand (they work a lot better then abg or mallie), but as long as people are going to continue to try to do this the best we can do here is try to reduce the harm by telling people not to inject hot wax and to at least let it cool and micron filter or at least re-filter to remove gel/wax.


WOW!!! Nothing left in the spoon!!! WTF!!!!

^^^ This is exactly what I used to do. The small amount of gel that does form in the second cooker after you let it cool will have little to no morphine in it, since it's almost all in solution now--after this step, REFILTER through your weapon of choice (micron), at the very least cotton, though not recommended. NOW use. Now you will have two cookers, the first one filled with gel, and the second with a little bit of gel. ENJOY!!!

Peel the pills, and toss them in about 3cc's of water in a shot glass whole. When you crush them, it allows them to make more gel than if you just let them stay whole and soak out into the water. It's not 100% efficient, but it comes out cleaner and less dangerous.

I used to iv morphine quite a bit and found all those methods a waste of time. You need to use a lot of water and a syringe to hold it. A 3 or 5 cc syringe.


1.remove coating with water (not spit) on paper towel

2.chop and crush as much as possable

3. Throw in spoon and soak with several ccs of cold water

4. Filter with cotton, use 2 or 3 if they "clog" and draw up with a 3 or 5cc syringe

5. Inject


I always used this method with success and found that you need a lot of water to prevent the solution from getting too jelled and a syringe big enough to deliver in one go. There still will be a lot of leftover morphine and this is still very dangerous to do for the record

If the solution is gelling up, you *should not* be putting it into your body, period. If you must, try running it through a cotton, then a micron filter, and there is a small chance you will come out with a semi-pure, clean solution. The ingredients that make it gel stay in there when you just dilute it more, it's not like they go away, and that shit gets into your veins and when the blood passes through your lungs it gets dropped off there, and eventually your lungs are encrusted with particles of magnesium stereate and pregelatinized starch, and talc, and corn starch, and that's how pulmonary edema happens leading to eventual death.

muvolution, what do you think of the method that ONandOFF and myself use? all of the gel is left behind because it comes back to a cool temperature before it goes into a syringe. Yes, also forgot to mention that a 3cc rig is usually the best for morphine if you have a tolerance at all. 2-2.5mLs of water per 100mg is usually safe.

It sounds pretty decent. Obviously if you could get it without heating, it would be better, but it sounds like that is what breaks the ER/ anti-abuse mechanism, and it sounds like all the gel comes out. I might suggest rapidly cooling it in the fridge/ freezer to make sure all the binders precipitate back out.

I have a friend (yes, it's really not me; I dislike morphine now) who still cooks and shoots MS reds every day.  I used to do ms contin myself for years, using a heat-and-add-bits-of-water method that I'm sure would make many people cry, shake their heads and speculate as to how many limbs I have left.  For the record, it's a Very Bad Idea to do that, though I know many people who have successfully shot that gel for ten years or more.  How long they'll live is an open question, of course.


Being more aware of harm reduction now I suggested he try grinding it up as best he can and just using cold water.  He did it but barely got anything from the shot.  Then he heated it and got a decent hit. 


I would like to help him reduce the harm with cold water.  Can anyone confirm a method for cold water extraction for these pills that is as effective as cooking (i.e. you've tried both and got the same result)?

I had a non fatal OD last night.I prepped 2 of the Teva brand 100 mg MS Contin.I had already consumed 160 mg's of methadone earlier,but I had just gotten my first paycheck and wanted to chip a little bit.After doing the shot,I got the most overwhelming morphine rush I've ever had.


Massive histamine release,pins and needles,swollen hands and face (had to take 2 benadryl) and I passed out for about 5 minutes.I then called my friend to talk to me for a few hours so I wouldn't nod off and never wake up.I was severely stoned.


So I know I can in fact prep abuse proof morphine pills for IV use.The MS Contin in the states must be different, or something.I've never had problems like everybody here on bl desribes.Where I live,all the Oxycontin addicts have switched to shooting MS Contin because Oxycontin is way overpriced and weaker then IV morphine.

So I guess what I'm asking is has someone here had a similar story and went ahead and and just just bit the bullet and tried it to put the allure to bed and walked away and called it good.

Sounds like good advice, thanks I won't do it. 

On this other subject, I'm more miffed than ever about whether it is or isn't possible to defeat the SR matrix at least enough for me to get a solid buzz off from time to time. As discussed I don't need to get them prepared for IV but some other ROA. I get those little round grey 100's which I think are better to start with than those obnoxious big baby blue barrels. SO, ask ten guy's get ten diff answers on how the hell to extract a few of these things to get a buzz. I have hundreds of extras from over the years, maybe I should switch to something different, my PM Doc will give me anything I want because of my back surgery and medication history. I tried Opana but was totally unimpressed. The patches were ok for a while, is there something new and exciting out there I haven't heard of and lastly in are there ANY SR pain meds that DON'T have the f'king matrix goop. Thanks again for the encouragement to not even try IV'g.

**looking for a way to inject ER Morphine (M-Eslon 60mg)**


I am sure this horse has been beaten to death, but i can't find a satisfying answer anywhere.


I recently came across these 60mg M-Eslon ER capsules. 


It's the second one from the left.


Anyway, these capsules contain tiny little beads, of waxy consistency. 


Here is the ingredient list


> Each No. 3 hard gelatin capsule, printed with a logo, "M-ESLON" and "60" in black, opaque orange cap and transparent natural body, contains morphine sulfate 60 mg in the form of extended release microgranules. Nonmedicinal ingredients: cornstarch, dibutyl sebacate, polyoxyethylene glycol, polymeric dispersion of ethylcellulose, sugar and talc; capsule shell: colouring agent, gelatin, and sulfur dioxide. Tartrazine-free.
> 		
> Click to expand...


Here is what i have tried: i tried crushing the little beads. The resulting powder floats on top of water and does not appear to get wet, or mix with water in any acceptable way. 


How does one properly prepare this specific tablet for IV administration, when one doesn't have access to micron filters? 

Personal experience with this specific capsule is appreciated.


Would breaking up the beads break the ER release matrix, and expose most of the water soluble Morphine Sulphate, which would then simply dissolve in water?


I threw the crushed beads in a spoon and added water. I observed no gelling, but the powder floated on top and stayed dry. I tried stirring it in, but all the powder collects in a large clump, with the inside staying dry. I haven't shot these yet, but i really want to do so without inflicting damage upon me.

Everyone has access to Micron filters: [www.gpzservices.com](http://www.gpzservices.com)


This are little waxy beads, so IMO, it is not ever going to be safe for IV administration. 

Check out the Morphine megathread on the second page of the Other Drugs Forum, there is alot of info in there about breaking down wax-based ER formulations.

i don't want to spend the money on the filters, because even if i have the filters, i still don't know how to properly prepare them.


I am well aware that there are risks when injecting pills. I plan on reducing the harm i am doing to myself by choosing the right method of preparation. 


After all, i could have simply crushed the powder, threw it in a syringe and slam. But that would be reckless and irresponsible. Surely there are better ways of doing this.

Honestly man those pills are very difficult to inject. I wouldnt recommend even trying if you don't have any micron filters, that really is recipe for disaster. Any method someone tells you on here will probably just cause the solution to temporarily be injectable (It can get into a syringe, then in your vein) but also remove very little, if any of the fillers and binders that can damage you. If you get micron filters it will at least be semi-safe, though still not a good idea.


I'd recommend just trying another ROA. Injecting it isnt worth your trouble or the harm it will cause your body. Maybe try plugging them? Certainly that would be better than trying to inject, and you will also get more out of them than you would if you take them orally.

okay, listen.


I will get the micron filters, once i am positive that these things are injectable without any hassle. 

What i currently have in my possession doesn't matter at all, because i am looking for a way to **prepare** these capsules for IV administration. 


What bothers me is that the powdered beads don't dissolve in water, and the powder itself doesn't get wet, it "avoids" the water if that makes sense. 


So i am just oh so curious how i am going to dissolve the morphine sulphate out of this powder if it doesn't even mix with water. 

If i am positive that i can disolve the powder in water SOMEHOW, then i shall look into purchasing a micron filter. Right now, in my current situation, i would gain nothing from purchasing a micron filter, as i don't even know how to disolve the powdered beads yet.


I refrain from heating the powder, as i am certain this would dissolve the wax matrix, and this can't be good, can it? I mean, it's good because the morphine dissolves (probably), but also the wax ends up in my veins, and i don't want this. 


I read about a method defeating wax matrices and morphine sulphate somewhere, involving Toluene. Apparently the morphine sulphate is not soluble in Toluene, but the wax matrix is. So it should be as simple as throwing the beads into a shot glass of toluene, let gravity do it's thing, decant and purge of solvent to obtain pure Morphine sulphate and other insoluble binders (which then could be taken care of with a MICRON FILTER 8) ). Would this question be better off in the chemistry section of the board? 


could someone confirm this method of defeating wax matrices? I am a very feeble minded addict, and i don't need these pills that bad that i have to shoot them and endanger my health doing so. Unfortunately, these 60mg ER release are all i can get, and they are paid for by my insurance, so i am looking for a way to prepare these for IV. And if it means chemical separation of ingredients, then so be it. I have a *large* amount of these on hand, so it would be damn nice if i could figure out how to shoot these safely. 


And a solvent based extraction, on say, 60 tablets should net me some 3.5 grams of straight morphine sulphate. The only problem being, is that i have never employed said method, and i can not vouch for it's validity.


i found the thread. I suppose it's up to me now to do some preliminary testing.

Quick question for ya. With Roxys, how long does it take pill to dissolve w/out heat? Can I use lukewarm water? Also do u get a shot just as strong as when heated?  Some of those generic Roxys are very hard, if crushed to powder will all 30 mgs dissolve w/out heat. I know I may sound anal but I'd like to know bc they are expensive and I'm an opiate addict and want the most for my money. Also does anyone know where I can find micron filters in baton rouge, la.

I'm gonna sneak this little off topic wrong thread tiny question. But first thank u guy's for this spirited banter about IV'ing my ms 100's. I am now thoroughly scared to try any of these methods. However, for my plain Oxycodone, I assume I should filter those as well even though I've read here that they're just mix and go. Where do u procure these famous micron filters, thanks again all.

Hey, check out the links at the bottom of my post for everything you could ever need regarding micron filtering. 

You can buy almost everything you would need at Amazon.com, GPZServices, or Mountainside-Medical.net.


Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions regarding IV use. Big ups to you for doing this right an doing your research.

**Best way to IV MScontin**


So I am getting some 60mg MScontins next week, and I've wanted to try IV'ing morphine for quite awhile, but the ones I'm prescribed are the Kadian 60mg (the ones that have the lil white beads inside a capsule) and I dont think those are able to be IV'd. So can someone tell me how to go about prepping and shooting MScontin ? I'm still new to IV'ing, just IV'd for the first time a couple days ago with Dilaudid, I am a long time opiate user tho, so I have a decently high tolerance. But like i said, i am new to IV'ing, so as much info on how to prep and shoot MScontin would be much appreciated, because I prefer to be as safe as possible. Oh and just in case it matters, the syringes I currently have are the U-100 Insulin 1cc Syringes and I believe they are either 29 or 30gauge.

OMG, you couldn't have picked a hotter topic on this site. There is so much written here on this it is dizzying. I too have wanted to know about these MS Contins that I have so many of every month. You know wanted to mix up my ROA of them from time to time. One thing that I think is not cool about this subject here and this goes for all of the current SR, ER, TR etc. meds is that there are many posts dating as far back as 2007 with instructions and recomendations about how to negotiate the waxy nasty matrix crap. Point being there have been numerous reformulations on all these meds that have made it virtually impossible to defeat and extract unless you’re a chemist. So just remember this when perusing this site on that subjet. Take care be safe.

What is with everyone saying dont heat pills? Ive beeing IVing pills now for over a year and the only pill I heat are my morphine.(100mg grey pills, 200mg red). Only those two...I dont add heat to kadian or statex. Im in Canada Btw. Why is everyone saying this? The only way to do the 100mg and 200mg is to take the coating off, put the whole pill in the cooker, add water, then heat until the pill is boiling then quickly push down on the pill to make it flat(use the end of a syringe or soemthing), then after you push down, heat again for another 30-45seconds, then QUICKLY add a coton and suck it up. If you wait too long and its not hot it gels up.

you  realize that when you suck something into the syringe that will gel up if its not hot... that it just proceeds to cool off once in your veins and gel up there...

why doesnt it gel up before I bang it then? I always let it cool off by waiting 5minutes or if im in a rush I put the syringe under cold water for a minute and its fine. How bad is it to do what Im doing? Ive never had problems but maybe its just all internal. Anyone wana help?

I've said this many times on this site... you must use micron filters for any kind of extended release pills you are trying to inject... if you don't the particulate matter filters out in your lungs and when you age a bit, you start dying from pulmonary edema.


Don't believe me? Check out James Fogle, author of Drugstore Cowboy, who is currently dying in prison from IVing dilaudids and blues without filtering properly.

pretty hard to feel bad for James Fogle--at 75, he's made it well past the life expectancy of the IV pill user.


still, not filtering dillies is lazy.  you can shake and bake them (grind pill, pour into syringe, suck up water and bang the whole mess) but why would anyone do that when simple cold water + filter gets most of the gunk out?  it's not exactly labour intensive.

just pointing out that he did filter most of the pills, and as benign as dilaudid is, he still is very ill. any ER formulation is going to be so much worse.

Effect of filtration on morphine and particle content of injections prepared from slow-release oral morphine tablets


Background


Injections of mixtures prepared from crushed tablets contain insoluble particles which can cause embolisms and other complications. Although many particles can be removed by filtration, many injecting drug users do not filter due to availability, cost or performance of filters, and also due to concerns that some of the dose will be lost.


Methods


Injection solutions were prepared from slow-release morphine tablets (MS Contin®) replicating methods used by injecting drug users. Contaminating particles were counted by microscopy and morphine content analysed by liquid chromatography before and after filtration.


Results


Unfiltered tablet extracts contained tens of millions of particles with a range in sizes from < 5 μm to > 400 μm. Cigarette filters removed most of the larger particles (> 50 μm) but the smaller particles remained. Commercial syringe filters (0.45 and 0.22 μm) produced a dramatic reduction in particles but tended to block unless used after a cigarette filter. Morphine was retained by all filters but could be recovered by following the filtration with one or two 1 ml washes. The combined use of a cigarette filter then 0.22 μm filter, with rinses, enabled recovery of 90% of the extracted morphine in a solution which was essentially free of tablet-derived particles.


Conclusions


Apart from overdose and addiction itself, the harmful consequences of injecting morphine tablets come from the insoluble particles from the tablets and microbial contamination. These harmful components can be substantially reduced by passing the injection through a sterilizing (0.22 μm) filter. To prevent the filter from blocking, a preliminary coarse filter (such as a cigarette filter) should be used first. The filters retain some of the dose, but this can be recovered by following filtration with one or two rinses with 1 ml water. Although filtration can reduce the non-pharmacological harmful consequences of injecting tablets, this remains an unsafe practice due to skin and environmental contamination by particles and microorganisms, and the risks of blood-borne infections from sharing injecting equipment.


Background


It is common for many injecting drug users to prepare injections from tablets that are designed for oral administration [1,2]. Tablets contain therapeutically inactive ingredients to facilitate the lubrication, disintegration and dissolution of the dosage form [3]. These ingredients include talc, cornstarch, cellulose, magnesium stearate and waxes, which are not water soluble and their injection can cause complications. After injection into any blood vessel, particles will move downstream until they encounter a vessel too small to pass, where they lodge forming an embolism. Blockage of a vessel causes ischemic damage through a reduction in blood supply to the tissue downstream and can result in necrosis of the distal tissue. For example, injection of particles into a peripheral vein can lead to pulmonary granulomas, pulmonary oedema, emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis and hypertension [4,5]. Smaller particles (< 3-4 μm) can pass through capillaries and remain in the circulation until sequestered by the mononuclear phagocytic system, mainly in the liver and spleen [6]. Intra-arterial injection, whether deliberate or accidental, can impair blood supply to a limb and cause severe tissue ischemia and necrosis, leading to amputation [7].


Adverse reactions to illicit drug injections are commonly aggravated by infections due to the non-sterile methods of preparation and injection procedures. This is seen with local skin and soft tissue infections, which are the most common cause of hospital admissions of injecting drug users [8]. Filterable contaminants in drug injections contribute to many other cardiovascular and infectious complications [9,10].


Although appropriate syringe filters can remove particles from solutions for injection, their use has not become routine amongst injecting drug users. While there are many factors contributing to this, including cost, availability and performance of syringe filters, one substantial reason is the concern of many drug users that some of the drug would be lost in filtration.


The current study was designed to replicate preparation and filtration methods used by injecting drug users for injection of slow-release oral morphine tablets (MS Contin®, also known as MST Continus® in some other countries). This was selected as injection of morphine tablets was reported as the last drug injected by 15% of the 2270 injecting drug users interviewed in the national 2008 Australian Needle and Syringe Program study [11] and as injected in the past six months by 47% of the 909 frequent injecting drug users interviewed nationally in the 2008 Illicit Drug Reporting System study [12]. MS Contin is the morphine tablet most commonly injected [12]. The current study aimed to compare the effectiveness of different types of commonly used filters on their ability to reduce particle content, and also their effect on amount of morphine remaining in the filtered solution.


Methods


Procedures used by injecting drug users


A survey of injecting drug users in the Hobart area (Tasmania, Australia) presenting to needle and syringe distribution outlets (n = 260) was conducted to determine the filtering methods they applied on their last occasion of morphine injection [13,14]. One-third (29%) had not used any filter; 41% used cigarette filters (34% hand-rolling cigarette filters); 21% used 0.22 μm syringe filters accessed through needle and syringe outlets. Minorities reported use of 0.45 μm syringe filters (2%), cotton balls (3%), combinations of cigarette and syringe filters (3%) or other makeshift filters (such as tampons, 1%). Injecting drug users in the Hobart area (n = 11) subsequently participated in detailed interviews to describe how they prepared injections from tablets and their filtration procedures. The methods used in this laboratory study are based on these methods.


Extraction of morphine from tablets


One sustained-release 60 mg tablet of morphine sulfate (MS Contin®, Mundipharma, UK) was wiped with a sterile swab containing 70% isopropyl alcohol (Briemarpak, Briemar Nominees, Australia) to remove the orange coating (replicating the process used by injecting drug users), then placed on a glass petri dish to dry. The tablet was then extracted using either cold or hot Water for Injection BP (Pfizer, Australia). In the cold method, the tablet was thoroughly crushed using a glass mortar and pestle, and mixed with 3.0 ml water. The mixture was then stood for 5 min with occasional stirring. Injecting drug users employ a variety of improvised methods, such as crushing the tablet between two spoons. However, it was considered preferable to use a single, reproducible method in this study, although it is probably more efficient than the improvised methods and may result in fewer large particles.


The resulting drug extract was either kept for filtration, examined for particle content by light microscopy or analysed for morphine content by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The mixture was transferred into a 5 ml plastic specimen tube for particle counting or a 50 ml volumetric flask for morphine analysis. The effect of different methods of filtration on the particle and morphine content of the extracts were also examined. Control solutions were prepared in an identical manner except that the tablet was omitted.


In the hot method of morphine extraction, the tablet was crushed by a porcelain pestle in a small (3 cm diameter, 4 cm high), round nickel crucible and the remnants adhering to the pestle were scraped into the crucible. Then 3.0 ml water were added and the crucible placed on a hot plate and gently boiled, with mixing, for 30-45 s by which time the mixture appeared to be clear and melted wax could be seen floating on top. The mixture was then stood on the bench until it felt cold to touch (about 5 min) before further treatment as described for the cold preparations.


It is important to note that cold extraction methods are recommended by Australian Intravenous Drug Consumer groups (Network Against Prohibition [http://www.napnt.org/health/filtering_pills.htm](http://www.napnt.org/health/filtering_pills.htm) webcite; Safer Injecting Net [http://www.saferinjecting.net/injecting-ms-contin.htm](http://www.saferinjecting.net/injecting-ms-contin.htm) webcite) due to a perception of loss of active dose following hot extraction techniques.


Filtration


Cigarette type filter


A filter used for hand-rolled cigarettes (Ranch Slims, Stuart Alexander & Co., Australia) was cut down the side and the encircling paper removed. Following precisely the methods reported by injecting drug consumers, the filter was placed in the drug extraction mixture and moved around with the tip of a 5 ml syringe (Luer-Lok, sterile, BD Medical, Melbourne, Australia) until it became saturated with the liquid. The tip of the syringe was gently pressed against the side of the filter and the mixture slowly drawn up. This was repeated at two other sites on the filter, and the filter usually became blocked before all of the liquid was drawn up. A second filter was added to enable the filtration to continue until there was no mixture left.


As described for the unfiltered extract, the filtrate was kept for further filtration, particle counting or morphine analysis. Two successive 1 ml rinses of water were added to the mortar or crucible and, after moving the filter around in the liquid, taken up into the syringe and added to the first filtrate. With the hot preparation method, each rinse volume was briefly boiled then cooled before filtration. All containers were tared and weighed again at different stages to estimate the volumes collected. Despite the presence of tablet constituents, it was assumed that the specific gravity of all the mixtures was that of water to enable the volumes to be calculated. Aliquots of each rinse were taken for morphine analysis.


Cotton ball filter


A cotton ball (Home Brand Cotton Balls, Australia) was cut into four equal parts which were rolled into smaller balls. One small ball was placed in the drug extraction mixture and gently moved around with the tip of a 5 ml syringe to absorb the liquid. The mixture was taken up into the syringe and treated as described for the cigarette type filter.


Syringe filter (0.45 or 0.22 μm)


The mixture was taken up into a 5 ml syringe fitted with a 19G needle. The needle was removed and replaced by a 0.45 or 0.22 μm sterile syringe filter (33 mm diameter, Millex, Millipore, Ireland) and the syringe contents were slowly pushed through the filter. In some experiments the filter was flushed with a 1 ml rinse volume of water.


Combined filters


After initial filtration through a cigarette type filter, followed by two 1 ml rinses, the combined filtrates were taken up into a 5 ml syringe and then the needle was replaced with a 0.45 or 0.22 μm syringe filter and the syringe contents gently expelled into a container. The filter was flushed with another 1 ml water.


Analysis of particle content


Glass microscope slides and coverslips were cleaned in laboratory detergent (Decon 90, Decon Lab., Sussex, UK), rinsed in tap water, distilled water and methanol, then dried in air. In some experiments an overnight acid wash (conc. nitric acid) was included before the water rinses.


A 20 μl aliquot of each sample was pipetted on to a slide and covered with a 22 × 22 mm coverslip. This volume filled the area under the coverslip. The slides were viewed under a light microscope (Gillet and Sibert, London, UK) in transmission mode. The eyepieces (Leitz Wetzlar, Germany) had reticules which enabled particles of different sizes to be counted. One eyepiece showed a rectangular area (360 × 250 μm with 20× objective) and the other a linear scale (0-10 by 0.1 unit) whose length was 400 μm with 20× objective. The rectangle and scale were calibrated using the ruled lines of a Neubauer blood cell counting chamber (Hawksley, London, UK). Thus the smallest particle that could be measured with the 20× objective was 4 μm (0.1 on the scale) although smaller particles could be seen and counted. For each sample, five fields were chosen for counting, at the four corners and centre of the coverslip, selected by moving the microscope stage without looking through the eyepiece. Particles were counted if they were inside the rectangle, or overlapped the bottom or right side, but not if they overlapped the top or left side.


Particles were counted in size groups, using the scale and a factor based on the magnification of the objective to estimate size. For example, particles 50-99 μm were counted with the 5× objective, and corresponded to scale readings 0.3-0.5. Particles 20-49.9 μm were counted with the 20× objective and corresponded to scale readings 0.5-1.24. Clearly this level of precision was not possible, and borderline particles could have been assigned to either of two adjacent groups. Total particles in each size group were estimated from the average count per field multiplied by the ratio of field area/coverslip area (= number of particles in 20 μl), then by the ratio of the volume of the injection (ml)/0.02 ml to give the number of particles in the injection mixture. Counts are given as mean ± SD of three replicate preparations. Photomicrographs of slides were taken with an Olympus BX50 microscope fitted with an Olympus DP50 digital camera.


Analysis of morphine content


The tablet extract or its filtrate was made to volume (50 ml) with 0.5% acetic acid. About 5 ml was filtered through a syringe filter consisting of a nylon prefilter and 0.45 μm filter (Chromacol, UK). This step was required to remove particles before HPLC analysis. The relatively large volume and acidic pH was expected to maximise the dissolution of any morphine that remained in the particles, and to minimise any retention by the filter. An aliquot of this filtrate was diluted ten-fold and analysed, in duplicate, by HPLC using a Varian 9010 instrument (Varian, Australia), a C18 reversed-phase column and UV detection at 286 nm. The mobile phase was 90% phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 3) and 10% methanol, and flow rate 0.7 ml/min. Injections were made using a 20 μl loop. Standard solutions were prepared from morphine sulfate BP (British Drug Houses, London, UK) and there was no internal standard. The retention time of morphine was 4.2 min. Calibration curves from 2.5 - 200 μg/ml were prepared each day and linearity was excellent (r2 > 0.99). As the morphine content of the tablets is given in mg morphine sulfate, we have done the same with the morphine recovered from the tablets.


Results


Cold extraction, unfiltered


The outer coating was readily removed with an alcohol swab and the tablet crushed easily although continued grinding did not result in an ever-finer powder since the waxy nature of the powder resulted in some re-compaction.


The crushed tablet suspended in cold water gave an opaque suspension with a milky appearance (Figure 1). Macroscopic particles were evident on the wall of the tube. The mean morphine content (as morphine sulfate) was 56 ± 2 mg from 60 mg tablets (Table 1). Microscopic examination showed many particles ranging in size from > 400 μm to < 5 μm (Figure 2A). Particles were not uniformly distributed across the coverslip area. Most of the fields counted were crowded and heterogeneous, making it difficult to count every particle, and the fields were usually dissimilar. The larger particles (> 50 μm) tended to be amorphous in shape and to some extent appeared to be agglomerations of smaller particles (Figure 2B). In counting the particles, the size group was taken to be that of the agglomeration, regardless of how friable it appeared. Thus the assignment of particles to size categories was based on a subjective judgement of whether they appeared to be separate or joined. Small particles (< 5-10 μm) sometimes drifted across the field, and had to be counted quickly while they remained in view. However, some particles would have been missed. The smallest particles (< 5 μm) were generally too numerous to count accurately, and their counts represent a minimum number.

Table 1. Recovery of morphine after cold extraction and filtration 


In some preparations regular crystalline shapes were seen, with sizes ranging from rectangles of 10 μm × 25 μm, to rods of 1-2 μm × 5-10 μm (Figure 2C and 2D). Treatment with weak acid (0.5% acetic acid) dissolved the crystals. This, together with their shape, and the absence of other likely candidates in the tablet formulation, suggested that the crystals were morphine hydrate, which precipitated because of the alkalinity of the glass. This was confirmed by examining an extract which gave abundant crystals on the standard glass slides. The same extract gave no crystals on either glass slides which had been soaked overnight in nitric acid, or plastic slides. Because their formation was considered to be artifactual, the crystals were not included in the particle count. All slides were examined when freshly-prepared as crystal formation increased with time on the slide.


A solution of morphine sulfate 60 mg in 3 ml Water for Injection had a pH of 4.6. An aliquot (50 μl) was mixed with an equal volume of 50 mM NaOH, resulting in the formation of masses of small rods of the same appearance as those found in the tablet extracts. The cold unfiltered tablet mixture had a pH of 6.4, which was unchanged after filtration through the cigarette filter or 0.45 μm or 0.22 μm filters.


Figure 3 shows the number of particles sized 5 μm and larger in the total injection volume for three preparations: control (no tablet), cold extraction and hot extraction. Figure 4 shows the additional particles in the smallest size group (< 5 μm) of the same preparations, plotted separately because their counts were an order of magnitude greater than for the larger particles. The upper panel of Figure 3 shows the particle counts in unfiltered preparations. Even in the absence of a crushed tablet, some small (up to 20 μm) particles were found (Control: Unfiltered), reflecting contamination from the local environment. The unfiltered cold tablet extract produced a much larger number of particles of all sizes, with the numbers tending to increase as the size became smaller (Figure 3, Cold: Unfiltered). Although not apparent in Figure 3, there were also significant numbers of particles in the largest size group (> 400 μm), 12,000 ± 14,000 in the 3 ml injection volume. The large SD shows the inherent variability of the particle counts.

Numbers of particles (in thousands) estimated to be in the total injection volumes, prepared without a tablet (control) or with cold or hot extraction.

Figure 4. Particles less than 5 μm in injection mixtures. Numbers of particles (in thousands) estimated to be in the total injection volumes. The unfiltered extracts were passed successively through a cigarette filter then a syringe filter (0.45 μm or 0.22 μm). Values are mean ± SD (N = 3).


Cold extraction, filtered


Two cigarette filters were required to enable the mixture to be taken into a syringe without the filter being blocked. The filtrate was milky, like the unfiltered mixture, but it was also more translucent and there were fewer particles on the wall of the tube (Figure 1). Only about half (1.7 ml) of the 3 ml water used to prepare the mixture could be recovered, with the remaining liquid remaining in the wet filters (Table 1). The mean morphine content of the filtrate was 32 mg, which is the amount expected to be in this fraction (1.7/3.0) of the total volume of extract. This indicates that the morphine was not binding to the filter, but was being retained because some of the solution was held up in the filter. Two successive 1 ml rinses with water recovered most of the remaining morphine (Table 1).


Some large particles escaped this filtration (Figure 5A), and there were large numbers of smaller particles and crystals (Figure 5B). The cigarette filter produced a large reduction (60-80%) in numbers of particles > 50 μm, a smaller reduction (10-20%) in particles sized 10-50 μm, and an increase (20-40%) in the number of smaller particles (< 10 μm; Figures 3 and 4).


Figure 5. Particles in cigarette filtrate (cold extraction). Photomicrographs of particles from a single preparation.


The cotton ball filter gave a similar result to the cigarette filter: a milky filtrate with limited removal of particles (data not shown). However, the recovery of morphine may have been slightly lower (Table 1). Also, it was difficult to consistently reproduce the size and density of the filters.


The 0.45 μm syringe filter gave a clear solution (Figure 1), but the filter tended to block and it required considerable pressure to deliver the last of the filtrate. Additionally, the volume of filtrate was low (1.9 ml), containing only 34 mg morphine. However, this was the amount expected for the fraction of mixture which was filtered. The filtrate was relatively particle-free, and this will be described under the combination filtration procedure.


Hot extraction, unfiltered


The tablet could only be coarsely crushed in the crucible, but everything melted or went into solution when the water was boiled. Care was taken to minimise evaporative water loss, since this tended to increase crystal formation. On cooling, the mixture became turbid and some large waxy solids separated. The largest masses were not taken up into the syringe and were therefore not included in the particle count. The aspirated mixture had a milky appearance, similar to that produced by cold extraction. The morphine extraction (59 ± 1 mg, Table 2) was virtually complete. Microscopic examination showed that, compared to cold extraction, there were fewer particles sized 10 μm or larger, and more sized less than 10 μm (Figures 3 and 4). However, the injection still contained an average 50,000 particles in each of the size groups 50-99 μm and > 100 μm. Figure 6A shows a field with one very large particle (> 400 μm) and many smaller particles, and panel B shows what appear to be solidified droplets of melted wax. The microscopic appearance of hot extractions was characterised by droplets, particles, and crystals (Figure 6A and 6D). The larger droplets had inclusions, either particles or other droplets. The formation of many small droplets contributed to the large number of small particles present.

Table 2. Recovery of morphine after hot extraction and filtration 


Hot extraction, filtered


Aspiration through a cigarette filter removed all of the largest particles (> 100 μm) but only 10-50% of the smaller particles (Figures 3 and 4). In preliminary experiments it was found that, if the mixture was still warm, many more of the wax droplets passed through the filter. As with the cold preparation, nearly all of the dose could be recovered after 2 × 1 ml rinses with water (Table 2).


Filtration through cotton wool balls gave no better recovery of morphine (Table 2) and, because of the variability in forming these filters, was not further considered.


The 0.45 μm syringe filter again gave a clear solution with recovery of 41 mg morphine, which increased to 52 mg after a 1 ml rinse (Table 1). The particle count is described after combination filtration.


Combination filtration


Fresh extracts were prepared using cold and hot water and passed sequentially through a cigarette filter then syringe filter (0.45 μm or 0.22 μm), with rinses. After both cold and hot extraction with cigarette filtration, the subsequent syringe filtration step did not significantly reduce the recovery of morphine (Tables 1 and 2). Both syringe filters greatly reduced the particle count, to levels at or below the control counts (Figures 7 and 4). In some samples (e.g. 0.45 μm filtrate after hot extraction) there appeared to be large numbers of small (< 5 μm) particles or droplets. However, this will require confirmation by re-investigation using cleaner conditions.

Discussion


Morphine in the MS Contin® slow-release tablet is embedded in a complex dual matrix of hydroxyethyl cellulose and cetostearyl alcohol, designed to release the drug over 12 h [15]. Crushing the tablet disrupts this matrix, allowing the rapid extraction of morphine. The amount of morphine in prolonged-release tablets is permitted to vary by 5% [16] so a 60 mg tablet could contain from 57 to 63 mg morphine sulfate. The extraction of morphine by cold water (56 mg) and hot water (59 mg) was therefore essentially complete. None of the filters bound morphine, and their retention of morphine was due to the volume of liquid which remained. Consequently, rinsing the filters increased the recovery of morphine. Repeated rinses brought diminishing recoveries of morphine, and increased the volume to be injected, and therefore the number of rinses used in the combined filtration method was a minimized but nevertheless gave a good recovery (84-93%) of the extracted morphine. Overall, the extraction of morphine and its recovery after filtration was similar after cold and hot extraction. 


The MS Contin® tablet contains a number of constituents with low or no water solubility which are liable to produce particles in the extract [17]. These include cetostearyl alcohol, which is a mixture of two waxes: cetyl alcohol (1-hexadecanol, mp 49°C) and stearyl alcohol (1-octadecanol, mp 61°C); magnesium stearate (mp 88°C); talc, a hydrated magnesium silicate; and hydroxyethylcellulose (a gelling agent which is insoluble in water). The coating contains other insolubles such as iron oxide, but this was usually removed in preparing the extracts.


There are advantages and disadvantages in counting particles by microscopy rather than an instrumental method, such as the Coulter Multisizer which has been used to study the effectiveness of filters for heroin injections [18]. In this latter study, the instrument required considerable dilution of the sample (50 μl to 75 ml) with the possibility of dissolution of some particles which would have been present in the smaller volume to be injected. The dilution was made with an electrolyte (saline) which may also have affected particle solubility or aggregation. Microscopy avoided dilution and enabled examination of the appearance of particles, which gave insights into their origin (such as crushed solids, condensed wax droplets, and crystallised morphine) which in turn can indicate how they could be removed. However, microscopy necessarily examines only a small part of the total sample, adding to errors as discussed below.


Counting particles, especially in the unfiltered preparations, was inherently variable due to the large amount of insoluble material and its complex physical form. This variability also affected instrumental counting, and Scott [18] considered that variability in the particle counts made the exact values meaningless although useful for comparison of filters. In our study counts are presented as the number of particles in an injection volume in order to relate the data to health impacts. This required a large multiplier factor. For example a count of one 100 μm particle in 5 fields using the 5× objective would give an estimated 8,897 particles in the 3 ml dose volume, and one 10 μm particle (20× objective) would give 161,333 particles in 3 ml. If there were no similar particles in the other two replicate mixtures, then the mean particle counts would be 2966 for the 100 μm particle and 53778 for the 10 μm particle. The particle counts are therefore reported in thousands to avoid implying a level of precision which would be misleading. The counts are indicative estimates rather than precise determinations, but are nevertheless able to show that filtering can greatly reduce the number of particles injected.


The working area for preparing the injections was neither sterile nor particle-free, since the aim was to reproduce the typical conditions used for illicit preparations by injecting drug users. Consequently, a significant number of particles and fibres were found when control injections were prepared, showing that particles are ubiquitous unless removed by specific cleaning procedures. Fibres, however, were not counted as particles since they were present on control slides and were not considered to be tablet-derived. Environmental particles will vary widely according to local conditions but will add to the total particle burden in the injection. Not using a clean workplace became a limitation in counting particles in the cigarette plus 0.22 μm filtrate, in which virtually all tablet-derived particles had been removed.


The form of the waxes was evidently altered after melting and re-solidifying, with the formation of wax droplets of various sizes. Hot extraction resulted in a shift in particle size distribution, with the formation of more small particles (< 5 μm) and fewer larger particles. However, the remaining particle burden in unfiltered preparations was still too large for this to be considered other than harmful to inject. Pharmaceutical standards require that, measured by microscopy, injections of less than 100 ml must have, in total, no more than 3000 particles > 10 μm and no more than 300 particles > 25 μm [16]. The hot unfiltered morphine tablet preparations had, in the total volume of 3 ml, an average 1.1 million particles > 10 μm and 368,000 particles > 20 μm. For the cold preparations, the numbers of particles were 7.2 million > 10 μm, and 4.0 million > 20 μm.


The aqueous solubility of morphine is critically dependent on its ionization and therefore the pH, as the ionized form is freely soluble and the free base has a low water solubility (0.25 mg/ml at 35°C) [19]. These authors found that, at 35°C, the solubility of morphine in water was 13.39 mg/ml at pH 6.35 and 5.75 mg/ml at pH 6.69. This change in solubility with pH could be explained by the change in ionization and the low free base solubility. A 60 mg tablet of morphine sulfate (MW = 758.9) contains 45.1 mg morphine (MW = 285.3), or 15.0 mg/ml in the 3 ml extract. Using the amount of morphine sulfate recovered in cold extracts, this concentration would be 14.0 mg/ml. In either case, the concentration of morphine in the 3 ml extract will be critically close to, or exceed, its solubility, especially as the pH is slightly higher (6.4) and the temperature was considerably lower (about 20°C). From the pKa of morphine (8.08) and the buffer equation, pH = pKa + log10([base form]/[acid form]), it can be calculated that morphine is 1.8% unionized at pH 6.35 and 2.1% unionized at pH 6.40. 


It was considered that morphine crystal formation was an artifact due to alkalinity in the glass microscope slide or cover, since they did not form on acid-washed glass or plastic slides. However, there is a significant risk of formation of morphine crystals in the tablet extracts,, and conditions of preparation could reduce this problem by decreasing pH or, preferably, increasing the volume of water. Although morphine will eventually dissolve in blood this will take some time, and any crystals which remain undissolved during the brief transit time from injection site to capillary bed are liable to cause embolisms.


The unfiltered tablet extracts must be considered extremely harmful as they contained many particles of all sizes. After intravenous injection, particles will flow through ever-widening vessels back to the heart and then they will enter the pulmonary circulation, where the smaller arteries which are 300-400 μm diameter [20] could be occluded by the largest particles found in unfiltered mixtures. Arterioles (9-40 μm diameter) and capillaries (7-9 μm diameter) could be blocked by the smaller particles. Even particles too small to embolize may cause vascular injury. Small airborne particles (< 2.5 μm) have been implicated in cardiac and vascular damage, including endothelial dysfunction and promotion of atherosclerotic lesions [21]. Large numbers of particles of this size were present in the unfiltered mixtures.


The cigarette filter reduced the number of particles, especially the larger particles. This filter was more effective when used after hot extraction, but the remaining particle burden remained too high for injection. Of course, cigarette filters are not designed for liquids. The morphine recovery from the cigarette filters was nearly complete (90%) after two rinses. The unfiltered mixtures caused a block of the syringe filters, but the cigarette filtrate passed through them, as did the rinse volumes. Scott [18] found that both 0.22 μm and 0.45 μm syringe filters blocked with heroin injections, and abandoned them in favour of 5 μm filters. However, these blockages can be prevented by the use of a preliminary, coarse filter, such as the cigarette filter applied here.


The combination of cigarette filter then syringe filter mostly gave a good recovery of the extracted morphine. The 0.22 μm filter is considered to be sterilizing because, unlike the 0.45 μm filter, it will remove bacteria. In a trial with injecting drug users [22], it was found that 0.22 μm syringe filters were effective in removing bacteria from 3 out of 4 injections, while larger pore filters (15 - 20 μm) were completely inadequate.


Conclusions


When a tablet of slow-release morphine (MS Contin®) is crushed and mixed with water, the resulting mixture contains millions of particles, of sizes from less than 5 μm to greater than 400 μm. These particles will cause great harm if injected into the bloodstream. The number of particles can be greatly reduced by filtration. A low-porosity syringe filter (0.45 or 0.22 μm) is most effective, but is likely to block unless a coarser filter is used first. Little of the morphine is lost in filtration if the filters are rinsed.


Hot extraction does not significantly increase extraction of morphine, and carries the risk of filtering a warm mixture which allows wax to pass through the filter, producing particles when it cools and solidifies. In practice, it is uncommon for solutions to be left for long before filtration and injection, producing the potential for a substantially greater level of filtrate contamination with wax than identified in the current study.


It is not possible to prepare an injection of pharmaceutical standard without clean facilities, as some particles will remain even after filtration through a syringe filter, and the injection will not be sterile. Also, the manufacturer cautions against using Millex® sterile filters for suspensions or emulsions, because they are not designed for this purpose (Millipore Millex User Guide, 2008). However, filtration with a 0.45 μm or 0.22 μm filter can remove virtually all of the tablet-derived particles and should be a standard method of harm reduction for injecting drug users (a plain language summary of this study is provided in Additional file 1 in order to facilitate health interventions). The 0.22 μm filter is to be preferred, as it can remove the organisms (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus, Candida) which commonly produce cutaneous and systemic infections in injecting drug users [7,8,10]. Although it cannot remove the much smaller virus particles, including Hepatitis C [23], viral infections are mostly due to blood contamination from shared equipment and are avoided by not sharing. In one Canadian hospital, the two most common reasons for admission of injecting drug users were pneumonia and soft-tissue infections [24], both potentially preventable by effective skin swabbing and filtration of injections. The average daily cost of hospitalization was $CAN610 ($USD420 at the time of the study), which makes the use of alcohol swabs (currently <$USD0.02 in Australia) and filters (<$USD0.90) extremely cost-effectve.

Maybe the reason they can't be bothered is the same reason why some of them steal the presents from under the tree in some family's home on Christmas eve, alienate and/or abandon their family and friends, prostitute themselves and have unprotected homosexual sex when they're not even gay, willingly share used syringes, and all the other unglamourous etceteras- because when you're hooked with a heavy habit and your mind and body is agonsingly convulsing in the literal throes of impending death sickness, all that matters is getting that there shit into that there vein. Such a little thing as filtering a pill becomes exactly that when compared to the magnitude of the desperation of the situation.

I have some ER pills that I wish to take **orally**, and I want to defeat the "wax matrix." From reading these forums I have found two options, and I would like CONFIRMATION that they will or will not work.


1 - I can follow the steps for prepping IV use (micron filters, etc), then take the resulting solution orally rather than through IV.


2 - I can leave a pill in a warm, acidic solution (7up or something?) for a prolonged time, mimicking the effect of stomach acids and dissolving the wax matrix. Then I can drink the solution.


Will either of these methods work?

The first one seems plausible (to me) yet nobody has brought it up yet.

The second one seems iffy, but I have read a handful of testimonials here and in other forums saying it works.


This is my first time posting here, so thanks BL for all the info I've learned so far.

Any thoughts guys?

Brighton, I believe multiple people have confirmed that crushing does NOT defeat the wax matrix. I'll repost my question so someone else can input.

Hey, I've got just a blister of Morphine tablets, but it's nowhere written what kind of tablets they are. I was told it's 30mg ER MST Cosinus or smth like that. They're red and wheel shape. 


Are those preparable for... Anything? IV? Plugging?

Maybe this would be of some interest?:


Morphine is a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid with two additional ring closures.


Most of the licit morphine produced is used to make codeine by methylation. It is also a precursor for many drugs including heroin (diacetylmorphine), hydromorphone, and oxymorphone. Replacement of the N-methyl group of morphine with an N-phenylethyl group results in a product that is 18 times more powerful than morphine in its opiate agonist potency. Combining this modification with the replacement of the 6-hydroxyl with a 6-methylene produces a compound some 1,443 times more potent than morphine, stronger than the Bentley compounds such as etorphine.


The structure-activity relationship of morphine has been extensively studied. The structural formula of morphine was determined in 1925 and confirmed in 1952 when two methods of total synthesis were also published. As a result of the extensive study and use of this molecule, more than 200 morphine derivatives (also counting codeine and related drugs) have been developed since the last quarter of the 19th Century. These drugs range from 25 per cent the strength of codeine or a little over 2 per cent of the strength of morphine, to several hundred times the strength of morphine to several powerful opioid antagoinsts including naloxone (Narcan), naltrexone (Trexan), and nalorphine (Nalline) for human use and also the amongst strongest antagonists known, such as diprenorphine (M5050), the reversing agent in the Immobilon large animal tranquilliser dart kit; the tranquilliser is another ultra-potent morphine derivative/structural analogue, viz., etorphine (M99). Morphine-derived agonist-antagonist drugs have also been developed. Elements of the morphine structure have been used to create completely synthetic drugs such as the morphinan family (levorphanol, dextromethorphan and others) and other groups which have many members with morphine-like qualities. The modification of morphine and the aforementioned synthetics has also given rise to non-narcotic drugs with other uses such as emetics, stimulants, antitussives, anticholinergics, muscle relaxants, local anaesthetics, general anaesthetics, and others.


Most semi-synthetic opioids, both of the morphine and codeine subgroups, are created by modifying one or more of the following:

•Halogenating or making other modifications at positions 1 and/or 2 on the morphine carbon skeleton. 

•The methyl group which makes morphine into codeine can be removed or added back, or replaced with another functional group like ethyl and others to make codeine analogues of morphine-derived drugs and vice versa. Codeine analogues of morphine-based drugs often serve as prodrugs of the stronger drug, as in codeine & morphine, hydrocodone & hydromorphone, oxycodone & oxymorphone, nicocodeine & nicomorphine, dihydrocodeine and dihydromorphine, &c. &c. 

•Saturating, opening, or other changes to the bond between positions 7 and 8, as well as adding, removing, or modifying functional groups to these positions; saturating, reducing, eliminating, or otherwise modifying the 7-8 bond and attaching a functional group at 14 yields hydromorphinol; the oxidation of the hydroxyl group to a carbonyl and changing the 7-8 bond to single from double changes codeine into oxycodone. 

•Attachment, removal or modification of functional groups to positions 3 and/or 6 (dihydrocodeine and related, hydrocodone, nicomorphine); in the case of moving the methyl functional group from position 3 to 6, codeine becomes heterocodeine which is 72 times stronger, and therefore six times stronger than morphine 

•Attachment of functional groups or other modification at position 14 (oxymorphone, oxycodone, naloxone) 

•Modifications at positions 2, 4, 5 or 17, usually along with other changes to the molecule elsewhere on the morphine skeleton. Often this is done with drugs produced by catalytic reduction, hydrogenation, oxidation, or the like, producing strong derivatives of morphine and codeine. 


Both morphine and its hydrated form, C17H19NO3H2O, are sparingly soluble in water. In five liters of water, only one gram of the hydrate will dissolve. For this reason, pharmaceutical companies produce sulfate and hydrochloride salts of the drug, both of which are over 300 times more water-soluble than their parent molecule. Whereas the pH of a saturated morphine hydrate solution is 8.5, the salts are acidic. Since they derive from a strong acid but weak base, they are both at about pH = 5; as a consequence, the morphine salts are mixed with small amounts of NaOH to make them suitable for injection.


A number of salts of morphine are used, with the most common in current clinical use being the hydrochloride, sulphate, tartrate, acetate, citrate; less commonly methobromide, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, lactate, chloride, and bitartrate and the others listed below. Morphine meconate is a major form of the alkaloid in the poppy, as is morphine pectinate, nitrate and some others. Like codeine, dihydrocodeine and other, especially older, opiates, morphine has been used as the salicylate salt by some suppliers and can be easily compounded, imparting the therapeutic advantage of both the opioid and the NSAID; multiple barbiturate salts of morphine were also used in the past, as was/is morphine valerate, the salt of the acid being the active principle of valerian. Calcium morphenate is the intermediate in various latex and poppy-straw methods of morphine production. Morphine ascorbate and other salts such as the tannate, citrate, and acetate, phosphate, valerate and others may be present in poppy tea depending on the method of preparation. Morphine valerate produced industrially was one ingredient of a medication available for both oral and parenteral administration popular many years ago in Europe and elsewhere called Trivalin (not to be confused with the curremt, unrelated herbal preparation of the same name) which also included the valerates of caffeine and cocaine, with a version containing codeine valerate as a fourth ingredient being distributed under the name Tetravalin.


Closely related to morphine are the opioids morphine-N-oxide (genomorphine) which is a pharmaceutical which is no longer in common use; and pseudomorphine, an alkaloid which exists in opium, form as degradation products of morphine.

Production


A Hungarian chemist, János Kabay, found and internationally patented a method to extract morphine from poppy straw. In the opium poppy the alkaloids are bound to meconic acid. The method is to extract from the crushed plant with diluted sulfuric acid, which is a stronger acid than meconic acid, but not so strong to react with alkaloid molecules. The extraction is performed in many steps (one amount of crushed plant is at least six to ten times extracted, so practically every alkaloid goes into the solution). From the solution obtained at the last extraction step, the alkaloids are precipitated by either ammonium hydroxide or sodium carbonate. The last step is purifying and separating morphine from other opium alkaloids. Opium poppy contains at least 40 different alkaloids, but most of them are of very low concentration. Morphine is the principal alkaloid in raw opium and constitutes ~8-19% of opium by dry weight (depending on growing conditions) 


The pharmacology of heroin and morphine is identical except the two acetyl groups increase the lipid solubility of the heroin molecule, causing it to cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the brain more rapidly. Once in the brain, these acetyl groups are removed to yield morphine, which causes the subjective effects of heroin. Thus, heroin may be thought of as a more rapidly acting form of morphine..


Precursor to other opioids, in an underground and illicit setting


Illicit morphine is rarely produced from codeine found in over the counter cough and pain medicines. This demethylation reaction is often performed using pyridine and hydrochloric acid.


Another source of illicit morphine comes from the extraction of morphine from extended release morphine products, such as MS-Contin. Morphine can be extracted from these products with simple extraction techniques to yield a morphine solution that can be injected. Alternatively, the tablets can be crushed and snorted, injected or swallowed, although this provides much less euphoria although retaining some of the extended-release effect and the extended-release property is why MS-Contin is used in some countries alongside methadone, dihydrocodeine, buprenorphine, dihydroetorphine, piritramide, levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM) and special 24-hour formulations of hydromorphone for maintenance and detoxification of those physically dependent on opioids.


Another means of using or misusing morphine is to use chemical reactions to turn it into heroin or another stronger opioid. Morphine can, using a technique reported in New Zealand (where the initial precursor is codeine) and elsewhere known as home-bake, be turned into what is usually a mixture of morphine, heroin, 3-monoacetylmorphine, 6-monoacetylmorphine, and codeine derivatives like acetylcodeine if the process is using morphine made from demethylating codeine by mixing acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride with the morphine and cooking it in an oven between 80 and 85°C for several hours. 


Since heroin is one of a series of 3,6 diesters of morphine, it is possible to convert morphine to nicomorphine (Vilan) using nicotinic anhydride, dipropanoylmorphine with propionic anhydride, dibutanoylmorphine and disalicyloylmorphine with the respective acid anhydrides. Glacial Acetic acid can be used to obtain a mixture high in 6-monoacetylmorphine, nicotinic acid (Vitamin B3) in some form would be precursor to 6-nicotinylmorphine, salicylic acid may yield the salicyoyl analogue of 6-MAM, and so on. 


Homebake or other clandestinely-produced heroin produced from extended-release morphine tablets may be known as Blue Heroin because of the blue colour of some of these tablets, even though the coloured coating of the tablet is usually removed before processing, many strengths of the tablets are not blue, bluish or a related colour like purple, and the final product tends not to be blue. A writer of a 2006 description of producing heroin from 100 mg as well as some 30 and 15 mg MS-Contin type tablets coined the term Blue Heroin to distinguish his, her or their product from New Zealand-style homebake as the process was shorter and began with uncoated tablets which in the case of the 100 mg tablet was at or above 35 per cent morphine sulphate by weight, resulting in a final liquid injectable which was brown-purple and quite potent. The drugs present in the final product are limited to heroin, 6-monoacetylmorphine, 3-monoacetylmorphine, and morphine, with the 6-MAM being just as or more sought than the heroin for reasons elucidated in the Wikipedia heroin article.


The clandestine conversion of morphine to ketones of the hydromorphone class or other derivatives like dihydromorphine (Paramorfan), desomorphine (Permonid), metopon &c. and codeine to hydrocodone (Dicodid), dihydrocodeine (Paracodin) &c. is more involved, time consuming, requires lab equipment of various types, and usually requires expensive catalysts and large amounts of morphine at the outset and is less common but still has been discovered by authorities in various ways during the last 20 years or so. Dihydromorphine can be acetylated into another 3,6 morphine diester, namely diacetyldihydromorphine (Paralaudin), and hydrocodone into thebacon

ok, i just joined today , but i been using the forums as a resource for quite awhile. i am having the same thoughts as you on this, so im gonna try the second method tonight and let you know how it works out.  i usually stick with roxi's, up untill now i have been regularily prescribed roxi 30's and 15's , but due to the dea sticking its nose in my doc said i had to give up the 15's in favor of something that was extended release. so im getting the opana 20 mg er. but my scrip wont be here for a few days so a friend gave me some of those purple 30mg ms contins that say abg on one side and 30 on the other. i usually use at least 5 to 10 of the 30's a day ( or the equivolent ) depending on how i feel, so im not sure how much luck ill have with the ms contin, havent heard good things but i know if i cant get around the extended release thing theyre useless to me probably. theyre is so much info on here that contradicts itself its hard to know what to believe, so im just gonna try what makes sense to me, which is to simulate the stomach and let it release for the 12 hrs. i aint shootin nothing, and im not to enthusiastic about sticking things up my butt but i can drink a shot of crappy tasting jelly if thats what has to be done. so im gonna set it up tonight and try it in the morning when i wake up fresh and clean and let you know if its worth repeating.  oh yeah, this is my first post, so if i broke some wierd protocol or something, just let me know.

i have given up on trying to shoot M-Eslon 60mg ER Morphine formulation.


There is no conceivable way i can shoot these in a safe manner. I must now pioneer the chemical extraction of M-Eslon's morphine from it's waxy matrix. 


Here is what i did. 


1. Emptied out the beads of 25 x M-Eslon 60 ER (net mass 3.75g) into a mortar and crushed the beads into a clumpy, loose slightly waxy powder

2. Transferred 1.0g of the powder into a 10ml test tube and added 8ml of anhydrous Toluene, Environmental Grade, 99.8% (not the stuff you buy at the hardware store, it actually contains more solvents than just Toluene)

3. I stoppered the tube and vigorously agitated the mixture for 30 seconds. 

4. I placed the tube into a stand, and let solids settle for 24 hours. The tube remained stoppered, as to avoid absorption of moisture. 

5. I decanted and used a pipette to remove about 7ml of toluene from the test tube. 

6. I poured the remaining toluene including solids into a filter, and washed the filtrate three times with clean, cold anhydrous toluene.   

7. The remaining powder was placed on a glass dish, and remaining toluene was allowed to evaporate over a 24 hour period.

8. The remaining, dry powder was weighed, and reagent tested to confirm presence of an opiate. Read comments


Comments:

Step 5: The removed 7ml portion of the toluene was placed into a clean 100 ml pyrex dish, and evaporated. It left behind a waxy film on the glass which was not further analysed or quantified. It was noted that the wax was successfully dissolved by the toluene.


The total amount of solids recovered from 1 gram of initial starting material was 378 mg. Marquis / Mecke (deep purple / faint green) both indicated the presence of an opiate. 


I am fairly certain that i have successfully extracted the morphine. This was all done in my kitchen (which is closer to a lab than a food preparation area).  Now i am contemplating weather or not i should inject the resulting powder. I am a bit apprehensive about this, but after seeing how the powder dissolves crystal clear in water... i don't know. I will wait for my micron filters to get here. 


Meanwhile, I will plug some 160mg and see what that does for me. I mean, everything left behind after dissolving in toluene dissolves in water, so i should be good to go? I know the Toluene is evaporated off by now, i just wish I had a HPLC set-up so i could determine what this white powder in front of me really is. I mean... I am 99% certain it's Morphine Phosphate, but would i be willing to bet my life on it? Nope.

**experimenting with ABG ms contin**


tried the "simulated digestion" method . crushed two ms contin 30 mg up last night about midnight and put them in a small amount of mt dew. stirred a couple times over the next 12 hours. around noon today i drank the mixture.  got a slight buzz, very mild euphoric feeling, didnt do much for the pain but its not worse than usual and after spending 3 hours arguing with every rep possible with humanas mail order prescription program and getting nowhere, the entire time hunched over since my kid lost my longer chord to my cell and it was nearly dead already this morning, so it had to be plugged in the entire time with a 20" chord, could be construed as working for pain. usually id have a pounding headache and neck/back pain after this kind of ordeal and would have to lie down for a couple hours.  id say it worked but due to the low oral BA it is what it is. maybe next time try 4 and see what happens. i take my meds for pain, but a decent buzz is not a bad thing either. they would definitely keep you from going through withdrawals if your regular meds werent available.  i tried railing one last night, cut up ok, didnt gel up in the nose to bad, fell asleep before i could really tell if it worked or not though. maybe ill try one now. anyone have any suggestions for snorting or oral usage with these to make them theyre most effective? theyre the purple ones with a 30 on one side and ABG on the other.

Does anyone know about how to approach the chitosan nasal RoA? I read somewhere something about a nasal spray, but that seems like to much work. How much chitosan should one mix with morphine mg:mg for this to be effective?

You were using the toulene to get out the insoluble binders , yeah, as you know morphine is insoluble in toulene? You basically washed the powder with toulene and kept the powder left in the filter, right? Thats what you should do, should be fairly simple. 


I would have just done a CWE , it is not worth going through all of that to get that small amount of morphine, just add water to about 100 mgs of crushed ER beads, stir very well, and filter a few times if you feel necessary. Seems like you lost a LOT of product , 1000mgs to 378mgs, not a very good yield. I think you got the binders, not the morph...

Then place onto a magazine in a straight line so only a little comes out at a time onto a piece of aluminum foil. fold the magazine into a V so there is a small point at the bottom and so the two tops dont lie up together( get that ) hard to explain. Then tap the powder out slowly onto the A. foil and make sure no to make clumps but to spread out evenly just enough not to see the a. foil between the powder. (that is the most important part of it, if u mess it up it wont crisp rite. And oh dont use a spoon or anything else doesnt work at all just burning the shit. Now when crisping take your time it will start to get a wierd color at first then will start to change to a light brwish. u are getting there at this point. You want it dark drwn but not black. When you are doing this you will see what im talking about by applying the powder on evenly and not in clumps.

I have 60mg morphine sulfate crs and have found that when I use about a quarter of the pill crushed into a very fine powder it doesn't gel up as much when I'm cooking it down.  Also the less heat I use the less it gels but I feel like I lost potency.  It seems like there has to be a better way to IV these.  Any suggestions?

I have was this thread and have seen very little knowledge regarding how to IV msir or morphine sulfate instant release. Everyone talks about the mscontin or the er pills but I am interested as your thoughts to 15mg MSIR Roxane labs pills. When I do the cwe which I have been doing there is alot of chalk left. I am curious as how you people recommend preparing them for IV. I have only used less than about ten times using qtip cotton swabs rolled into the size of a bb. I know how dangerous this is I have read it a hundred times so please don't lecture me on how bad it is. I will be purchasing micron filters to use and make some solution to store. I was using just over 1/2ml per pill as I only have the 50cc syringes until I get some 100cc ones when I purchase the filters. I love the feeling and rush I get when I IV them, I have tried plugging them a few times but it doesn't give me that rush I am looking for and isn't hardly as noticeable either! So people I know nobody has posted on this thread in awhile but please help me with your suggestions. I live in California and am not very experienced yet or with using other chemicals like the AA or aaa so I don't know where I purchase these chemicals and do it that way. Please any info will be appreciated. I have heard to use 1ml per pill and do the cwe is that the best way with these? Thank you love this forum btw!

Tried morphine for the first time recently.


I had no current tolerance from any recent opioid use to factor in, and also, I had never had anything intravenously. I had previously ingested 20mg diazepam (but I have a little bit of current benzo tolerance, high natural tolerance and diazepam does fuck all to me, but it is nevertheless important to take other CNS depressants seriously into account). This was my third time using a stronger opioid, the first two being with oxycodone. My first time with oxy was 40mg (plus alcohol, drank before the surprising acquisition of said OCs - foolhardily decided to eat it anyway, but I was fine), so I figure I'm not naturally all that sensitive to opiates, at least.


I took 10mg I.V., and felt very little effects. A mild wave of warmth, but nothing I'd call a rush. I plugged another 10mg very shortly after, and found myself feeling quite sedated - though still comfortably able to move without stumbling or nausea - but hardly euphoric at all. 400mg of tramadol, I would say, was more euphoric for me. I've come to the conclusion that the dose was obviously insufficient.


When I next try it, how much would be a safe dose, which would give me a good impression of recreational effects of IV morphine? Since I could tolerate 40-50mg oxycodone tolerance-naive, I figured 20-25mg would be safe to slam. Also, would it be safe - and would it add to, or detract from, the experience - to take 20mg and a low dose, 5-10mg of diazepam or something equivalent?

Not many people feel that Morphine is euphoric, its more of a sedation but comfortable one.

Morphine is euphoric, maybe not as euphoric as say IV Heroin or oxymorphone, but definitely a euphoriant. 

It all comes down to personal opinions, but once you've fallen in love with let's say heroin, the legs and nod of morphine is great. I've yet to try to IV Morphine. Last time i purchased Morphine IR my dope dealer's dumb junkie ass forgot to shave off the coating and it gelled up on the spoon. I wanted to expirience the infamous "pins and needles" rush.

I have a kadian 100mg capsule (the one with the beads) after reading through a shitload of threads ive decided to either plug (tp method, I dnt have a syringe) or as one suggestion stated "crush up the beads, let dissolve in water and drink". I'm kinda down for trying the second option, since it seems like a lot less opportunity to fuck it up, but I only have 1 and wanna get the most out of it.


Currently I can take 30-50mg oxycodone to get to the level I wanna be at. so considering my tolerance can anyone help me out as to the best way to take it other than IV? 


Also if anyone has any tips to make any of these methods easier that'd b cool

**MS MONO CAPSULES (morphine sulphate)**


Just a quick question for those people out there, has anyone had the new longer lasting version of morphine MS Mono?? I got changed from oxycontin 80mg twice daily to 150mg MS Mono once daily and my opinion is that the mono is shit cause of lack of euphoria also not much pain relief. Would MS contin be better even though mono and ms contin are exactly the same only difference ms mono is slower release with the dose lasting 24 hours? Or woulda higher dose be needed or just go back to oxy??

Not many people have heard or are prescribed MS Mono but those ones who have tried it or are taking it currently how do you compare it to other pain killers and do you know how to pass the time release ...... do I just empty the cap and crush the beads??![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)

MSContin is probably the better choice, it's one of my favorite forms of morphine for pain releif.


You need to raise that dosage too, especially since it's supposed to be spread over 24 hours...

I usually plug about 15-20 morphine 15mg IR, after i have crushed them into a super fine powder and all my water i mix it well then let it set for about 10 mins so all the left over residue from the pill (white looking powder) settles to the bottom of my glass. My question is, the residue at the bottom of the glass is it useless to try to plug also or should i just plug the clear liquid.  Iv been usaing all the white residue and liquid but i didn't know if it was any different or not.

so i have a few ms contin er 10mg, planning to use them after raving on the comedown from mdma and 2cb, about how many would equal a small line of average brown? figured these will be a lot easier to use when out and about.


thanks.

If you can, crush it up and let it soak in 1mL of water for 8-12 hours ahead of hand and then plug it when you want to come down. 


Because you you only have the 10mg extended release morphines, that's not that much, especially if you were to pop it orally as the bioavailability is terrible, and don't snort it because the bioavailability for that is piss poor as well especially since they're not instant release pills. Plugging is the best way to go.

My question is, the residue at the bottom of the glass is it useless to try to plug also or should i just plug the clear liquid.  Iv been usaing all the white residue and liquid but i didn't know if it was any different or not.

if you have any sort of tolerance whatsoever then 30mg morphine plugged is a good starting dose. That's was what I did the first time I ever plugged morphine. Oral morphine is such a waste. 

Just remember that you need to let them sit for at least 8-12 hours (in cold water, only 1mL is needed) to allow the MSContins time release to release itself. 


And Brighton- I supersaturate my morphine doses these days soaking many pills at a time overnight for the morning dose, and I've found that when I leave my mallinckrodt 100mg morphines for 8 hours in water, there is no "residue" left, it's a completely aqueous solution.

How is morphine compared to heroin? Not necessarily IV, but in general. Plugged, oral, nasal.

Very similar. diamorphine has a much bigger rush because it crossed the BBB faster than morphine, but alot of the other effects are the same.


I'm comparing it to black/brown tar heroin, which has a lot of morphine content in it already, and 6-MAM. Maybe powder H has a more "pure" high, but tar feels pretty comparable to morphine sulphate besides the rush.

You can make it more euphoric by baking it with acetic anhydride,or even acetic acid aka vinegar with water removed,to get not diamorph,...but better ,check out; home bake;threads.

Anyone that claims or even thinks that morphine is not euphoric is absolutely delusional and completely devoid of any common sense or haven't tried it intravenously. 

If you think that heroin is euphoric then you automatically have to agree that morphine is euphoric because heroin is nothing but a morphine prodrug and its real name is morphine diacetate or diacetylmorphine. 


Morphine is probably the most euphoric opioid there is along with heroin. Studies have shown this to be true.

Morphine is extremely euphoric. If morphine isn't euphoric then I don't know what is. Without morphine there would be no such thing as heroin. A study actually found them to be equally euphoric. 


Wikipedia cites the study:


> In controlled studies comparing the physiological and subjective effects of injected heroin and morphine in individuals formerly addicted to opiates, subjects showed no preference for one drug over the other. Equipotent, injected doses had comparable action courses, with no difference in subjects' self-rated feelings of euphoria, ambition, nervousness, relaxation, drowsiness, or sleepiness.[10] Short-term addiction studies by the same researchers demonstrated that tolerance developed at a similar rate to both heroin and morphine. When compared to the opioids hydromorphone, fentanyl, oxycodone, and pethidine/meperidine, former addicts showed a strong preference for heroin and morphine, suggesting that heroin and morphine are particularly susceptible to abuse and addiction. Morphine and heroin were also much more likely to produce euphoria and other positive subjective effects when compared to these other opioids.[10] The choice of heroin and morphine over other opioids by former-drug addicts may also be the result of the fact that heroin (also known as morphine diacetate, diamorphine or di-acetyl-morphine) is an ester salt of morphine and a morphine prodrug, essentially meaning that they are identical drugs in vivo. Heroin is converted to morphine before binding to the opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, where morphine then causes the subjective effects, which is what the addicted individuals are ultimately looking for.[11]

Kokaino,

This is the reason why I don't bother with heroin. Heroin, in my area (tar) even when micron filtered does much more damage than micron filtered pharmaceutical morphine sulphate. 


That's why I'll take a Malli 100mg [M]100 over TWO stamps (0.2g) of heroin 10 times out of 10. They are tiny, and do not gel. Even better: The MS-IR 30s, I get the Roxanne brand.

You're in the West coast huh? Yeah tar isn't anywhere as good as the powder we have here in the Midwest and East coast. I have an aunt in Modesto, CA and when I went there I went to Turlock to score some dope and of course it was tar, so I cooked it up and everything and shot it but it was nowhere as good as the stuff I get here in Detroit. I'd probably do pharmaceutical morphine if I was in your shoes too. The only thing is heroin is so much cheaper than pharms.

Modesto is not a good are for heroin. That's like, 5 hours from where I'm at. Trust me, Oakland, CA has good tar. I have never had powder heroin, but I'd imagine it's much easier to cut. I like how tar contains more than just heroin, even if it's due to incomplete acetylation of the morphine haha. I like the mild pins and needles, not as pronounced as when shooting pharmaceutical Morphine sulphate. 


Pharmaceutical Morphine Sulphate is cheaper by far in my situation. I can't describe by how far due to price discussion but it's significant.

Plus I just don't like street drugs, the only "street" drug I like is crystal MDMA and MDA. Every other drug, I prefer the pharmaceutical version. If I want to do Methamphetamine? Check, Desoxyn. Opiates? Check, many options, with exact dosage information and everything is sterile.

Well pharmaceuticals are definitely cleaner and at least you know how much you're doing, unlike street drugs. I used to be obsessed with MDMA back when I was 18-20 years old. I would do E pills throughout the day everday. But I grew out of that. Modesto was FULL of crystal meth and it was good crystal too. I heard Desoxyn wasn't as good as Dexedrine (which I'm prescribed - I get 180 count of the 10 mg IR tabs a month), but I can't judge because I've never tried pharmaceutical grade methamphetamine. We got meth here in Detroit (especially in the suburbs), but the city is completely dominated by heroin and crack. In fact, Detroit has a severe heroin epidemic. So opioids of all kinds are easily obtained on the streets besides heroin. Morphine and Oxycontin are everywhere, same with Vicodins/Lortabs, Tylenol #3 & #4, and Percocets. Dilaudid and Demerol are very common, as is methadone. Fentanyl is relatively common aswell. Opana I never came across, unfortunately. Benzos are everywhere, especially lorazepam and alprazolam.

I tried plugging 100mg MS Contin a couple different times and didnt't really feel much at all .. I have the generic made by rhodes pharm and i found that railing them is much better. I get a great energy buzz and take a 2mg xanax with it. There is no gelling at all and the the drip isnt to bad either. Not as good as coke but not as bad as u would think. I just get better results snorting them over plugg and oral. Just cant do it to late in the day or ill be up all night. Or ill be in a "twilight sleep" with crazy dreams!

Hi

I have morphine sulphate IR pills and want to IV them safely.  I always use 0.2 micron filters to shoot pills but I've never shot these particular pills before and I believe that morphine IR pills contain talc.  Is this correct, and if so, will the 0.2 filters remove all the talc to produce a safe injectable?  Thanks

I wanted to point out a couple of things about one pill filler. Silicon dioxide(SiO2) AKA Silica). SiO2 is chemically inert but it is also insoluble. Why? Because SiO2 in pills is merely micro fine quartz dust. It will be transparent in water or any solvent but is a suspension of nano sized particles.

I finally tried plugging about 100 mg out of 400 mg of MS Contin which was allowed to sit in the refrigerator for a week.

Not much difference than a slightly crushed tab taken orally.

Yesterday I tried the rest, 300 mg, plugged.

Only slightly stronger and onset was also only slightly faster.

Lasted about as long as same doses taken orally.

So my conclusion is that it's a waste of time.

I find I get best results by using a pill crusher to fracture the tab into a dozen large fragments and some smaller particle than if I pulverize and take that orally.

When pulverized it is apparently subject to more damage by digestive juices. Its a surface area thing. But fracturing the tab allows it to survive passage through the stomach better and speeds onset. This is essentially the same effect and same speed of onset as plugging so why bother? At least that is my conclusion. I think after going over a month taking half my daily Rx 200 mg should have made it easier for me to feel 300 mg plugged. But it really wasn't a big enough improvement to bother with.

That's too bad that it didn't work out for you. Plugging is not the best ROA for everyone but most people get much better results when dosed rectally. I personally experience extremely rapid onset and the intensity/analgesia is significantly higher than oral dosing.


 I bother because:

1) instant onset

2) longer duration

3) more pain killing action / analgesia 

4)  less side effects

5) better overall experience 


However, some people get better effects from oral dosing, everyone's body is different, and the science backing up the rectal ROA is variable, including the rectal BA which goes from about 30% (so around the same of oral) up to like 70%, in which case obviously if you fall into this category, the rectal ROA is a very viable and good option.

I think you get closer to the 70% if you add around 100mg of baking soda to your morphine concoction to alkalize it...


edit: when dosing rectally that is...

Nothing like a colon full of MSContin and baking soda. I have crushed and eaten 100-200mg MSContin orally on numerous occasions but never got much off of them. Had all of the side effects of a strong opiate (itching, constricted pupils, etc.) with very little euphoria. If a 70% bioavailability can be achieved rectally though I would definitely be interested if I run across some more any time soon.

This is correct, which is why I recommend plugging morphine at a pH of 8.

Excellent information! Thank you very, very much for posting this! I really appreciate the info on finding veins and how to use the needle. I've been using needles for various substances for over a decade, but I've never told anyone I do it. Consequently, I really don't know how to do it and I miss A LOT! This will help me with my new prescription of morphine sulfate IR tablets. Many thanks!

Hello all! Last month my doc gave me morphine sulfate IR and I safely Injected many of them thanks to the info here. This month he gave me morphine sulfate ER. Can someone tell me the difference between IR and ER when it comes to injecting? Will the extended release gel up? Thank you in advance!


So they gel right up. What can I do to safely IV?

A quick question about oral Morphine.


SWIM is used to taking about 40mg-50mg of Oxy orally (IR) about three times per week and SWIM feels it at this dose. 


SWIM has 20mg Morphine IR's and is wondering what dose is good to get over the cross-tolerance and feel something from it?


SWIM remembers taking 10mg Morphine IR several years ago and got quite buzzed off that with a decent rush (at that time SWIM's Oxy dose was about 7.5mg-10mg as well). 


SWIM just took 3 X 20mg Morphine IR at the same time on the weekend after taking Oxy in for the two days prior to this and SWIM did not really feel much except some sedation (no real rush or buzz). 


So what is a good dose for SWIM and his/her Morphine IR? 100mg? 120mg? 


Thanks.

^ i'd simply bump your dose up 20mg every 45-60mins from where you left off last time until you reach your point of satisfaction.

any type of water is going to kick start the gelling that the majority of morphine pills are notorious fore.  saline, distilled, bacteriostatic, whatever water will cause gelling.

I get pretty nauseous every time I take morphine, even on lower dosages, probably my paper stomach and because I take it so rarely. 


I want to take 20mg of morphine IR for pain coupled with doxylamine-succinate against the nausea, does anyone know what kind of dosage I'd need in order to not throw up? 

The regular dosage of diphenhydramine would help me out as well considering I can calculate what kind of a dose I'd need based on the potency.


I'd also like to know whether or not I should take them both at once or take the doxylamine and wait for it to kick in because I can pretty much feel the morphine working after about 10 minutes whereas the doxylamine would take a while longer to kick in fully, and I really don't want to throw up/itch myself to death today.


Thanks in advance.

I am used to 2 X 100 mg MS Contin every 12 hours. I believe that 80 mg of Oxycontin is about equal to 100 mg MS Contin per intended medical analgesic effects.

IMO, the subjective recreational effects are different. I prefer Oxycontin for recreation.

In the USA, the FDA forced Oxycontin to be bound together so it now is more resistant to off label usage so that it now behaves more like MS Contin, ie gelling tendency.

High dosage, instant release forms of both are restricted to 20 mg tabs or less if memory serves.

Hi everyone,


I'd like to know if 20mg of Kapanol crushed and swallowed is anywhere near 10mg liquid IV as they have at hospital ect? I really like the IV or IM I've had before and now have some Kapanol 20mg and 10mg capsules and I'd like to safely replicate the nice euphoria I get from the IM/IV morphine. What will 20mg Kapanol crushed be equivalent to??

Usually the oral dose is like 3 times that of the IV dose..so I'd say take like 30 mg's to replicate 10 IV...Though you never will truly be able to replicate how great morphine is via IV

i'm not trying to kill myself. on vacation with my family and trying to get off sick with maybe a very light buzz. lmk guys!

I just wanted to check some Morphine Sulphate ER capsules are what I was told they are.


They are capsules. Orange on what half and see-through/clear on the other half and have what looks like beige grains inside.


They have "60 mg" on the orange half in black print.


Can anyone confirm that these are indeed morphine sulphate er 60mg capsules?

MSContinus


They're resistant little buggers lol. Quite difficult to scratch off the time-release coating without also scratching off a little of the good stuff inside.

Although once crushed, they chopu up very smoothly.

Well, compared to my OC's they do (on both the above points).


Once I've removed the coating and crushed and chopped the inside to a powder the time release is destroyed, right? So when I eat/plug/insufflate the powder it's now instant-release morphine?

I can't seem to get my morphine pills dissolve so I thought putting the powder into gel caps might work. Any thoughts? Also, I haven't tried the enema style of plugging because of the dissolving factor and the fact that I only have a 5 ml syringe. Would that work if I can get past the pill dissolve issue? Any tips?

would this be the best way to prep a 100mg ER pill (gray ones)


crush up into fine powder and put into spoon

dry heat until the powder turns brown

then quickly add water and stir


This is how a friend had explained to me on how to do it, which I've done twice. I'm just wondering if I'm getting the most out of it?. I do get the intense rush and parts of my body turn all red!! One thing tho, it does leave a small some what hard lump at the injection site...almost like a histamine reaction I would get sometimes when IVing heroin that looks like hives. But it's just small and only at the injections site that stays for an hour or so. Is this normal?

Looks like the main hold u was obtaining ragent grade toluene.  For our pruposes we just was it to be andhydrous.   There is an fairly simple solution.


Buy some Epsom salt.  Bake it at 250F to make it anhydrous mag sulfate.  Mix about 5 grams in your toluene and filtr out the mag sulfate.   This will pull the water out of the toluene.


Also looking at the salt water water removal method,  that sot ofworks because salt somewhatbreaks emulsions.  emulsions are what max the water and wax mix (normally they don't.)   They are better emulsifier breakers than salt which may make this real simple,  I'll tr to find something safe.

I find that if you crush the tabs, put them in benzenefor ten mins,then into pure alcohol to wash off the harmful benzene.(the drug won't disolve in either , you are left with pure morphine. mix with COLD water then use your wheel filter>25.you should be safe as houses...be careful

You're talking about generic "ms-contins" right? Like how canada has generic oxycontins without the overkill anti-abuse right?


I had tons, literally of 60mg Cobalt (generic canadian company) extended release morphines and beating them was easy, i would let one site in a shot of vodka or tequila, whatever you like best, 94% would be even better for 10 hours, if its vodka/94%(everclear i guess), then you got a solution of alcohol and morphine. Which can be shot yes, I would still filter it and use bacteriostatic water they give you in injection kits but thats me.

All these anti-abuse pills just making it more harmful for IV addicts. How much profit do they make off junkies anyway? Fucking dogs.

Anyway there's only 1 way to do Morphine (Intravenously) imo. I have unfortunately never tried it and am impatiently waiting for the day.

I find 15mgs of morphine is way stronger for pain & pleasure than 15mgs of hydrocodone......then again, everyone's body chemistry breaks down morphine very differently.

Yeah but when you get to around 35-40mg oral hydrocodone, you'll nod, most likely just the same as a 35mg morphine shot. Or maybe it was that hydrocodone oral doses are equipotent to morphine oral doses, it was one or the other.

Hi all, I've come across some DBL morphine sulfate injection BP Ampoules 10mg/ml. I've never done morphine, just dabbled with OC (endone to be exact, up to 25mg doses) . From what I've read I think I'll plug it. Just wondering if it's good to go, already being a liquid, or would it be best to dilute it with something. And of course,  any recommended dosages (I'm 165lbs and obviously an opiate newbie). Thanks in advance

it's for IV/IM use then it's good to go for injection. If it's a ampule you have to crack it and make sure you don't get any glass in the solution. I have had ampules of Valium, Dimenhydrinate and Chlorpromazine (hardly anything as exciting as morphine ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) ) and unlike the single or multidose vials you have to crack them to open them which can be a bloody ordeal quite literally if you don't do it right. I accidentally took a chunk out of my finger cracking a ampule of Valium one time as i didn't crack the glass right but after abit you will get the hang of it. I wrap the tip of the amp in a tissue and then crack it that way i don't have to worry about accidentally cutting my finger open. 


 I would say start with 20mg's IV or IM. To get the rush of morphine you really need to IV it but as we all know once you IV it you can develop a psychological fixation on that rush and no other method of administration will do. So if you are going to go that route you have to be prepared for that. IV morphine kicks in pretty much instantly but IM takes abit to reach full effects as in a good 15 minutes. If you IM it prepare for it to burn like a cunt afterwords for abit.


 I would not go over 20mg's IV or IM if that is the way you are going to take it. Morphine IV/IM is much stronger then oral morphine and no matter which way you take Morphine side effects like nausea and vomiting and sedation are more prevalent then with say Oxycodone so 20mg's your first time out would be a good starting dose. I can say first hand that it has more of these side effects then Oxycodone, Dilaudid or Fentanyl. I would just IM it if you don't want to get into IV use as IMing it means you still get the maximum bioavailability unlike plugging. You will just have to put up with abit of omfg that stings like a cunt shit for abit after a IM morphine injection but it will be worth it. If you had a amp or vial of a good anti-histamine such as Diphenhydramine, Dimenhydrinate or the much sought after Cyclizine then you would have a nice mix to IM. I have IMed a vial or amp of Diphenhydramine or Dimenhydrinate (never ever IM any pill) and waited until it kicked in to IV some morphine and that worked great.


 Oh well atleast IM morphine burns nowhere near IM Demerol (Meperidine aka Pethidine) which only 1 injection of 1ML/1CC fluid stings like a absolute cunt. Benzos are even worse as they don't dissolve in water but rather in alcohol and a few other chemicals ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

Thanks for the comprehensive post! As much as I would love to get the most out of it and IV/IM it, needles are beyond a line I'm never willing to cross...so that's why I think I'll plug it over oral RoA. That said, if you're suggesting 20mg IV, should it be bumped up to around 60mg for plugging given the decreased BA?

Anybody else find IV morphine to be just a 5 second rush then no high at all? Even at high doses like 30mgs the rush is very intense but again no high. Pinpoint pupils though.


Im starting to think its something with these particular pills i havd. These also suck orally. No high at all even though my pupils are very constricted and one time i even fell asleep when i tried upping the dose (120mgs). Theyre new and from the drugstore só i really dont know what it could be wrong. I remember nodding my tits off from morphine before, great drug... Its not tolerance either bte

Hello everyone,


It's been awhile since I have posted on here but since I am on palliative care because of some severe physical problems I thought I would discuss some of the medications I'm taking.I have never had a doctor gives me such large amounts of medications because it's so crazy here and where I live with people abusing. but this guy was in Vietnam and he had a horrible experience and as a doctor decided he would never let any of his patients suffer. so I am thankful he understands my high tolerance, and after the first visit he is maintaining my current dose of 50 milligrams of methadone every 8 hours, we changed the 8mg of dilaudid every 6 hours to roxanol (morphine sulfate oral liquid 20mg/1ml) take 1ml every 2 hrs as needed. My veins are impossible to hit but I have been using this intramuscularly for pain, it's the Roxane lab. generic so it's safe, it just burns like hell for a few minutes. And also for major breakthru pain I have abstral 800mcg (fentanyl sublingual tablet) I prefer the subsys sublingual spray but this stuff works pretty great too. The last 2 months I have been in excruciating pain and my high tolerance has been making my pain impossible to manage until now. I bought the book "The Final Exit" by Derek Humphry and was going to use the helium hood merhod but I finally found this great palliative care/hospice doctor. It is so nice to have hope again.

Hey. I have been using potentiators to enhance my opiate buzz lately (specifially quinine and grapefruit juice to enhance heroin and dilaudid)


From my basic understanding these specific potentiators inhibit the metabolization of the opiates, so while you are not necessarily absorbing more of the substance, the amount you absorb lingers for longer. In terms of dependency and addiction issues, would this be equivalent to redosing an amount that would sustain you for as long as the potebtiator does? If I use a potentiator that was to get me higher, would it affect melike taking a higher dose?

I am wondering the same thing


My script lists corn starch as an inactive ingredient.


This is the first I have learned of plugging, What exactly are the advantages gained? I use morphine 15/ xr for chronic pain, after being on hydrocodone 10/325 6 times a day this new xr crap is just not cutting it. Not needing a buzz, just comfortable. The pain clinic i used closed, and my new dr is determined to cut down my usage. Does this manner of medicating yourself get more or better results from the meds? I am desperate to get these tabs to pack a bigger punch! Also, can this be done vaginialy?

Sorry to bump this thread but I have yet to see purification of Morphine for IV by means other than cotton and micron filters. I have heard of great results with extracting Morphine Sulfate ER's with the coating removed and the pills split into 1/3's then placed in a coffee filter "Tea Bag" with string or staples to keep a closed "bag". This is placed in clean, slightly acidic water overnight to saturate the water with the morphine salt. After a delicate rinse of the tea bag into the solution only fillers remain with nominal MS residuals in the bag ( eat or discard). After reducing the solution with gentle heat and a small fan the Morphine is precipitated out as freebase with pure 10% Ammonia solution (ammonium hydroxide w/no surfactants added) at a pH of 9.1 and is then cooled to increase precipitation efficacy. Looks like snow on the bottom of a static snow globe.

 Using a vacuum filter buchner funnel or even a borosilicate chemex hour glass coffee carafe with 20 micron qualitative filter paper or bleached coffee filters easily recovers the fluffy freebase which can be washed with basic clean water as freebase morphine is not water soluble. After drying and scraping off the paper filter the morphine base powder can be converted back into a salt with dilute citric, HCL acid ,etc. This can be dried or adjusted to pH 5-6 with ACS grade NaOH or even baking soda with a little salt as a harmless by product. The end product easily filters with even the .22 micron syringe filters and does not clog them in the slightest. 

 A drop placed on a glass slide and compared side by side with a cotton filtered solution of MS under a microscope shows the striking contrast of the two. This is for personal use only of course and in the spirit of harm reduction for those with basic chemistry knowledge and a little patience.

That's really complicated. When one is not speaking of Morphine XR forms such as Kadians, M-Eslons and Avinzas, which are all gelcaps with crystal hard beads inside. I've seen M-Eslons and shot the 15mg and 30mg ones I had with the regular filters we get in our SecuriCup sterile cups packages in the IV kits we get here witht he bacteriostatic water vials, alcohol pads, and syringes (4) 27 1/2 BT. Sometimes they have the better and as good as microns SteriFilts. But I never saw M-Eslons again and I wasn't privy to their inactive contents. I still don't know if they contain talc in their beads, so even when mortared and pesteled, I never shot Kadians, they got talc in them, at any dosage, the beads contain talc, that's something I just won't shoot. Not many gelcaps+beads meds are safe to IV, other than HydromorphContins, the filter in SecuriCups will take care of these very well. They were the 130mg Kadians so, crushing them in a powder, refilling the capsule. Eating an rx 600mg Tagamet and the 130mg now-IR kadian was pretty intense for oral morphine, of course the Tagamet, and the fact it's the second highest dose, there's 800mg ones but I'll leave that to people who really have hardcore ulcers.


All this to say, when I had 60mg generic ms-contin type hard pills, I did not know that all is needed to turn them into IR morphine that will not gel, is salt water. Yeah, make yourself a saline solution, draw it in a syringe, and throw it in the hopefully, sterile object that contains the MS-Contin or generic ms-contin like morphine XR pill. The pill will dissolve and no heating is even needed. Just stir a bunch with the stirring tip (the safety tips) and you'll get a normal solution. 


Although, if you're lucky enough to put you hands on a lot of 100mg+ morphine XR of any type, I say turn them into IR and spare your veins. Just eating a couple red rectangle MS-Contins when dopesick was living a dream. I had a whole bunch from people who have no idea of the street value they got. Anyway, salt water, is the answer here.

@TRO,so that means if I was on 1200 mg ER morphine/day it would be same as 1200 mg hydroc.actually available. Always comforted myself that only 300-400mg  get ba.

so that's my actual dose, not the 1200 I have to take cause of low ba.

Now would i feel MORE from same dose hydrocodone?

Maybe you could clear that up for me☺

Ok folks ive been prescribed morphine and hydromorphone for close to 10 years now and I truly hated morphine for iv use untill now. Ive recently tried a process that works so well that the 30mg time release morphine im precribed produce a rush almost identical to my hydromorphone. Now the pills i have are purple blank on one side with n30 on the other. I dont know how the process will work on other brands yet but for these gel monsters its perfect. Quick dirrections: First get rid of the coating, second crush it into a fine fine powder, next is important dump the powder into the spoon and using a clean finger spread the powder into a thin layer over the spoon for you want as much of the powder to have contact with the metal as possible and keep the layer cosistant no thick spots, next heat the spoon evenly with no water till evenly until it starts smoking and turns a dark dark brown i dont know how but this burns out the gel and leaves the morphine, quicly hit it with a 150units of water while its still scorching hot your shot will look like some tar h but you will realize instantly theres no gel incredibly, then throw cotton micron or wat ever works for you in it draw it up with a clean syringe of coarse let the liquid cool unless you like hot shots and do your thing. your welcome. If the process works on other time release pills let me kno.

Might work to get morphine into your system, but I don't even want to think about the other gunk entering your veins along with it from the pill prep. Shooting tar probably isn't exactly something that is much if any better, but this mental picture of injecting the charred remains of a pill I had makes me kind of shudder.


Btw, welcome to BL!

THIS=


I don't 100% agree with the preparation method. I think it is impossible to write a "one size fits all" FAQ on prepping morphine IV. It heavily depends on what brand and formulation the morphine is in.[/QUOTE]

Cant see how that would work on ours,there Is a technique to get pure base out of ours,but cant find it.

Dont want to name Brand,good that its used for maintenance,ivdu shoot it anyway,but even more questions bout how to extract these safely on Web can be bad,we are small country so most will know anyway,ones with beads...

For those who are kind to their circulatory systems there is always plugging / shafting. Take a peek at these BA numbers for some inspiration:


> **The Bioavailability of Rectally Administered Morphine**
> 
> 
> 
> **Abstract: ** Plasma concentrations of morphine were followed for 24  hours in eight patients after intravenous and rectal administration of  10 mg morphine chloride. The plasma levels of morphine were determined  by a sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay based upon an extraction  procedure which separates morphine from its major polar metabolites. The  bioavailability of morphine after rectal administration was found to be  **53.3** ± 17.8% (mean ± S.D.). Peak concentrations of 16.3 ± 8.7 ng ml-1  were reached after **59 ± 16 min**. The study indicates that first pass  elimination of morphine may be partially avoided by rectal  administration.

I know with certain extended release Morphine using cold saline water (0.89% like the ones at the exchange) was efficient enough to extract the majority, of course it was not anything I would recommend anyone else do because of the damage involved and at least use a micron filter after a cotton filter as just using cotton is not enough no matter how many times you run it through another clean cotton. 


The concept is the salt disrupted the gelling mechanism enough to pull a solution, but nowhere near enough to stop it from getting insoluble stuff into the solution, which is why micron filter is required even though I recommend mixing and pulling through cotton about 1-3 washes of the cold saline with no heat obviously without cooking the pill beforehand leading to more harmful particles in the solution and as fast as possible to pull as much morphine via agitation by running the water through then after filtering the shots use the first as the main shot and put the second and third together for the second. Also use an alcohol pad to wipe the coating off.... This works with the abg and m box pills that are smaller.


Again I don't recommend injecting these, but if you must do not use heat and instead use science.... You are essentially doing a water extraction to make a liquid solution you will be introducing directly to your blood stream past most of your bodies natural defenses to protect yourself. I understand being desperate though so if you can't take it a step further using a basic lab setup to extract the Morphine from the pill mostly pure then at least try to do something basic rather than something more advance than you can really understand. Only cavemen rely on fire for the end all answer....


Edit: plugging is also very easy. There's an old plugging tek by the user Tricomb buried somewhere here. I rather not take the effort to find it now as everyone needs to learn how to use this place, but ya plugging is much easier and I bet more efficient and probably lacking painful pins and needles although I wouldn't know I just know I hated that about iv.

Need help. I have an ampoule of morphine for IV injections. Text on ampoule is: "1ml - Morfin 2% - injektionsv?ske - Ph. Nord - Ferrosan" (photo: [https://i.imgur.com/PtGbeOb.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/PtGbeOb.jpg)) How much mg's in it?

I'm guessing 200 mg total making ten 20 mg 1 cc (10 units). In the hospital they use 4 mg or so. Personally I don't like going over 15 mg where 30 mg is painful. Start low as you can always do more, but you need narcan to fix taking too much.

You really think they'd put 20 doses in one ampule? If your determined to use it, try a 1/10th of the vile just in case those crazy Nords really loaded it up. I would personally look for any ID info and Google it. In the US it would be 10-20mg at most but don't rely on countries to have the same standards. Some High Potency Ampules do exist. Solubility wise about 60mg of MS can fit into 1ml.

Need help on plugging morphine for first time.... I can take orally 100mg of morphine... probably more but I'm interested in plugging I've researched it heavily and I'm thinking starting with a dose of 25mg would be acceptable.... is this too high or too low? I need some advice

^ Remember Morphine has a relatively low water solubility; for 100mg, you would need 2ml of water to plug; personally don’t recommend the it, because at 100mg, your likely getting around 40% BA Anyway(BA% of morphine increases with dose) however if you do plug, you need to dissolve it in a good 2ml of water, if it’s 100ng(Comfortably 50mg/ml dissolves under normal conditions)

  I know someone who would never use any form but oral.   Hypothetically, this person has been taking a set daily amount of the extended release (XR) pills for over a year. That set amount has always been in a set form.  Like: TOTAL daily amount has been 90 mg XR,   in the form of   15 mg XR 6 times a day.  Arbitrary numbers, to seek answers to a safety/efficacy question.  The question: Things have changed. The only form this person can access now is 30 mg XR 3 times a day.  2 times the dose, half the frequency of doses, daily mg total unchanged.  The result has been that now in this new form, with every dose they are deeply drugged for a few hours, OK for maybe 1, then they get increasing dopesick for hours, until the next dose.  Rinse and repeat.  Splitting the 30 mg XR in half and taking that 6 times a day does not improve the result.  Its almost like splitting releases something (like nalaxone ?) that normally, unsplit, was never apparent. No idea what is going on there actually.  But for whatever reason splitting leaves them acting like they are short by about 25% overall each day.  Any thoughts on how to better change one 30 mg XR dose back to two 15 mg XR ? Hypothetically.

  Opiates decrease the respiratory drive. If you take morphine and get sleepy, you are likely to go to sleep. If you stay up you'll still be breathing less than usual - maybe a little, maybe a lot, it depends on a whole lot of things (are you new to opiates? How much did you take? Do you have other drugs in your system? and so on).   Most people here are probably aware of this, of course.  The wake-up headache could be due to 1- having spent the night being low on oxygen (lowered respiratory drive) or to 2- decreased sensitivity to pain causing you to allow your head and neck to be in less than ideal positions all night.

i am having an issue with headache. i do the 60mg er tabs, 


crush in spoon. but this is more like squishing really since it doesnt really break up much.

add 150 unit of water

bring to boil

use filter and pull up what you can


these gel up pretty bad but the first hit is intense. however, i get the pins and needles

sensation along with getting real hot and flush.

it is starting to concern me. is this common?

is there another way to do these?

to my knowledge i am doing them the 'right' way.

We should probably reconsider plugging morphine 


Also, Chronic morphine is typically 1.5-2x as potent as a single dose,(P.O)  and very high doses can further increase BA% to some extent. At what dose this begins on average, or how significant, not sure, though it varies from (roughly) 15-50%, mean 30%, although exceeding 30-40% would take some effort, chronic use of larger doses and what not- also watch out for the histamine release, with injecting especially

That looks like old Morphine and 30mg sounds plausible, but that ampule is def not used in PCA machines. A PCA uses a large syringe controlled by a precise servo hooked up to the happy button on the end of the cord that always gets tangled with the TV controller.

Ok so I got my hands on oral liquid morphine no alcohol or additives. I tried IVing a couple of times and I do not get much out of it. I tried a 35 just now and I feel warm and light headed for a second but that's it.  I used to IV dilaudid but quit for a while so I started off slow not wanting to hurt myself but it just does not seem to give me the rush I want. Is that normal?

They are made of the same polyethylene oxides that the reformulated Oxycontins are in the states. They could probably withstand a ground zero nuclear blast. Some have dissolved in water over days but it's like drinking snot and still retains some time release. Sry.

oral morphine is only good when its dosed very high for a nontolerant person that is atleast 100-150 mg and for a tolerant person its atleast 400-600mg,my experience is that oral oxy is 2,5-3 times as strong so 80 mg oxy is 200 -240mg of oral morphine

Thats what I thought. They are horrible I seem to do more harm to myself than intended. Why do they make garbage like this knowing it will harm people.

From the States now living in Brazil (S?o Paulo) and finally found some opiates after a two month search. I’m a heroin addict and I used to have a pretty huge tolerance but have been IVing 30mg Oxycodone pills prior to coming to Brazil (around 4-5 a day). First off the OxyContins here in Brazil are all the new formula and can’t be crushed. I settled for my connect to get some morphine sulfate and NOT MS Contins as from what I understand have always gelled up when in contact with water. My connect found me Dimorf IR 10mg Morphine Sulfate tabs made by Cristalia. I have to say that I am pretty impressed.  There are a lot of fillers/binders in these pills for a 10mg pill but the rush is similar to Dilaudid which is pretty intense. I found one pill would break down pretty well per 1ml of water. You will get a pretty nice rush if you stick to just one pill per shot. Initially tried to crush 3 pills into one shot and I wound up having to do multiple shots to draw up all the morphine I could, which seemed like a lot of time for very little added benefit. 


Dimorf comes in 30mg 60mg 100mg and I believe maybe 120 as well.  I’m going to try the 30mg this week. Thought maybe the higher dosages may come with some sort of tamper resistant coating and bad enough I’m shooting pills period....ain’t messing with the gel stuff no matter what. I’ll report back as to my findings but I have to say I am pretty excited.

I have been in so much pain lately that I have been crushing my 30 mg MS Contin and soaking in water. They do dissolve, at least the kind I have do. Then I have been using the rectal administration. 


It is working a lot better. This method hits my lower back pain, left leg pain right where I need it to. 

It also has not decreased the duration of action. Which I was worried about. 


I am very grateful to you guys here for giving information on this method. I really need a dosage increase! 

This has saved my life for now.

So an update on the 30mg Dimorf....they are crushable and injectable and they are so much better than the 10mg. Same size as the 10a with 3xs as much morphine which is pretty awesome. And the rush is comparable to an 8mg Dilly. Who’s says you can’t get opiates in Brazil!

Absolutely agree...injecting these pills is hopefully a temporary solution until I source another connect. I’m an ole’ school junkie that prefers “dope” over anything

I have a fairly good tolerance. Been taking oral oxy and inject oxy occasionally around 30mg plus tramadol codiene. The bottle is called ordine 2 oral solution 2mg/ml. It contains 200ml.

Sorry for the delayed response, I fell asleep last night and forgot to check it again today. I'm surprised nobody else stumbled in to give you advice.


Since the morphine is already in an oral preparation you're Available ROAs are limited to oral or plugging. 


Oral oxycodone is said to be around 1.5 times stronger than oral morphine so, for example, if you normally swallow 30mg of oxy then you would probably want to try taking around 45mg morphine orally (so 22.5ml of your morphine solution if it is infact 2mg/ml).

Does breaking an extended release tablet really ruin the delivery method? And how much is released at a time for the morphine ER 60mg? (RD 72) it?s been four hours and I had a slight rush a few minutes ago but now nothing? Will it come back in awhile? I?m not positive how Extended release tablets work

ER preparations release the API over a 7 hour period so they wear off at 12 hours. Depending on whether your pill crushes into a powder or just a couple of pieces will determine how fast it breaks down. Some still gel up once they absorb enough liquid in the stomach. But the general rule is the more surface area exposed, the faster they will release the MS. As in a powderized pill will release much faster than one that's only broken into halves or thirds.

I wouldn't expect a whole lot more beyond the 4+ hour mark if your pill was at least broken down into smaller pieces.

**low dose morphine withdrawal**


Taking 80mg oxy a day trying to take it properly so bit restless.

30mg extended and 4 5mgs but i take 10mg twice a day.


Ive been taking 20mg morphine a day, got it down to 15mg without a prescription but im cutting the tabs into tiny bits and just lowering it.

I can get enough morph to last me a week but I dont wanna keep taking it.

PROBLEM IS IM ON QUETIAPINE, I GOT FIBROMYALGIA AND RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME(TAKE ROPINIROLE) SO OPIATE WITHDRAWAL IS A FUCKING BASTARD.

Excuse my swearing.

I got addicted to morph cos my gp would not give me 20mg short acting oxy on top of 30mg oxy.

but he wa shappy to give me fentanyl and shorttec but did say he wanted me to try get off the long tec was not happening fentayl was horrible and even worst when 50hours had passed I was in bad withdrawal and I saw a different gp who switched me back to oxy but my usual gp be ringing on monday.

If he tries lower my dose I BE IN EVEN MORE SHIT.


is it more in my head but 20mg to 10mg is a 50percent drop same with 10mg to 5mg.

People say morphine aint strong, i used to think it too but your body knows if its bloody gone.

Sorry im rambling took some zopiclone and gabapentins whilst my body gets used to having 30mg over a hourly perioud not 15mg instant every 5hours.

Morphine ER lasts longer than 12hours for me.

Oxycontin lasts about 8.

And I find plugging gives me a nod at the start then thats it done.

Its stronger than people think, I injected 30mg and dont remember rest of day and I was tolerant to 150mg morphine orally.

I also injected 60mg after taking high dose mdma remember my eyes rolling into back of my head Im surprised I did not die(dont do it)
