# DOx

*Source: https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/DOx*

**DOx** is a chemical class of substituted amphetamines that persists of many long lasting and very potent psychedelic drugs.
DOx not only includes [DOB](/index.php?title=DOB&action=edit&redlink=1), [DOC](/index.php?title=DOC&action=edit&redlink=1), [DOI](/index.php?title=DOI&action=edit&redlink=1) and [DOM](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/DOM), but also as number of lesser known substances, such as the [Aleph](/index.php?title=Aleph&action=edit&redlink=1) and [TMA](/index.php?title=TMA&action=edit&redlink=1) series.
Almost all substances of the DOx series have a very long duration (12-30 hours), are extremely potent (active at just a few miligrams) and have a very slow onset.
They're often described as less spiritual and more stimulating compared to classic psychedelics.

## History

The DOx series was first researched by Alexander and Ann Shulgin, who rated [DOM](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/DOM) as one of the most important phenethylamine compounds, the so called "magical half-dozen", in their book PiHKAL.
The most popular substance of this class is [DOM](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/DOM), also known as STP (Serenity, Tranquility, and Peace), which first appeared in tablet form in 1967.
As of 2014, drugs of the DOx series are sometimes mistakenly sold as "acid" on blotters, and once again [DOM](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/DOM) is the most widespread compound among users of psychedelic amphetamines.

## Harm Reduction

Due to DOx' nature as substituted amphetamines, they pose some risk as  potent stimulants; take similar harm reduction precautions as one would  on [stimulants](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Stimulants).

See [Psychedelic Harm Reduction](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Psychedelics#Harm_Reduction) for general information.

### WARNING

DOx compounds have a very long duration and also a long comeup, redosing is not recommended, as it may take multiple hours to peak.

### Potentiators

- [Cannabis](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Cannabis)

### Interactions

Check out our [Drug Combinations](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Drug_Combinations) page and chart for interactions and combinations of common drugs.

Under no circumstances any DOx compound should be combined with a MAOI.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

DOx is a chemical class of substituted amphetamine derivatives featuring methoxy groups at the 2- and 5-positions of the phenyl ring, and a substituent such as alkyl or halogen at the 4- position of the phenyl ring. The compounds of this class are  potent and long-lasting psychedelic drugs, and act as highly selective 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptor partial agonists.

## Legal status

Most substances of the DOx class are controlled substances in almost every country. DOC and DOI are unscheduled in the US and a few other countries.
