## Subjective Experience

Ephedra sinica has been used in China as a herbal medicine for thousands of years.
Independent use by indigenous peoples in various parts of the world has also been
documented.

Wikipedia describes its history as follows:

```
"Ephedra sinica (also known as Chinese ephedra or Ma Huang) is a plant
species native to Mongolia, Russia (Buryatiya, Chita, Primorye), and
northeastern China. Ephedra is a medicinal preparation from the plant
Ephedra sinica. Several additional species belonging to the genus ephedra
have traditionally been used for a variety of medicinal purposes, and are a
possible candidate for the Soma plant of Indo-Iranian religion. It has been
used in traditional Chinese medicine for more than 2,000 years"

With respect to its psychoactivity, the same article states that:

```
"Of the six ephedrine-type ingredients found in ephedra (at concentrations of
0.02-3.4%), the most common are ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. The
stimulant and thermogenic effects of Ephedra sinica and other ephedra
species are due to the presence of the alkaloids ephedrine and
pseudoephedrine. These compounds stimulate the brain, increase heart rate,
constrict blood vessels (increasing blood pressure), and expand bronchial
tubes (making breathing easier). Their thermogenic properties cause an
increase in metabolism, as evidenced by an increase in body heat"

consumed as a tea. Regarding dose, there are few guidelines, although the following
