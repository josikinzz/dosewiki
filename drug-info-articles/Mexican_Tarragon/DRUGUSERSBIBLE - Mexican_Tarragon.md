## Subjective Experience

Used ritually by the Aztecs, this plant is contradictorily reported to be both a sedative
and a stimulant. Of the two propositions, the former appears to be more widely
adopted. It is also cited as being smoked with peyote (and other substances) to
enhance visuals, and with nicotiana rustica as an aphrodisiac.

My experiments were originally undertaken during the evening, in the anticipation of
sedation. The effects in this respect were mild, at best.

However, an unexpected outcome was vivid and lucid dreams. Subsequent research
revealed that tagetes lucida has indeed been widely used as an oneirogen. It certainly
worked as such in my case.

I should also note that I found smoking to have a significantly greater effect than oral
ingestion.
