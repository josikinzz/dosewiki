## Subjective Experience

A small supply of this appeared on the market in 2016, shortly before the general UK
ban came into effect. I was fortunate to obtain enough for a couple of low-dose trips.

These were pleasant enough: enhanced colouration with minor visuals, a sense of
mood lift with mild euphoria, and a tingly body feel as experienced with other 2C-B
variants.

The difference between many of these analogues is often subtle and difficult to
distinguish, particularly with respect to headspace. It could well be that this one
converts to 2C-B itself in vivo, as I have seen suggested.

Overall, this was a very nice foray, with the relatively short duration being a positive
in my circumstances at the time. It was certainly trippy in nature, and I was almost
back to baseline after about 6 hours.

2C-B-AN, also known as 4-bromo-N-(α′-cyanobenzyl)-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine or as brolphetaminil, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine, 2C, and N-benzylphenethylamine families related to 2C-B. It is the derivative of 2C-B with a modified NBOMe-like N-(α′-cyanobenzyl) substitution. The drug is chemically unstable and has been found to be a prodrug of 2C-B in vivo. It is active at a dose of 50 mg orally and has a duration of 5 to 8 hours. 2C-B-AN has been described as producing stimulation and certain visual alterations. It was described in the scientific literature by Daniel Trachsel in 2013, who cited personal communication with P. Rausch in 2009 as the source for the information. 2C-B-AN was encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe by 2016.
