## Subjective Experience

This one is tricky: as in my personal inability to distinguish between the varying
effects of the different lysergamides.

I understood that 75ug was a small dose, but I only possessed three blotters in total,
and I wanted to test gently. Nonetheless, the familiar headspace soon emerged, as
did a nice mood elevation.

It is commonly claimed that LSZ offers more introspection than its more popular
sisters, LSD and AL-LAD. I looked for this, but didn’t really find it. Regardless, the
few low-end trips I experienced were very enjoyable.

In retrospect, I should have gone higher whilst this was still on the market. Having
stated this, I have no reason to believe that it would have produced a significantly
different experience to that of its close relatives (see previous reports).

EFFECTS LIST #
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
LSZ's effects are considered quite similar to LSD's effects, with a slightly shorter duration. Some users have reported that nausea is more prominent with LSZ than with LSD, but there are not a large number of reports as of December, 2013. As with any psychedelic, LSZ acts as a psychological amplifier. Colors may be enhanced, patterns may be perceived, and the user may feel connected to others and to the universe at large. On the negative side, users may become paranoid or feel as if they are dying.
 
CAUTION & DISCLAIMER #
 
Erowid's effects information is a summary of data gathered from users, research, and other resources. This information is intended to describe the range of effects people report experiencing. Effects may vary dramatically from one person to another or one experience to another based on a variety of factors such as body chemistry, age, gender, physical health, dose, form of material, etc.

LSZ
 
Dose
 
by Erowid
 
LSZ (Lysergic acid 2,4-dimethylazetidide) is extremely potent, like its chemical cousin LSD. LSZ is detectably active below 50 micrograms (ug) and strongly active over 100 or 200 ug. 
 
 
DOSAGE DESCRIPTION #
 
Caution : Dose information should not be taken as recommendations. [ see below ]
 
**LSZ Dosages**
**Oral**
**( very tentative )**
- Threshold: 10 ug
- Light: 50 - 100 ug
- Common: 100 - 300 ug
- Strong: 200+ ug
 
LSZ is an ergoloid most commonly found on blotter. LSZ has three stereoisomers and one of the three is substantially more potent than the other three. A racemic mixture of LSZ (not stereo pure for the most potent S,S isomer) will have different effective dosages than S,S-pure LSZ. 
 
 Extreme caution and care must be used if it is ever encountered as a powder/crystal, though that form is rare and has not been seen in retail markets. Most or all LSZ in 2013/2014 has been available as blotter.
 
NOTES #
 
Because LSZ's first widespread commercial availability was in mid 2013, there are only a small number of reports of human use. Dose information must be considered tentative. Although most reports indicate dosage similar to or lower than (more potent than) LSD, it's possible that a small number of people are unusually sensitive or insensitive to LSZ.
 
CAUTION & DISCLAIMER #
 
Every individual reacts differently to every chemical. 
 
 Erowid's dosage information is a summary of data gathered from users, research, and other resources. This information is intended to describe the range of dosages people report using. It should not be construed as a recommendation of any sort. Individuals can respond very differently to the same dosage. What is safe for one can be deadly for another.

**Lysergic acid 2,4-dimethylazetidide** (also known as **λ** , **Lambda** , and **LSZ** ) is a synthetic [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) chemical class which produces [LSD-like](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD#Subjective_effects) [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) .

In the 2000s, a team led by [David E. Nichols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_E._Nichols) at Purdue University set to develop a rigid analog of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) with the diethylamide group constrained into an azetidine ring in order to map the binding site at the [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) .

LSZ has little to no history of human usage prior to 2012 when it appeared on some [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) markets in the UK. LSZ later gained international popularity through a small cluster of mail-order novel psychedelic shops that appeared in 2012. There have also been several unconfirmed reports of LSZ being synthesized in illicit laboratories and distributed on blotter paper or in liquid solution under names such as "Diazedine" and "λ" (or "Lambda").

LSZ is not considered to be addictive or physiologically toxic. Nevertheless, adverse psychological reactions such as severe [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) are always possible, particularly among those predisposed to mental illness. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction#Hallucinogens) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

LSZ, or d-lysergic acid 2,4-dimethylazetidide, is a semi-synthethic alkaloid of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) famiy. It contains a core structure of lysergic acid with an amine functional group bound to R N of the chemical structure. This core polycyclic structure is an indole derivative, and has [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) and [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) groups embedded within it.

The structure contains a bicyclic hexahydroindole fused to a bicyclic quinoline group (lysergic acid). At carbon 8 of the quinoline, an amide group is bound. Additionally, the substitutions of the terminal nitrogen atom of the amide group form a 2,4-dimethylazetidide group. LSZ is additionally substituted at carbon 6 with a methyl group.

There are three possible stereoisomers around the azetidine ring with the (S,S)-(+) isomer being the most active. It is slightly more potent than LSD itself in drug discrimination tests using trained rats.

## Pharmacology

LSZ likely acts as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . The [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from LSZ's efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptors. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational LSZ do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because LSZ is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people within the psychonaut community who have tried LSZ suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

LSZ is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of LSZ is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). LSZ presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that all psychedelics will have a reduced effect after the consumption of LSZ.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of LSZ. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals.

LSZ, also known as lysergic acid 2,4-dimethylazetidide or as LA-Azetidide (LA-Az), is a psychedelic drug of the lysergamide family related to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). It is taken orally.
The drug acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. It also interacts with dopamine receptors. The compound is a close analogue of LSD that has been modified at the amide to be more rigid and to have three diastereomers. LA-SS-Az, the (S,S)- isomer, is the most potent and similar isomer to LSD, and is the typically employed form of LSZ. LA-SS-Az and the other isomers of LSZ produce psychedelic-like effects in animals.
LSZ was first described in the scientific literature by David E. Nichols and colleagues in 2002. It was developed as a tool for studying psychedelic interactions with the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and followed the earlier unstable compound LA-Aziridine developed by Nichols and Robert Oberlender. LSZ, under the name "diazedine", may have been produced on a small scale by the LSD manufacturers William Leonard Pickard and Gordon Todd Skinner around the year 2000. It was first definitely encountered as a novel designer drug in 2013 and then became a popular psychedelic. LSZ is a controlled substance in several European countries.

## Use and effects

LSZ, as the (S,S)- isomer LA-SS-Az, has been reported to have a dose range of 100 to 200 μg or 100 to 300 μg orally, with a typical dose estimate of 150 or 200 μg. This dose range is notably higher than that of LSD, which is 50 to 200 μg with a typical dose of about 100 μg. According to David E. Nichols however, LSZ is approximately equipotent with LSD based on human anecdotal reports. The duration of LSZ is reported to be in the range of 3 to 11 hours, with a median duration of around 8 hours. This was shorter than the duration of the LSD prodrug 1P-LSD, which had a duration range of 6 to 14 hours and a median duration of about 10 hours in the same study. The detailed effects of LSZ, aside from it being a psychedelic similarly to LSD, do not appear to have been reported in the published literature.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

LSZ has been found to bind non-selectively to serotonin, dopamine, and certain other receptors. It shows especially high affinity for the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C receptors, among others. The drug acts as a potent agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, with potency and efficacy similar to that of LSD. It may be more potent than LSD as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor.
LSZ produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic-like effects, in rodents. It shows about the same potency as LSD and AL-LAD in producing this effect. However, LSZ shows a weaker maximal head-twitch response than LSD or AL-LAD. This might be due to lower efficacy at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor or stronger actions at other receptors like the serotonin 5-HT1A or 5-HT2C receptor. LSZ also substitutes for LSD in rodent drug discrimination tests. It was about 1.8-fold more potent than LSD in this assay. All three isomers of LSZ fully substituted for LSD in rodent drug discrimination tests, but the (S,S)- isomer was the most potent and was the only isomer that was more potent than LSD. In addition, only the (S,S) isomer fully substituted for the LSD-like selective serotonin 5-HT1A receptor full agonist and partial ergoline LY-293284. In contrast to LSZ, LSD itself does not substitute for LY-293284 in drug discrimination tests.
In addition to its psychedelic effects, LSZ has been found to produce anti-inflammatory effects in preclinical research.

### Pharmacokinetics

The in-vitro metabolism of LSZ has been studied.

## Chemistry

LSZ, also known as lysergic acid 2,4-dimethylazetidide or as LA-Azetidine (LA-Az), is a substituted lysergamide derivative related to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). It is the analogue of LSD in which the N,N-diethylamide moiety has been replaced with an 2,4-dimethylazetidine moiety. The compound has three possible diastereomers around the azetidine ring, including the cis-(2RS,4SR)-, trans-(2R,4R)-, and trans-(2S,4S)- 2,4-dimethylazetidine isomers. The (S,S)- isomer, also known as LA-SS-Az, is the most potent diastereomer and is the typically employed form of the compound.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of LSZ has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of LSZ include other lysergamides like the 6-substituted lysergamides ETH-LAD, PRO-LAD, AL-LAD, and CE-LAD; the amide-substituted lysergamides LA-3Cl-SB, EcPLA, and MiPLA; the amide-cycilzed lysergamides LA-Aziridine, LA-Pyr (LPD-824), LPN, LA-Pip, LA-Morph (LSM-775), and LA-Azepane; and the ester prodrugs ALD-52 (1A-LSD), 1P-LSD, 1cP-LSD, 1V-LSD, 1B-LSD, 1P-ETH-LAD, and 1cP-AL-LAD, among others.

## History

LSZ was developed by David E. Nichols and colleagues at Purdue University and was first described by them in the scientific literature in 2002. It was developed to help better understand the binding orientation of LSD at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and to help further map the topography of the receptor. LSZ is a rigid analogue of LSD in which the N,N-diethylamide moiety has been replaced with and constrained into a 2,4-dimethylazetidine moiety. Moreover, the compound has two additional chiral centers due to this modification, with three possible diastereomers.
Nichols and colleagues like Robert Oberlender had initially attempted to do this research by employing the closely related and very similar compound LA-Aziridine in the 1980s, but this drug proved to be highly chemically unstable such that in-vivo studies were precluded. With the development of LSZ, the team determined that the (S,S)- isomer, LA-SS-Az, was the most potent and hence most optimal configuration of LSZ in terms of serotonin 5-HT2A receptor activation and psychedelic-like effects in animals. In addition, the conformation of LSD within the crystal structure of the closely related serotonin 5-HT2B receptor was later found to be essentially superimposable with the structure of LA-SS-Az. Similar findings were made with virtual docking studies with the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. LSZ, as LA-SS-Az, is among the only known analogues of LSD modified at the amide to have similar or greater psychedelic-type potency.
According to Krystle Cole in an interview with journalist and researcher Hamilton Morris, the LSD clandestine manufacturers William Leonard Pickard and Gordon Todd Skinner had synthesized and experimented with a psychedelic drug they called "diazedine" around the year 2000. Per Cole, "[diazedine] was also crazy, but nothing earth-shattering". Pickard and Skinner had high expectations for the drug and intended to produce and distribute it as an LSD alternative, but had difficulty scaling its synthesis due to high production costs and low yields. Pickard was a student of Nichols in his lab at Purdue University and was aware of the work on LSZ before it was published. Morris has speculated that "diazedine" (notably a contraction of "dimethylazetidine") is extremely likely to have been LSZ, although this remains unconfirmed. There have also been rumors for many years that LSZ was distributed for a time on blotter paper under the name "λ" ("lambda"), though this has likewise not been confirmed.
LSZ was first definitely encountered as a novel designer drug, in Europe, in December 2013. It is known to have been produced and sold by the now-defunct psychedelic lysergamide manufacturer Lizard Labs in the 2010s and 2020s. The drug is said to have become a popular psychedelic drug and alternative to other lysergamides like LSD following its initial emergence.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Europe

LSZ is illegal in Switzerland as of December 2015, in Denmark as of May 2015, and in Sweden as of January 2016. It is also illegal in France.

#### United Kingdom

On June 10, 2014, the United Kingdom Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) recommended that LSZ be specifically named in the UK Misuse of Drugs Act as a class A drug despite not identifying any harm associated with its use. The United Kingdom Home office accepted this advice and announced a ban of the substance to be enacted on 6 January 2015 as part of the Misuse of Drugs Act amended in 2014.

## Research

LSZ has been patented as a potential anti-inflammatory drug by Charles D. Nichols and colleagues.
