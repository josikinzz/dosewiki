**2-Fluoroethamphetamine** ( **2-FEA** ) is a novel [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) class that produces classical stimulant effects such as [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [enhanced focus](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement) and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Route_of_administration) .

The exact effects of 2-FEA are not well known by its users with anecdotal reports suggesting only minimal activity and possible serotonergic qualities.

2-FEA is sold on the online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market. It is strongly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

2-Fluoroethamphetamine (2-FEA) is a synthetic molecule of the [substituted amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) class. Molecules of the amphetamine class contain a phenethylamine core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH2) group through an ethyl chain with an additional methyl substitution at R α (i.e., amphetamines are alpha-methylated phenethylamines). 2-FEA contains an ethyl group bound to the terminal amine R N of the amphetamine core.

2-FEA is the N-ethylated homolog of [2-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FA) (2-fluoroamphetamine).

## Pharmacology

2-FEA has not yet been formally studied to the same extent as traditional [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamines) . Currently, it is assumed that it most likely acts primarily as a triple [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) , and that it releases the neurotransmitters: [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) . 2-FEA likely creates it effects by acting as a releasing agent of said neurotransmitters and/or by binding to- and partially blocking the transporter proteins that normally clear substances from the [synaptic cleft,](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaptic_cleft) after they have fulfilled their function of conducting a neural impulse.

## Subjective effects

The effects of 2-FEA appear to be very subtle and difficult to characterize. Some reports suggest it is relatively mild and free of side effects in a similar fashion to [2-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FA) , while others note an increase in physical side effects or serotonergic activity reminiscent of [3-FEA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-FEA) .

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** and **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - 2-FEA is reported to produce a paradoxical combination of sedating and stimulating effects. The sedating aspects are perhaps attributable to serotonin release. The stimulating effects are typically more prominent at dosages in and above the strong dosage range and tend to become prominent after the peak effects have subsided.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)**
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)**
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Bronchodilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bronchodilation)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Dry mouth](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dry_mouth)**
- **[Frequent urination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frequent_urination)**
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)**
- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)**
- **[Restless legs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Restless_legs)** ### Visual effects
 
- The visual effects of 2-FEA are usually less consistent and only mildly noticeable at higher dosages. They are somewhat comparable to [deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriants) and occur more readily in darker areas. 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** *( [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Morphing) )* - This effect is usually subtle and barely noticeable and only occurs at higher dosages or when combined with [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) .
- **[Brightness alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brightness_alteration)** - 2-FEA can make spaces seem brighter as a result of its pupil dilating effects.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)** - This effect occurs very rarely, and typically only when the user has taken high doses, is coming down, or has been awake for unusually long periods. It is usually very mild when it does occur. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of 2-FEA are generally very subtle and consist of mild to moderate stimulation. 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** & **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - This effect typically occurs with overly high doses or after redosing and staying awake for extended periods of time.
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation)**
- **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought organization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_organization)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - This can be described as the experience of time speeding up and passing much quicker than it usually would when sober. ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)**
- **[Depersonalization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depersonalization)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 2-FEA use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 2-FEA has a very limited history of human usage.

Anecdotal reports from those who have tried 2-FEA suggest that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this substance at low to moderate doses by itself or using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , the chronic use of 2-FEA can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of 2-FEA develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 2-FEA presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of 2-FEA all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Stimulants** - 2-FEA can be potentially dangerous in combination with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) as it can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with 2-FEA should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - 2-FEA may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.
- **MDMA** - The neurotoxic effects of MDMA may be increased when combined with [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) .

- **[MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs)** - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , and some [antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressants) .
- **Cocaine** - This combination may increase strain on the heart.

## Legal status

2-FEA is currently a gray area compound within all parts of the world, meaning its regulation lies in a legal gray area and that it is not known to be specifically illegal ("scheduled") within any country. However, people may still be charged for its possession under certain circumstances such as under analogue laws and with the intent to sell or consume.

- **Canada** : 2-FEA would be considered Schedule I as it is an analogue of Amphetamine.
- **France** : As of december 2024, 2-FEA is not explicitly scheduled. It is thus legal to possess, although in a grey area.
- **Germany** : 2-FEA is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of November 26, 2016. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.
- **New Zealand** : 2-FEA is an amphetamine analogue, so is a Schedule 3 controlled substance in New Zealand.
- **The Netherlands:** 2-FEA is currently legal, but it is part of a substance group that may be banned soon as part of a recently passed law on New Psychoactive Substances (NPS).
- **Switzerland** : 2-FEA can be considered a controlled substance as a defined derivative of a-methylphenethylamine under Verzeichnis E point 130. It is legal when used for scientific or industrial use.
- **United Kingdom** : 2-FEA is considered a Class A drug as a result of the amphetamine analogue clause of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

2-Furylethylamine (2-FEA or FEA) is a drug of the arylalkylamine family related to the substituted phenethylamines such as β-phenethylamine (PEA) and amphetamine. It is known to have similar pressor effects as amphetamine and strong constricting effects on the uterus in animals. The psychoactive effects of FEA in humans are unknown.
Derivatives of FEA include α-Me-FEA (furylisopropylamine) and α,N-Me-FEA, among others. α-Me-FEA was less several-fold potent than amphetamine in animals and showed limited effects in humans. Analogues of FEA, besides β-phenethylamine (PEA) and amphetamine (α-Me-PEA), include TH-FEA, α-Me-TH-FEA, ThEA, thiopropamine (α-Me-ThEA), 3-ThEA, 2-(2-pyrrolyl)ethylamine (NEA), and α-Me-NEA, among others. Some of them are known to be active.
FEA was first synthesized by 1920. FEA and analogues were studied by Gordon Alles and colleagues, who discovered its pressor effects. FEA is not a controlled substance in the United States as of 2011.
