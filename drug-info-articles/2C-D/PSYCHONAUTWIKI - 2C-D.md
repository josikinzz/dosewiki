**2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylphenethylamine** (also known as **2C-M** , **LE-25** and more commonly as **2C-D** ) is a synthetic [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) chemical class that produces short-lived [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . Its sensory and cognitive effects profile has been described as being the most similar to that of [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) among members of the [2C-x family](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x_family) , albeit with a significantly shorter duration.

The synthesis of 2C-D was first published in 1970 by a team from the Texas Research Institute of Mental Sciences. Initial trials by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) at sub-threshold doses in humans were carried out in 1964.

Many anecdotal reports suggest that it is calmer, easier to handle and more comfortable on the body than other closely related [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) . While not especially visual or physically euphoric at common doses, it is reported to be very lucid, analytical and unimpaired in its headspace - a quality it retains even as the dose is increased.

Lower doses of 2C-D (generally 10 mg or less) have been explored for its use as a potential [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) , albeit with mixed results.

Today, 2C-D is used both recreationally and as an [entheogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogen) . It is rarely sold on the streets and almost exclusively distributed as a gray area [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) by online vendors.

## History and culture

The synthesis of 2C-D was first published in 1970 by a team from the Texas Research Institute of Mental Sciences, , but initial trials by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) at sub-threshold doses were carried out in 1964. Further investigations at higher doses were carried out by Shulgin and his fellow researchers between 1974 and 1978. The name '2C-D' derives from the chemical's structure - it is the 2-Carbon analogue of [DOM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOM) .

Shulgin notably referred to 2C-D as a “pharmacological tofu,” meaning it can extend or potentiate the effect of other substances without overly coloring the experience, in a manner similar to how tofu absorbs the flavors of sauces or spices it is cooked with. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] While some use this as evidence that 2C-D is relatively uninteresting as a psychedelic on its own, others strongly disagree with this assessment and hold that 2C-D is an unusually versatile and fully-fledged [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) in its own right.

Despite showing promise as a very functional psychostimulant with successful studies investigating the use in psychotherapy in Germany, 2C-D has not found widespread use. This has been argued to be due to the previously limited diversity of substances on the market - a consumer dynamic which has changed significantly with the advent of the internet - allowing a broader freedom of choice for explorers of psychedelic phenethylamines. Of these, it tends to be substantially harder to find and notably more expensive by weight. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Chemistry

2C-D, or 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenethylamine, is a substituted [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain. 2C-D contains methoxy functional groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 as well as a methyl group attached to carbon R 4 of the phenyl ring.

2C-D belongs to the 2C family of phenethylamines which contain methoxy groups on the 2 and 5 positions of the benzene ring.

## Pharmacology

2C-D's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

The head space of 2C-D is described by many as being lucid, insightful and relatively normal in its thought processes even at moderate to high doses. The feeling of unaltered consciousness may be unsatisfying to users who want an intense experience because the head space is fairly normal, stable and therefore sometimes uninteresting to those who are new to hallucinogenic experiences.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, the 2C-D experience begins with mild sedation that gives way to moderate stimulation as the experience progresses. It lacks the forceful energetic push associated with most psychedelic [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) .
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of 2C-D can be described as a pleasurable, all-encompassing comfort sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)** - Whilst at lower doses one may find that their bodily control is enhanced, at higher dosages it seems to become suppressed.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - In comparison to other [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) such as [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , any nausea produced by this substance tends to be very mild and dissipates quickly even with higher dosages.
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)** ### Visual effects
 
- Compared to other members of the 2C-x family like [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , the visual effects of 2C-D have been noted for being understated until heavier doses are reached. After this point, a full spectrum of hallucinatory visual phenomena begin to appear. 
#### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as low in detail, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and realistic in style.
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Colour tinting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_tinting)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Recursion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recursion)**
- **[Diffraction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diffraction)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry of 2C-D be described as more similar in appearance to that of [DOM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOM) or [25D-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25D-NBOMe) than that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) . It can be comprehensively described as structured in its organization, organic in style, intricate in complexity, large in style, slow and smooth in motion, colorful in scheme, bright in color, blurred in its edges and equally rounded and angular in its corners. It gives off a natural feel at higher dosages. While the final level of 2C-D geometry has yet to be formally confirmed, it seems more likely that it would result in states of [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) visual geometry over [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - In comparison to other psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , 2C-D is low in hallucinations embedded within visual geometry. However, when it does occur this particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, and interactive in style.
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - 2C-D is capable of external hallucinations embedded within visual geometry. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They can be described as external in their manifestation, lucid in believability, and fixed in style. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection)**

- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects

- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: 2C-D](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_2CD.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 2C-D use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 2C-D is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal evidence from those within the community who have tried 2C-D suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

2C-D is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 2C-D is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 2C-D presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 2C-D all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 2C-D. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
