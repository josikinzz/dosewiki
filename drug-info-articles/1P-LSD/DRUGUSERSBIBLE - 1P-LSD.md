## Subjective Experience

When 1P-LSD appeared on the markets towards the end of 2014 it was immediately
recognised that its effects were identical, or near identical, to those of LSD itself.

This was also my experience. Thus, in logging my personal research, it is difficult,
perhaps impossible, to add a new perspective to the countless reports and
monologues that have been produced over the years. Instead, I will simply map
generic features and insights, rather than delve into the content or substance of any
single or specific trip.

As with most chemicals of this class, I procured the tabs directly from Lizard Labs,
which already had a reputation for bringing high quality and novel psychedelics to
the online market. IP-LSD was to become its most well known creation, and was
widely distributed through other vendors.

As usual with dosage, I started small and built up. In fact I started very small, with a
microdose.

Herein lies another dimension to this particular psychedelic: some people microdose
on a daily or regular basis. This is commonly claimed to enhance mental or visual
acuity or insight, to counter depression, to increase creativity or productivity, and so
forth.

That's an aside. My microdose tests were simply intended to dip my toe into the
water, to get a feel for the drug, and to gain some assurance regarding its quality and
safety.

As I built up the dose the experiences became richer and more influential. Music was
dramatically enhanced, as were computer visuals, and vision generally became more
interesting. There's something about the vibrancy of colouration on 1P-LSD or LSD
which seems to be a universal constant.

The headspace was always extremely pleasant, and a wonderful feeling of oneness
with the universe increased with dose. This is an aspect well worthy of focus in its
own right, as I found the same as virtually everyone else who has written on this
facet: specifically that nature is a truly wonderful place in which to experience it. I
frequently gazed around in astonishment, seeing, feeling, indeed witnessing, the
interconnectedness, of.... everything.

I recall, on one particular trip, stepping out into the garden during a warm sunny
evening. I was at one with nature, as the swarms swirled around plants and bushes,
all in perfect harmony. The sky was simply beautiful as clouds drifted effortlessly
across. At one point I lay horizontal on the grass and simply watched. Everything
evoked a sense of wonder, as I drank in an experience which was all around me.

Goodness knows what sort of spectacle I would have made had anyone been looking
through their window and witnessed my astonishment. It was a oneness that only
someone who has been there can possibly understand. I didn't just see it or hear it, I
was part of it, and actually felt the whole within myself.

This was an entirely different type of ego-shattering drama to the unfoldments of
ayahuasca, for example. It was beauty and bliss within its own boundless terms.

Words will always fail, and can never properly describe the quality or depths of the
sensations and perceptions which are unlocked. Indeed, I have experienced so many
beautiful moments, and I believe learned much, through the use of this remarkable
drug.

The onset of a typical 1P-LSD trip usually took about an hour, with indications that
changes were afoot beginning well before this. This was a gentle incline, barely
perceived during its early stages, with hints slowly manifesting here and there, and
steadily strengthening.

The duration was always lengthy, with the often quoted 8-12 hours not being far off
the mark. It should be noted that the peak was considerably shorter than this, and
fully functional control was always established well before the end.

Mild after effects of lassitude, and a feeling of being drained, sometimes persisted
into the next day. However, for me, these minor discomforts were always well worth
enduring, given the perceived positives and benefits which came with the overall
exercise.

## Reflection

There’s a neat video on YouTube, the chorus of which perfectly sums up the feeling I
experience following a 1P-LSD trip: “I wish I’d gone deeper but I’m not so brave”.

This is an unspoken desire to learn more, more quickly, by taking increasingly larger
doses. It is an intellectual challenge, tempered only by fear of the unknown, and the
length of the period of reduced social capacitation.

This innate curiosity and yearning to uncover mystery is what has driven me to
slowly push the boundaries, and indeed, to continue to explore this genre.
