*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25N-NBOMe*

25N-NBOMe, also known as 2C-N-NBOMe or NBOMe-2C-N, is a derivative of the hallucinogen 2C-N. The pharmacological properties of 25N-NBOMe have not been described in the scientific literature, but it is believed to act in a similar manner to related compounds such as 25I-NBOMe and 25C-NBOMe, which are potent agonists at the 5HT2A receptor. 25N-NBOMe has been sold as a street drug and has only been described in the literature in terms of identification by forensic analysis.

## Use and effects

The dose range of 25N-NBOMe has been given as 0.1 to 1.3 mg or more sublingually, with a typical dose estimate of 0.6 mg. Whereas 2C-N is much less potent in terms of dose than other 2C drugs, 25N-NBOMe appears to have a similar dose range as other NBOMe drugs.

### Pharmacodynamics

25N-NBOMe is a selective and highly potent agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors. Its affinities (Ki) are 0.144 nM at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, 8.7 nM at the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor, and 1.06 nM at the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor. In terms of affinity, the drug has approximately 7.4-fold selectivity for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor over the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor and 60-fold selectivity for the 5-HT2A receptor over the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor.
The EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration (EmaxTooltip maximal efficacy) values of 25N-NBOMe are 0.51 nM (87.9%) at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, 47 nM (57.6%) at the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor, and 1.32 nM (99.4%) at the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor. Hence, 25N-NBOMe is a full agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors and a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor. In terms of functional activity, 25N-NBOMe had 2.6-fold selectivity for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor over the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor and 92-fold selectivity for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor over the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor. 
In a 2023 study, the pharmacological properties of 25N-NBOMe (also referred to as compound 4) were extensively characterized using both in vitro and in vivo models. Radioligand binding assays showed high binding affinity for serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, with pKi values of 9.26 ± 0.15 at 5-HT2A, 8.35 ± 0.08 at 5-HT2B, and 8.16 ± 0.07 at 5-HT2C. The compound was also screened across more than 40 additional CNS targets and found to be highly selective for the 5-HT2 receptor subfamily.
In calcium flux functional assays, 25N-NBOMe was a potent full agonist at 5-HT2A (pEC50 = 9.50 ± 0.03; Emax = 94 ± 1%) and 5-HT2C (pEC50 = 9.07 ± 0.03; Emax = 102 ± 1%) receptors, while showing negligible agonist activity at 5-HT2B (Emax < 10%).
Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) functional assays measuring Gq dissociation and β-arrestin2 recruitment signaling indicated strong agonist activity at 5-HT2A, with Gq pEC50 = 9.69 ± 0.04 (Emax = 95.2 ± 1.2%) and β-arrestin2 recruitment pEC50 = 9.66 ± 0.09 (Emax = 136.5 ± 3.6%). This illustrates that 25N-NBOMe is a balanced 5-HT2A agonist across these pathways, in contrast to analogs like 25N-N1-Nap and 25N-NBPh which displayed functional selectivity or signaling bias for β-arrestin2 recruitment. For 5-HT2C, Gq pEC50 was 9.34 ± 0.08 (Emax = 100.0 ± 2.5%), while weak partial agonist activity was observed at 5-HT2B (pEC50 = 8.63 ± 0.14; Emax = 54.1 ± 2.5%).
In vivo, 25N-NBOMe induced a robust head-twitch response (HTR) in mice with an ED50 of 0.11 mg/kg (0.29 μmol/kg). Notably 25N-NBOMe produced the highest HTR frequency (4.890 counts per minute) among a panel of structurally related 25N analogs.
Unlike many other serotonergic psychedelics, 25N-NBOMe has shown reinforcing effects in rodents, including in terms of conditioned place preference (CPP) and self-administration. 25N-NBOMe has been found to increase phosphorylation of the dopamine transporter (DAT) in the striatum similarly to methamphetamine in rodents. DAT phosphorylation is associated with dopamine reverse transport and efflux, which in turn increases extracellular dopamine levels.
