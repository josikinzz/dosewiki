**Phenibut Discussion Thread**


I usually take 4,000mgs of Phenibut one day a week, usually Saturdays.


I have never taken that dose more than twice in a 5 day period out of fear of addiction because they say not to on the tub.


So I took 4,000mgs last Saturday (5 days ago) and want to again on Saturday as usual, but today being Wednesday and having a little mild Kratom WD I want to take approximately 2,000-2,500mgs of Phenibut to feel a bit better.


Am I likely to get addicted or get Phenibut withdrawal if do that and end up dosing approx. 10,000mgs over the course of a 7-8 day period and dose twice in a 3 day period???


I mean I've heard of people dosing 6,000mgs in a day and being fine so is that that different from 2,000-2,500 today and 4,000mgs in 3 days??


I should mention I also take Klonopin sometimes so I'd think that MIGHT lessen any discomfort I might feel?


Any answers as to whether or not this would be going overboard are appreciated.

Nobody??


I'm thinking taking such a little bit extra within a few days isn't a big deal but I want opinions from some Phenibut users.


I know some people use this stuff more than recommended but I'm trying to be very careful and rarely take it more than once a week except for this one time so I want to know if it's ok or if I'm likely to have withdrawal if I take 2,500mgs today (I already did) and then take 4,000mgs again in 3 days (and then none again for another week).


Thanks

you're just asking for problems the more and more you take it, especially since you stated you also take klonopin. you're looking for persmission to use more than you normally do from the internet, if you're worried to begin with and are asking bluelight, you already have your answer imo. be safe

Be careful with it.  That amount won't likely put you in WD, but it is easy to get into a habit with phenibut where there are diminishing returns but ya take it anyway.  For example, the other day I made a thread asking for help with tapering my 5 gram a day habit and no one responded at all.  Don't get addicted to it man, it sucks and doesn't work like it used to.  Be careful.

I never would take more than 1g of Phenibut a day, and would not exceed 1.5g or in rare cases 2g/week. The rebound effects should not be underestimated. The GABA-system is nothing to fuck with, because in contrast to most/all other habits the withdrawal can be hazardous, so better not even start this path or if anything take high doses of l-theanine instead.

I've been taking 4,000mgs every Saturday and no more than that or more often than that for several months now with no issues.


It even says on the back of the tub not to exceed 4,000mgs (4 grams) a week meaning that that amount is ok.


I just don't see it as likely that I'd get withdrawal from having taken 2,500mgs in the middle of the week in addition to my normal dosing pattern one time only.

I am.


Honestly, I don't like it enough to let myself get addicted and I already know how addictive it is from how much I've read about it which is why I am asking.


My main enjoyment I get out of it is simply that it potentiates Kratom so well and I really like Kratom.


There's no way in HELL I'd let myself get addicted to Phenibut.

Why would I be asking for problems MORE than most people because I take Klonopin??


Would Klonopin be more likely to lessen any mild WD symptoms if I ever got any because it is also a GABAergic??


I'm NOT looking for permission to BEGIN using it more often than once in a week in the future, just like i always have, just looking for info on whether or not it's likely that the fact that I took one mid-week dose this time would lead to withdrawal.


I don't think it's really very likely that it would be enough to do that based on what I know...so really...my asking BL hasn't already given me my answer....

Also, if I dose on Saturday and I WERE to notice any withdrawal symptoms (I hope I don't if I do decide to dose).....how quickly would they show up??


24 hours??


A few days??

Ok, so that's 6,000mgs a week, and if I take 4,000mgs on Saturday as usual, that will have been 6,500mgs this week, same as you basically, and only exceeding the highest weekly dosage mentioned on the tub by 2,500mgs, which probably isn't that much all things considered.


I don't think that's over usage.


Not like the people using it every day or every other day or exceeding 10,000 or more milligrams per week, and ESPECIALLY seeing as this is the only time I will take a mid week dose.


I'm assuming withdrawal should not occur from having had one 2,500mgs mid week dose in addition to my normal dosing pattern that has proven safe and non-habit forming thus far.

No, klonopin wouldn't necessarily keep phenibut withdrawl at bay. One works on gaba A and one works on gaba B, so, theoretically, they shouldn't help each other with withdrawl. Im not saying you should use it every day, but if you do get an addiction its not that difficult to taper from. Not in my opinion, at least. I know that's not the "pc" type of thing to say, but I honestly don't see what the big stink is about tapering off of it. Granted I didn't have some colossal 10 gram a day habit like I see some people getting. God I cant even imagine using that much. But I was at about 2 grams a day for a few months and it wasn't that hard to taper down.

**Phenibut and sub lingual nicotine smoking cessation, or switching ROA**


Help my esmoker broke down and I'm not intending to step back to regular cigarettes which are nasty so since I have plenty of different of flavor low potency juice I was planning on using it sublingual at small doses somewhere between 500 microgram and 2 milligram . The phenibut will help with reducing stress and the craving for nicotine that arises as a result of stress. Also should take care of nightmares and weird dreams.


What's the highest dose of phenibut I should shoot for if I want to avoid physical dependency as a result of a 3-4 day stint

I enjoyed Phenibut when I first received my order and started playing around with the doses to find my "sweet spot", which certainly took longer than most compounds for me. Maybe it's my tolerance to gabapentoids, because I've been on gabapentin/pregabalin for years, but I don't take them often anymore (haven't even picked up my refill for gaba). I found a rectally administrated dose of 0.75-1g to be on point for me, after reading ebola?'s suggestion on an old thread. Intrarectal Phenibut had way less side-effects/nausea in comparison to oral ROA, as well as noticeable effects in ~20 mins IME. 


Has anyone else had any lower-back pain/aching the day after taking Phenibut? It's in my lower back, like my kidneys are aching. I've read that some think it's UT/kidney-related, which makes sense to me considering my experiences. Could the vendor I was going through just have low-grade Phenibut? Or has anyone else had this issue consistently?

I will sometimes experience GI issues with phenibut if I eat greasy foods with it or drink alcohol. Really not sure whether or not it does damage to liver/kidneys or not since there aren't any studies that I know of to back that up.


It's crazy to me when I hear of people taking anything over 1.5 grams with zero tolerance. Lately I have been taking 1 gram every other day following a cycle period suggested by Phenibut God, but notice the tolerance build even from that so I may try a three or four day washout period to bring tolerance back to baseline and to see how I feel.


One amazing benefit I have experinced from phenibut that I was not expecting...it seems to be healing my chronic muscle stiffness/pain. For the last six months I have struggled with carpal tunnel like symptoms from an overuse muscle injury I experienced while working over an extended period of time. My pain and stiffness is practially GONE, and this includes on days that I do not take it. Now I know it stays in your system for a while but I read an article on how phenibut may actually help to heal damaged muscles by increasing human growth hormones.

I had a love affair with Phenibut years ago. I took it a lot so if you're easily addicted, try to stay away. It potentiates Kratom and Klonopin. So you don't want to take a high dose of phenibut while using Kratom or Klonopin. Phenibut used to make me feel as good as etizolam. I don't use it anymore, but I might order some for whenever I run out of etizolam. My only use for it would be to stop withdrawals. I'm not addicted anymore, but it was the best drug. Be careful. People who don't know any better, take way too much and get nauseous and vomit. When you take too much of it and feel sick, you will feel sick the majority of the day because it lasts long. It's not a drug to mess around with carelessly. People need to know it kicks in in 

2-4 hours so don't take more if you think it's not working. You'll be sorry. 


Withdrawals were frightening. I'm trying to remember how I got through it, probably with Klonopin to taper off. Both work on GABA.

Phenibut does seem to effect your kidneys and I also get weird gastro problems in my tummy...when I used to take it. I honestly think it's toxic. It's best to stick to a lower dose.

While I respect your opinion I've now combined up to 4,000mgs of Phenibut with 1.5mgs of Klonopin and probably about an ounce of Kratom in a day at times with no problems.


I should mention that I  ALWAYS spread my Phenibut dosages out.


I usually like to start with 3,200mgs as my first dose and since I feel it takes about 2 hours to kick in I won't take more till about 3 hours after the first dose, then I usually take around 200mgs to put me up to 3,400...wait another 2 1/2--3 hours  and take maybe another 200---350 mgs...then an hour or two after that kicks in ramp it up to 4,000mgs before bed.


I just do it that way since the tub says you can take up to 4,000mgs safely so being the druggie I am I push it to that limit but I do NOT exceed it and I have NEVER taken even a TINY bit more than 4,000mgs in a 24 hour period.


I take Klonopin 5-6 days a week and I haven't felt it potentiate it much but i HAVE felt it potentiate Kratom and it's remarkable and great.


I think people just need to be  SUPER strict about not exceed the 4,000mgs in a day mark and dont' take them all at once if you do decide to because if they are spread out you will be more likely to feel ok.


I can spread out 4,000mgs over 8 hours and feel fine but if I even took 3,600mgs in one shot I'd be falling asleep.


And I would NEVER EVER exceed 2 days  a week or 8,000mgs in a week on two separate days.


I think I may have a larger tolerance naturally than the people who say not to take more than 1,500 mgs  because the first time I EVER took it I start in the 2,000mgs range and still finished my night at 4,000mgs and woke up feeling fine the next day.


I don't think withdrawal is likely to occur if people stick to these guidelines.


Oh, and most probably don't take melatonin on here but I take it every night so let me tell you...usually phenibut leaves me feeling very good the next day even if I didn't sleep more than 5-6 hours because I have heard that is an effect it has for some odd  reason I can't explain....BUT, if you take Melatonin don't be exceeding about 3 millileters if you combine it with Phenibut or if you are like me you will NOT feel good the next day...


When I take Phenibut if I keep my Melatonin at night to 3 milileters or less I wake up feeling fine.


Of course, these are  just my current tolerances based probably on weight, age, usage and all other sorts of shit so don't take my word for it.


BUT....Phenibut is not some horrible thing IF you are smart enough to stick to guidelines.


Pinpoints thread "My Phenibut Affair" did the GREAT job of scaring the SHIT out of me early and convinced me to NEVER use this stuff more than twice a week and I KNOW now I never will.


If people could just be sufficiently scared away from excessive use  (and be able to really know what "excessive use"  is) they can stay safe.


I truly believe from my experience thus far that Phenibut is one of those drugs where "the dose makes the poison" is ESPECIALLY REALLY TRUE.


To me personally, it feels like something almost TOTALLY fine kept to one or two days a week  MAX at the dosages I mentioned, and I bet if you even slightly go over that you'll be in a  WORLD of hell.


I would be scared of it if I thought I'd fuck up and use more, but I know i won't...so please guys, be smart.

Tolerance to most drugs is sort of a random or hard to explain thing.


I've been using Phenibut no more than once a week for 1 year and my first day over a year ago I started at 2,000mgs and finished the night falling asleep after getting it up to 4,000mgs and was ok.


Mind you I could NEVER take more than 3,400mgs max in one shot and feel ok....but I usually start with 3,200 mgs as a good starter dose and my sweet spot is usually 3,400mgs.


I tend to finish my nights by gradually getting up to that 4,000 mark as that really knocks me out and the tub says not to exceed 4,000mgs in a 7 day period so since I usually don't exceed one day a week and NEVER two...I  feel safe spreading it out...but for ME I feel like some of my Phenibut doses start to wayn (spelling?) in intensity after  2 hours, so that is why I will keep taking more till I go to sleep.


Some drugs just effect different people in odd ways.


But as I mentioned in my last post, I REALLY feel like the quote "the dose makes the poison" is true of Phenibut.


I'm not scared of even taking up to 4,000mgs on two separate days in a week (8,000mgs total)....or for that matter PROBABLY not even 8,000mgs spread out however you want to over 7 days (though FOR ME i feel a little unsettled not doing it only in 2 days IF  I do it that way...)  BUT....I really truly believe if you exceed that by even a small amount you are entering a serious danger zone.


By reading Pinpoint's "My Phenibut Affair" thread I was sufficiently scared and I really think I have this down now at a safe point where I won't get myself in to trouble.


Never underestimate the power of fear guys.


If you are too scared of the effects of exceeding a certain dosage...you probably wont and will probably be ok....

I don't know what kind of phenibut you are using...but I have never heard of that being a normal or okay dose. No offense, I just don't want someone who has never taken phenibut before to think that 4 grams is an okay amount start with because that is absurd. I started with two grams my very first time and it was WAY TOO MUCH.

> Taken into account your gaba tolerance already with the benzos this makes more sense. But like I said, there is no reason you should ever need 4 grams of phenibut in one day unless you have an insane tolerance. 1 gram is plenty for a beginner, maybe 1.5 if you weigh over 200 lbs, assuming you have no tolerance to any other gaba like drugs. Phenibut is an extremely potent drug and takes a long time to come into full effect.

Ok after reading your last post you seem to get it.


Listen man, I know you mean well but dosage and tolerance are not the same for everyone and I'm not a noob either having been doing Phenibut for a year now.


I know how it effects me so I wanted to respond to let you and others know that these dosages are something to pay attention to INDIVIDUALLY because what one person says doesn't go for others.


If I took 1,500mgs which is your favorite dose, I  would only feel a very little bit.


It would be a nice buzz for sure, but not much more.


2,500mgs gets me good for a while...but 3,200mgs in one shot is how i feel just right.


The remaining 800mgs is spread out VERY slowly with the intention ONLY of putting me to sleep knowing I am NOT going ANYWHERE or driving AT ALL the rest of the night and all of that is over the course of hours.


None of us have this stuff down to a science.


Like I said I CANNOT take 4,000 mgs, or even 3,600mgs in one shot and feel too good, but if I take less than  2,000mgs in one shot it will be pretty minor and almost not worth doing...maybe worth doing for a slight buzz at best.


I don't know all the factors the effect tolerance.


Like Phenibut is a GABA B drug and so is alcohol and I have a MASSIVE alcohol tolerance so who is to say that having a big tolerance to drinking might not increase your tolerance to Phenibut????


It might or might not.


Anyways man....I am agreeing with you that we all need to be careful.


I'm more concerned with  those who steadily take  small daily doses  and  get addicted than those who take larger doses one or two days a  week.


That has always been my way:  I'm a binge user of drugs but  then I abstain for as long as possible.


That isn't always smart BUT...it has the benefit of going many days without a drug IF...you are able to be ok off of your initial binge dose of your drug.


So far...with Phenibut  this has been ok for me with NOT exceeding the 4,000mgs dose on the tub.


I read that warning on there and I listened to it.


I wasn't just doing this off the top of my head.


I'm glad we've got a thread for this drug now.


It's a very interesting compound.

I just got a small amount (25g) of Phenibut Hcl powder today. I'm completely new to this stuff, never used it before, so maybe some of you can help me out..


First off, it seems the standard starting dosage for good effects is around .75g-1g. However I too, take clonazepam every day, but I"m thinking that since Phenibut is a GABAb agonist, that there wouldn't really be much cross tolerance? 


Also, on a little side note, I remember initially when creating this thread, there was someone who was saying that Phenibut was *not* a GABAb agonist, but rather worked in a way more comparable to Gabapentin/Pregabalin? 


Anyway, I passed out before I could complete this post-but I just took 1.2g orally. I guess I'm just looking for some people experiences with dosages as well as the effects, though I'll surely find out myself within the next couple of hourse

**The truth about Phenibut**


I've read a lot of things about Phenibut and frankly it annoyed me how miss informed they are. I've been reading about people taking doses like 300-500mg. This dose won't do anything. Maybe if it's your very first time then I can see how someone might see some effects. I personally take 10 grams a day, yes 10grams. At this dose it completely abolishes any and all anxieties especially socially. When I take this does I can talk to anyone about anything when without it I would be filled with fear and anxiety and not want to talk to anyone and life's obstacles seem like some huge monster. It makes you a motivated beast. I've been taking this dose every single day for years  just about and I have never had any kind of tolerance issue or negative side affects. Frankly, a high dose of Phenibut turns you into a confident and very sociable person who doesn't stress about anything and can handle anything. It's really a super drug. Any dose over 12.5 grams however you will experience some nasty side effect and you won't get the results I've stated above. You must drink a good amount of caffeine with it however for you to feel its maximum effects. For example I drink two rockstars every day with it and maybe some coffee later. Because of its absolutely unbearable taste I always mix it with cranberry juice. I do 5 grams in one cup and 5 in the next. For best results wait 10-15 minutes between drinks. Slowly build up to 10 grams because If u go too fast and take to much for your tolerance it will make you vomit all day long. Try upping the dose by a gram or two everyday.  Do not take Phenibut with any opiates or benzos. Opiates will make you vomit all day mixed with Phenibut. Mixing benzos with it is not a good idea either from what I've read but I haven't tried it because I don't see the point. One awesome side effect is that when you crash about 12 hours later (the Phenibut effects at this dose last 12 hours or beyond.) But the come down makes you very tired and is exellent for falling asleep especially if u have sleep troubles. Also do not mix it with Gabapentin because they will fight it out in your brain and you won't have a pleasant result. Sometimes it makes my stomach feel uncomfortable, so it would be a good idea to go to your doctor and tell them you've been really nauseous and ask for promethazine. It works wonders and is the best nausea med available. I take 50mg if I'm feeling nauseous. I take my Phenibut 2 hours before work cuz it takes a bit to kick in, go kill it at work, then go home and sleep. It will give you such a great nights sleep. The withdrawals if you want to call it that are easily handled with some Gabapentin say 3-4 grams and maybe the same or a little more the next day. And you will be feeling nice and normal mentally after that. If anyone has any questions feel free to ask (or possible flame) me. I am by no means a doctor or intending to tell anyone to use these drugs nor do I indorse it. I'm simply stating how I do it and the results I get. Hope you enjoyed the post, I'd love to hear your feedback. Thanks

^Please use paragraphs, it's really hard to read this wall of text


And please don't forget that Bluelight is a harm reduction forum and telling people to take huge amounts of phenibut isn't really harm reduction

I'll merge your thread with the Phenibut megathread

Is phenibut any ore mentally addictive than kratom? Never had an issue with kratom use once every few days.


I have this terrible fear of becoming a slave to gabaergics and not being able to leave the house without the 4 horsemen of the apocalyse chasing me.


I think though if I found a gabaergic that I were comfortable with without it causing issues then it could be a fantastic ally.


Or is it pretty mild in terms of being compulsive? ie i could buy just one bag to try it without suddenly becoming a slave? Note that I am not a addictive person and take things very cautiously to the point of obsession.

Dude, to ask if a drug is  "mentally addictive" is not a question that anyone can answer.


Their are hard answers to how PHYSICALLY addictive a drug is, etc, and even THAT is based on personal chemistry, but to ask about whether or not it is something you will be prone to be MENTALLY attached to is something no one can answer.


Like I've found the ability to either binge on or COMPLETELY abstain from (notice I did NOT say "moderate" LOL) with every single drug I've ever tried EXCEPT caffeine lol.


So you could ask me what's the most MENTALLY addictive of these drugs I have tried at one point:  Oxycodone, Klonopin, Cocaine, Kratom, Kratom extract, Phenibut HCL, Dexadrine, Alcohol, or caffeine.....and my answer is going to be that caffeine is the most MENTALLY addictive "FOR ME"...in fact, I'd also say it was the most PHYSICALLY addictive FOR ME....but you won't find too many people giving you that same answer lol.


FOR ME I find Phenibut even easier to resist the temptation to take than Kratom because BY ITSELF without mixing in other substances I don't really feel like Phenibut HCL gets me THAT high.


It can SOMETIMES, but it's true potential FOR ME is found in combining it with things like Kratom or Prolintane.


But others on this very forum have said they couldn't resist Phenibut and got HORRIBLY addicted to it quickly.


It's quite PHYSICALLY addictive, that much we know, yet I've had ZERO trouble moderating and keep it to one or two days a week MAX with no negative side effects to note of really, while I personally have found Kratom to be considerably more difficult to moderate with only because I enjoy the high so much, and yet I've never gotten REALLY bad withdrawal from Kratom either, just a little bit of mild depression and/or lethargy that may last 3-5 days max.


So the question you are asking can't be answered IMO.


When it comes to ANY drug, all you can do is all the research you can and then EVENTUALLY it comes down to whether or not you want to "take the plunge" and take that first dose.


And it sounds to me like you are that point with Phenibut where you will probably not be able to get any more answers as to how you will respond to it than you've already been given since you've already asked people a lot of questions about it.


You are at that point where either you try it and find out, or don't try it and don't find out.


It shouldn't be a big deal either way, unless you think you are the kind of person to start taking it every other day in which case I would steer clear.

Is it ok to use phenibut daily for a cycle of 7-14days and then completely stop? The reason is because I'm forced to bed rest from doctors orders and it's really fucking boring, phenibut makes time go by faster while my body heals from injury. When I can resume regular activities I won't need the phenibut anymore. Just a crutch to get through temporary boredom


I'm currently on day 4 of using phenibut daily. 2 g dose before bed (8pills) works best for me. Dose will most likely increase as tolerance develops.

I think I can speak unanimously for everyone on this forum when I say FUCK NO it is Definitely NOT ok AT ALL  to use Phenibut for 7-14 days and then stop!!!


The fact that you are already on day 4 is BAD news.


How many milligrams have you taken in the past four days???


2,000 each of the 4???


If so then you MIGHT MAYBE be ok IF you stop RIGHT NOW.


Did you read the back of the tub?!?!


You are only supposed to use 4,000mgs per week.


Granted I personally have exceeded that by 2X, doing 8,000 in a week but that's the most I'd EVER do.


Phenibut is EXTREMELY addictive and the withdrawal can cause you to become temporarily psychotic, hear voices and literally feel like you are going crazy and in fact, it is possible to even die from Phenibut withdrawal.


What makes things worse is that most American doctors don't even know what Phenibut is and if you have to go to the hospital for it they might not even know what to do.


Consider yourself lucky you even thought to post this so soon, yet IMO not soon enough.


You may ALREADY be in for some pretty serious withdrawal symptoms.


Phenibut is really meant to be used ONE day a week...MAYBE two MAX depending on how low your dosage is.


Seriously, what is it with you kids today???


Why wouldn't you ask this question BEFORE you decided to take it four times in a week?!?!


Seriously stop RIGHT now and if you get bad withdrawal symptoms like extreme anxiety, insomnia, depression or sickness you may want to go to the hospital.


And your damn right that "dose will likely increase as tolerance develops" because Phenibut tolerance is well known to increase Faster than most other drugs out there!!


Before you know it those 2,000mgs won't work and you'll need four times that amount.


STOP NOW.

IF you've only used 8,000mgs so far you will be ok as I have used that much in 1 week before, but never over the course of 4 days in a row which I think would be worse, no more than spread out over 3 max.


You might just BARELY have saved yourself from BAD withdrawal MAYBE.


I mean Kratom is addictive but at least that's not going to drive you insane from the WD or put you in the hospital.


If you want some drug to enjoy in bed smoke some weed or MAYBE use Kratom RESPONSIBLY.


Don't use powerful GABA-ergic drugs for a week to 2 on end and then stop cold turkey.


That's pretty much a guideline for exactly how to cause yourself bad withdrawal.

I would definitely heed Mycophile's above advice if I were you. I can see wanting to use phenibut to get through this time, but everyday use is going to set you up for horrible, possibly dangerous withdrawal. No gabaergics should be used everyday, no good can really come of it and a whole lot of bad can, and will.

Well tonight is the first night I am up on phenibut. Guess 2g isn't cutting it anymore. Crazy how fast tolerance goes up, especially when you use it for sleep. 


Instead of taking more, I will follow your advice and stop before i dig myse!f in a hole. Thanksg

Day 5: Damn Took 3g tonight for a total consumption of 11g this week. I have some bullshit to do to tonight. Gonna phenibullshit through it 1 last time then stop. (Hopefully)


I guess I will pay the price later. Right now the pros of using phenibut outweighs the cons. I really don't wanna use it again but people at home are stressing me out when all I wanna do is crawl in bed like a lazy jerk. I will try to get as much work done tonight since I took it anyway.

You guys are asking if phenibut is more addictive than Kratom. If you have an addictive personality, pretty much anything can be addictive. It depends on the person. You do not want to get addicted to phenibut though, it gets scary, especially when those withdrawals kick in. It's a nasty drug to take often and your body will feel it.

> 			I've read a lot of things about Phenibut and frankly it annoyed me how miss informed they are. I've been reading about people taking doses like 300-500mg. This dose won't do anything. Maybe if it's your very first time then I can see how someone might see some effects. I personally take 10 grams a day, yes 10grams. At this dose it completely abolishes any and all anxieties especially socially. When I take this does I can talk to anyone about anything when without it I would be filled with fear and anxiety and not want to talk to anyone and life's obstacles seem like some huge monster. It makes you a motivated beast. I've been taking this dose every single day for years  just about and I have never had any kind of tolerance issue or negative side affects. Frankly, a high dose of Phenibut turns you into a confident and very sociable person who doesn't stress about anything and can handle anything. It's really a super drug. Any dose over 12.5 grams however you will experience some nasty side effect and you won't get the results I've stated above. You must drink a good amount of caffeine with it however for you to feel its maximum effects. For example I drink two rockstars every day with it and maybe some coffee later. Because of its absolutely unbearable taste I always mix it with cranberry juice. I do 5 grams in one cup and 5 in the next. For best results wait 10-15 minutes between drinks. Slowly build up to 10 grams because If u go too fast and take to much for your tolerance it will make you vomit all day long. Try upping the dose by a gram or two everyday.  Do not take Phenibut with any opiates or benzos. Opiates will make you vomit all day mixed with Phenibut. Mixing benzos with it is not a good idea either from what I've read but I haven't tried it because I don't see the point. One awesome side effect is that when you crash about 12 hours later (the Phenibut effects at this dose last 12 hours or beyond.) But the come down makes you very tired and is exellent for falling asleep especially if u have sleep troubles. Also do not mix it with Gabapentin because they will fight it out in your brain and you won't have a pleasant result. Sometimes it makes my stomach feel uncomfortable, so it would be a good idea to go to your doctor and tell them you've been really nauseous and ask for promethazine. It works wonders and is the best nausea med available. I take 50mg if I'm feeling nauseous. I take my Phenibut 2 hours before work cuz it takes a bit to kick in, go kill it at work, then go home and sleep. It will give you such a great nights sleep. The withdrawals if you want to call it that are easily handled with some Gabapentin say 3-4 grams and maybe the same or a little more the next day. And you will be feeling nice and normal mentally after that. If anyone has any questions feel free to ask (or possible flame) me. I am by no means a doctor or intending to tell anyone to use these drugs nor do I indorse it. I'm simply stating how I do it and the results I get. Hope you enjoyed the post, I'd love to hear your feedback. Thanks

I agree that the starting suggestion of 300-500 mg is a joke. I can't imagine that working on anything but a mouse. At least start at 1 gram. I didn't get a full effect until 2 grams. 10 grams is insane. I would only feel sick on that. I wouldn't recommend anyone to take that much.

I find it to be a great, but toxic drug. I wouldn't want all that phenibut in my system.


I'm considering ordering some. I haven't had any in close to a year and I'm hoping it gives me a boost. Maybe it'll help me off etiz and c-lam. Trading one drug for another, but at least I won't feel like a slave to etiz and c-lam.

the recommended dose on the label is definitely a joke. The company I order from says 250mg (1 pill) a day. LOL. They know people take more, prolly just there for legal reasons.


This shit takes 4 hrs to fully kick in and it's a huge waste of a buzz if ur underdosing . Better to a higher dose than lower, cuz at least then u will feel it and won't waste pills and precious time of ur life being ,"safe"


Benzos don't compare to phenibut. Phenibut makes everything better, music, sociability , empathy ,energy but also relaxed unlike benzos that just make u tired in a dull way.. phenibut is fun and LEGAL. LOL

Yes. That's why I was in love with phenibut when I took it for so long. Then I discovered Etiz and it made me feel exactly like phenibut: energy, motivation, euphoria. It made me manic like phenibut used to. I think if you take phenibut too long, the magic wears off. The magic has been wearing off Etiz and c-lam too. I guess your brain gets used to it. That's why I'm hoping if I order more phenibut, it will work its magic again since it's been so long. Phenibut made me witty as hell, like everything I said was funny and quick. I miss that.

I've been taking 1g a week for over 4 years. Still get that good old 'best day ever' feeling after all this time. The only thing I can't do is drink beer with it because I end up getting into some manic state that has gotten me in trouble a couple of times. 

It's the only drug I've ever religiously taken every week without fail - it's a beautiful, amazing drug. It just makes evvverrrything better!

The day is brighter and better with it. Drinking with phenibut used to make me drunk fast. The last time I had drinks with phenibut, I couldn't get drunk no matter how many drinks I had! That was a weird change that happened over time.

I haven't tried Phenibut but have been wondering the effects of daily low dose administration...does anyone have experience with 250mg - 500mg daily?  I'm curious if it would have mild antidepressiant effects or does it wear off too quickly requiring redose throughout the day? I've been very interested in Phenibut for a while, but I kicked a long term benzo habit six years ago and went through terrible withdrawal and as a result already have a lowered siezure threshold and don't want to exasperate the issue, not am I looking for a new addiction. I know most users say they don't feel anything at low doses but I'm not certain if they literally feel zero effects or if they're just not getting strong enough effects. Any insight would be most appreciated!

The OP only says phenibut binds to GABAB but it actually has higher preference for binding to and blocking VDCC's which is how pregabaline (Lyrica) and gabapentin (Neurontin) work - phenibut is a gabapentinoid like them.


Phenibut similarly has neuropathic painkilling effects at doses lower than those producing e.g. muscle relaxation which is rather pronounced in baclofen (the latter is indeed mostly a GABAB agonist and negligible as a VDCC blocker).


This tentatively confirms that phenibut but does not only prefer binding to VDCC's but also primarily acts thanks to that.


So, while you could consider that at the rather high doses plenty of people use phenibut the GABABergic effect may become relevant (meaning at that point it has dual action)... but given this information it seems better to say it is mostly and firstly like pregabaline and not so much like baclofen.


Yeah it's confusing because sure it is still an anxiolytic... and phenibut does have properties and a way one should use it that makes it in some ways comparable to gabaergics. Also usually when you read about gabaergics it's about GABAA agonism like benzos have, which is what most sedatives do. And yes phenibus is an analogue of GABA. But it is a mistake to just think phenibut is a gabaergic.

Phenibut use should be cycled to prevent dependency like that... why don't you taper it? Then don't take it too many days in a week if you decide to use it sporadically after that... although they act quite differently benzos also should only be used sporadically or if daily for a limited period if necessary. But yeah benzos are rougher in a lot of ways, many have heavier effects but also heavier withdrawals.


I unfortunately don't know where I placed my phenibut or if I still have any...

To clarify: you said you switched to gabapentin about a week ago? That is what you said in the other thread, but here you say you are still taking phenibut daily?


Hopefully you aren't taking the gabapentin on top of it, or have you been able to very much reduce your phenibut dosage by taking gabapentin is what you're saying?

I hate to say I told you so, but I told you to stop after day 4 and it seems that you didn't.


If you don't stop soon it's going to be worse and worse.


Read Pinpoint's thread "My Phenibut Affair".


That shit scared me away from EVER getting addicted to Phenibut.


He got full blown auditory hallucinations, some psychosis and a bunch of other REALLY bad shit.


You are better off not sleeping tomorrow or at least tapering.


It's just going to get worse and worse.


You needed to read about this shit BEFORE you started doing this.


Now that you didn't, you need to stop sooner rather than later or you it will just get exponentially worse as time goes on.

I'm going to be honest I've taken Klonopin daily for years, though at one point I was forced to stop for 9 months and it was NOT good...NOT in the sense of WD cause in fact I got almost no WD at all...but because my anxiety disorder came back.


I do it under doctor's supervision and have never had negative side effects.


Everyone says not to do it, but my anxiety disorder comes back with a vengeance if I don't for any lengthy period of time.


I skip doses every now and then with the goal of SOMEDAY hopefully getting off of them, but for me there are more advantages than disadvantages.


I just always feel I have to mention it when someone says the old "never use benzos daily" line.


There are some people who are just better off with them...and unfortunately I am one of them.


However, from both what I've read and what I've experienced Phenibut withdrawal SEEMS to occur MUCH more quickly in that I've never heard of people getting benzo withdrawal from using for a week or less but I have heard of it happening with Phenibut.


If he used Klonopin for a week I think he'd be fine, but using Phenibut every day for a week or two will IMO probably have MUCH worse rebound effects and WD than low dose Klonopin for a week or two.

> 			I've  read a lot of things about Phenibut and frankly it annoyed me how miss  informed they are. I've been reading about people taking doses like  300-500mg. This dose won't do anything. Maybe if it's your very first  time then I can see how someone might see some effects. I personally  take 10 grams a day, yes 10grams. At this dose it completely abolishes  any and all anxieties especially socially. When I take this does I can  talk to anyone about anything when without it I would be filled with  fear and anxiety and not want to talk to anyone and life's obstacles  seem like some huge monster. It makes you a motivated beast. I've been  taking this dose every single day for years  just about and I have never  had any kind of tolerance issue or negative side affects. Frankly, a  high dose of Phenibut turns you into a confident and very sociable  person who doesn't stress about anything and can handle anything. It's  really a super drug. Any dose over 12.5 grams however you will  experience some nasty side effect and you won't get the results I've  stated above. You must drink a good amount of caffeine with it however  for you to feel its maximum effects. For example I drink two rockstars  every day with it and maybe some coffee later. Because of its absolutely  unbearable taste I always mix it with cranberry juice. I do 5 grams in  one cup and 5 in the next. For best results wait 10-15 minutes between  drinks. Slowly build up to 10 grams because If u go too fast and take to  much for your tolerance it will make you vomit all day long. Try upping  the dose by a gram or two everyday.  Do not take Phenibut with any  opiates or benzos. Opiates will make you vomit all day mixed with  Phenibut. Mixing benzos with it is not a good idea either from what I've  read but I haven't tried it because I don't see the point. One awesome  side effect is that when you crash about 12 hours later (the Phenibut  effects at this dose last 12 hours or beyond.) But the come down makes  you very tired and is exellent for falling asleep especially if u have  sleep troubles. Also do not mix it with Gabapentin because they will  fight it out in your brain and you won't have a pleasant result.  Sometimes it makes my stomach feel uncomfortable, so it would be a good  idea to go to your doctor and tell them you've been really nauseous and  ask for promethazine. It works wonders and is the best nausea med  available. I take 50mg if I'm feeling nauseous. I take my Phenibut 2  hours before work cuz it takes a bit to kick in, go kill it at work,  then go home and sleep. It will give you such a great nights sleep. The  withdrawals if you want to call it that are easily handled with some  Gabapentin say 3-4 grams and maybe the same or a little more the next  day. And you will be feeling nice and normal mentally after that. If  anyone has any questions feel free to ask (or possible flame) me. I am  by no means a doctor or intending to tell anyone to use these drugs nor  do I indorse it. I'm simply stating how I do it and the results I get.  Hope you enjoyed the post, I'd love to hear your feedback.  Thanks

    Don't take this the wrong way, but this is a  pretty misguided statement........I've done quite a bit of phenibut; I  started in late 2014. The first time I took it was when I was just  hanging out at a friends house. He had phenibut, and having heard a  great deal about it, I asked for some. Didn't notice a damn thing all  night and ended up dosing ~3g by the time I went to sleep, made up of  compulsive 250mg doses every 20-45 mins. 


I woke up feeling  amazing. My pupils were almost completely dilated, I could hardly walk, I  felt VERY happy, I wanted to talk to everyone whether I knew them or  not, and I had an intense feeling of empathy. The strangest sensation I  experienced was that my dick felt like it was on the verge of busting a  nut (orgasm). I ended up driving around for 4 hours just because I  wanted to listen to music and smoke cigs. Even though phenibut is an  anxiolytic, and is believed to act on the GABA system, I felt extremely  wired, had a hard time sleeping (not because of being stimulated, sleep  was bad because I had so much I wanted to do and had so little time.  However, I would sometimes find myself nodding off whenever  seated/laying down. 


    It started off at ~2g-4g per dose, but I  immediately started a dosing regimen of parachuting the phenibut every  morning at ~8am-10am. Using every day my tolerance blew up to 15g-20g  per dose. I never even attempted to cycle my phenibut use and I never  bothered to weigh my doses, figuring that the good 'ole "eyeball"  technique was working well (Disclaimer: Not weighing your doses and  taking phenibut every day, is STOOPID AS PHUCK!). 


    One  weekend something shitty happened that made me look for an escape to  oblivion. I had a small amount left (8g? Idk), but I had another  shipment scheduled for Mon, so I just went ahead and dosed the rest of  my phenibut Sat night. Sunday wasn't awful, but I was sad. The kind of  sad thats melancholy and yearnfull for the past; reviewing old memories  was giving me the sensation of having lost something important. 

    I  snapped awake Mon sweating and feeling total dread. My shipment was to  come in the mail that day, so I spent all of my time staring out the  window and compulsively refreshing the USPS tracking info to see where  it was. I was shaking so bad that I dropped several glasses, Poured  scalding coffee on my dick, and could see my entire body shaking in the  mirror. Some beer temporarily calmed me down, but only made me feel  worse after an hour. The mail was late(ish) and I got the shipment at  3pm and I was no longer sick.


    I had no idea how bad the  withdrawal syndrome would be, so when I did find out I was terrified of  stopping. I started to taper, and It was relatively comfortable. Started  at 8g/day and every 3 days I'd drop the dose 500mg. I got off of it,  and other than some sadness and mild anxiety attacks upon getting to  work, I was off of the phenibut.


    The above took place in Feb  2015, and sometime in Dec 2015 I decided to supplement my tianeptine  sodium use with phenibut to relieve some symptoms that came with  tianeptine dependency. This time I started with low doses (~500mg-2g).  When I decided to use the dose I used earlier in the year, I had a day  full of narcolepsy, alcohol like intoxication, and my short-term memory  was mostly fucked; I'd start doing one thing and in the process I'd  forget exactly what I was doing and why I was doing it. The worst was  sleeping through my several alarms, rushing to work late, forgetting  basically EVERYTHING every 5mins, and worst of all, I'd catch myself  falling asleep right in the middle of talking with a customer AND  standing......somehow the client and my co-worker didn't notice. I fell  asleep at the wheel and narrowly avoided dying from hitting a tree,  which took my side mirror and all the paint out of the drivers side of  the car. 


    After all of that, I slowly increased my dose from  500mg to 2g /day. I was afraid to experience overdosing again because it  honestly would have gotten me fired had anyone noticed, not to mention  that its intoxication almost caused me to die from its narcoleptic  effects. 


    I started to realize that I was becoming more and  more depressed as my tianeptine use (and tolerance) exponentially  increased. I also realized that upping the dose of phenibut relieved  those symptoms. My tianeptine use was completely out of control; I was  using ~10g-15g/day towards the end. However, my phenibut use plateaued  at ~2g-4g/day, which FELT low to me relative to how big my doses were  during my first run. These phenibut doses kept depression away, but its  efficacy would wear out after 7-8 days and I'd have to bump up the  doses.


    I realized that this dependance would only ever give  me a great deal of pain, and that happiness was impossible if I didn't  quit. I decided to quit with a taper. But it was impossible for me to  responsibly taper the tianeptine, and one of my orders for tianeptine  was accidentally cancelled. Forced cold turkey. The tianeptine  withdrawal sucked so bad that I totally forgot about the phenibut. I was  downing 100's of loperamide pills and trying every single opiate  withdrawal remedy I could find to get some relief. Finally, after  calling the Suicide hotline, I went to the hospital. 


    They  began treating me for my tianeptine withdrawl, but no one really knew  what it was. They dropped me in the psych ward, gave me only  antipsychotics, and completely cut me off from the world. I was 'Ok" for  the first few days, but on day four I was shaking and very  uncomfortable, which made me realize I hadn't mentioned the phenibut. I  didn't want them to think I was drug seeking because I suddenly had  addictions to shit I apparently didn't feel like mentioning, so I kept  it to myself. On the 5th night I started seeing people outside trying to  get into my hospital room through the 3rd story window. I saw guns and  thought we were about to be robbed. Later I saw my employer play a movie  on my ceiling about how they were going to ruin my life for using and  lying to them about it. I thought all the nurses were actually evil  students who were using me as an test subject for violent  experiments......and there were rabid pit bulls running around the  hospital hunting for me. 


    I had essentially started having  some really severe delirium and started having mild(ish) seizures while  in the psych ward. The delusions lasted 2 days but the shaking stopped  after 24 hours. I got out in early Feb and I've been feeling better  since then.


TLDR Version Below: 


 MORAL OF THE STORY: I was only taking phenibut in low doses (.5mg-2mg),  but when used every day without breaks I had horrifying withdrawal  symptoms ranging from delusions, hallucinations, talking word salad, and  having SEIZURES from it.


    Phenibut is basically NEVER safe to  take with any amount of regularity, the withdrawal is nasty and worse  than a lot of the harder drugs I've withdrawn from.

Anyone ever take a one off dose of phenibut just to help with a night of sleep? Would anyone say that phenibut can be counterproductive for this use (I notice a lot of people saying they find phenibut energizing)?


If you were to take a dose of phenibut to help get a restful night of sleep then how much would you dose (assuming no tolerance)? And how long before falling asleep would you dose? 1 hour or more like 3 to 4 hours before sleep? Would you expect any additional grogginess the next morning or anymore difficulty waking up, at your usual time, then normal?


Thank you.

^^^^^^^


Thanks for your post LOBSTERBUTCH.


I only read the last few paragraphs and the TLDR but I got enough from your story to confirm what I already rightfully believed about Phenibut and Strity1994 SHOULD TAKE NOTE because he is still using after a week and doesn't seem to know what he's in for.


I mean me personally, today is my 2nd day of use this week, I used 4,000mgs yesterday and 2,600 today, I MIGHT do another gram but that will be IT FOR A WEEK.


I've personally learned that NO MORE than 8 grams a week is REMOTELY ok.


I will never exceed that and from that amount I've never had issues.


Phenibut seems to be criminally misunderstood in terms of it's addiction potential and I'm not even sure how many hospitals realize it so it's up to people like us on these forum to explain it.


You may be able to get away with a few grams a week...MAYBE even up to 8 like me....but you CANNOT use Phenibut DAILY without running into SERIOUS problems even in the short term.


I'd even say that REGARDLESS of doses if you are ingesting ANY amount of Phenibut more than 3 days a week (and depending on doses that could and often is TOO much) you are overdoing it and NEED to stop.


I think some people who are overdoing it think it's just like overdoing alcohol or Kratom or weed or whatever but it ISN'T guys.


This stuff is of another variety of drug and another strength entirely.


Keep your use to a MINIMUM or it WILL catch up with you.

Interesting question cause i have found it CAN help but can also hurt and it will be counterproductive if you EVER use more than 8,000mgs MAX in a week IMO.


The one thing which does NOT help is if I combine too much of ANY other sleep med to my Phenibut.


I take Melatonin every single night...usually 3 and 3/4ths milileters but if I exceed 3 ML of melatonin with my Phenibut it seems to give me a shitty night's sleep and it's too many drugs and just knocks me out and I wake up groggy which you don't want.


Likewise, SOMETIMES lately I have been taking 2 benadryls/simply sleep to sleep but I will NOT EVER sleep well combining it with Phenibut, let alone Melatonin as well.


As for dosage...it depends on tolerance cause I have a pretty high tolerance for Phenibut.


Like I enjoy hanging out on doses between 2,500 and 3,400mgs of Phenibut and that is too high for some so I can't rightfully tell you what the best dose is FOR YOU.


MY ADVICE: figure out what dosage you could feel Ok BEING AWAKE ON and then go above it by anywhere from 0.5 (half a gram) to a gram but probably not more than that.


Like, if you like just watching TV on 2,000mgs go to 2,500mgs or 3,000mgs.


If you tend to prefer 1,000mgs go to 1,700mgs or 2,000mgs MAX.


FOR ME Phenibut takes about 2 hours to kick in.


So if I was taking it for sleep I am going to want to be SURE it's kicked in before bed so if you want to go to sleep at 2AM I would take it at 11 or 11:30 PM and that way it should be taking effect around 1AM and you should be out like a light by 2AM.


IF I GET THE DOSAGE PERFECTLY...which doesn't always happen....I am lucky enough to get this "extra energy" the next day where I might only sleep 6 hours but wake up feeling like I slept eleven hours and in a great mood!!!


Just kind of feeling like a little kid, just jumping right out of bed ready to start the day the second my eyes open.


There IS supposedly a science behind WHY this happens but I don't really understand it...something to do with GABA and it is NOT sustainable or something you can expect or happen multiple days in a row BUT it can be just fine IMO to do one night or less a week.


So yeah....I suggest NOT mixing in ANY other drugs (weed is probably ok) but no sleeping drugs....NOT exceeding your normal dose by more than a gram....a few hours  before bed....that should work well for sleep in my personal experience.

My Phenibut Affair (Really F'n Long)


    This is a story of a journey I took over the past 4 months on a mission to find sustainable zen. With the advent of WebMD, Wikipedia, forums and the never-ending flow of information found on the internet these days I, like many, have become something of an internet doctor. I diagnose myself free of charge and waive all rights to sue for malpractice. So in an attempt to replace my previous hard drug addictions with a natural, legal alternative I stumbled across a product called Phenibut. I had heard of it before, but with heroin and benzodiazepines flowing in the front door who has time for obscure chemicals with funny sounding names? At this point though I had been off the hard stuff for several months, but I still wasn't feeling 'right' - whatever that is. So for $20, shipping included, I took a chance. I waited for that brown UPS truck and in the meantime I read everything I could about this miracle cure. By the time it arrived I signed for it like I was putting my signature on the Declaration of Independence. I had predetermined that 2 grams was the best starting dose and thus with a plop-plop fizz-fizz I was back on tour.


    The first effect I noticed that I couldn't write off as placebo was a curious giddy feeling when interacting with people that afternoon. It was an MDMA-like empathy that caused me to draw out conversations much longer than they needed as if I was drinking in the nectar of sociability. Now, I am a salesman by trade, but I'm actually a closet introvert with a self-conscious form of anxiety. In fact I got into sales a decade prior at the behest of a therapist. It was his thought that throwing myself to the wolves, so to speak, would allow me to deal with my anxiety issues. It worked like a charm - at least I thought it had until I realized I was self-medicating with opiates and benzodiazepines to succeed. But I digress, back to the Phenibut. In addition to the empathy I was in an excellent mood. I don't mean a 'it's Friday night and I feel all right' mood, I mean an 'all is right with the world, my career, my life' mood. It was truly magical after months of feeling 'off' due to the PAWS phase of recovery.


    That night after re-dosing another gram something told me to get on my elliptical at home. Something also told me to bring music - lots of music. Let me tell you, never have a felt such manic happiness from exerci- scratch that, from anything - and yes I've done MDMA. That night was bliss. I'm no exercise buff so this was a strange deviation from the norm. I assumed I had achieved some sort of runner's high and I continued on that elliptical until I could bare no more. I felt amazing. No anxiety yet fully cognitively functional. In fact I was beyond functional - I was 'takin' care of business' at a whole new level - nothing could stop me, nothing could bring me down. Thus began my love affair.


    Now, I had been warned via internet forums and postings about the withdrawal, but when you feel this good your brain cares not what some nerds on the internet are blabbing about. I was one bad motherfucker. I was the guy from the movie Limitless and I could do no wrong. If you were of the opposite sex and above a 4/10 you were gonna get the shit fucked out of you with my eyes. If I got the chance to speak to someone who would listen they were going to hear all about everything on my mind at approximately 120 words per minute. I felt as though I had finally found 'it' - that perfect mix of stimulation, mood enhancement and anxiolysis with no side effects - at least not yet. Music and exercise as well as eating healthy and socializing became a religion for me. This further lulled me into a sense of 'this is forever sustainable and healthy to boot' mindset.


    A couple weeks went by in what can only be described in retrospect as a hypomanic state. Everything I said was the word of God himself and I owned every place I went. I was the god damn CEO of bosses and the world was my oyster & my playground as long as my servant, Phenibut, was by my side. My friends loved the new me and my family felt that I was the perfect son. I started running each night, music pumping, singing to the stars and not giving a damn about anyone who saw. I quickly worked up from 2 miles to 5 miles to 8 miles. My body was looking great - I had never felt better in my life.


    One sunny Sunday summer morning I woke up and dosed like every other day. Something inside me, much like the voice that first told me to get on that elliptical, told me I should spend the day running to the beach. Now, the beach is 15 miles from my house. This seemed like an exciting challenge and now looking back on it I was in a full blown hypomanic state. It was like a 12 hour MDMA peak, I shit you not - 80 degrees, not a cloud in the sky, heading to the beach, not a care in the world. The only care I had was the thought of why other people weren't as happy as I was. Each person I passed who said 'hi' back to me gave me a rush of bliss as if they had just awarded me the Nobel prize with a simple acknowledgement of my existence. That day came and went and boy was I sore the following day. What I didn't realize is that Phenibut rapidly depletes Potassium and could've landed me in the ER had it not been for my copious intake of health food.


    Eventually side effects reared their ugly heads - I had cramps in my limbs often and woke early, albeit refreshed, but knowing full well that 4 hours of sleep per night may become an issue. Another side effect began to make it's presence known, which was a bloated mid-section. I always had a flat tummy, except for the time I had used Gabapentin, which caused water retention, so I assumed it would go aware upon cessation of Phenibut. But wait, how could I stop? The new and improved me is dependent on this chemical to sustain my newfound lifestyle. I had a day or two when I ran out and the Express shipment didn't arrive until a day after it was supposed to - holy shit. It was bad. I knew I was in for a real treat. However, thanks to my previous addiction my brain had already had close to a decade of experience coming up with ways to get what it wanted just one last time in a never-ending fashion.


    Alas I was dosing on a 24/7 schedule and it wasn't keeping me out of withdrawal and when it did I would still have nasty GI side effects and pains in what I assume to be my organs - not a good sign. I became nervous that perhaps taking my anxiety & fear department completely offline was preventing me from making the logical connection between Phenibut and serious bodily harm. I couldn't believe that what had happened to everyone else was actually happening to me. I just wanted to be back out on that sunny Sunday summer morning again. The days that I would search the internet for answers to why I was so happy all the time and if it was unhealthy to be so fucking happy that you shit rainbows. That was the magic that was lost now and no matter what I tried it wouldn't return.


    I was consuming at least 10 grams per day, so I attempted to taper in a futile fashion. The pull to take more with the hope of one last hoorah was too much. I waited until a holiday weekend when I knew that I would simultaneously run out and be unable to get an overnight shipment delivered until halfway through the following week. I work Monday-Friday so I scheduled the withdrawal to begin early Saturday and hopefully peak sometime on Sunday or Monday. I brought nothing but what one would find in Mr. & Mrs. Average's medicine cabinet. That was a mistake. What came that Sunday was a preview of what I'd imagine hell would be like. It was a constant non-stop panic attack with the most bizarre delusional paranoia that combined itself with torturous bodily sensations that played into the paranoia to make you truly believe you were dying. Sleep was non-existent and the few half hour blocks when you did pass out from exhaustion were horrifying. The most realistic nightmares I've ever experienced and they were totally mindfucking in an 'Inception' style where you'd wake up, jump out of bed and immediately fall off a cliff and into the pits of hell - nightmares within nightmares within nightmares ad naseum.


    By the time the night was over I literally could not differentiate between reality and nightmare - I was psychotic with no prior history of psychosis. Now, normally nobody is as logical as me - I have a mind like steel trap - or so I thought. While all this was going on I had absolutely no desire to interact with anything or anyone. Nothing I used to do was the least bit satisfying, people were like poison, the thought of exercise made me nauseous, and my appetite was lower than a meth addict's. I felt as though my personality had died and gone to hell. My attempts to tell people to stay away due to 'the flu' were successful, but at the time I truly believed they hated me and knew I was nothing but a big, fat phony. The stress that my body was undergoing caused me to develop a terrible cold just to, you know, put the cherry on the shitcake. However the first sign that God still existed was when the world's longest panic attack ended roughly 48 hours in - gone without a trace - granted with no cessation of other symptoms. Once the anxiety lifted I was left with a strange dopaminergic stimulation that actually felt pretty damn good, at least during the day. My nights were still filled with full on psychosis with OEV/CEV - not the good type, schizo-style voices, and hellish hallucinations of every sort. Of course you were forced to be awake for every moment of it lest you spend what feels like eternity living in a movie called 'Nightmare' starring yours truly.


    Thankful beyond thanks at day 7 I was back to normal - what ever that is. I still had trouble sleeping through the night and still had strange thoughts from time to time, but my anxiety is noticeably less than when I started the Phenibut. I've chalked this up to the idea that MY PERCEPTION of anxiety has forever changed. No more do I see transient daily anxiety as a threat. So in a way Phenibut has helped cure some of my psychological issues by showing me that the anxiety that I do live with is something to be scoffed at for it is weak unlike the hell that I knew. This was an unpleasant-beyond-words way to learn this, but a week in hell should yield years of serenity. Any time I get anxious I think back to that 48 hour panic attack and the nightmares which my memory has somehow encoded to the section of my mind called 'shit that happened irl' - in other words they were nightmares which were vivid and real enough to cause PTSD in those prone to it. The bloating has slightly subsided but I cannot help but think I may have caused some damage to my liver or kidneys. I will be getting blood tests shortly.


    Nobody knows about this experience other than my current therapist who didn't even know what Phenibut was and wrote it off as some bad reaction to a homeopathic drug - I didn't attempt to take that conversation any further. The family and friends who knew I was taking some sort of powder stuff assumed it was a supplement for exercise, which I guess you could kind of say it was.


    So would I recommend Phenibut to anyone? Yes, in fact, I would. For the lessons learned alone I would say yes. I would never deny anyone the happiness and bliss that this chemical provided me, not for anything in the world. It was magic - at first. You quickly learn who you are, who you could be, what you need to do to become who you could be - and if you're like me - you actually become who you could be before the cons outweigh the pros. I have made lasting improvements in my personal, financial, business, and family life. Unlike a drug like heroin that isolates the user into a lonely death, Phenibut brought out the best in me.


    This all happened a couple months ago and I've been clean ever since. So why am I writing this experience now? Well you see, I'm an addict. What I mean to say is that I have 1000 grams of Phenibut on my doorstep right now and I don't know how this story will end but I know where it begins and I want to get this on paper while I'm in my right state of mind so that it may perhaps help, entertain, upset or enlighten.


    Time to see how deep this rabbit hole goes...

The first time I took it was when I was just  hanging out at a friends house. He had phenibut, and having heard a  great deal about it, I asked for some. Didn't notice a damn thing all  night and ended up dosing ~3g by the time I went to sleep, made up of  compulsive 250mg doses every 20-45 mins.

My pupils were almost completely dilated, I could hardly walk, I  felt VERY happy, I wanted to talk to everyone whether I knew them or  not, and I had an intense feeling of empathy. The strangest sensation I  experienced was that my dick felt like it was on the verge of busting a  nut (orgasm). I ended up driving around for 4 hours just because I  wanted to listen to music and smoke cigs. Even though phenibut is an  anxiolytic, and is believed to act on the GABA system, I felt extremely  wired, had a hard time sleeping (not because of being stimulated, sleep  was bad because I had so much I wanted to do and had so little time.  However, I would sometimes find myself nodding off whenever  seated/laying down.

> 
>     It started off at ~2g-4g per dose, but I  immediately started a dosing regimen of parachuting the phenibut every  morning at ~8am-10am. Using every day my tolerance blew up to 15g-20g  per dose. I never even attempted to cycle my phenibut use and I never  bothered to weigh my doses, figuring that the good 'ole "eyeball"  technique was working well (Disclaimer: Not weighing your doses and  taking phenibut every day, is STOOPID AS PHUCK!).

>     One  weekend something shitty happened that made me look for an escape to  oblivion. I had a small amount left (8g? Idk), but I had another  shipment scheduled for Mon, so I just went ahead and dosed the rest of  my phenibut Sat night. Sunday wasn't awful, but I was sad. The kind of  sad thats melancholy and yearnfull for the past; reviewing old memories  was giving me the sensation of having lost something important. 
> 
>     I  snapped awake Mon sweating and feeling total dread. My shipment was to  come in the mail that day, so I spent all of my time staring out the  window and compulsively refreshing the USPS tracking info to see where  it was. I was shaking so bad that I dropped several glasses, Poured  scalding coffee on my dick, and could see my entire body shaking in the  mirror. Some beer temporarily calmed me down, but only made me feel  worse after an hour. The mail was late(ish) and I got the shipment at  3pm and I was no longer sick.

>     The above took place in Feb  2015, and sometime in Dec 2015 I decided to supplement my tianeptine  sodium use with phenibut to relieve some symptoms that came with  tianeptine dependency. This time I started with low doses (~500mg-2g).  When I decided to use the dose I used earlier in the year, I had a day  full of narcolepsy, alcohol like intoxication, and my short-term memory  was mostly fucked; I'd start doing one thing and in the process I'd  forget exactly what I was doing and why I was doing it. The worst was  sleeping through my several alarms, rushing to work late, forgetting  basically EVERYTHING every 5mins, and worst of all, I'd catch myself  falling asleep right in the middle of talking with a customer AND  standing......somehow the client and my co-worker didn't notice. I fell  asleep at the wheel and narrowly avoided dying from hitting a tree,  which took my side mirror and all the paint out of the drivers side of  the car.

I also realized that upping the dose of phenibut relieved  those symptoms. My tianeptine use was completely out of control; I was  using ~10g-15g/day towards the end. However, my phenibut use plateaued  at ~2g-4g/day, which FELT low to me relative to how big my doses were  during my first run. These phenibut doses kept depression away, but its  efficacy would wear out after 7-8 days and I'd have to bump up the  doses.

But it was impossible for me to  responsibly taper the tianeptine, and one of my orders for tianeptine  was accidentally cancelled. Forced cold turkey. The tianeptine  withdrawal sucked so bad that I totally forgot about the phenibut. I was  downing 100's of loperamide pills and trying every single opiate  withdrawal remedy I could find to get some relief. Finally, after  calling the Suicide hotline, I went to the hospital.

They dropped me in the psych ward, gave me only  antipsychotics, and completely cut me off from the world. I was 'Ok" for  the first few days, but on day four I was shaking and very  uncomfortable, which made me realize I hadn't mentioned the phenibut. I  didn't want them to think I was drug seeking because I suddenly had  addictions to shit I apparently didn't feel like mentioning, so I kept  it to myself. On the 5th night I started seeing people outside trying to  get into my hospital room through the 3rd story window. I saw guns and  thought we were about to be robbed. Later I saw my employer play a movie  on my ceiling about how they were going to ruin my life for using and  lying to them about it. I thought all the nurses were actually evil  students who were using me as an test subject for violent  experiments......and there were rabid pit bulls running around the  hospital hunting for me.

Thanks for sharing dude... This is my 3rd run with phenibut. (All happened this year)


My 1st run was 2g/day , lost my job when I ran out of phenibut pills and experienced extreme paranoia/anxiety. Though everyone at work, especially my boss, was out to get me. 


My 2nd run, now jobless with a butt load of spare time. I had an endless supply of phenibut (1KG powder) and would eyeball my doses. And one pooint, I passed out for a day and a half and woke up totally fucked up. This run eventually ended with me in a psych ward.


Now I'm on my 3rd run, 2g/day since ~week ago. 


Now I haven't mentioned the positives: someone could tell me my family died, and id probably come up with a witty joke and make them laugh. Phenibut makes me feel super cool. Almost too good to be true feeling.

I am still baffled at the amounts taken by some of the people here. I'll take a gram every three days and that is it. If I try to take it more then that I start to feel like complete shit in all ways possible. Bad tension headaches and upset stomach if I go beyond 1.5 grams followed by the worst hangover the next day. And I consider myself to have a pretty big GABA tolerance. It's good when it's good, but things seem to go south quick with phenibut. Strange drug.

So basically I am getting the idea that nothing in Pinpoint's thread about his 48 hour panic attack complete with insomnia and full blown psychosis and paranoia with open eye visuals (sounds like they WEREN'T fun) and auditory hallucinations has scared you off from what you are doing.


You know you can DIE from Phenibut WD right???


But now you are asking how to potentiate Heroin, Ambien and Vodka which is already probably a lethal combo and should potentiate eachother just fine.


Why wasn't heroin enough for being confined to bed for 2 weeks??


Don't take this the wrong way, but seeing as losing your job and ending up in a psych ward didn't help you and none of this shit has helped you learn you sound like the kind of guy who needs to end up in the hospital for an extended stay for something EVEN WORSE to learn...and still that might not be enough.


I mean dude, who needs to ask how to potentiate the combo of heroin, vodka and Ambien??!?!

Some of their doses seem high to me, but yours also seem pretty low.


I usually do end up taking 4 grams by the end of a day w/ Phenibut, but I start low.


High doses put me in a pretty out of it state, low doses are more of a stimulant.

The reading I've done on phenibut is that the drug was developed by the russians for cosmonauts. They decided to use it instead of diazepam or other anxiolytics because it provided anxiolysis without sedation and cognitive impairment (at the reccomended dose, which is around 250mg but i cannot remember exactly what it was). So its not GREAT for sleep but it does help quiet the mind, so there is that.

exactly, it seems that the mechanism of action that phenibut has causes  some interesting effects in terms of forming a physical dependancy. From  what I understand it works on PEA sites, dopamine sites, and GABA  sites, and I seem to remember reading it had action at NMDA sites and  calcium voltage channels. I think because of all of the stuff it does in  the brain, people can take the max dose once or twice a week and be  relativley fine. However, if someone starts taking say, 250mg, every  night before bed for a few months, they would probably experience, at  the minimum, some very uncomfortable anxiety, feelings of sadness,  feelings of general panic, shaking, sweating, and some unpleasant  insomnia. 


At the dose of 250mg/day, I'd have a hard time  believing that someone would be getting an extremely noticeable effect,  probably mild anxiolysis, a little help sleeping maybe (or paradoxically  some mild stimulation, it seems to have two heads like this), and maybe  some muscle relaxation. Hardly seems like it"d be worth the trouble.


Of  course, if you take a low dose of a benzo long enough you'd get nasty  discontinuation symptoms at the very LEAST. But it seems that since  phenibut is so unique in its method of action, the physical dependancy  sets in quickly (same with tollerance), and because of the different  systems it acts on the withdrawal end up being complex.


You  basically pay significantly more for the "up" that phenibut gives with  the withdrawal syndrome thats at least 2X shittier than the high was  good.

250-500 mg is fine for anxiety , equivalent to up to 0.5 mg of xanax imo.

Update: on second week @ 3-4g/day

Physically I'm not confined 2 bed anymore but now Im on crutches to move around so I have to keep taking the phenibut cuz I still cant exercise. Crutches are a pain in the ass so I consider myself to be bed bound still.


I'm so bored yet I can't do nothing but drugs. I thought about buying a ps4 but how is my crippled ass gonna carry that damn thing from the store? Both of my hands have to hold onto the crutches. Lol

Idk man, get someone to help you bring the ps4 home from the store? I'm an Xbox one man myself, but to each his own I guess. But dude, start reading a book or do something creative like art, music, writing, etc. I've been reading "Gone Girl" and that book kicks ass, super interesting, and I'm not the kinda guy who is a 'reader". I only suggest this because I've gotten into the habit of using drugs to kill time because I was bored in the past, and once I got dependant on em, it was VERY hard to stop, because once I got through the physical WD, I'd realize the only thing I used to fill time was drugs, so it was "boring" to fucking do anything else, which led me to full on relapses a whole bunch o times. Just saying dude, don't put so much faith/value/significance/importance on drugs. They're supposed to enhance experiences or enable experiences........not BE the experience (except some of the hallucinogens haha).

Thanks dude. Yeahive been using drugs because I have nothing else to do. Literally nothing , I will sit on my bed all day and read posts on online forums. If I had something to keep me busy, I wouldnt be doing that. I used to be addicted to online gaming before drugs, so I've always had an addictive personality. The reason why I'm injured, is cuz I got addicted to exercise lol. Anything I do, I get addicted to. If it's something I enjoy, I will get addicted to it. I started watching a TV series, I finished all seasons in a matter of days, because I watched every episode nonstop. I used my computer so much, it over heated and died.  Now I have nothing to do, so back to drugs. I will try to get a PS4 tomorrow, that would help me pass the time as I heal from my injury and keep me off phenibut. Then return it before the 30 days expire lol

I'm not really trying to be a dick here...BUT......


If you being confined to bed for just 2 weeks means you HAVE to indulge in all sorts of drugs I'd HATE to see what you'd be like if you had THREE torn ACLs in the past like I did.


Imagine not being able to really walk much at all for the first 3 weeks...I mean you CAN while in a brace AND crutches, and not only that, but you you have to sleep with this giant brace on which is hard, and you have to commit yourself to DAILY physical therapy for SIX months.


I mean it's SO bad that when you first get out of the hospital one of the "exercises" is just to sit in a fucking chair and try to lift your foot off the ground....and it's REALLY hard to do.


Like right after surgery you can't sit in a chair and lift your foot more than one fucking inch off the ground cause you have no strength in your leg and if someone tries to push your leg to do it you'll be in EXTREME pain.


You have to first sit in an electronic chair that moves your leg back and forth to your chest and back because you can't even move it that much by yourself and you have to sit in that shit FOUR HOURS A DAY for the first 2 weeks till you achieve a certain range of motion.


Of course you WOULD be on painkillers as I was  like Oxycodone and Hydrocodone for the pain...and yes of course I had some fun with them as well but didn't use them to actually get high more than two or three days a week max cause I knew I'd get addicted.


And I went through that THREE times.


That's a total of 18 MONTHS of that shit...over the course of 5 years cause I kept blowing my knee out again.


Sad to say it....but I think if you'd been in that situation...I'm not so sure you'd have been able to avoid ODing on heroin lol.


Sorry, that's NOT a nice thing to say...I'm being a dick here...I appologize as I'm a bit bitchy since I am in Kratom withdrawal which as we both know is NOT that bad....but still makes me pissy and bitchy lol.


I guess my point is:  be VERY wary of using drugs to escape from physical problems because if you ever have a REAL SERIOUS injury I can't imagine how much worse you could make it for yourself.


However, I should really heed my own advice cause instead of using drugs to escape PHYSICAL injuries which I've been surprisingly good at NOT doing THAT much of, I use them to escape mental problems, depression and anxiety.


So I guess I kind of need to listen to my own advice for different reasons lol.

On a TOTALLY different note I have just one question:


I NEVER use Phenibut more than 2 days a week BUT it's pretty rare that a 7 day period would go by without me dosing at least one day so is it POSSIBLE that if I went...lets say...10 days without that on like day 8 or 9 or 10 withdrawals could SUDDENLY appear even though I have NEVER had ANY before when sticking to my schedule of never dosing more than 2 days a week??


Probably not right?


Wouldn't WDs start before that and if they don't happen by 7 days after your last dose then they aren't going to happen??

Pretty sure you would notice withdrawals within 48 hrs after ur last dose of phenibut. And it's alright, I'm always bitchy and miserable unless I'm on some kind of substance. whenI'm sober, I realize how much life sucks. If I don't have an escape, whether it be video games, exercise, or drugs... I will go nuts. The last I was fully sober was 3-4 yrs ago, when I was on anti depressants, u see, life without some sort of crutch is just plain depressing

Yeah I know what you mean.


I mean I wouldn't say that FOR ME life ALWAYS "sucks when I'm not on drugs"...but I need SOMETHING to be addicted to like you said about yourself, also with exercise.


That's probably why I injured myself so many times, just pushing myself too hard too fast.


I have to have SOMETHING to be REALLY into, whether it's a TV show, a sport, a book, a drug, ANYTHING or I will go crazy.


I have long periods of sobriety, often several months if not more (not including my anti depressants and coffee) but there's never a time I'm not doing SOMETHING to a crazy extent.


So I'd agree with the other poster you should try to find some other things to be really into that won't hurt you as much as drugs like TV shows, internet, video games, books, music, whatever it is even if you can't exercise or move much.


Why don't you try to get back on anti depressants if they seem to have helped you so much??

Do you take any anti depressants?I tried Paxil and it did "cure me " but it's a potent inhibitor of 2d6 liver enzyme which blocks a majority of drugs. Actually most SSRI medication does this, but not to the extent of Paxil. I might ask my doctor for Zoloft , as its the most commonly prescribed ssri for anxiety ,but they say Paxil is the most potent SSRI and best for social anxiety, doctors don't reallyprescribe it anymore because of side effects... But I've always had GO BI OR GO HOME attitude, so I might as well just go back on Paxil, as I'm already Rx'd it. The only drug that worked o n it was alcohol. That shit just BLOCKS everything lol. Including happiness , sadness,etc. I doubt phenibut would work,, even if I used it only once a week, so that would suck. Phenibut has given me some pretty great experiences in life... 


Not sure if I wanna trade the NECTAR OF THE GODS (phenibut) and KRATOM for PAXIL yet. 

But Paxil + Exercise + Alcohol( 1 beer)  = Extremely pro social effect, almost in that ZEN / STREET SMARTS state of mind like on PHENIBUT but without the empathy or horny ness. So while I could pick up any chick, I would have to pull the 

"sorry but I don't wanna fuck , nice talking to ya LOL"

Yes, I am on Lexapro (escitalopram) for depression and Klonopin for anxiety.


They both work but only to an extent.


Klonopin helps my social anxiety GREATLY...but it doesn't do enough for my general anxiety, nor does it actually make me WANT to go out and be social like drinking or Kratom or Phenibut, it just gets rid of this one REALLY bad problem I have which I don't feel like discussing, but lets just say it's a life saver for me.


The Lexapro works for SOME of my depression but I don't really notice that I'm on it, all I know is that when I was cut off from my Klonopin for 9 months about 2 years ago I had been on Prozac and all that time I kind of didn't realize the Prozac WASN'T working cause the Klonopin masked it and did the rest of the work.


Suddenly when NOT on Klonopin for those 9 months I realized I was SERIOUSLY fucking depressed (AND of course really anxious without the Klonopin) and I switched to Lexapro.


Then I was able to start actually getting out of bed and doing some shit again, because while so depressed all I wanted to do was sleep, but I still had fucking horrible social anxiety cause some stupid doctor thought I shouldn't be on Klonopin.


FINALLY I got back on Klonopin again, and with the combo of Klonopin and Lexapro I am KIND of ok...still not really too great lol....but good enough to go out and face the world SOMETIMES and work a job, make money, and live life to an extent.


YES it is true that many drugs cannot be taken on SSRIs and are very dangerous and can cause serotonin syndrome BUT you'd be surprised at the large number of drugs I HAVE been able to get good and high on WITHOUT problems while still on both Lexapro and Klonopin.


Like they say not to drink on Lexapro (or Klonopin) but I drink on both all the time.


That does NOT mean it's a good idea (especially on Klonopin which only ONCE out of about 1,000 times caused me to black out and that was my FIRST day back on Klonopin after 9 months off of it so OBVIOUSLY the reason it happened was that I lost my tolerance to Klonopin and once I gained it back I was able to drink just as much on Klonopin and NOT black out...but still DON'T drink too much on Klonopin)....


But anyways, so yeah, I am able to use all of the following drugs on both Klonopin and Lexapro and get high and not YET (knock on wood) do any SERIOUS harm to myself:   alcohol, weed, Oxycodone, Hydrocodone (be VERY careful I Do NOT suggest mixing Opiates with BENZOS!!!) Kratom, Phenibut, Prolintane, Dexadrine, LSD, Shrooms, Salvia Divinorum, Opium, Nitrous Oxide, Kratom extract, Indian Warrior herb (just a VERY mild herb), and a bunch of others.


I mean my favorite drugs have always been things like Kratom, weed, alcohol, Shrooms and LSD and I never had a problem with any of them on either Lexapro, Prozac or Klonopin.


BUT....things like DXM will fucking KILL YOU if you take them on an SSRI...and things like Ecstasy or Molly (which I have never been able to use cause I was always on an SSRI since age 14) at BEST will NOT get you AT ALL high if you are taking an SSRI and at WORST could really hurt or kill you.


You just have to REALLY do your homework to figure out what you can and can't take.


But in my life I've never had a bad interaction with an SSRI and only one black out from drinking on Klonopin...and I'd only say my track record is good from a mixture of doing my research on Bluelight which was really a great discovery, and probably also some degree of luck before I knew about this website and was younger.

I hadn't seen the last part of your post but I don't know about Paxil but Lexapro is probably pretty closely related and I've had ZERO trouble getting high on Phenibut or Kratom on it.


MAYBE IF Paxil is different Phenibut MIGHT be an issue (I can't really see why though) but i SERIOUSLY doubt you would have ANY trouble getting high on Kratom.


I mean why would an SSRI block an opioid???


Doesn't make sense to me why it would, OR why it would block a GABA B drug like Phenibut and for me Lexapro does neither and neither did Prozac which is another SSRI (actually I never mixed Phenibut with Prozac, only Lexapro but Kratom DID get me high on BOTH Prozac and Lexapro and Phenibut also works just fine on Lexapro).


FOR ME Lexapro does NOT block emotions.


I still feel everything, depressed (not AS depressed thankfully) happy IF something good happens which it sometimes does lol, can laugh, can feel all the same emotions as off of it.


I know SOME people react that way to SOME SSRIS but neither Prozac or Lexapro ever gave me those issues, nor have I had any problems with my libido which everyone else seems to very annoyingly say ALWAYS happen if you take an SSRI, cause that's NOT ALWAYS true.

That sounds just like me dude, sitting on the computer all day, being high and surfin the web. I get it dude, I still do that sometimes, just without all the drugs. I threw myself into making music which is something I've loved since I was 14 but let fall the the side when drugs got the lead role in my life. You just gotta find something to occupy. You mentioned excersize.....its funny, I had a friend like you......after rehab he'd drink like 20 bottles of water a day and run hor hours on the treadmill........he would even binge eat carrots and cellery.......I guess, like you, he needed to be constantly occupied

I've been taking Phenibut for a while but there's still a few questions I have about it I was wondering if other users could answer:


1) How long does a Phenibut high really last for most people??


Like for me, I started taking some early today at around 10:30 AM and it kicked in around 12:30PM and it's now around 10:30PM at night and I'm still on it, although I redosed more later on but I am pretty sure even my first dose is still effecting me.


That's why I think Phenibut highs actually last like 12 hours.


Do other people feel like it lasts that long though??


I definitely don't think it wears off ANY sooner than like 9 hours. 


I mean for me it lasts a LONG time.


2) Likewise, what is Phenibut's half life?


Most people say that 5 times the half life is how long a drug is in your system, but some people would say 7.


So I'm just wondering how long it stays in your system.


3) How long do most Phenibut users feel it takes for Phenibut to kick in after they take it??


For me, I feel like it takes somewhere between 1 1/2 and 2 hours to kick in.


Like today, like I said I took my first dose at 10:30AM and I'd already had some strong coffee so I was wide awake but I was lying on my bed around the time it kicked in and all I know is that a little after the clock said noon I was out like a light again for another 2 1/2 hours and getting really weird dreams so I know the Phenibut put me back to sleep meaning that it had taken somewhere around 90 mins to kick in.


But maybe for some people it could take longer or shorter based on your body chemistry.


Also, I am talking about Phenibut HCL here and not Phenibut FFA, although I didn't find much difference between the two since I've tried both.


Thanks.

For me, I begin to feel the effects about an hour and a half to two hours in, but I don't experience the full effect until about seven hours after dosing. It lasts well into the next day for me. About the half life I couldn't tell you. I started building a tolerance cycling a gram on a day off a day, and after about a month of doing that I did experience uncomfortable side effects taking an extended break, the scariest probably being muscle tremors in my legs. Now I only dose about a gram every three days, and that seems to work just fine for its intended purpose without any major drawbacks.

Wow it lasts into the next day for you??


I don't think it does for me, but I dosed 2 days in a row the past 2 before today and today I'm extra sensitive emotionally so I am wondering if that's a little bit of GABA rebound but I doubt it could actually be real WD because I have done this amount several times before and never had WD.


Because the tub says no more than 4,000mgs in a week I used to stick to that but because so many people said it was ok to do more than that I settled on no more than 8,000mgs in a week and NEVER taken on more than 3 seperate days in a week even if divided up over those it equaled less or the same amount.


Sounds like from what you are doing you'd consider 8,000mgs in a week to be too much but again, I've never had any bad side effects from it, beyond maybe IF this bit of sensitivity I am experiencing today is a bit of rebound but I'm not anxious which is often what happens with GABA rebound, like when I get drunk on my Klonopin I am always very anxious the next day when hungover but I've never had that happen to me with Phenibut.

I definitely wouldn't quit phenibut cold turkey. That would be like quitting Klonopin or some benzo cold turkey. Yeah, some smarty pants would say phenibut isn't "technically" a benzo, but I think of it as one and treat it as one because it has a helluva bite and backlash just like one. Taper off of the phenibut by cutting your dose back. Whatever you were taking, slowly take less until you're out of the woods. When I tapered years ago and started feeling REALLY bad, all I needed was to fill a 00 capsule up with phenibut and it would at least ease the withdrawals. Or maybe you'll need to fill 2 capsules first. Just slowly taper back!

**Phenibut and depression...?**


Long story short, I was mentally freaking out about life and felt like it would be a good time to take 4g Phenibut HCL, not FAA, and try and calm myself.


(Read if you want to know the backstory, jump to the paragraph below this to go straight to my question)

Long story not shortened, It worked half of what I wanted it to do, and the other half it made it twice as worse but I still think I would have rather taken this scenario over the original, no matter how bad it got. For my anxiety and stressing, it was completely gone, adios. But the half that I was thinking about life, struggling and having a literal hell of a time, that was amplified to the point where I could do nothing besides listen to music and try to drown out the thoughts about how shitty life is, to little avail. All I could think of was what I was thinking of before the phenibut, and it got to the point where I stopped responding to all of my conversations over text, snapchat, instagram, and I sat on my floor at the brink of taking a sedative and sleeping the thoughts away.  I decided that was a bad idea because I wasn't aware of how severe the synergy between Phenibut and sedatives would be, so I decided to drink until I couldn't focus on jack shit anymore and at this point my experience turned okay, less me being able to do anything productive.


So the question I pose, is this normal? Is it normal to have bad thoughts worsened and to think about life or bad topics in general more and feel worse about them on phenibut than off? I want to redose in the morning to prevent any more anxiety, the first time I'll ever redose on any psychoactive substance, so don't worry I'm not addicted to Phenibut or anything, but I don't know whether that will make me seldom in school and think about what I was before or was that experience just the exception, not the rule? Would something like Amphetamine do better at making me think less about the hardships, more than phenibut that is?


I have school in 5 hours, I'd love, but don't need, a response before then. If I don't get a response I'll just redose and see what happens, because I really want to have these thoughts out of my head.

Yes, that is quite normal. Phenibut amplifies emotions of every nature, quite like Ethanol. So if you felt shitty before, it can get worse. Moreover doing Phenibut while being alone is pointless IME. 4g is a very high dose (for me it would be an OD) for a non-dependent user. So maybe try 1g next time. It feel a lot less toxic.


Amphetamine should not be abused as a sole mood lifting agent. That is just a side effect of amphetamine. For your situation I would recommend some mild mood-lifting, already researched, herbal substance in combination with physical activity. The latter being more important. 


To come back to topic : Yes, your reactions are normal in my view.

4g is ALOT. Did you build a tolerance to this dose? Half of that put me to sleep. Maybe a quarter of that for anxiolitic action. Unless ofc ur taking something else with it, on amp I have to double dose phenibut. Amps comedown will make u feel fkin terrible if u think u feel bad now

OP, did you say that you didn't know the severity of mixing phenibut with a sedative, but you drank on it instead? You understand that was a bad idea right? 


I would recommend you read some mega threads.


Most definately take it easy with drugs/drug combos that you are unfamiliar with.


Read  the shrine, if you want to see how bad combos can turn out.

I personally disagree that taking Phenibut while alone is pointless and I also frequently go as high as 4 grams but I will spread out those 4 grams usually over a 10-12 hour period so by the time I actually reach that dosage I will be going to sleep soon.


The majority of a day on Phenibut for me will probably be ranging in the 2,000mgs range or the low 3000s like maybe 2,000-3,200 before it starts getting late and I am seeking a truly sedative experience to just nod out, but keep in mind I drink LARGE amounts of caffeine which probably helps keep me more active and awake on higher doses.


If I want to be at all active I can't take more than 3,200mgs.


But I greatly enjoy Phenibut while by myself just walking around outside when it's nice out and listening to music and getting a really good emotional impact out of nature or the music I'm listening to in particular, sometimes other things etc and I also really like to exercise while on it which is one of the uses it's supposedly intended for and in LOW doses can increase my performance when doing cardio or light weight lifting.


IMO saying there's no point in doing it alone is like saying it's wrong to drink alcohol alone:  is it probably more psychologically unhealthy??


I think we can agree that it is.


Is it still enjoyable/helpful in some way??


That's up to the user themselves to decide.


But on topic, I have never gotten depression from Phenibut personally, but I DO notice it can strongly increase my anger but at the same time, it can also calm me down and make me feel happy and empathetic so it's a catch 22.


It all depends on what is going on.


If someone says something to piss me off while I am on a strong dose of Phenibut I often find myself getting MORE angry than normal which I find odd but perhaps it isnt', and that DOESN'T happen to me when I drink which is of course another GABAergic.


BUT...if I am instead ANXIOUS about something then Phenibut calms me down, and if I am depressed it usually is likely to help as well in that I can appreciate the little things in life more like hanging out outside on a nice day, chilling with my cat lol, listening to music, a nice talk with a friend, etc.


And if I happen to be around people I also find myself more generous and empathetic towards them while on it.

I've got a very low tolerance and even the 4g with the ethanol (140 proof bitchesssss) it wasn't particularly sedating, I didn't want to do things like exercise, but nevertheless I was able to fully. And thank you for the insight into not using Amphetamine for mood lift, I'll be sure to take what you said into account. I really didn't realize that it isn't particularly meant for what I use it for.

IME 2g does very little besides reduce, not eliminate, my speech problems, and does slightly improve my mood, that's why I took 4g. I took 2 cups of keurig style coffee with it, as I've heard caffeine and phenibut are very good together.

About mixing Phenibut and alcohol, I was impaired at the time and decided that it probably wasn't going to harm me, and I realize now that that was a highly dangerous decision and I should have done research on the combination if I wanted to do it. 


Also, are there actually shrine posts about people who mixed phenibut and sedatives..? I'll go check it out now, thanks for the advice Speed King.

Is nodding where you suddenly realize something/feel the random urge to like stop everything and just relax for a second, because that happened at what I consider the peak of my experience, after I redosed 2g (Essentially, as I took 2g at first on an empty stomach and a few hours later I vomited the contents of my stomach up and then took 2g with food to try and stop vomiting the phenibut up). It was weird, I was having trouble focusing on objects far away and for the first time on a psychoactive I had photophobia, even though my eyes were nowhere near the size they are on Dex. 


Apart from all of the responses, after my experience today, I can genuinely say that I believe that vomiting a few times and having a minor headache which, yes, is caused BY THE PHENIBUT PEOPLE, TRIED AND TRUE, is an okay swap for the benefits I receive in the school setting. I have a speech impairment which hasn't been diagnosed but is definitely a major problem, and the amount of phenibut I took COMPLETELY erased the impairment. I was speaking like I never ever have before, I was literally so happy I could have cried. In addition, I have many many moments every day where a word is just on the tip of my tongue and I can never find it, but on phenibut, I had no such moments. I was able to pick up topics much faster than I have before, I was super super motivated to do work, I was incredibly sociable, like, I have trouble sometimes talking to friends in the hallway but on phenibut I'm able to talk to complete strangers with 0 problem, and lastly I was much more confident in myself, I felt like I was able to be whoever I wanted and that I was able to do whatever I put my mind to. I will definitely be trying phenibut in varying dosages to achieve the same effects with less side effects, because vomiting in school isn't too fun.

No, I think most people define "nodding" as basically falling asleep and then waking back up again and falling asleep again etc repeatedly like you might do even if you were just tired.


I'm not sure why you threw up off that dosage but maybe it was cause you were on an empty stomach or took too much.


Just be careful because Phenibut is HIGHLY addictive and the withdrawals can supposedly be like HELL ON EARTH, sometimes even with days of insomnia and paranoia and even auditory hallucinations and stopping cold turkey even has the risk of death as does with all GABA drugs like benzos and alcohol.


I personally NEVER take more than 8,000mgs in a single week or on more than 3 days in a single week at ANY dose.


I currently stick to never dosing more than 2 days a week.


The tub itself usually says not to take more than 4,000mgs in a week but I've found myself ok at twice that.


Phenibut is NOT the type of drug you should take 4, 5, 6 or 7 days a week EVEN FOR A SHORT period of time as it can cause dependence VERY quickly and also your tolerance will rise very quickly so your current dosage no longer works and once you get to taking more to achieve the same effect your getting yourself into trouble so set a certain dosage you NEVER exceed in 24 hours and a certain number of days per week you NEVER exceed in terms of when you take it.


Don't fall in love with it so much that you take too much or you will have a worse problem on your hands than your speech impairment, though I'm glad to hear it has worked for you, you will most likely need to supplement your Phenibut usage with some alternative therapy or ways of dealing with your problem if you expect lasting results in my opinion.


Like maybe work with a speech therapist or psychologist while you are on Phenibut??


Or even on the off days?

Sorry if this isn't an appropriate place to ask this, but If I just had a ONE day binge where I consumed 6g over the course and a little alcohol as well, is it okay to completely stop after it or must I use a relatively quick taper?

6g is nothing. you can just stop dude. Whats more important is how much you took over a week. Tapering after just a day will worsen your withdrawals. I doubt you will feel anything . 


For any of you that takes phenibut, it's how much you take in a week that matters. It doesn't matter take a big ass dose one day or spread it out over days. It's the same thing.


I was using like 2g a day every day in a week that's 14g. And I would continue doing that every week till week 3 then stop. Now that's gonna warrant some motherfucking withdrawals. Not that bad. I just didn't sleep for 7 days and was horribly depressed and anxious.   That was my most recent run (last month)


For HR purpose I'm not gonna talk about my previous run but I went through 1000g  of phenibut powder before stoping abruptly and was fucked up for a long time.

4g at ~7pm night before, little alcohol at 8,  fell asleep at around 9 or 10, woke up at 1:30 to 2, took ~2g at 3, threw it all up by 4:30, dosed again right after I threw up but added food and caffeine this time, so I didn't throw up, and Gym class started at 9.

There must be a reason for you to take an overdose of Phenibut before gym class. Was your intention to be too sick for a physical exam ? Why not just call in sick ? 6g is too much. Btw : If you feel fine now, you most probably will also be fine the next days. It will feel like a alcohol hangover I suppose. If you feel acute draconic side effects, best seek medical attention, but that is unlikely. And don't forget to drink water. That stuff can be harsh on the kidneys.


@fooman


Don't worry fooman. Your taper will not be affected. It is not nice to hijack a thread, but when someone takes an OD of 6g and thinks it is harmless, we HAVE to reply. But after the issue is moved to the Megathread, our posts should be deleted here.


@Ventrusii


Please post your question in the Phenibut megathread [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/794810-Phenibut-Discussion-Thread/page4](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/794810-Phenibut-Discussion-Thread/page4). We should delete our posts after that here. You have to click on "edit" and then in edit mode on "delete" on the right.


I deleted my last two posts and asked the mods, whether they can move our other posts.

I just wanted to say sorry about my post yesterday. I was high on amphetamines and even though I can be careless with Phenibut use, 6g is too much. I didn't mean to downplay  ur dose like it nothing just because I took insane doses in the past. But let us know how ur doing...

This. I was just about to explain how phenibut withdrawal made me hallucinate and hear things that weren't actually there. I couldn't tell what was real or not real anymore. It makes you want to kill yourself. People need to stop playing around with this and take it more seriously.

I had ordered 25g to have on hand in case of emergencies and after reading these threads I sent it back. The more I read the more I realize how insidious this stuff really is. I think this is definately off limits to any one who has had issues with other GABAergics, though I am grossly fascinated to see what PAWS is like after a long term daily phenibut habit.

No. You don't want to know what it's like. PAWS from phenibut is a nightmare. A different type of nightmare from benzo withdrawals. It's even worst the way it fucks with your mind. Literally you could go insane.

Phenibut is way more addictive than benzos to me not only do they take anxiety but also improves cognition and motivation unlike benzos. Im always more verbally fluid, increased ability to think on my feet, come up with a solution or decision on  Phenibut so there is a temptation to keep using.

Bingo! It makes you feel quick, witty and focused, great mood, no anxiety. It honestly reminds me of a "Limitless" pill from that movie. That's what it's like. Anyway, been there and done that with phenibut. It stopped working the same for me so I moved on to a new addiction.

That almost makes it tempting lol. Since getting clean I have become so dull and listless, and I don't socialize much. I do go out and do things, but I'm conversationally very quiet. Positive phenibut would have gotten out of hand for me immediately. It's too bad they can design something that has similar effects but is not as insidious. Benzo are relaxing but the are also mind numbing...definately not even close.

@sobrietysucks


I'm not sure if this is to me, doesn't seem so because you up-played my scenario, rather than downplaying it as you said. But if it was to me, first what you said is okay, in entirety, and I'm doing mostly well right now. I have a minor headache that's lasted on and off since yesterday at about 3, and my nausea stopped at around 6 this morning, that being the last time I threw up (thank fucking god). I had minor hallucinations like me hearing my name once or twice and seeing things race across my peripheral vision but not actually be there. Other than that, a little brain fog is all I have. I'm thankful that I didn't kill myself with the dose and my stupid actions, and I think taking a two stimulants with my redose (2 cups of coffee and my new (literally started that day, funny enough) ~62.5mg dose of propylhexedrine (FUCK LAVENDER BURPS LIKE OMFG)) may have saved my fucking life. I think this because after I believe the propylhexedrine wore off, ~4-5 hours after I took it, I went from able to do my daily school activities, to falling nearly asleep on a bench in PE. I think that I might have stimulated myself during the peak and slightly after, thank god, because the peak without stimulants could have decreased my rate of respiration to the point of death if that was enough. I guess we'll never know, and for my sake, I'm glad we don't.

How do you deal with the acidity with 2g+ doses? I'm fine with lower doses, but at doses where this stuff actually starts to get recreational, it gives me the worst heartburn and intestinal cramps and my whole body just feels acidic. My stomach really can't tolerate tums for some reason. Baking soda? Would the dampen the effects of the phenibut somehow? I don't get very worrisome side effects like bleeding, but I also don't use frequently.

Best thing to do IME is take two tums every time you start to feel the slightest bit of nausea, don't take into account the "max dose" on the antacids per day, as that's for someone with normal acid production. On phenibut, you'll need more than the maximum dose, no doubt.

HCl in capsules. I read that the FAA is better in terms of acidity, but the same person said it felt much less recreational, which is the only reason I use phenibut. I couldn't find many other accounts.

While I definitely think you are correct in a way if you over do it with Phenibut, it all depends on the type of drug inclinations you have, because when used PROPERLY Phenibut can be great.


It's odd with me because I often have trouble moderating with many substances, I might even say MOST substances, but then there are certain substances that for whatever reason (**knock on wood**) I don't have trouble moderating with really and Phenibut is one of them.


While I often get up to 4 grams in a day  (I am on that much right now) I never exceed that, nor exceed 8,000mgs in a single week, and so far have had very few real side effects from it.


On the other hand, while I like Kratom more (R.I.P. stupid fucking DEA, now I'm just moving on and forgetting it ever existed) and I'd consider Kratom FAR less harmful and less addictive FOR ME for some reason I was just obsessed with Kratom and constantly redosing.


I never got a really bad PHYSICAL addiction but I was mentally way too in love with the stuff, and if I did that with Phenibut I'd be in BIG trouble.


But if for some reason you find yourself to harmonize well with the substance and DON'T feel the constant need to take it every day..which for whatever reason I don't...it can be an excellent compound with few side effects.


It's just one of those things where kept at the exact right dosages you can experience great and helpful effects with very few side effects at all, but if you cross that line into using more than you should it's like suddenly dropping off a steep cliff when you were previously on entirely firm ground.


At least, that's what I believe from the reports I've heard of it's dangers without ever having experienced themselves because I've been cautious.


So my point is, yes, if you have trouble with GABergics you should probably steer clear...BUT, I don't feel like its' this "Evil" substance, and I feel like when NOT greatly overdone, you can get really high off it and experience very positive effects like performance enhancement with some sports and intellectual activities, empathy towards people, relaxing effect for socializing, with very few negative side effects.


It's a "dose makes the poison" kind of deal, but when used **moderately**, I really feel like it's quite safe.

This is exactly what I am wondering. I'm a horrible alcoholic, but benzos were never insidious for me. I never took them to get high, and the only times I took more ham prescribed was when I was drunk and had forgotten I already took one and would keep popping one until I passed out or ended up in the hospital (legitimately, my memory was destroyed at that time). 


I was absolutely addicted to benzos because I had a script and took Xanax daily per the script, for ten years. It wasn't until I was at the end stage of my alcoholism did I learn that benzos were abusable and addictive. When I went to rehab for the booze they cut me off (terrible withdrawal and PAWS). When I got out of rehab I wasn't obsessing about benzos, but booze was on my mind 24/7, and I eventually relapsed on alcohol.  I actually found little hidden stashes of Xanax around my house (not hidden intentionally, just very poor memory) and just flushed them as I found them. It didn't occur to me to take it after that hellish withdrawal. The day I checked into rehab was the day I took my last benzo. Originally I thought if I took Phenibut in lower doses, like 250 mg - 500 mg would that be therapeutic for me until I found out it's not a daily suppliment. Then I thought I could use it for acute anxiety - it happens a couple of times a year. 


My drug history include opiates for a few years, coke, and other random substances and I never had an issue stopping those, granted, I didn't feel great quitting opiates but I stopped cold turkey after a daily two year habit and never relapsed. I really enjoyed them. I loved coke but I could absolutely use one weekend and keep it around for months without it creeping into my thoughts. I've had many substances that are known to be fiendish and I could take or leave them so I really don't know about phenibut. 


I haven't sent it back yet, but also knowing now that it is not quick acting I'm not so certain it would do what I was hoping. I wanted it for acute anxiety attacks and it doesn't sound like it would help those. I guess as tempting as it is, it's just not worth the risk especially if it's not going to kick in an sedate me within 20 minutes, and probably not going to be hugely noticeable at the dose range I was considering anyway. I appreciate your comments - I am certainly considering what you have said.

Yeah, Phenibut is ANYTHING but "quick acting".


It takes about an hour and a half to two hours for me to feel a dose so it's not the kind of thing you can take in the case of an acute panic attack like Xanax or Klonopin, the latter of the two which I have scripts for which helps with my anxiety, but Klonopin has never gotten me high in any way while Phenibut does.


I am the way with Phenibut that you were with Coke: I can leave it around and usually won't feel like I absolutely can't resist it.


I only use it on the weekends and never during the week.


For me I can take it or leave it and yet really enjoy its effects so its a good medium for me, but yeah, most drug users do have certain drugs that they have problems with more than others and you can never really know whether or not it will be one of those you have problems with, and while it isn't really all that much like alcohol, it's closer to alcohol than non-GABA drugs and I COULD see it as potentially being something an alcoholic might abuse.


If you actually have money to blow you could buy a small amount and try it once or twice and then flush it if you think it's going to be an issue, but if you really liked it maybe you'd then be inclined to purchase more as it's not very expensive and entirely legal and easy to order online.


It's an unusual substance for sure, both relaxing and in some ways stimulating.


But the people who have problems with it have had SERIOUS issues.


If abused and taken more than the amount I take it can be VERY habit forming and isn't the kind of thing to just say "fuck it I'll keep taking more" with.


You have to set a certain limit for yourself based on the guidelines on the TUB (it says no more than 4,000mgs in a week, so I take no more than twice that in a week) and then stick to those VERY RIGIDLY.


I know that if I exceeded what I take by any significant margin I'd run into trouble, so I never have and because i don't find it to be irresistable for me, I never will...and the fear of knowing what would happen if I did keeps me in check after having read some of threads on here from those who abused it.

Can anyone help me gather the courage to try phenibut? I desperately need something to make me more social but after coming off benzos my GABA receptors are a little whacky and I am afraid to try phenibut because of its crazy long duration. I dont want to be out of it for days and I general dont like synthetic substances only preferring to ingest plants. There are a few synthetics I can tolerate but not many and never as well as plants.


The downside to sticking with plants is that I have not found a plant that will obliterate social anxiety and make me want to talk to people. It seems only synthetic drugs can accomplish that sort of thing, or perhaps alcohol but alcohol doesnt work for me socially. It makes me feel retarded.

Who told you Phenibut lasts for days??


It can SOMETIMES last into the next day depending on when you take your last dose but you will DEFINITELY not feel it for more than a day after you dose.


And you also shouldn't feel "out of it" if you are not dosing EXTREMELY high.


I just feel nice the next day and in a good mood.


It will definitely get rid of most of your social anxiety as it does with mine.


So maybe that stuff will help you feel better about it.


It's really not bad at all if you just stick to not using it more than like 2 days a week and follow some simple guidelines.


The scary stories are from people who decided to take it regularly and if you don't do that you probably won't have bad side effects as I only use it 2 days a week max and never have any serious ones.

I'm really interested in trying phenibut. I've been reading a wide range of various dosages, tho. Would you say that 1g is enough for a first time user to feel pleasant effects without being sleepy?

1 gram is a great start. I didn't really "feel it" until I upped to 2 grams, but I was safe to start low. Rather safe than sorry on phenibut because if you get sick, it lasts hours and hours, not fun. You should be fine with 1 gram. If nothing happens in 2 to 4 hours, try 2 grams next time.

Thank you! I'm assuming the effects are going to be subtle. If I don't feel much at 1g would it be ok to dose another gram after 3 or 4 hours or is redosing pointless during the same day?

Maybe it's because I take opiates but all this over phenibut? It doesn't seem that potent. I've also read if you take higher doses GABBA A is effected so that might be why there is such discrepancy in feeling of use. I wish there wasn't a 50/50 chance to get a horrible migraine because its a pretty good sleep aid and relaxant.

I took 1.5g phenibut today and brain fog, anxiety, fatigue, depression withdrawal and cravings from other drugs completely gone.  No matter how much stims,benzos or kratom I take, none of them make me feel as good / happy like Phenibut does.

Lol- I purchased some with some other suppliments like l-theanine and melatonin etc last week.

If you need the courage to ingest a substance you should probably and investigate further the aspects that are frightening you. I prefer plants to synthetics but sometimes it's unavoidable. However, I find these beneficial for social anxiety: kratom, ashwaganha, l-theanine, and kava...have you tried any of those? I currently take 500mg ashwaganha powder and 100mg of l-theanine in the morning, and then another 100mg of l-theanine at lunch and also at dinner. Barely any anxiety anymore, it's been great. I've been doing this for two weeks now. I was using kratom but that's not sustainable. I ordered pure ashwaganha powder and l-theanine powder in 100g tubs - you need a scale but buying bulk powder is easier on the wallet. I was taking some suppliments from Whole Foods that only lasted 15 days and were triple what I paid for the powder. Do you research and find a reputable vendor


ETA: This is not plant based but if you're recovering from benzos look up aniracetam. It needs to be taken with choline, but I think it helps repair some of the damage done by excess glutamate when stopping benzos. From the studies I have read, it has a regenerative effect.

I think that's good u return the phenibut. I tried the supplements, kratom benzos etc and nowhere near magical as phenibut for social anxiety in particular, there's always a chance you will like the feeling so much that u wanna keep using it... I will probably use Phenibut recreationally for the rest of my life because of the altered extroverted fun bubbly state effect it gives. Could be all in my head but I just feel so much more pleasant to everyone.  I know that if I had never tried it, I would have never wanted to chase that feeling. Idk if it's a good or bad thing but  Phenibut made realize nothing is impossible and that I can be any1 I want? As opposed to the anxious, introverted, semi-ocd/ overly introespective, stress prone, reserved self I have been all my life. It made me realize that sometimes, I can switch that dull mediocre person off and be who I want to be, even if only 1 or 2 times a week.


For general anxiety id say just stick to benzos as they will do the job. But for "social" anxiety, phenibut deffo takes care of that.

That is very odd in terms of whatever vendor you are talking about but I don't think you are correct.


That's happening with Kratom, but the main vendors I know of still offer Phenibut and it doesn't pose the same threat to big Pharma that Kratom does and from my experience most of the vendors which offered Kratom in the past did not sell Phenibut and most vendors which sold/sell Phenibut never sold Kratom.


Phenibut is considered a nootropic and to some extent performance enhancer and is sold alongside congitive aids as well as performance enhancing aids for sports whereas Kratom was never part of that same scene and sold in herb shops.


It's not a painkiller and it is a prescription drug in Russia which gives it credence.


I might also be being a bit hopeful, but I don't think Phenibut is on the way out like Kratom is.


It's still sold alongside tons of other nootropics on multiple sites.

Ok, thanks! I'm ordering some this Friday so should have it early next week. I'll let ya know how it goes. Hopefully, I'll like it and can use it once or twice a week. I'm a Kratom lover and that's coming to an untimely end. I don't really want to go back to pills so maybe this will be something I can chill with from time to time.

Ok. Just please have a scale. I always measured with scales and put the powder in 00 capsules. You want to make sure exactly how much you're taking.

The vendor I've been seeing online sales 300mg capsules. I'm probably gonna purchase those. It says 99.5% pure...if that can be believed. I don't have a scale and figured I better be safe with it already being measured out.

It's hard to say whether or not these products will go the way of kratom. I sure hope not.


But Moreaux is correct about credit card processors/banks. They are cracking down on the sale of these "grey area" items including not only kratom sites but many nootropics sites as well. They are simply refusing to provide credit card processing to many of these sites suddenly (within the last week or so).


Don't be surprised the next time you want to order at your favorite site... You may be unable to pay directly with a credit card.


I think Moreaux point is: hopefully this is not a sign of worse things to come.

That was my point indeed ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I figured I would mention the entire experience as Phenibut is one of the most popular items sold on that site and a few others I purchase from, and the inability to process credit cards was not only that one site but several other vendors, which also happened earlier this month to several kratom vendors. As Phenibut seems like it should be tapered and not cold turkey'ed when using regularly as some members do, I would certainly make certain that I had enough stashed away for an emergency taper in case there are sudden issues with procurement. I say this in the potential interest of harm reduction as I don't know if Phenibut, when taken daily over an extended period of time, causes some of the same issues with the glutamate system that benzodiazapines do when suddenly stopped. I could see it being possible if someone were a daily high dose user, and there is no guarantee emergency room workers would be familiar enough with the withdrawal to provide meaningful support should one have to make a visit while in Phenibut withdrawal. Aside from that, the few stories I have read, particularly the most recent one above, sounds like stopping abruptly is pure hell so a standby taper stash may not be a bad idea ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Well the only sites I've ever ordered it from are still allowing credit cards and I'm sure there's plenty more.


For the ones that no longer are, how are you able to pay??


Bitcoins only?


I don't even know how to use bitcoins.


Or can you use money orders??


And WHY would they reject credit cards when these drugs are fully legal??

I can't speak for all sites, but most would still probably allow payment through things like Bitcoin, Money Orders, bank transfer, etc.


Not all credit card processors have cracked down, and obviously, not all sites have had their credit card processing revoked yet. But it is happening to more and more sites so just be aware.


If you are dependent on something like phenibut it MAY be a good idea, like Moreaux suggested, to make sure you always have enough on hand to do an emergency taper. You never know, phenibut could be suddenly emergency scheduled out of nowhere. I agree that it is unlikely to happen, but considering the dangers of withdrawal, why risk it?


Mycophile: I do not know exactly why the credit card companies are revoking their services to nootropics sites. I can only assume they are being pressured to by somebody or agency. After all, these companies make their money handling credit card transactions for other businesses. So it would not be in their best interest to turn away business like this... Hence, I believe, they must be pressured into doing so.


This is frustrating to nootropics site owners. The ones I have spoken to say they were blind sided by this suddenly. They are trying to find a new credit card processor that won't refuse to work with them, but it appears such credit card processors are far and few between these days.


By the way, Bitcoin is not so difficult to use. It isn't really any more difficult than using PayPal once you get used to it. If interested, search Google for how to use it... You'll be surprised to see it's not really so hard or confusing.

Because nootropic sites are frequently used by mainstream society, a lot of good write ups and informationals and some excellent resources that have been published this week regarding Bitcoin including trusted vendors/agencies. I did get phenomenal information from the owner of one of the nootropics sites I deal with, and have been considering trying it out. 


Keep in mind Bitcoin is not federally backed, so if you store yours at an agency and something happens, you're out of the cash. Similarly, if you store them on your hard drive or on a token/vault and that hardware breaks, goes missing, etc, you are out of the cash so keep that in mind I when purchasing them. This has been the biggest drawback for me as to why I have not been involved with Bitcoin for myself. Many vendors accept Bitcoin, including some local pizza places in my town so it is definately becoming more mainstream.

**benefits vastly outweighs risks**


started again and have stuck with ~500mg 3x daily (generally 6am, midday, 6pm) which seems to be where I find the best coverage and most consistent effects.


I can say without a doubt that the key for me has been sticking to regular dosage and timing, I believe this is hugely important for anyone using it daily. It has done wonders for my generalized and social anxieties and has facilitated the most stable mood and consistent mindset I've ever had in my life. Clarity of mind, reduced obsessiveness, better interactions with others, better sleep, improved motivation (subtle, not extreme like "honeymoon" period with stimulants). Just all round happier, healthier and more positive about life! I love it and feel truly lucky to have given it a try ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

The standard treatment regimen is 750-1500 mg per day for 3 weeks. You may still get some physical withdrawal symptoms, but they should be relatively mild if you kept your dosing regimen at or below 1500 mg per day. But you should have some phenibut on hand to taper with if your withdrawal symptoms seem more than mild.

I was thinking a while ago about something concerning Phenibut that would be pretty good, IMO. What if you were to take the dose that you've found to make you much more sociable, and then added a low(-ish) dose of any good stimulant? I think that would be a pretty good combination, the Phenibut for easing social anxiety and inhibitions, and the stimulant to make you more inclined to do things, talk, socialize, dance, and have a blast. 


Does anyone know from experience if this kind of a combo is worth trying, or basically just the same as alcohol-induced sociability mixed with alcohol-induced socializing, without the other alcohol effects?


On another note: I feel so lovey when I'm on Phenibut, and I feel like people are so much nicer when I'm on it. It just makes me smile ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yes and it's a good combo.


I've combined Phenibut with both Prolintane and Dexedrine separately (I would NOT take Prolintane and Dex together, too much stimulation) and both combos were GREAT.


My favorite combos were Phenibut, Kratom and Prolintane and Phenibut, Kratom and Dexedrine.


The stimulant plus relaxant (and opioid in Kratom's case) combo is excellent.


However, I personally feel like Phenibut is also somewhat stimulating and not only sedating/relaxing and many others feel this way as well.

  a mild stim used alongside a nice dose of phenibut makes for a very nice night out..one thing to make this combo about 20-30% more effective is to dose a nice higher dosage of phenibut in the morning, later on, take the stim, wait for it to kick in, then get  a hard workout in..you will feel like a different person if you try this out, i guarantee..


  btw i am now 3 ad a half days clean from phenibut, i dont notice any withdrawals tbh ..i have taken phenibut daily for many years, i stagger my doses, most days i take a small maintenance dose of maybe 1200-1500 mgs but on days when i will need the strong mood boosting and much increased social drive i will take 4-5 grams in the morning.so again im not trying to complain about not feeling wds i just think its strange as phenibut has a very nasty rep for wds..maybe it takes 4-5 days to kick in?


  btw whoever said bitcoins are hard, i disagree completely!i used to think the same way, i couldnt learn bitcoins for some reason..then 4-5 days ago  i spent maybe 30 minutes reading a '5 step' guide online on how to buy and spend bitcoins..well, it is easier than using a paypal acct imo..i wish i would have learned to use bitcoins a few years ago

Lol, when you take 5 grams, it won't be completely washed out of your system until ~3 days.

Actually it is recommended to add a stimulant with Phenibut. It creates a synergy and  cognitive enhancement with no side effects.

I don't think they are exaggerated at all, I just think different people respond differently.


I was cut off from Klonopin cold turkey after over a decade of daily use and got ZERO WDs but I don't think they are over exaggerated by the people who say they experience them, I just didn't.


Posters have reported visual and auditory hallucinations and multiple days of insomnia from Phenibut abuse.


I think you and Belfort are VERY rare in not having worse WDs.

 The horror stories are the on the extreme spectrum of wds and by no means represent common or average withdrawals... I think the horror stories are very rare cases.

I don't necessarily think you are right.


Or IF you are, I think you are probably on the other far end of the spectrum.


One way or another Phenibut is VERY addictive and you can get BADLY hooked VERY fast.


This is pretty much recognized by almost everyone around here.


I know Belfort pretty well, and for sure he is a rare example of someone who can use it as often as he can without having MUCH worse withdrawals.

 i know a good chunk of guys who take phenibut for a year or longer at 2-3 grams and above end up with very bad withdrawals..now i have no idea if this % of guys who get nasty wds are 90% or maybe 60% im not sure but i very rarely come across a report where someone jumped off phenibut after a year or so of chronic use who claimed they felt very mild withdrawals..i dont remember seeing any tbh


  oh yes i dont want to try to sound like a special guy because i dont seem to get phenibut withdrawals i just am very puzzled by it..ive taken it daily for over 4 years and jumped off cold turkey last thursday..well the only wd symptoms i might feel to a small degree is a sense of restlessness and insomnia..i dont even notice much of a mood drop and this is strange as i always experience terrible moods when i quit other drugs 


 i have at times felt irresponsible for telling people that ive used pheni daily for many years and ran into very little problem.granted i do have my own dosing system which has helped me  keep tolerance low and good effects still noticeable..

Lol. One of the "horror" stories was about a guy dosing phenibut every 2-3 hours. That is absolute insanity. Yeah, anyone using phenibut like crack will get withdrawals.  **But if you are a new user, you have nothing to worry about.  ** 


 if you are thinking of trying of phenibut , just experiment with doses and focus on figuring out your sweet spot to enjoy phenibut as much as possible and get the most out of it. Don't let those exaggerated horror stories scare you. I wish someone would have told me that when I was new. I would have started using phenibut soo much sooner! lol ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


If you have no idea how to get started just go to subReddit /r/phenibut for a list of vendors of this legal nootropic and cognitive enhancer. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

If I start at a gram or 1.5 grams, it shouldn't make me drowsy, right? From what I've read, it's only at higher doses that help with sleep. I want to try it in the morning but obviously don't want to be a zombie all day.

If you take it in the morning, you will feel energized. If you dose before bed, it will make you sleepy. Phenibut you can do whatever you want, be active or relax. It's not like a stimulant or benzo that you have to take it a certain time of the day or it'll mess you up. on Reddit it says to take 750mg per dose, and no more than 1.5g in a day. So you could split. I actually took only 750mg in the morning the other day, I felt so productive all day and slept great at night. At the 750mg dose, I didn't feel like I was on anything but my behavior was definitely different. I was smiling, talking to everyone and getting things done!  Caffeine is also your friend on Phenibut, no crash or jitters. On 1.5g, I can really feel like it and my patience is increased... Stuck in traffic for 2 hours? No problem still in a good mood lol

It's been a while since I've tried phenibut, and I never did feel much from it. Maybe my source isn't great. Or maybe I was scared of taking too much, so didn't take enough. I tried up to 1.5 grams. Any ideas?

Any of those reasons may be why. It could also be that phenibut is not for you. But I bet you haven't taken enough yet. Everyone's dose is different. 


I never got anything worthwhile out of phenibut until I tried 1.6g. For years I thought it was worthless to me because I never took enough. I finally decided to try 1.6g recently and I finally discovered what all the fuss is about.


You could try taking more: increase your dosage to something like 1.75g next time, then 2g. I bet youll discover the "magic". Just increase in increments, give yourself plenty of time (days) in between each dose.

Hi everyone, I see that's a pretty old thread, but still... Phenibut is one of Russian drugs, which is routinely prescribed to nearly everyone. Just like piracetam. Russians believe in nootropics, that's the key. I grew up there I was prescribed piracetam every fall and winter, as "brain vitamins". I don't remember if it was effective, but it did not hurt me. I guess Phenibut is a similar stuff.

No it is not. You can fuck up quite easily with that one. 


Careful Russians vouch for Rhodiola (the use of Rhodiola originated in Russia afaik). ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) The only "cardiohealthy" stimulant out there IMHO. Hell it is even legal and promoted in Norway, available in supermarkets.


Phenibut was scheduled in many places recently anyways.

So long as I don't dose every day and keep my doses no higher than 2.5 grams in a day, I haven't gotten any form of withdrawals. I've gone 4-5 days at a time without dosing and experienced none of the nasty reputed physical effects that come with GABAergic withdrawal. During my work week, I usually take it on days 1, 3, and 5, and then skip the weekend (days 6-7) and do it again next week. Never had any problems with this regimen.

Russians believe in nootropics, that's the key. I grew up there I was prescribed piracetam every fall and winter, as "brain vitamins". I don't remember if it was effective, but it did not hurt me. I guess Phenibut is a similar stuff.

I don't have a personal experience with either Phenibut or blood pressure meds. From what I know, phenibut should not drop your BP if you take it as directed. In Russia doctors usually prescribe 250 mg divided into two or three doses if needed. There it's not a controlled substance, available OTC. Some people report it's helpful for insomnia, anxiety, apathy, etc. Other say they experience negative side effects up to withdrawal symptoms if the med discontinued abruptly. I personally have little to no trust in Russian drugs that are not recognized internationally. For example, their Phenotropil is by far less safe and less effective than our eugeroics (I have a shift work sleep disorder and am interested in this class of meds).

Phenibut is such a weird drug sometimes.


Today was the second time I've taken it and then fallen asleep afterwards, and both times this has happened I have dreamt about strangers being in my room and wondering why they are there lol.


I'm no expert on dream analysis or psychotherapy, but it's funny, and I certainly interpret both times the "people" being the Phenibut and wondering why it was in my head (or room) after falling back asleep haha.

Taking 1.5 grams EVERY day is a bad idea.


Taking it in a **single** day is no big deal AT ALL.


The tub I have from a known vendor says not to exceed 4,000mgs in a  week, but I will take 8,000mgs in a week MAX.


I quite often will take 4,000mgs over the course of a day, spread out over about 14 hours.


Today I took 1,800mgs and I’m not even feeling it.


It’s NOT dangerous to take 1,500mgs, or even 4,000mgs for most people in a single day.


What’s TRULY crazy is the people on here either taking upwards of 8,000mgs in a SINGLE DAY OR taking like thousands of milligrams EVERY day cause you will be addicted in no time flat and the withdrawal can be BAD.


There is SO much inconsistency on Phenibut.


I will see people saying the shit you are saying, that 1,500mgs is a lot to take in a day…and I will barely feel that amount lol.


Then you have people thinking they can take 6,000 mgs every day for weeks and finding out the hard way what will happen…people can get psychosis from that…

I’ve driven on lower doses, like 2 grams or less, though some people think those are high doses.


I wouldn’t suggest driving on higher doses than that though, and really, it can potentially be sedating at any dose and is a CNS depressant to some extent, so I’d be careful and can’t say I’d recommend it, but also can’t 100% rule out I would never possibly do it again lol.

Disclaimer: I am not advocating that people take this substance consistently, or beyond what they feel comfortable with; I'm only sharing my personal experience.


I (usually) take Phenibut 2-3 times a week, and so long as I don't take it every day, I get absolutely no withdrawal symptoms. None. I've tested this out by going five days, a week, or even longer without it, and didn't even feel mild depressive symptoms. My dosage is 1.5 - 2.5 grams, and I did get up to that level with a mild tolerance. 


I do wholeheartedly agree that people should be careful with this substance and start low and leave days (several days preferably) between doses. If mismanaged, Phenibut can be a dangerous substance to use; however, this applies to (most) other psychoactive substances as well. I've found a regimen with Phenibut that has enriched my life and lifestyle, and I think with a little foresight and discipline, others can do the same.


(Additional disclaimer: I'm only sharing my personal experience, and it's entirely possible that other people may not be able to adopt a similar dosing regimen without experiencing discomfort, or possibly even withdrawal symptoms. What works for one may not work for others, though anecdotally speaking, I've communicated with many others who have reported similar results as mine.)

If you think, Rhodiola is not effective, try to sleep on a high enough dose (not popping a ridiculous amount of bark extract capsules of course).


It is a stimulating adaptogen. Effects are mostly physiologically, that means it it stabilizes the cardio-vascular-system (very abstract description I know, please research further, when you are interested). The most astonishing property of this drug is, that it is actually causing a stabilization of the heartbeat (HR and BP) instead of increasing it like usual stimulants do. That for me makes this drug unique and highly valuable. The risk is very low.

I've been over sleeping too because of phenibut.


I find myself sleeping well over 12 hours and still find it difficult to initially wake up. Sometimes I have a headache or other odd feelings from oversleeping.


So far it's really only been the one downside to phenibut for me (besides the potential for addiction). There is an easy cure for me: I just have to make sure I force myself to get up after 6-9hrs of sleep. I find it difficult to wake up but once I'm actually up and awake the grogginess quickly fades.

That’s what I always do if I’m taking larger doses:  I will start the day off lower like 1 dose of 1,500mgs  (for me that is low even if some others may find that a high dose), then after that kicks in maybe take another 500mgs so that it’s 2,000, then another 4 or 500, etc.


How much I want to take depends on the day but I never exceed 4,000mgs in 24 hours because the tub says not to exceed 4,000 mgs in a week (and I usually won't be sometimes I will dose twice in a week, but even then I won't exceed 8,000mgs in a week) and so that put that number in my head and after hearing about how quickly Phenibut tolerance can rise and how addictive it is I decided I'd never exceed that in a day.


The benefit I see is that I can take more of it this way, because if I take too much all in one shot I will just get really really tired.


But for some reason, spacing out the doses and drinking coffee (I always drink a shitload of coffee anyway) will allow me to eventually end the day with having taken a larger combined dose but feeling good off of it when otherwise I would be too sedated.

I almost always stagger my doses. Usually I'll take 1.5 - 2 grams and then, two hours later, take 500 mg. Helps to prolong the peak, and also the other reasons that Mycophile said.

No offense, but stop acting like a know it all asshole.


You are NOT an expert on Phenibut and do not probably know anymore about it than me or many others on here.


Phenibut is an unusual substance that people react to differently and just because 1 gram is good for you doesn't mean it is for everyone.


I'm not a "drug addicted nob" LOL, never once had withdrawals from it and VERY much doubt I ever will, and if you read a lot of people's accounts you will see MANY of them saying that they take more than 1 gram a day or 1 gram a week.


If I do happen to take 4 grams it will be spaced out over the course of 16 hours or so, but usually that's more than I like to take.


I would say that depending on the day between 1,800mgs----3,200mgs is best, with an average dose that I can expect to feel just right off of probably about 2,200--2,400mgs if I am taking it with Kratom.


I can't stand it when people act like their experience goes for everyone else and they must know more than anyone else.


If I take one gram I won't really feel much at all.


I've never gotten addicted or had any withdrawal, and never take it more than twice a week.


Stop pretending you are the king of Phenibut knowledge.


You don't know more about it than anyone else here.

I experienced a mild WD, along with mild codeine WD at once. 


I took phenibut at dosages 2-3g 21 of 30 days, and i believe it took about 4-5 days to feel back to normal. The codeine wd probably compounded the problems. The major issue was chills while trying to sleep. Its hot and dry here so id shiver when id have the fan on, and feel fuckin hot when the fan was off.


TBH, i was expecting a far worse WD reading from sources like reddit, here and drugs forum. Overblown, but still, i think if i kept going for a few months, shit would have been way worse. 


I absolutely love phenibut. A great asset to have. I found it to exhibit performance enhancing aspects at the gym. I have been in the best shape performance wise and aesthetically. I could quite literally have the confidence of hugh hefner, able to just break the ice with anyone i bumped into. I felt alive and dangerously ready for anything the elements, life or anything else for that matter could throw at me. 


Next order i will be respecting this chemical, taking maybe 2 doses per week. Just too good to fuck up.

Well I finally got up the courage to try Phenibut last night and wow, I had to kick myself hard for not trying it sooner. I only took about 250 mg and I definitely want to try a higher dose next time, but I was impressed. I have such horrible anxiety and the phenibut really helped me feel calmer. Not only that, but it made music sound better and gave me this sense of flow, like the day was just flowing by almost like the feeling you get when you're rolling where time just rolls by. I was expecting a major hangover today but instead I don't feel bad. 


DOes anyone know how long after taking phenibut it would be safe to take GHB? My plan is to alternatve phenibut and GHB taking with sober time in between to see if I taking these substances over a period of time could reduce my baseline anxiety and make me feel less anxious even when sober. 


THe sad thing is if only I had known about (phenibut) or been able to get (GHB) these substances earlier in my life, I would not have gone through life totally crippled by anxiety and gotten addicted to alcohol and benzos which wrecked my life. Im starting to realize the drugs I abused when I was young were in many ways, the worst type of drugs for a personality like mine. Abusing weed worsened my anxiety tenfold and gave me  panic attacks, alcohol gave me horrible rebound anxiety and depression and benzos wrecked my brain.

^the half life seems to be around 5-6 hours and 5-7 half lifes should be enough to get it completely out of your system, but I once read that the effects on GABA can linger, so imo wait 2-3 days


But don't you think that GHB and phenibut will be equally worse for you, given that you've been addicted to alcohol and benzos and that you suffer from anxiety ?

No because they allow me to remain more conscious while intoxicated. Kava taught me that by meditating on the causes of my anxiety while intoxicated I could actually let go of some of my anxiety and feel less anxious sober. I took GHB a week ago, and even after it wore off I had less body tension than before taking it because experiencing a state of such deep physical relaxation helped make me more aware of the places where I was unconsciously tensing up in my body. Therefore my hope is that with responsible use over time I can reduce my anxiety levels permanently. Supposedly this is what the inventor of GHB did. He said that after many years of drinking GHB he basically had no more anxiety and lived a very calm, relaxed life.


Alcohol and benzos make you too unconscious to gain much from and they are more toxic to the body.

Your words won't end up being any kind of a fatal warning.


I've dabbled in doses between 3,000-8,000mgs a week, usually closer to 4,000mgs a week for 2 years now, with no issue.


Those are NOT very high doses, and you don't have even the slightest bit of expertise on the matter.


Nothing bad will happen from taking less than 8,000mgs, and sometimes no more than 4,000mgs, in a 7 day period.

You must have lived in Russia and really known some important doctors.


Stop telling people what to do.


You know no more than anyone else here and have no knowledge of importance to impart on this or anything else.


Taking 4,000—6,000mgs spread out over 2 days and never more than 2 days a week is not dangerous, especially seeing as the tubs themselves say it's ok to take 4,000mgs a week.


The manufacturers know more about the substance than you.

Gotcha, as long as you can stick to using it like once a week or even less it shouldn't be that bad, but both phenibut and GHB can cause rebound anxiety etc.

I find it difficult to wake up the next day after taking phenibut. Once Im actually I up, I notice an increase in energy and awareness over my usual baseline. I believe that this excess energy could easily become rebound symptoms if I ever started overusing the stuff. The feeling is similar to when I wake up without a hangover after a night of drinking.

The mods want us to ignore eachother, but I’m not trying to be rude, I feel you are being rude to me.


Dude, I don’t believe that the vendor I am speaking of has a conspiracy against it’s users haha, and if 4,000mgs a day was dangerous (which is what they suggest), I'd have gotten addicted to it a year ago.


That’s crazy talk.


If they wanted us addicted they'd suggest not exceeding 16,000mgs a week so we'd think it was fine to take over 1,000mgs every day and be addicted in no time.


I’ve used Phenibut on and off for over a year now, and I don’t have a casual attitude about it, I just know how my body responds to it, and believe that it’s not as dangerous as you think or as addictive.


If you read other people’s accounts, you’ll see I’m basically in the middle between you being EXTREMELY conservative on one end thinking no one should use more than a gram a week, and other on the far end thinking it’s ok to take every day or every other day and they are crazy and developing an addiction.


I use Phenibut quite moderately in my opinion and write down my dosages and every day I take it, which is usually only once a week, sometimes twice a week.


I’ve gone from using up to 8,000mgs spread out over 2 days in a week and abstaining 5  (I'm of the opinion it shouldn't ever be used more than two days a week), to NO USE AT ALL for THREE MONTHS…proving that’s not an amount to get me addicted.


I know Phenibut well and how my body reacts to it and I am well aware of what is too much.


I am very confident that the amounts I’m currently using will not get me in trouble because they haven’t in the past and** I never increase my weekly intake above what I currently use which is the key.**


**If I was upping the doses, there would be an issue, but I’m not.


I use the same amount I always have which has never been an issue.**


I am merely pointing out that the dosages you think are dangerous are not dangerous for everyone.


You are just using a VERY small amount at only 1,000mgs per week…which is fine..but be aware that your usage is SUPER minimal.


Thanks for your concern, but I’m fine.

It's been a LONG time since I've posted on this thread. I tried phenibut for the first time a few months ago and felt absolutely nothing. This week I finally ordered more thinking i would give it one more try. I finally see what all the fuss is about! The first time I tried it months ago, I was scared of dosing too much so took less than 1 gram. This time I decided to try 1.5 g and it was the perfect dose. It took a couple hours to kick in but then I felt a total sense of well being, slightly stimulated and focused, but relaxed too. I respect how quickly tolerance can set in and have read how horrible WD can be so am only dosing twice per week at the 1.5 g. But as an update...I do LOVE my phenibut days!!! &#55357;&#56833;

Well I just got Fluro-Phenibut a few days ago but because I've got some stuff to do I think I probably won't end up taking it for about 2 weeks, like maybe the weekend after this coming one.


But it'll be interesting to see how it compares cause I've tried both Phenibut HCL and Phenibut FFA many times.


There don't seem to be many reports on here of people using it, but then again I haven't looked.


I'm going to do as much research as possible cause it's supposed to be like 5--10 times more potent so I'm slightly "concerned" with getting the dosage right, or not really concerned, but just significantly aware that I need to get the dosage right or I might feel like shit.


But there should be enough info out there that through careful titration I'll figure it out, and one thing that will make it much easier is that it is supposed to kick in in like 20-30 mins unlike regular Phenibut (either HCL or FFA) which both take about 2 hours for me, so I'll be able to know quickly whether or not I took a good dosage.


Some people say they felt FFA kicked in faster but I didn't.


And I'm going to assume (knock on wood) that it won't be much more dangerous to combine with my Klonopin than regular Phenibut has been, cause i've never had an issue there, but I will probably skip my daily dose of Klonopin when I take it.


Klonopin doesn't usually cause serious respiratory depression in my experience.


It's always been annoying waiting hours to know if you got your dosage right so it'll be nice not to have to wait so long.

So I got my first 50g satchel of Phenibut yesterday. Took 1,000mg around 2pm. By 9pm I was feeling slightly sedated, with a barely noticeable lift in mood. Kinda disappointing, I was really hoping for more. Today I took 1,500mg at 10am, so hopefully this increase will get me to the effects that I hear everyone talking about. I usually need a little more of everything to feel the effects that most people get at a lower dose, but is 1,500mg a *large* dose? Or is this kind of average?

I've found that even having a moderate alcohol habit makes phenibut next to useless. None of the euphoric effects anymore only sedation.

So I took, in staggered doses, a total of 2,600mg of Phenibut yesterday. After 7 hours or so I was definitely feeling uplifted, but still *nothing* like the effects that I hear people talk about. I'm starting to wonder if, as @Kleinerkiffer stated, I got a bad and/or cut batch. I'm taking a couple days off of it now, but will try again next week with 2 1,500mg doses spaced over 4 hours and see what happens.


Is there anything else that I could stack with Phenibut to up its efficacy? I have heard mixed reports about using things like 5-HTP and L-Theanine. Anyone have any advice?

It's possible. Some people are saying that lately it is becoming more common to get shitty phenibut from vendors. Something to do with it becoming more and more difficult to obtain. I dunno... Just hearsay.


It's also possible you just react differently to phenibut. Not everyone gets the positive effects you've been reading about.

Well that would be a major damn bummer.


Ordered some from a new vendor, comes highly reviewed by some people very experienced with Phenibut. If this product turns out the same way, then I guess its just me :-/

Been using phenibut for the past week. Tried 1 gram on the morning I got it, it was pretty good. I was bumping my head to music by lunch time, laughing hysterically at the way my kitten seems to roll his R's when he says "mrow" (very Spanish, very suave) and generally had this warm glow about me into the evening. 


I've had the same dose each morning for one week and the effects seem more subtle now but still noticable. It seems to have quite a wakeful, wide-eyed kind of feel to it. I'm not sure if I am getting a paradoxical effect or if that is just the nature of this stuff.


I take benzos daily (usually 5-10 milligrams diazepam or something similar), I've missed a few days through the week though and didn't even notice. Will now take a break from the phenibut for a while, probably save it for nights out as I don't really enjoy drinking much any more. Seems like an okay substitute.

I think that's to be expected, especially after long-term, regular use. Personally, my anxiety was so hellish when quitting phenibut that would have been the least of my worries.


Phenibut, for me, induced severe depression as time went on, so I had no pleasure in doing anything even before quitting it. Next to no anxiety, but finding enjoyment in my daily life was quite literally impossible.

Are you currently addicted to phenibut? Meaning: do you need to take it every day in order to avoid physical withdrawal symptoms or do you just take it occasionally?


How much phenibut would you take tonight and how many hours will pass between when you'll dose and when you will be given the anaesthetic?

Endoscopy is usually without anaesthesia or with something like midazolam so there might be a interaction, i.e. increased CNS depression

If you don't have to take it imo just don't and if you're addicted and have to take some to prevent withdrawal take the least amount possible

Hi everyone, I was hoping someone could help me, possibly give a similar experience or answer to my question.  I just ordered 25 grams of Phenibut from a reputable source after much research... I have a lot of experiences with other GABAergics:  I am prescribed a pretty heavy dose of Gabapentin (Neurontin): 800 mg tablets 3x a day, as well as 10 mg Valium 2x a day. Also, having narcolepsy, I was prescribed (for maybe a year) (Na)GHB up to 8 grams a night (split in two 4 gram doses). Although I ONLY take the Gabapentin and Valium PRN, i end up having to take them every other day or so, to prevent any withdrawal symptoms. So that's just a little background on my GABAergic uses, and possibly tolerance. Back to the Phenibut, I received my 25 gram container in the mail today. I immediately took 1 gram on a completely empty stomach, carefully measured out with a digital scale (that weighs down to the tenth of a gram).  From all the experience reports I read, I knew not to expect any noticeable effects for up to 4 hours or so. I took it about noon, and when 6:00 pm rolled around, I noticed there was NOTHING to be felt.... Not even a little bit. So I went and weighed out another 1.5 grams and took it (still on empty stomach-I refrained from eating until I was going to feel something, which was easily done since I take Adderall daily), and waited for any results... After about 2 hours I began to feel something that I haven't felt in a long time... Unfortunately it wasn't anything positive, but I got horrible cramps all throughout my legs.  It was really bad cramping, and a very familiar feeling (although I hadn't felt it in some time).  I recognized this cramping in my legs as the SAME EXACT horrible leg cramps I got from the GHB when I would fight the GHB-induced sleep, in order to ENJOY the ABSOLUTE MAGNIFICENT effects I would feel from taking it. I acknowledged that Phenibut is "supposedly" more similar to GHB being that both are mainly GABA-B agonist.  So, although in pain, I didn't freak out or anything, instead I knew for sure, at least, that I hadn't received bunk supply. Well, now it is 9:30 pm, and despite the cramps in my legs not subsiding, I STILL feel no more relaxed or any kind of head-change to speak of at all...  The only conclusion I can come up with is that my tolerance to Benzodiazepines, and Gabapentin, is preventing me from having any kind of feeling from the Phenibut.  I have been taking Gabapentin and Benzo's (one kind or another) for many years, and cannot get really any recreational effects off even Xanax. What is confusing me though, is that when I would take the GHB (and stay up) I would feel like i was on MDMA, but even MUCH better! And I heard Phenibut was close to, or at least similar to GHB (being that people would substitute it, selling on the street under "GHB" and getting away with it). Can anyone explain why I not only have felt no effects from Phenibut, but don't even seem to get a therapeutic effect either?  I do see that people have taken much higher doses (for recreational purposes), but if I have leg cramps like this with only taking 2.5 grams throughout the day, I don't see how I could go much higher in dosage. Also I have seen many reviews saying that "the user" never used more than 2 grams at once EVER, yet still thoroughly enjoyed their experience. With being my first time taking Phenibut, should I not have felt SOMETHING (other than the severe leg cramps)? Been researching and couldn't even find anyone having the leg cramps I experienced (which I only experienced from LARGE doses of pharmaceutical grade GHB). I hope someone has had a similar experience or explanation? Please get back to me!

Hi everyone, I was hoping someone could help me, possibly give a similar experience or answer to my question. I just ordered 25 grams of Phenibut from a reputable source after much research... I have a lot of experiences with other GABAergics: I am prescribed a pretty heavy dose of Gabapentin (Neurontin): 800 mg tablets 3x a day, as well as 10 mg Valium 2x a day. Also, having narcolepsy, I was prescribed (for maybe a year) (Na)GHB up to 8 grams a night (split in two 4 gram doses). Although I ONLY take the Gabapentin and Valium PRN, i end up having to take them every other day or so, to prevent any withdrawal symptoms. So that's just a little background on my GABAergic uses, and possibly tolerance. 


Back to the Phenibut, I received my 25 gram container in the mail today. I immediately took 1 gram on a completely empty stomach, carefully measured out with a digital scale (that weighs down to the tenth of a gram). From all the experience reports I read, I knew not to expect any noticeable effects for up to 4 hours or so. I took it about noon, and when 6:00 pm rolled around, I noticed there was NOTHING to be felt.... Not even a little bit. So I went and weighed out another 1.5 grams and took it (still on empty stomach-I refrained from eating until I was going to feel something, which was easily done since I take Adderall daily), and waited for any results... 

After about 2 hours I began to feel something that I haven't felt in a long time... Unfortunately it wasn't anything positive, but I got horrible cramps all throughout my legs. It was really bad cramping, and a very familiar feeling (although I hadn't felt it in some time). I recognized this cramping in my legs as the SAME EXACT horrible leg cramps I got from the GHB when I would fight the GHB-induced sleep, in order to ENJOY the ABSOLUTE MAGNIFICENT effects I would feel from taking it. 

I acknowledged that Phenibut is "supposedly" more similar to GHB being that both are mainly GABA-B agonist. So, although in pain, I didn't freak out or anything, instead I knew for sure, at least, that I hadn't received bunk supply. Well, now it is 9:30 pm, and despite the cramps in my legs not subsiding, I STILL feel no more relaxed or any kind of head-change to speak of at all... 


The only conclusion I can come up with is that my tolerance to Benzodiazepines, and Gabapentin, is preventing me from having any kind of feeling from the Phenibut. I have been taking Gabapentin and Benzo's (one kind or another) for many years, and cannot get really any recreational effects off even Xanax. What is confusing me though, is that when I would take the GHB (and stay up) I would feel like i was on MDMA, but even MUCH better! And I heard Phenibut was close to, or at least similar to GHB (being that people would substitute it, selling on the street under "GHB" and getting away with it). 

Can anyone explain why I not only have felt no effects from Phenibut, but don't even seem to get a therapeutic effect either? I do see that people have taken much higher doses (for recreational purposes), but if I have leg cramps like this with only taking 2.5 grams throughout the day, I don't see how I could go much higher in dosage. Also I have seen many reviews saying that "the user" never used more than 2 grams at once EVER, yet still thoroughly enjoyed their experience. With being my first time taking Phenibut, should I not have felt SOMETHING (other than the severe leg cramps)? Been researching and couldn't even find anyone having the leg cramps I experienced (which I only experienced from LARGE doses of pharmaceutical grade GHB). I hope someone has had a similar experience or explanation? Please get back to me!

If you're feeling better physically, then it's only going to get better. That being said, when I kicked phenibut, my anxiety level was extremely high for several weeks, as well as my inability to sleep normally. Benzos, gabapentin and clonidine are all somewhat helpful for phenibut withdrawal, if you can acquire any of them.


Good luck.

This post is meant for people who have used phenibut daily for about a month and are worried about withdrawals.


I’ll introduce myself. I’m Vazkor from the Netherlands. I’m 45 years old and weigh about 75 kilos. I’m healthy.


I did use other drugs in the past but since the beginning of 2016 I only used weed, benzos, GHB and Phenibut. My last use of GHB is about 9 months ago. I have a prescription for benzos and use about 100mg oxazepam a month. I have smoked weed for the last 30 years. The last years this went from daily to weekly. I don’t drink a lot of alcohol: a few beers per week.


I have been physically addicted to GHB and Phenibut a few times in the past. I was never physically depended for more than a few weeks. All of those times I quit cold turkey, which wasn’t fun.


My last ‘experiment’ was taking phenibut daily for 45 days, using 60 grams total.


Two weeks ago I tapered from random doses, multiple times a day, to 1.5 grams once a day. The last two weeks I used 1.5 grams for 6 days, then 1 gram for 4 days, then 0.5 grams for 2 days, then 0.25 grams for 2 days, then 0.125 grams for 2 days, then stopped using.


This scheme was rather painless. Slight headaches from time to time and a feeling a bit wired. No anxiety, depression or loss of libido, what did happen when I went cold turkey.


Everyone is different, but for me at least it worked like this. Maybe for you as well…


Hope this helps someone.


Vazkor

Have been taking phenibut since the start of March. It is definitely useful stuff, though my desire to take it has become less and less because as I've become accustomed to the effects, they have become less noticeable, not that this is necessarily a bad thing. I will say that phenibut for me, has basically served as buprenorphine to my benzo use. I've gone a month taking phenibut, without taking any benzos and experienced only subtle acute withdrawal effects and no noticeable post-withdrawal effects.


Right now, I'm down to just 800mgs phenibut per day and will keep stepping down over the next week or so. I will probably re-visit phenibut in the future. Seems like it would be good for a festival or concert, but I haven't had the chance to try it at such an event in the past couple months.

I've had some odd aftereffects 1-2 days after using phenibut lately. My dosing regimen is quite strict, I don't dose more that once every 2-3 weeks, and never exceeded 1gr. I've been doing this for about 5 months, give or take. The last two experiences were fine, yet, about 48 hours after dosing, I started to feel terribly depressed, like I've never felt before; realizing the extreme pointlessness of being, of acting, of everything. It was really bleak. All I wanted to do was go to bed and wait until it's over.


This 'depressive episode' lasted for about 12-15 hours, I think. The day after I felt normal and a bit euphoric for being relieved from this horrible state of mind. 


About 2 weeks later, I decided to give it another go, at 500 mg instead of the usual 1000. Effects were, as expected as I've tried this dosage before, minimal yet present. 48 hours later I, again, felt a bit down, but much more manageable than previous time. 


Anyone can relate to this?

Perhaps this third try will work.


I tske phenibit and Wellbutrin for anxiety and depression. And I do get a little reckless with the phenibut from time to time,  Leaving me without for a few days. That's when I use the  Gabapentin that my doctor gives me that I'm supposed to take instead of the  Phenibut. :-/


I will say from an HR standpoint I know this is not recommended however even when tolerance develops to the phenibut I still get anxiety and depression relief. Much better than I get from Gabapentin.


But even when I use the Gabapentin for withdrawals it gets rid of most of them but not that dreaded phenibut withdrawal insomnia. Let my doctor switch me from Seroquel to olanzipine for sleep purposes, and I'll be damned if I don't sleep like a baby for 8 hours every night with that and they Gabapentin. I posted this in the hopes that it might help somebody going to that nasty insomnia and using Lyrica or Neurontin to try and get rid of the withdrawal symptoms but still not being able to sleep.

This was the main reason I had to stop phenibut -- it made me horribly, HORRIBLY depressed. I've dealt with sporadic depression basically my whole life, but phenibut took it to a whole other level. It got so bad I put myself in the hospital, something I could never have imagined doing. 


Now, I typically took doses in excess of what you're taking, but not always. Towards the end of my phenibut habit the "rebound" depression came with every dose, varying in intensity depending on how high my dose was. This was the first time I'd ever been truly suicidal in my life. 


The crazy part is, I didn't even fully realize it was the phenibut causing this until a few months before I stopped. All I can say is be very careful, because it's unlikely to get any better, and will almost certainly get worse.

I had a minor Valium habit from August 2015 until January 2017.  Did a super slow taper from August 2016 until the end.   I had tried Phenibut before that on a number of occasions. It never really struck me as that great.  BUT


I've had some withdrawal issues for the past several months. I ended up getting some Phenibut again to see if it helps. 


I would say that it does.   I think the most important difference between Phenibut and benzos is that it doesn't impair your judgment.  The biggest regret I have from my Valium days is the myriad stupid things I did. This has not happened with Phenibut.  At the same time, I don't find Phenibut to be "fun".  I'm surprised people abuse it, or even get addicted to it.   


All of that said, as I am still dealing with the aftermath of my Valium experiment, my recommendation to everyone is to skip these drugs if you can.  They are more trouble than they are worth.

Thanks for your response. 'Good' to know it isn't just me. GHB is way too impairing for me, I can take phenibut and just proceed through my day as normal, except everything is nice, no nervousness.

Thanks for your reply. This sounds really bad, man, hope you're doing better now. I think it can really increase underlying depressions. These side-effects happened too me when I was in a little bit of a decisive period, and was under quite some stress. The phenibut removed the stress but came back with a vengeance. Glad I discovered early. I will give it another spin in a month or 2, or when I feel a lot better in general, too see if these rebounds are the reaction to depression or just part of the drug itself (I doubt that, seeing that lots of other people don't really experience this).

I think it's all about the thrill you're chasing. I love phenibut for the euphoric "life is good" feeling it gives, but hate it for it's quick tolerance/dependence potential.

Exactly! I use Gabapentin a lot to help my nerves feel balanced after going through Ritalin and benzos. I was thinking about starting Phenibut again instead of using Gabapentin, but shit, that dependency and withdrawal is really scary. Think I'll leave it alone. Haven't had it in a few years...


You're usually better off without Phenibut in the long-run, unless you can keep it to the lowest dose possible.

So, people have said they have taken SSRI's with no ill effect with Phenibut, 


But what about Tricyclic anti-depressants, specifically Amitriptyline? Any risk there?

Totally agree. Gabapentin is nearly more enjoyable to me in terms of relaxation/loving life. I've seen online vendors but they're so freaking expensive everywhere I've seen.

Did anyone else suffer from protracted phenibut withdrawal? 5 months 13 days ago I decided to quit a  heavy phenibut addiction cold turkey. During the time I was addicted to phenibut I took 32 grams a day, 4 times a week for about 8-9 months. After quitting phenibut cold turkey over 5 months ago I suffered the acute withdrawal which was 6 days of hell but on the 7th day I woke up and all my emotions were gone, its like a switch for all emotions went off. Now I suffer from anhedonia/emotional numbness and it hasn't went away for over 5 months now, did/does anyone else suffer from this?

I've only ever had the hcl, but as far as the taste, yes... it's horrible. I always just ordered capsules because they're still dirt cheap. The one time they were out of capsules and I had to order powder, I just parachuted it.

Every time I start phenibut I've found the best way imo is to take 3,500mg a day, in the morning, once a day.  EVERYDAY. 


The SAME EXACT DOSE, never upping the amount, everyday. After about 1 month when the positives start to wear down, I take slightly less everyday until I stop, or I'll do a different drug for a few days if I cold turkey it.


Then I'll quit for a week or two or a few months, then start it up again.  I did it twice a day, everyday, for a year. I weened down for about a month I think when I stopped but it was still kinda bad, but not that bad. Weening down is the important thing with this one.

I don't mind the phenibut taste, it's not really bitter to me just quite sour which mostly tastes curious but interesting... on more rare occasions I can taste how people say it tastes like ass.


The FAA would taste much more like ass which is not something I'd really like sublingually - doesn't seem appealing to me or worth it. If you don't take high dosage then I don't know that there is really - like a toxicological - advantage to being able to reduce your intake with sublingual FAA over oral HCl and if you do take high dosage I probably still wouldn't want it sublingually despite reduced intake, although I am not exactly sure on whether it would be quicker to harm your GI tract with the HCl or to harm your mucous membrane with the FAA if you take considerable amounts.


Is R-phenibut being sold? It's much more of a VDCC "blocker" which is imo mainly what you *should* be looking for. I don't think aiming for the GABA b agonism is really something people should be doing outside of therapeutic baclofen, nor GABA b in concert with VDCC blocking.


In the past phenibut made my day easier to handle and just better, more relaxed and high-spirited. Now phenibut doesn't seem to do me many favors and gives me soreness / pain sensitivity, but pregabalin prescription does fulfill that same effect of smoothening out my day and how I can function (pregabalin is rather a pure VDCC "blocker", no GABA agonism)...


Phenibut absolutely requires cycling for responsible use and you absolutely don't want to up your dosage to fight tolerance (just like this is extremely ill-advised with GHB), but take a break. Pregabalin is also a bit ugly to come off of but I consciously decided to later pay that price for the therapeutic value, something I definitely would never do again with benzo's for all the money in the world.

Dissolved in a little water, I find the taste of the HCl very sour but I don't mind it. If I eat the powder though, it is bitter and unpleasant.


Phenibut has been very useful to me as a substitute for benzos and zopiclone, which I have been taking on and off for 15 years and daily for the past few years (surprisingly, my daily doses have remained quite modest ~5-10mg diazepam, ~7.5mg-15 zopiclone for instance). Despite the relatively light doses, it had been quite difficult to take a break again once I started using daily. With phenibut, I've been able to take some time out from the benzos again. My daily doses of phenibut were generally one to two grams, sometimes a little less, though now I am only using around half a gram every second day. 


Times where I have re-dosed several times for a few days straight, using maybe five grams a day (possibly more), my eyes have become quite sore and a nauseating feeling of mild vertigo has lasted for around 24 hours. This has happened at least twice and is quite unpleasant. So, for me, phenibut is self-limiting in terms of how high I can push the dose and I'm actually preferring the mild doses I am using now. All in all, useful stuff.

I added 1 gram of phenibut with gabapentin yesterday and today. It feels like the phenibut turned something on in my brain that was missing. I usually hate everything including the sun, but now I don't mind anything. The sun is bright and it doesn't bother me. I'm not cowering or hiding like the singer in the "Who Can It Be Now?" video. I don't feel afraid to be seen. Also, I am incredibly horny.


I haven't had phenibut in years, but now I see how it gives a "boost". I feel alive again. Gonna get more next month. It only takes a little bit. Not a lot.

Does Phenibut have convulsant effects? GABAB receptor agonists are not anticonvulsants. I tried to use Phenibut to ease benzo WD a few years ago, but Phenibut actually triggered almost seizures, and was of no use for helping GABAA WD. It made the WD much worse.

^That's no good. I have some arriving today for etizolam/suboxone w/d. I think I'm going to give it a try as I am through the bulk of my w/d. Just terrible rebound insomnia and brain zaps anytime I come close to sleeping. That is strange though as I was just passing time not being able to sleep this morning reading the phenibut thread on the shroomery and someone said that phenibut is still prescribed outside Russia in doses up to 5 grams a day for alcoholism which would be gabaB, (or A, been up forever and my memory is failing) correct?

For benzo withdrawal I would recommend Amitriptyline as it's an old-skool anti-depressant which is remarkably good for benzo withdrawal. Seriously, I went from 2 hours sleep a night and getting suicidal depressed and psychotic to the point I was almost admitted into a mental hospital, to now where I can easily sleep 14 hours if I want too. lol It's been a life changing drug for me. Down to 6mg from 50mg diazepam.

F'Loki (or anyone who cares to reply): when you take higher doses (2.5g+) do you take it all at once or stagger it out? Were you able to take and enjoy a high dose like that right from the beginning or did you take it a few times and build a tolerance before going that high?


Do you get a lot of that nasty dizzy nauseous feeling from doses between 2-3.5g? I haven't gone higher than 1.8g yet. At 1.8g I can feel the slightest edge of it's recreational side but I can also feel a slight dizziness too so I've been reluctant to go higher. After reading the positive effects you described I am more inclined to try a higher dose but still worried about it getting nasty.

Phenibut will make you feel like shit for a day if you overdo it. I can't remember exactly how I used to take larger doses since I did larger doses years ago. Google that particular question to find more answers and read up on other people's experiences.


I remember very well that withdrawals were scary as fuck and made me hallucinate so make sure you don't run out if you do larger doses regularly. (Which isn't recommended)


Phenibut might help me get my life back on track so I'm going to take it this month for anxiety. It will stop me from wanting anything to do with etizolam. I do not want that shit. Blackouts happen too easily with etiz. So I'm happy to rediscover phenibut right now.

Well, I usually take x4 700mg gel caps at first, and always try to have it with my evening dinner (so like 6pm or 7pm). So that is 2.8 grams on a full stomach. 

I take it on a full stomach because I find it helps a little with the weird G.I disturbances. I also take Omeprezole (Prilosec) for acid reflux so will usually take x2 20mg when taking phenibut, 1 with my meal, and one maybe 5 hours later. I also take diphenyhydramine. This may be the reason I don't feel too nauseous with higher doses. But I think taking it on a full stomach helps with that too. 


I have found that whether taking it on a full stomach or empty stomach doesn't make a difference to when I come up on it: It's always between 90 minutes and upto 4 hours. I dont really understand the reason behind this. I could take some on an empty stomach and it'll take 3 hours to kick in, but then another time 1.5 hour to kick in, I could take with a full stomach and it'll be exactly the same. 


Anyway, to answer your question, yes I take 2.8 grams in one go. I will then re-dose another 700mg when I am a few hours into it. 


As for tolerance, I first tried phenibut for insomnia a few years ago and it was the pure powder. I think I took maybe 2 grams. It knocked me out completely and well into the next day, I was on holiday and was walking like I was on ketamine or booze without the alcohol side effects (Like GHB if you've ever tried that). lol yeah I was a bit fucked up at the time and I think I was also on the RC thieno-benzo clonazolam, so that undoubtedly had an effect too. 


I have found that doses around that 2 gram range are perfect for insomnia and helping with benzo withdrawals. Anything higher and I have found it becomes recreational. I once took it 5 nights in a row when I was going through a period of extreme anxiety, depression and fentanyl/heroin PAWS. I mixed it with a little bit of zopiclone and found that tolerance was surprisingly not that bad. I'd take 2.8 grams the first night, second night was also fine on that dose, but then yeah there was some tolerance, I upped it to 3.5, 4.2 then 5 grams before stopping and just going back to my diazepam taper. I did not notice any withdrawal symptoms to be honest and I left it a good week before dosing again and found my tolerance was back down to baseline. 


Your last question about dizziness/nausea: I will have nausea on anything above 2.5 grams. To be honest 3.5 grams is a little overkill for me at the moment - but that might be because I am coming to the end of a diazepam withdrawal and on quite a high dose of Amitripyline. But yeah nausea is quite bad from 3.5 grams when initially it wasn't too bad. It might well be because I am on Amitripyline and it's having an additional effect. I never once felt like I was going to puke though: It is always manageable and the next day I will just feel like i've had a few beers - I find once I take a shit and get some food and liquids in me I start feeling better lol The psychological comedown is quite nice though and I am often left with an afterglow. 


Yeah at 1.8 grams you would probably be feeling the beginnings of 'recreational' dosing. I would just build it up slowly and maybe dose at 2.5 grams next. After this, the dose/response curve is more sensitive, so it's best to wait a couple of hours between re-dosing, and also if you overshoot the more nauseous you will be for basically no gain in positive effects. That last point I cannot stress enough.


Don't worry about any neurotoxic effects or overdosing: The LD50 is something like 100 grams which no one is going to be able to stomach lol 


I don't get dizziness at all until I hit the 4-5 gram mark, which I wouldn't go into these days. 


I'd go for 2.5 grams and if you are worried about nausea get some diphenyhydramine, it'll kill most the nausea. Ant-acids help too. I would not dare mix it with alcohol as I could see that going south very fast, but have known some crazy people who have done so and they said it boosts alcohols effects by three or four times. 


But yeah, i'd probably up it to 2,5 grams, maybe build up to 3 grams, then 3.5 grams. I honestly feel like I am coming up off of MDA or LSD when I use it recreationally. You will have to experiment a bit, but know when you get there.

I had a horrrrrrrible experience with the phenibut hangover/OD. Was bedridden vomiting and nauseous as well with the room spinning like crazy with an intense headache all day long. Nothing helped. I'd like to take phenibut again sometime, but never, ever so irresponsibly.

Thanks for the info guys. I actually ended up dosing higher today as soon as I woke up. Was well before you guys responded but I did some of my own googling/research last night so I wasn't jumping in blindfolded.


I was gonna dose 2.5 grams but ended up dumping out 2.8 onto the scale, decided 'fuck it' and took it all instead of trying to fine tune it down to 2.5.


I had a really great day. Took about 3 hours to kick in fullh but once it did I felt really good. Felt almost like a low stimulant dose but without any anxiety or jitteryness. Had tons of motivation, no anxiety or worries and basically wore a perma grin all day.


These effects kinda starting slowly tapering off around 7-8 hours after dosing. It's been almost 12 hours now. For the most part I don't 'feel' intoxicated but i can tell my coordination is off. When I'm walking around I notice I feel off balance and I walk a little like I'm drunk (but I don't feel like I'm drunk). I also feel a little slow and like I could easily go to bed if I layed down. There is some ever so slight nausea present but it's very easily ignored/forgotten.


Not too shabby of an experience but I don't think I'll be trying to push the dosage any higher. If anything I'll probably lower it to somewhere between 2.5-2.7g next time. I've also been strictly limiting my phenibut use to once per month and have no desire to change that after today.


Thanks again. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hi all,

I've just started using Phenebut and getting weird side effects within 24 hours.


I read it helps for sleep so gave it a go. I started with 250mg for a couple of nights and nothing. Repeat for 500mg and 750mg. 1000mg and a great night sleep.


The next day part of my bottom lip was numb. I figured this was related to starting the drug and would go away. Jump forward three nights and I'm getting - what feels like severe benzo withdrawal:


Brain shocks

Electric shocks in my hands to the point where I drop things.

Body shocks


It's actually worse than I got coming off two years of pills to help me sleep - Valium and Rivotril as traditional sleeping pills didn't work.


I only used Phenebut at night 1000mg for three nights and it's gradually getting worse. I tried taking 500mg yesterday afternoon to check if I was somewhere going into precipitated withdrawal and no effect at all.


I've looked on the net and can't find this as anything listed other than this as withdrawal effects of Phenebut - any idea what is going on? Anyone get this from simply using Phenebut?


Cheers

Mick ![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)

That's odd...so you're only taking phenibut? Nothing else? Just trying to make sure it's not an interaction. Also, I wonder what brand you're taking, but not sure if we can discuss brands...


Is it HCL or FAA?

The dreams I had last night after taking 2.8g were incredibly intense.


In the moment I was not enjoying them but thinking of them now I feel differently. There's something special about dreaming that intensely... Even though most of them were unpleasant.


They were exhaustingly intense... But I look forward to falling asleep after my next phenibut dose (won't be for about a month)

mikeyjames - that is extremely unusual. I have never experienced or heard of any withdrawals after just 3 days of use at therapeutic levels. Are you taking anything else with it? It might be an interaction. Maybe try a different supplier as it might also be dodgy stuff you are getting. Don't know what else to suggest really. You might be allergic to it? Might be genetics. 


I do occasionally get muscle jerks' and twitches but this is at doses of 4-5 grams (the most I have ever taken). I have actually spilled a glass of water on my bed side table twice whilst having jerks when asleep. You might just be sensitive to it. 


MDPV: Glad you enjoyed the 2.8 grams. Did you get any of the MDMA type effects I described? And did you notice how it paradoxically is mentally stimulating yet you can feel like you can still sleep on it? 


It's a real enigma of a drug. Effects and duration seem inconsistent for seemingly no reason. I'd like to read the Soviets research into it for their cosmonauts. I can read a little Russian. 


I am also convinced it does not actually hit GABA-A receptors, just GABA-B, otherwise I would've noticed by now because I am tapering my diazepam (down to 4mg), and it's really not made any noticeable difference. If anything it has helped. 

I am also convinced it has some sort of effect on serotonin as well as dopamine, because of the MDMA like effects and a little euphoria.   


Just took 2 grams a couple of hours ago as I really need to sort out my sleep pattern out. lol

Definitely found it mentally stimulating while still feeling like I could sleep.  Felt like low stimulant dose feeling: increased motivation, general feeling of well being, increased libido. Guess those effects could correlate to MDMA but honestly I didn't feel it compare in the moment.

For me, phenibut helps with sleep for the first night after dosing only once and sometimes the second night as well due to some residual effects still lingering. But then the third and fourth nights I get rebound insomnia. For me, it would not help me get back on track... It just disrupts things mostly. Hopefully it works for you.

Yes I do not ever take it back to back: I have only done that once when I was in very desperate withdrawal from benzos, opiates and couldn't pick up my anti-depressants, so was withdrawing from all 3 which is as nasty as it sounds, and on top of that I had crazy unpleasant shit going on in my life at the time. It really helped during that time. 

But yes, the first night I took 2.8 grams, slept great, second night upped it to 3.5 grams, next night 4.2 grams, then when I hit 5 grams that was it really. I didnt really find any rebound insomnia or anxiety, but again that could be because I was put on amitriptyline (switched from SRNIs) a few days later and also my diazepam reduction. That may have blunted any withdrawal symptom symptoms. I couldn't say. But having to up the dose that much over 4 or 5 days definitely shows how tolerance can build very quickly. 


I think the last time I took Phenibut was 3 or 4 days ago and tbh I have a general rule once per 4 days (and that has never made me feel any tolerance building, but it's very much YMMV with this drug), but I usually only take it once a week in reality. And taken like this in lower doses generally does a nice job (I do mix with melatonin 1mg, and usually diphenyhydramine) of getting me to sleep earlier and I usually wake up feeling well rested. 


I still can't really decided just how recreational it is. Not very, but worth it for something different if you are into experimenting. Yeah the "MDMA-like" effects are pretty subtle but they become more obvious the more I take it. It's never gonna compete with MDMA but I just found some of the subtler effects similar (tactile sensation increase, but without a loss in sex drive like on molly lol, music sounds amazing etc.).


 I think it's a good substance to use for benzo withdrawal, and i'd like to see more GABA-B drugs prescribed for it, say on a restricted prescription of x3 doses a week max. Combine that with the old-skool tricyclic anti-depressants and I honestly think you'd have a drug combo there that would make benzo withdrawals MUCH MUCH easier to deal with. It might even allow for a more rapid taper. 


Just as an example of how inconsistent it is; I am only tonight just starting to feel it after 5 hours. And strangely it seemed to really kick in after a heavy supper before bed.


Yeah, weird stuff.

Hey F'Loki 

No, it's not what I expected. The day I wrote the post was horrendous - a few hours later I was driving and my cigarette kept jumping out of my hand. Then that night when I tried to sleep I got a light show that reminded me of trying to sleep that day after, when in my early 20's (early 1990's) when I used to do acid/mdma/etc and go to raves. I don't actually have what's referred to as a minds eye, suffering from aphantasia, so any visual stuff is really noticeable for me (probably why acid was my favourite drug 25 years ago). BTW I've never had a flashback.


I mucked a round a bit later that day and took another 500mg to see if it would make it better or worse - it made it worse.


The good news - now day 3 without Phenebut and feeling pretty much normal again.


I guess Phenebut is just not good for me.


Cheers

Mick

Same here I wanted to use phenibut for social anxiety and while I found it effective for that purpose, the effects lasted too long and were too disruptive to my normal schedule. I can see it working well for a young, healthy person who can get away with the after effects but with my health problems it's just not worth it.

Phenibut doesn't help me with insomnia. It actually triggers mania in my case and makes me feel great, not sleepy. I can sleep on it though when it's time to go to bed and as someone else mentioned, the dreams are quite intense.


It can have a heavy body load and give me gastro problems. It's hard on the stomach at times, but that's when I switch over to FAA instead of HCL if I need a break. FAA does not work as good as HCL imo. It's just a different feeling. Nothing beats HCL.


Expecting mine in the mail today.

I wouldn't say it's *that* easy to OD on, I mean if you use it responsible and keep the total dose from getting too high. I think I could say I've experience a "mild" OD from it, but I was basically taking it without regard to the total dose, very irresponsibly.

Ok so I've been using thousands of grams of phenibut over the course of a few months, I'm actually withdrawing from a 25g a day habit.


It isn't easy to od on. As like die but if you dose way too high without working your way up to it you will black out you won't remember shit most likely. This was back when 15g got me super high and tingly all over. If I went up to 20g at that time I would be blacked out passed out on the floor with my girlfriend trying to wake me up and then me trying to sleep with Brittany ( my girlfriend)  but I couldn't figure out that I was in fact, already talking to my girlfriend.


Total black out mode and that was not the first time. My friend with a much lower tolerance to me ended up blacking out, crashing his truck into a telephone pole and having seizures in the hospital. He probably felt high at 10g and did something stupi like 20 or 30g over like 12 hours.

Ewww I feel nauseous just thinking about those huge doses mentioned above. I'm taking a break from it today because I'm sick of feeling hyper from it. When taking phenibut, I actually need a benzo to calm the high down a bit. Or else I have a lot of energy and mania which can get a bit annoying at times. And I become extremely talkative.

Over-doing it on phenibut leaves an unpleasant aftermath which generally persuades people to take care in future. I've been using it for a few months now and most of the time I'm careful, but it can still be somewhat deceptive because it comes on slow and lasts quite a while, plus it's a pleasant feeling so it *can* be easy to re-dose a bit too much. As far as serious overdose, I think it would take a great deal of carelessness - this is definitely a much, much safer machine than GBL or GHB and in my opinion, the wakeful euphoria is much more enjoyable. 


I'd say it's worth a try, might be an idea to take a light dose just before leaving the house for a few hours if you're worried about fiending.

Cruisy..


It's not for everybody though. I have a taste for benzos and zopiclone etc. I have fun at the shops and music festivals drifting about in slow-motion, chatting without worrying that I'm saying the wrong thing all the time.. Phenibut gives me a somewhat similar feeling, but more manic; a more energetic euphoric feel than the slow-mo, care-free state of well-being I get from benzos and z-drugs.


That's just me though, a lot of people don't get much from it or don't find that sort of feeling enjoyable. Just makes some people lethargic or bored. If it's not for you, move on. All of this stuff can be very habit forming and it's not really something you'd want to aquire a taste for unnecessarily.

> 			I've read a lot of things about Phenibut and frankly it annoyed me how miss informed they are. I've been reading about people taking doses like 300-500mg. This dose won't do anything. Maybe if it's your very first time then I can see how someone might see some effects. I personally take 10 grams a day, yes 10grams. At this dose it completely abolishes any and all anxieties especially socially. When I take this does I can talk to anyone about anything when without it I would be filled with fear and anxiety and not want to talk to anyone and life's obstacles seem like some huge monster. It makes you a motivated beast. I've been taking this dose every single day for years  just about and I have never had any kind of tolerance issue or negative side affects. Frankly, a high dose of Phenibut turns you into a confident and very sociable person who doesn't stress about anything and can handle anything. It's really a super drug. Any dose over 12.5 grams however you will experience some nasty side effect and you won't get the results I've stated above. You must drink a good amount of caffeine with it however for you to feel its maximum effects. For example I drink two rockstars every day with it and maybe some coffee later. Because of its absolutely unbearable taste I always mix it with cranberry juice. I do 5 grams in one cup and 5 in the next. For best results wait 10-15 minutes between drinks. Slowly build up to 10 grams because If u go too fast and take to much for your tolerance it will make you vomit all day long. Try upping the dose by a gram or two everyday.  Do not take Phenibut with any opiates or benzos. Opiates will make you vomit all day mixed with Phenibut. Mixing benzos with it is not a good idea either from what I've read but I haven't tried it because I don't see the point. One awesome side effect is that when you crash about 12 hours later (the Phenibut effects at this dose last 12 hours or beyond.) But the come down makes you very tired and is exellent for falling asleep especially if u have sleep troubles. Also do not mix it with Gabapentin because they will fight it out in your brain and you won't have a pleasant result. Sometimes it makes my stomach feel uncomfortable, so it would be a good idea to go to your doctor and tell them you've been really nauseous and ask for promethazine. It works wonders and is the best nausea med available. I take 50mg if I'm feeling nauseous. I take my Phenibut 2 hours before work cuz it takes a bit to kick in, go kill it at work, then go home and sleep. It will give you such a great nights sleep. The withdrawals if you want to call it that are easily handled with some Gabapentin say 3-4 grams and maybe the same or a little more the next day. And you will be feeling nice and normal mentally after that. If anyone has any questions feel free to ask (or possible flame) me. I am by no means a doctor or intending to tell anyone to use these drugs nor do I indorse it. I'm simply stating how I do it and the results I get. Hope you enjoyed the post, I'd love to hear your feedback. Thanks

Anyone suggesting anything over 3g for a first time user is absolutely asking for trouble!


YOU TAKE A HIGH DOSE AND YOU WILL BLACK OUT, MY FRIEND WRECKED HIS TRUCK AND HAD MULTIPLE SEIZURES.


Start at th lowest possible dose and work your way up. If your feeling ballsy take 3g MAX  FOR THE FIRST TIME.


This is a very powerful drug and the purpose of this forum is harm reduction.


Start at 500mg and work your way up, giving at least 4 hours in between doses.


EDIT:


Doses under a gram will have an effect on certain people. My girlfriend and my mom for instance can get the anti anxiety effects at under a gram. But if your trying to actually abuse it and get high ( which most of us on this forum are doing) then our dosages will be many times higher than the lowest therapeutic dose.


Be careful with this unforgiving drug.

Yeah, I agree. Start low and work the dose up. You really have no idea how your body react to phenibut. 


Personally I have a habit of taking 5g Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday night. I've been doing this consistently for almost a year now. I've realized my time is basically wasted when the effects wear off. I went down to 4.75g today, I suppose I can bring it down ~250mg every few days or slow. My fear is I will end up using more etizolam than I am right now though (3-4mg a day). I have always had anxiety and have withdrawn from tramadol, kratom, suboxone over the last few years (though I used methoxetamine to ease most that)...but this seems so much harder. Ugh, how I regret letting this happen.

I'm on my taper and man, it's hard to disipline myself! It's funny how depressing thoughts come from no where while getting off. Thinking of my past failures, ex girlfriends, loss of good jobs, college drop out ect. How do others get through the mind tricks? This is so dehumanizing, if I can I think I would go to a detox clinic for a week to be medicated. But I don't have that luxury. Just to hear that time only makes it better is depressing on its own. I'm close to flushing my stash and drinking for the next 2 weeks straight.

Yeah I found myself on day 3 with nothing regretting past decisions and things that I couldn't possibly change while laying there trying to sleep. I've been out of work for a little over a month and I start my new job in less than 43 hours and I'm literally functioning on less than 20 hours of sleep in. 168 hours. I drank 3 24oz 5.9% beers tonight and still don't feel Like I can sleep for a prolonged amount of time.


I feel like my need to gain money is a reason to dose again. I don't even know how much to dose considering i have alcohol in my system and was taking 20g at once and then usually more a few hours later.


My last dose of 10g was approx 15 hours ago and that really didn't duo much and is still substantially lower than what I was dosing.


This drug is hard.


EDIT: 5 mins later.


I just took another 8g mixed with pickle juice in a shot. Taste is actually not too bad this way, never tried it before but that was the only thing in my fridge besides milk to mix it with.


My girlfriend will be home in 5 hours. I guess I'll report back tomorrow to see if I actually remember seeing her in the morning.


DISCLAIMER!

Do not mix alcohol and phenibut like in this post, I'm not advocating anyone to do what I've written here, especially at these doses. Just please use caution.

Pickle juice? Damn! What a trooper. I've been out of work for awhile too which depresses me. I'm actively looking for a job when I have my daily phenibut. When I don't have it I won't bother going to a interview. I had a few beers, wasnt wasted. My gf knows about phenibut and knows I'm weaning.

**Wow never thought I could achieve this effect with phenibut**


I took 2000mg earlier today. I am going to try 2250-2500mg later tomorrow morning. This stuff is really fucking strong, especially at these doses.

Yikes...I just take about 1.5g, dump it in my mouth, and wash it down with water. I do this until I reach my desired dose. It tastes VERY salty, but I can't imagine mixing it with anything else.

I want to post another side effect of mega dosing.


I've found that upwards of 15g doses cause confusion upon waking.


I took 8g with alcohol the other morning at about 4:00 am

Took another 15g at 9:20 am and went bed.


Woke up at 2pm went grocery shopping, walked the dogs with my girlfriend and mom by the water. They said I acted normal and not even high.


Had some awesome sex ( a very welcomed side effect!)  and Went to sleep about 7pm and woke up at 1030pm


My girlfriend stated how she doesn't miss the confusion when I wake up and I said elaborate. I remember waking up and me telling her I was more tired 20 minutes ago when I woke up and she kept saying what? I had to repeat it twice and apparently I wasn't fully muttering the words, mostly just mumbling them. This happened with three different statements or questions I made.


I thought I was completely sayng them!


I didn't black out or not remember anything, and this was close to12 hours after the largest dose of the day! 

I did only sleep for a short amount of time, my girlfriend and I work 3rd shift so we barely sleep and sleep whenever we can.

Be careful with phenibut, especially when you're saying it's "real fucking strong" and taking it two, or more days in a row. That stuff is very addictive.

That is way too much for the first time! Even 3 grams is way too much for the first time. People please start low and work your way up. Can't stress that enough. People underestimate the strength of phenibut, but getting sick on it makes you wish you were dead just to escape that feeling.

I've been using only phenibut and gabapentin lately. It's been making me feel good, but it keeps me up all day and night. I'm usually an insomniac anyway, but I think the phenibut and gabapentin combo makes me more awake and alert than usual. It makes me also tweet a lot more because I feel confident in myself and my opinions. I'm no longer second-guessing myself.


Ritalin is not approved by my insurance any longer so I'm not taking it. It's actually a blessing I can no longer get Ritalin because I started to abuse it and then went into the darkest depression ever when I ran out. So this month I'm only using phenibut/gabapentin. A benzo would be nice. I mentioned that before. It would calm me down from this "high".

The Ritalin depression lasted about 2 weeks. I felt suicidal. If anyone is taking Ritalin regularly, I would recommend tapering.


I have been using gabapentin and phenibut quite a bit this month which isn't good in the long run, but right now, it's helping me through my days. I am not suicidal, anxious and depressed all day and night so I'm just glad to have some relief. Btw, I have major depression and anxiety. That is my natural state of mind so honestly, anything that can help me combat that is welcome. I probably don't even need to take phenibut and gabapentin at the same time and I wouldn't recommend it. It's a habit, only since the beginning of this month. Probably just because I have both of those things around.


I've come off phenibut in the past so I'm not worried about it. When it stops working well, I'll taper and leave it alone.

4g is a hell of a lot of phenibut.  If you only use it once a week,   go for half that dose,  especially if drinking on top....never a good idea.

Why are you taking gabapentin?     A couple of grams don't interfere with one point two G of Pregabalin.    As you've been on phenibut before, its only use is in two day cycles, for max effect.

The combo feels better. It's like a synergy. I know it's stupid. I won't keep taking both. I disagree that phenibut only has a max effect for 2 days. It has been working for me many more days in a row.

I noticed Erowid do not have an 'Effects' section yet for Phenibut. I think with the amount of 'trip reports' we've had here from people we could probably easily do that. 


Positives Effects:


- Decreased inhibitions

- Decreased anxiety and depression

- Increase in sociability

- Increased enjoyment of music

- Increased creativity 

- General "feel-good" feeling, sometimes mild Euphoria 

- Pleasant body high, increased tactile sensation, a "floaty" feeling.

- Increased sex drive


Neutral:


- Paradoxically sedating and stimulating

- Mentally stimulating

- Very vivid dreaming


Negative:


- GI disturbances at higher doses

- Nausea (especially with higher doses)

- A "hangover effect": Headaches, nausea, upset stomach, dizziness. Worse on high doses. 

- Muscle cramps 

- Muscle twitching 

- Physical addiction potential if taken in successive days/nights without a break inbetween

- Withdrawal Symptoms described as almost as bad as Benzo withdrawal. Tapering generally seems to be a good idea, like benzos. 


LD50 seems to be very high, and pretty much impossible to fatally overdose on because you will be violently sick before you can even begin to ingest those amounts. However, even 'mild overdoses' have been reported to be extremely unpleasant, with extreme vomiting, diarrhea and headaches. 


Dosing:

Start low. No more than 2 grams for new users, and build it up slowly from there. 

It can take up to 4 or 5 hours to feel the effects if taken with a meal, however effects can be felt after just 45 minutes-2 hours for some. 


Low Dose: 500mg-1,500mg

Moderate Dose: 1,500mg-2,500mg

High Dose: 2,500mg-4000mg

Heavy Dose: 4000mg+ 


Duration: 

4 to 16 hours. Highly dependent on initial dose, re-dosing, and varies from person to person quite wildly.      


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Just my interpretation.

I can't believe people are taking more than 2000mg of this stuff a day. I took 4 250mg capsules earlier this morning for anxiety and I felt tired the whole day. I slept like half the fucking day.

I usually take about 1500mg at night, or else I wake up at 1:30 in the morning and can't fall asleep. Be careful with this stuff.

It has a different effect on different people. It makes some people tired/sleepy, it can trigger mania for me because I'm bipolar.


I've been hardly using it lately. I don't need it as much anymore. A bad side effect is it fucks with your stomach, makes you SUPER bloated! I've been working out hard lately so I'm laying off the high doses of phenibut. It defeats the purpose if you take this stuff while trying to slim down.

Just a tip: I think a good idea is to drink Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar before taking Phenibut HCL. 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar in 8 oz. water will neutralize your stomach, balance the PH or whatever. Phenibut HCL is very acidic so the apple cider vinegar beforehand will make it so the HCL is not harsh on your stomach. 


Also, it will prevent muscle cramps because Bragg's apple cider vinegar is full of potassium. Like bananas. I like to drink apple cider vinegar before running anyway just for the simple fact that it prevents muscle cramps.

Got some phenibut HCL and FAA in the mail today. I prefer the HCL "high", but it is known to cause awful bloating and cramps. It does a number on the digestive system.


FAA is easy on the stomach, but doesn't give me that manic high I like. Still, it defeats anxiety like a champ.


Has anyone ever mixed HCL and FAA together? Like maybe making half of your dose HCL and the other half FAA? Interested if anyone has experimented with both together.

I have a couple questions. First of all, let me preface by stating I am an early riser. I go to bed fairly late and wake up around 6:30AM every morning. After taking 2 g of Phenibut at 2 in the afternoon, I fell asleep around 1 in the morning and slept until 11AM. I was in a coma. Does anyone else sleep way harder and longer after dosing?


Second issue that is actually sort of concerning me...and this doesn't happen while on Phenibut...but the next day after dosing once I wake up, my hands do this weird jerking thing, almost like a spasm. This occurs when trying to, for example, type this post out. It's weird. And a little scary. I know Phenibut messes with the same brain recepter as alcohol...GABAB. I know alcohol withdrawal can cause seizures. I shouldn't be in WD. I don't think 2g is a hefty dose, I don't dose multiple days in a row, and haven't taken any in probably 2-3 months. What is this and does anyone else experience it??

^ Dosing at 2 in the afternoon is probably too late because it at least takes 2-4 hours for phenibut to really kick in. I wait at least 4 hours.

^Thank you. It's comforting to k know someone else has experienced it. I'm 48 hours off an extremely heavy Kratom habit so it could also be skewing stuff. That's actually why I took some Phenibut. I hadn't slept in 48 hours and knew from past Phenibut use that it would be effective for sleep, anxiety, and energy. 


That is what's so amazing about this drug, IMO. If I stay awake on it, I am productive, happy, and don't even need my xanax. Nor do I feel WD from xanax. Yet if I want to sleep, it promotes that too. Bizarre. I've only ever used it to soften the blow of other habits so keep my use extremely minimal. That's why the "ticks" flipped me out. My husband did say he tried to wake me up and couldn't. That flipped me out a little, too, bc I'm such a light sleeper. 


Anyway, thanks for your reply. It always helps to get knowledge from experienced users.

Okay so... my normal prescribed meds are as follows:


*Zoloft 200mg (1x am)

*Wellbutrin 300mg (1x am) & 150mg (6 hours later)

*Gabapentin 800mg (3x day)

*Ritalin 20mg (3x day)

*Ambien 10mg (1x pm)

*Valium 10mg (25mg or 2&1/2 10's A day) PRN (or *as needed)


I also take Kratom on and off (I'll buy 4oz)- And take about 6-10grams daily till its gone. I'm usually always left with a week or two in between orders and have no problems with withdrawal.


LASTLY I have been a big fan of Phenibut. I will order 200 grams and take 4-6 grams a day (keeping medicine doses the same) until it is gone. Then I usually have about 2 weeks where I don't have any. I never have had any problems with withdrawal. With daily use it actually builds up in your system and I feel the Phenibut 24/7 because of long half life. Typically I get a huge dopamine boost during day and when evening comes and I take my Phenibut dose, usually about 3-4 hours (of feeling intoxicated from the Phen) later I take an Ambien and pass out. 

Day after day, for months, I have done this daily routine with the weeks in between (the usual 200 g batches) and feel VERY full effects every day. Then I stop after a month of this cold turkey, and suffer no more than psychological withdrawal (cravings). But NEVER have any withdrawals like I do if I stop the valium or gabs cold turkey.

So this only 2 days a week cycle on/off or won't feel it b.s. and talk of withdrawals being so horrible stuff, I just cant understand. Maybe try coming off benzos after years of use or run out of of benzos and Gabapentin at same time after years of use and then you will know what withdrawals are. 

I understand everyones chemistry is different, so I'm not downing anyone, or boasting about chemo I take. If even a "self proclaimed seasoned drug abuser" tried taking my daily pharmacological regiment, after 2 days, they'd either be dead or at least comatose.and presumed dead.


I also am prescribed xyrem (sodium oxybate or a.k.a. NaGHB) 9Grams a night for narcolepsy. I cycle on and off this prescription, by my own discretion, every other couple weeks or so. The GHB every night in such large doses IS very hard on my body... (Ambien is only pharm I abstain from nights taking the GHB). Am I really screwed up being able to take this all for months (and most of the meds for years) and it make me feel okay and finctionable? I take care of my 2 year old son, so I have to be on my game each day... There's no question I am a very attentive and involved single father to my son. 

But I was terrified when my tolerance for phenibut went up to taking 3g at a time (sometimes BID). BUT JUST LIKE EVERY DRUG it has a ceiling tolerance and a consistent daily strength of action and benefit.

^yes. Not picking a fight but this crap is real. I'm on day 3 of no phenibut and still have issues. But I just googled KRATOM WD. It carries more similar symptoms. I was a heavy user for over a year of 250g weekly. Crazy I know. I used it for oxy WD, hence the screen name, and found myself trading one Addiction for another.

> Oxygal, you're right. I never meant to make it seem like Phenibut was harmless, or not something to be care careful with. The reason, I'm sure, that I was able to deal with suddenly no Phenibut after long periods of heavy use, was due to the fact that I am prescribed 3 strong gaba receptor agonist: *Gabapentin *Valium *Ambien

And what I'm prescribed to dose, every night, is about 3 times the recreational amount (3 grams I would say= a recreational experience/I am suppose to take 9 grams =[2 doses of 4.5 grams] back to back for just minimum 6-8 hours of Deep Wave sleep- of course to bypass any recreational level and put me in a 3-4 hour coma like sleep each dose).

>    Just stay educated and aware of your bodies reaction to these things, and be careful ... Phenibut is NOT a supplement/nootropic substance as advertised by these vendors (It IS a powerful pharmacuitical developed in Russia). Again stay educated,, its your best defense against anything "taking over" and ruling your life. Thanks Oxygirl for clarifying that.

@Oxygal


I've been using Phenibut for about 2 years and have tapered down over the course of 6 months to about 2 grams a day.


Still get extreme 'nodding' and, like you say, muscle weakness. As in, my arm or leg muscles will just go limp for a 1/2 second even if I'm standing or holding something. Also, just totally nodding off even on the bus or whatever for 1/2 seconds. It's messed up and TG I don't drive (DUI). 


I've noticed this happens when I don't get a whole lot of sleep (though it can happen in the middle of the day or right after dosing) and it seems to me that Phenibut (esp? when coming down from mixing w/ caffeine) seems to make me totally unaware of how tired I am. I will sit in bed reading and jerking asleep for an hour before my conscious mind is like, 'hey dude, remember this? this means you're tired AF, just shut your eyes and get some ZZs.'


Anyways, yeah if you've been using for a year or more the effects are totally different than when people start. [Sensitization](http://i.magaimg.net/img/1dgq.png) occurs and some effects ('nodding', muscle 'spasms') will increase and others (euphoria) might decrease.


That's my little addition to the topic, hope it helps.

Engage, I have noticed the half second slips you speak of. Usually late at night for me, when I'm at my computer, but they can seem quite abrupt and powerfully hypnotic given such a short duration, then I suddenly jolt back into consciousness as my headphones or phone hits the floor. Glad it's never happened while I'm standing.

Engage, thanks for the validation. I'm not well read on phenibut which is a dangerous thing. I've used it 3 times ever but drank alcohol on it. I figured this would cancel the stim effects. Nope. It saturates GABA b. This is a huge mistake. Plus I'm in recovery from xanax. Also the same receptor. I should probably steer clear. Or at least not drink on it.

I just have been taking that large amt of Phenibut with all the heavy GABAergics I'm prescribed (Valium, Gabapentin, NaGHB, Ambien) as well as the potent dopamine reuptake inhibition from really high doses of the Ritalin and Wellbutrin. I would think my GABA and DOPAMINE would be so downregulated bc of the prescribed daily use of those ON TOP of the pretty big Phenibut habit. I honestly was giving my acct, and experience, with the daily Phenibut at up to 5grams on top of the meds, and how after killing a few hundred grams in a couple weeks, I have no problem with going the next 2 weeks without it. Are you so self consumed you think everything is about you? Do you know how many hundreds of posts I've read that describe the same thing you're going thru? Well all was saying was I have had an opposite experience when stopping the Phenibut

If you look further up on this page, you and I have already addressed this. You had a slightly different attitude that day.

I was addicted to phenibut. I loved it! I used it for 2 yrs, pretty much every day at 4-9 grams. When I got off it, it was ruff. I was dehumanized with social anxiety, phobia of everything, sleep issues, and depression. I stayed off for 3 months hoping I would at least recover from the depressive and social part, but the only thing that got better was my sleep. I then ordered more phenibut, but this time was different. When we reunited, I took like 3 grams. I got disoriented, wobbles, drunk feeling that people always mentioned about getting when they first try this stuff...I never had this before at any dose. Phenibut always gave me energy, motivation, and cognitive clarity. I could take on the word with it. But this time it was gone!

If someone was long term on pregabalin (lyrica) would they still feel the good effects of phenibut as an occasional recreational thing?

Yes, I'm very conscious of that. I realise that there are no guarantees with advice on this kind of thing anyway. It really was for someone else I was asking anyway. I've been using phenibut once/twice a week for a couple of months and so far it has been very helpful.

Wow, I have been reading through some material here, and am actually kinda shocked by the fact that this stuff might actually be helpful. I mean seriously, anything to kill the cringe of withdrawals (from opioids). I actually tore off a couple of hours ago looking for some. And over the years I have been prescribed huge bottles of the stuff....straight to the garbage. I remember this younger kid who had been taking aderal since he was like 7 or something crazy like that . And he told me to try some for withdrawals, that at around 1500 mg, it helped his withdrawals. I just thought the kids was twizacked! But at the prospect of feeling better I am almost ready to give it a shot.

The anti-anxiety angle with phenibut (that I think most people are after) is the same one pregabalin uses.  They will definitely be cross tolerant at calcium channels.  But phenibut has some extra GABABR activity that should still come through.  Not sure how that feels though.  I guess for opioid WD a muscle-relaxer would still benefit.


EDIT:* opioid **W**D* not *opioid **O**D*.  You don't need muscle relaxers for OD I don't think.

Nope, but I did find some Lyrica that's only about 2 and a half years old. Thinking about it...messing with these gabba drugs, just because I am in a state of mind where I just want to do some real dope....maybe isn't the best idea. 


But as of the last 10 years or so..the decisions that I have made have been less than well chosen. Much of the time. lol.

Gabapentin gives me some pretty positive anti-anxiety feelings.  It's not subtle, way better than three cold pints of your favorite strong beer-type feelings.  Lyrica's a little trickier with dose escalation, I think.  Meanwhile, phenibut has the lowest potency of them all, by a lot.  So you limit yourself by sheer mass of drug.

Well shoots, I decided not to take the Lyrica. I was afraid of its making me feel worse. And just stuck with kratom. All good now though. And I am surprised to hear the horrible withdrawal stories about people who are taking these medications. I definitely don't need any new issues.

^ You're withdrawing from opiates, right? Sticking to kratom is your best bet because it's closest to an opiate. If you didn't have kratom, then Gabapentin might help. I always wanted to try Lyrica because I heard it's way stronger than Gabapentin. Lyrica is supposedly very expensive, that's the only problem. 

Gabapentin works so well for anxiety and a mood lift, it also helps with Adderall comedown or withdrawals. 


Kratom also helps with Adderall comedown and the low mood/fatigue that can happen if you go through withdrawals.


Gabapentin is something that always comes in handy. If you're expecting it to feel just as good as whatever you're coming off of, you'll be very disappointed. But it will get you through the hard times and you can go back to feeling "normal". 


Phenibut is better than nothing in case Gabapentin isn't available. Gabapentin is preferable though, to me anyway. 


The euphoria and amazing mood boost phenibut used to give me is long gone.

Felt like my heart was about to stop tonight:


It's been some months since I messed around with phenibut, but I got some to fill in as an anti-anxiety medication. Also, I'm sick of relying on someone for Gabapentin so I figured phenibut would be a good substitute. 


Tonight, I was reminded why I need to leave this alone. There is a disturbing side effect that makes me feel like my heart is going to stop!

I had a great day on it, felt a lot of love and was singing at the top of my lungs all day. An overall cheerful mood. I dozed off a few hours ago and when I woke up, I felt like my heart was about to stop. At one point, I was kinda prepared to die, kinda like my very last thought was "Uh oh, this is it!" My heart felt like it almost slowed to a complete stop, but then I noticed I kept breathing somehow. It's hard to explain, but the sheer terror of it is something I never want anyone to experience so watch out.


I forgot waking up and feeling like my heart is going to stop is one of the side effects I had in the past. Well, that was a waste of money. Done with it because maybe it's a severe panic attack or maybe my heart could actually stop if I keep taking it. Who knows... Just making a note in case others are experiencing heart trouble with this. I can't be the only one.

I love the stuff but also feel like there is something fishy about it. I think it’s precribed in 500mg so maybe I just dose too high but 1g a day often causes an odd pain in the back of my head and if I dose for more than 3 days it really feels like it’s tearing up both my stomach and kidneys. This all with the HCL. Hopefully the different forms aren’t as hard on the body as it really is a Godsend for benzo withdrawal.

Yes, it can cause tummy discomfort and heavy on the kidneys. I took HCL too and it's just heavy on the body. I have to take 3 grams just to feel anything. It's always been that way, so yesterday was 4 grams. You reminded me I had to take an Ibuprofen for my head last night. The left side of my brain was hurting bad. 


Be careful of symptoms, the tummy discomfort never bothered me as much as feeling like I'm about to meet my maker due to a heart attack. When I die, I'll be damned if it's stupid phenibut that takes me out. haha Done.


The FAA is more gentle on the system so give that a try. FAA doesn't make me feel as good as HCL though, as far as that manic euphoria. I can tell a difference, but it is easier on the system. Not worth ordering for me though.

You could put the powder into empty capsules so you won't have to taste it. It is a nasty chemical though. When you taste it, it makes you realize it cannot be good for your body.


I haven't taken any today and I still have a sour stomach type of feeling from yesterday's dose. It's gross stuff.

That’s right and if I should ever feel the urge to take sum Phenibut, I’ll do that! Thanks ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I know everything is kinda aquired taste and that it takes something like a crazy sorta „effort“ to feel a Chemical, learn from it and if it’s your „thing“, learn to appreciate what it has to offer. I never really got past the point of learning, or precisely, even though I’m sure to know most of it’s pros and cons and took it very often and in all kinda doses, it’s definitely not mine... I thought of Phenibut to be sort of a recreational benzo, but even those were more abusable even though they’re plain cold medicine and never really felt „satisfying“ like Opioids/Opiates ok their own - without the exception of a few combos (Heroin & Diazepam, almost euphoric/MXE & Tetrazepam, not dulling the ACH but relaxes, or MDPV & Pyrazolam). I am thinking about it till today if it was much because of the Phenibut but I just had a single time, where I massively overdosed on it and also took a damn lot of booze and other sedatives (enough to definitely kill someone else who’s weighing 30 pounds less and not having the not too super superpower, the ability to tolerate/withstand the most unholy high amounts of nearly everything) and the day after had a strange experience-thing going on, where I was totally hilarious and euphoric all day long, sometimes unable to quit sentences because of me constantly bursting out in laughter -

***PHENIBUT IS REALLY FUCKING DANGEROUS***

AFTER TAKING NONSTOP 60 500 mg pills my liver just nearly died, my shit was white and i probably never really recovered from that incident, i really enjoyed taking those high doses, the high is actually one of the best I experienced so far. But taking 8000mg for weeks was a bad idea for sure, its definitely a very aggressive liver poison, so anyone taking it should never overdose or take high doses on a daily base, being a great fan of GHB, GBL I can not recommend it. Phenibut became the very last choice for me, there is lot of other Substances that are far less dangerous to take. It really can damage your liver very bad, dont think it is the same like alcohol. The acute damage may last you forever and i am not the only one who experienced this effect.

Thank you for sharing that. Phenibut is certainly not worth risking your health and your life. As a matter of fact, it's not even a necessity. Addiction lies to you and convinces you that you need it. 


Are you safely off of those high doses now? I'd rather take Gabapentin any day. At least it doesn't make my body feel like a toxic wasteland. 

Gabapentin can be used to wean off of phenibut. People say Baclofen can too, but Gabapentin does the job just fine. Or any benzo really, as long as it's only taken for short-term to help with withdrawal. Don't want to replace one addiction with another.

I recommend looking into sublingval Validol, Valerian root extract, Lemon Balm Extract, Magnolia Bark Extract, Taurine, L-theanine - all of them are relaxing GABA acting stuff that is not so addictive and bad and may actually be healthy in some cases. 

Those with GABAergic addictions, please look into those supplements!


And yes, high doses of Phenibut are very damaging to the liver as thats how its primarily metabolized. Look into Milk Thistle extract to aid liver metabolism but be careful with it as it has numerous interactions with pharma drugs and drugs in general.


Also, if you already have weakened liver (alcoholism, hepatitis or other reasons), the already long post action of Phenibut will be increased, quite a lot in severe cases. A person I know with Hepatitis C has had a very long come down from a single Phenibut dose - almost 3 days of nervous stimulation, inability to sleep, anxiety and body aches.


I think it's not advisable to take Phenibut with weak livers at all.

Hey just found this thread, hi! I could use some much needed help yall. I'm going threw my first possible Withdrawls for any substance and would love your guys input on possibly the best taper schedule I can come up with for Phenibut with what I have available to me. Was thinking maybe a short cycle of multiple things in a small enough span to not just trade addictions, like in particular Baclofen. 


I'm almost 8 months on my daily phenibut use of 2-3 grams a day that was to suppress with my severe depression and social anxiety. I was in a very dark place, and this helped give me new life, but obviously unsustainable. I've also developed hearing impairment and tinnitus recently in my right ear during a taper from 3g to 2.2 over the course of two months. Plus being a depressed stressed out moron and carelessly abusing music while on this substance as well, all the time since I started. Hopefully this will go away after I quit, but my hearing for my right ear has diminished significantly. So yeah, i'm trying to get off this ASAP before I develop other long lasting sides from this.


I'm currently on 2.27 grams a day and now have 60x 10mg baclofen avaliable.


If anyone could possibly help me with a schedule, that would have me suffer minimal withdrawls please? On top of the 60x 10mg baclofen. I have 25x 2mg etizolam. a kilo of kratom, 20mg xr adderall (doubt this will be helpful) Kava (which i've never tried) L-Theanine and melatonin for sleep.


I've read that 10mg of baclofen equals to one gram of phenibut. Is this true though?


Was possibly thinking about tapering down to 2g of Phenibut a day then hoping right onto 20mg of Baclofen, maybe split up threw the day. But unsure how long I should stay on it or when to taper off it as I only have 60. Was wondering if there was anyway I could take Baclofen just enough before getting addicted to it? Possibly by cycling with what I currently have? Like maybe a three or four days max of etizolam afterwords and then kava and kratom or something else like Beta Alaine and fasoracetam for for the rest? Would love some recommendations or success stories with these options, ty.

I used to have a problem with GHB, then it was a problem with Phenibut.  I began phenibut taking a teaspoon (3 gram) dose. It was close enough to G for me and I did get a addicted a couple of times before I learned to only use it twice a week.  I liked the "downer" high.  Liked how it made me manic in a FUN way (at first) and most of all loved the prosexual effects, which mirrored G exactly-- extreme sexual arousal paired with difficulty achieving orgasm.  I cut my dose to half a teaspoon (1.5 grams) to 1/4 teaspoon, to 1/8th of a teaspoon! That's a mere 375 miligrams-- less than they put in "Happy Camper."

If you want to make your posts easier to read I'd break them up a bit.


I also sometimes get Phenibut rage and Flurophenibut rage, but it happens less with the latter.


I'd thought maybe it was cause partially by a combo of the Phenibut and the massive doses of caffeine i take, but maybe not.


But again, I find it happens less with F-Phenibut (though it is an untested RC), and even with regular, I find maybe it happens like 1 out of 4 times, but I have to avoid the wrong stresses.


I'm not married so I know that could be a stressor to some LOL...so I just avoid annoying people, annoying websites where people argue, and if nothing annoying happens, I usually have a good time.


I didn't know there were stronger acids available made from Valerian Root, cause Valerian Root by itself does very little.


NOT asking for links, but are those kinds of acids that come from valerian root made online?

Mycophile Valerian essential oil is actually pretty nice, but it went from 15 a vail to 150!  Valerenic acids, which are quite a mix of compounds, are actually the most strong parts of Valerian, and the best extracts contain only .08% of it.  An old hippy who grew the stuff said the best stuff evaporated out when it was dry and fresh root or essential oil was really nice stuff. I expect some component of the herb is really close to G.  Thanks for reminding me about fluoro... I DO recall that it is supposed to be more mello!  Rafayte, my psychiatrist ain't prescribing me pregabalin or gabapentin.  They aren't willing to consider that an option.  I don't know how I'd get a scrip for baclophen, since I don't need a muscle relaxant and they only prescribe flexoral when I do. f-phenibut is supposed to be closer to baclophen in effect, so I think that merits a little exploration!  Thank yee!

Are you an angry drunk too? Do you have problems with anger in general? 


I've never found phenibut to make me rage. Neither does Alcohol. I've noticed certain people who fit the "addict" model start to get angry when they ingest any type of GABA. 


On the other hand I've had to deal with getting opiate rage under control now for years so maybe I don't notice it.

I'm not an angry drunk, but I do have some anger problems it's true but they usually don't come out and while I'd say about 65% of the time regular Phenibut doesn't make me angry and about 85--90% of the time F-Phenibut doesn't, I can get it too at times.


Phenibut and F-Phenibut both make me very emotional in all ways, mostly loving ways but if someone or something pisses me off it can turn to anger, but again, much more with regular Phenibut than F-Phenibut.


I think there's something to what he's describing, and it makes sense that certain drugs that can make you more emotional in one way could also make you emotional in another way.

I know you're just looking for a drug recommendation but I'm going to recommend some hardcore motherfucking introspection.


Look what you're doing to your wife, man. I'm not trying to be a dick but you need a dose of reality. You are supposed to be her rock, the person she runs to, not away from. You are supposed to comfort her when she's down, not push her down. Are the mild highs you're getting really worth hurting the person who loves you most?


That is some serious addict behavior, hurting someone that much for a half assed high. I'm not judging, I've done the same thing to my parents and family. If you don't **stop** now, it will get worse. No slowing down, no "I can control it", no switching to a different drug. There is no third option, you get better, or you get worse. 


I truly wish you and your wife the best of luck. Addiction isn't easy for anyone involved,

^^^This.


I think it's sad your still trying to get something out of a drug that has the potential to cause to to act like this.


I can relate man, for me it was gabapentin.  I would take it in small doses with alcohol for a night out dancing but soon learned that I'd go off on the slightest provocation.


The first time it was my girls birthday and we had been fighting a lot lately so I took some gabapebtin to try and "calm down."  We went for a walk to help with that.  While we were walking some guys were drunk on a balcony and said something about my girls shoes.  As calmly as possible I ask "hey what room you guys in?" And they tell me not thinking anything of it.


Long story short I walk into a party full of college kids and called the whole party out of 30+ people.  Some guy thought he'd be tough and said he was the one yelling down at me (he wasn't) and I threw him on a ping pong table.  I then barely escaped...  Thankfully I know how to handle myself or I could have been fucked.


Second time I was at a show and saw my buddy had been jumped by a group of guys.  I then found these guys and fought two of em, fucked em up but I also walked away with injuries.


Both times I felt somewhat justified but it scared me how easy it was to hurt people while under its influence.  It took nothing for me to calmly go from normal to hurting people in a heartbeat.  I say this too cuz I found gabapentin and phenibut to be very similar in action, I've not enough experience with phenibut but I can tell it has the same potential for that kind of behavior.


I say you do the same as I, if a drug is making you act like that then ditch the drug completely.  It's not worth hurting your woman.

its got some similar effects to baclofen/pregabalin. Pregabalin is Lyrica, which is regularly prescribed for neuropathic pain. A good friend who recently had back surgery has been on it for a long time for nerve pain, of course, he has been working very closely with his doctor.


Phenibut is in the Gabapentinoid group of drugs, whit gabapentin(obviously), baclofen, pregabalyn, and a bunch of others I cant remember. They have similar effect profiles, but they vary in strength and type of effect. Phenibut may help with nerve pain, but its a strange drug,


When I used it, 3 days of use in a row resulted in rebound anxiety/depression. Not serious, but there. Longer term use has bad withdrawals. Really bad. 3g/day for 3 months had me in a delirium tremens type of w/d. Luckily I was in a hospital, but I had delusions, hallucination, sleeplesness, psychosis, and really bad tremors/shaking. No seizures though but that's probably because they got me stabilized on ativan and valium before it got to the point of life threatening, but it may have been possible to get seizures without medical intervention. 


Use it cautiously, I would use the lowest effective dose  a max of 3 times a week on non-consecutive days, or two days in a row with 3 days off after that. Think of it as a thing to take when you need some extra relief to do something you need to function well to do. Don't treat it like Tylenol or any other drug you'd take every day. 


Start at 250mg, and titrate up from there. It takes ~2hr for a dose to take effect, so be sure to wait for the 2hr before re-dosing. that was my problem, the first time I took it I re-dosed 1g every 30 minutes, so by the time i was 3 hours in I couldn't walk and I was puking like crazy. 


Physical dependency is no joke with this, but with any drug, this has the potential to be a useful and productive part of your pain management if treated with respect and diligence. Its a very "more-ish" drug when you get a "buzz" so be careful and let your doctor know what you're doing so you know if there are interactions with any other medications you take.

Supposedly a bunch of rich kids in a school in australia had a severe overdose on phenibut which has them hospitalized jn critical condition. BUT none of them died, and as far as I can find, no one has died "as a result of phenibut use" nor due to health problems that manifested as a result of long term use.

It's very easy to start abusing phenibut. It was a miracle drug for me in the very beginning many years ago, but that's over. Never get hooked on it. Withdrawals are horrific. 


Don't get into a habit of going through tubs of it, then running out and suffering withdrawals. If you can't get more right away to slowly taper off, make sure you have back-up like benzos or even Gabapentin to get through withdrawals if you ever experience it. The side effects start to outweigh the benefits when you overdo it.

i had two really rediculous "binges" while I was using phenibut. The one I mentioned above I was doing ~3g daily to self medicate depression and anxiety, lasted about 3-4 months and I cold turkey withdrawal-ed in the hospital until they got wise and realized it was GABAergic and got me stable. The second was earlier, but different, as I was taking massive, unmeasured doses daily for about 3 months. Once I realized and started measuring (once I realized the w/d is insane and I had to taper and know my doses) I was stable on ~10g daily which I tapered down to .5g/day and jumped, which was uncomfortable but way better than the 10g w/d i started to feel. 


Point is, I had blood work done after both of these binges and my liver enzyme tests came back normal, no problems. 


Now, this is just from ~3-4 months of use, so that doesn't mean its not bad for the liver, its just that my relatively extreme use of it for multi-month use didn't affect my liver in a noticeable record-able way. YMMV

> AFTER TAKING NONSTOP 60 500 mg pills my liver just nearly died, my shit was white and i probably never really recovered from that incident, i really enjoyed taking those high doses, the high is actually one of the best I experienced so far. But taking 8000mg for weeks was a bad idea for sure, its definitely a very aggressive liver poison, so anyone taking it should never overdose or take high doses on a daily base, being a great fan of GHB, GBL I can not recommend it. Phenibut became the very last choice for me, there is lot of other Substances that are far less dangerous to take. It really can damage your liver very bad, dont think it is the same like alcohol. The acute damage may last you forever and i am not the only one who experienced this effect.

Now I'm very sorry to hear you say that you did that to yourself, and while YES, to SOME extent Phenibut can be dangerous, ESPECIALLY when so heavily abused as you did, and it's VERY addictive, you have to realize that there's proper use and abuse of all drugs, and what you did was take TWICE the MAX WEEKLY DOSE daily for weeks on end, so really, there was no possible way you weren't going to have something bad happen to you.


Alcohol is dangerous too, but if you drink 10 beers once a week you'll be fine.


The equivalent of what you did is basically take 20 shots a day, every day, for a month.


You were doing so much that even if SOMEHOW your liver had been ok you would have been so addicted that you could have died from withdrawal and people have had bad psychotic episodes from that kind of abuse.


When I used regular Phenibut (HCL or FFA...these days I use F-Phenibut which is an RC and is diffferent), my sweet spot was 3,200mgs (and that's a high dose), and I would never ever let myself use it more than 2 days a week, and I was always fine.


So yes, everyone needs to know to be very careful with Phenibut, but I can't help but feel that you are mis representing a drug and its dangers when you use such obscene amounts and then talk about how dangerous it is.


If you take obscene amounts of most substances bad things will happen, but if you take moderate amounts of most substances than most of the time they won't.

Hello everyone,


Just couple of questions regarding phenibut. 


Bottom line, I am looking very optimistically to substitute this to alcohol in a night game/clubbing occasionally. 

First of all, why? Well as most of you agree the alcohol high itself is not so special/enjoyable, makes you drowsy, lazy etc. Specially if I am out on a night game, picking up women at some point if you are too drunk, I always feel the urge to do cocaine because of the adverse effects of alcohol consumption. That combo (however enjoyable) is something you do not want to do on a monthly basis. In fact I have been trying to stay away from this combo at all, but couple of times in a year it happens.  Maybe I have tried so many various drugs in my lifetime, that alcohol for me has no real value, experience wise. There is the shitty feeling next day and being unproductive, I also workout in the gym regularly so everything really adds up. I definitely do not have a problem with alcohol, as I tend to consume it rarely and in minimum doses. However my weakness still is the alcohol+cocaine combo, so I try to avoid these settings in general. I have nice stack of benzos at home, which I use rarely and have not abused. So given the horror stories I have read I will try to proceed with extreme caution with phenibut. 


However I have read that people still complain about brain fog, tiredness/lack of motivation/ rebound anxiety/depression the next day. If used  2-3 times a month, will you still experience these side effects, or so to say hangover ? It depends of the dose you take ? Of course there is the special G, but I am in a foreign country and it is not the easiest way to get my hands on this. However G has its own pros and cons.


e: Finally got the post structured.

Honestly it 100% depends on the person. I dose higher than most people and I don't even have a tolerance, and yet I feel completely normal the day after. Not even an afterglow. 2-3 times a month is absolutely fine as far as wds/physical harm goes but we can't really tell how it's gonna affect you otherwise

While the withdrawals from phenibut are not nice, they are over fairly quickly from my experience.

Il tell you what, i can accomplish ANYTHING while on phenibut! Its seriously my cheat code to life! I met plenty if women on it, great jobs, worked hard, very social, high self esteem, attractive personality.....i really wish i can be on it for the rest of my life. I havent used any phen in a year. I contiplate going back on it, but if i do its gonna be all in. I can't be superman a few times a week......its all or nothing!

FAA is easier on the stomach than HCL, so it would be useless to buy HCL next since I have a sensitive stomach?

Ive been on up to 12grams a day divided every 12 hrs since april or may I got down to maybe 6. Idk if it really helped all that much to begin with maybe it did...  But now i dont notice a thing. With the help of gabapentin i dropped down to 6ish grams a day. Maybe less.... Im more scared of the detox than waiting to see how bad it really gets.... I know gaba based drug wd and it is hell...

Phenibut turns me into someone else man.  I have the most crazy stories about it.  Will have to tell you all about it sometime bros.  I no longer want to use it thankfully (for my own sake).


I lived with guys who megadosed it.  I'm talking insane amounts.  Wasn't good.

Or let's just say it never did my life any good.  


Take it responsibly please for your own sake.

 I really hope it's just blown out of proportion. I just read that Hungary banned phenibut this month, so I hope it's not related to us in any way in terms of cracking down, or it's just their laws in general. Honestly, anything that isn't placebo is always in hot water.

I think I'm going to return my HCL and just stick with FAA because I'd rather not risk my stomach, since I already have so many health issues already.

Yea the first few times I tried Phenibut I had a great time with it but the one thing that I always hated was how it would fuck up my stomach for days after.  Like the first time I had the shits for a week.  It almost made me write it off completely but I've since become immune to that negative effect I guess..

 Yeah, I'm definitely returning the HCL then because I noticed the FAA is helping my stomach because it's mitigating the anxiety I guess.

I've seen Phenibut recommended as a potentiate for Kratom. Do you take in in the morning or night? I am reading conflicting reports: it causes nods and sleep vs energy and productivity. I am still working on finding a strain of Kratom that doesn't make me feel tired. I think I may have found what works. I cannot be sleepy or nodding in the daytime, my career is demanding and requires focus and mental clarity. It would be cool to find something that gives you that kind of body high, before the nodding, without the subsequent nodding and for me, inevitable sleep.

IMO I would start with early evening dosing, At least until you get an idea of how it effects you. It usually starts off with an energetic come up that fades into sedation. Too much can leave you with a dirty hangover effect after you wake up a few hours later than normal. Some people that use it regularly will take a few smaller doses throughout the day, but I would caution against using for more than 3-4 days a week as the dependency can build quickly.

Thanks all... maybe a weekend game. Do you usually mix it together or is that a bad idea? Also, anyone know about seizure threshold affects (I have a seizure disorder). I'm fine on Kratom, I found my daytime mojo. I get light euphoria and an energy boost from UEI/UEMD, but damn that's expensive. That's kinda what I am shooting for though (when I get bad fatigue, a few times per week). It is like that? Sorry for all the questions, I just don't know much about it.

Oh, to be specific, if it matters... My intended use of Kratom is for pain management. I decided to go off hydrocodone because it was making me too sleepy for work and I wanted to give this a go, full knowing I could be put back on meds if need be. I would just love the added benefit of the energy boost and slight euphoria I used to get before I would get sleepy AF!  It helped me with productivity, activity tolerance, and dealing with people appropriately (only throat punching them in my head).

While Phenibut is a close relative to Baclofen and Gabapentin/ Lyrica, I agree with KK that you should proceed with caution. While there are some anecdotal reports of people who believed it worked well as an adjuvant with AE drugs like Keppra, most of the information that would be of benefit is not widely available. It was developed in the 60's by the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences so much of the testing info is likely to be written in Cyrillic on paper and filed away. It's considered a supplement as well which means you're going to find very little as compared to a substance labeled a drug. 


The info that is available is quite limited and insufficient to be able to say that it's "safe" with such conditions as seizure disorder.


> The derivatives of GABA and beta-phenylethylamine (PEA) the tranquilizer phenibut and muscle relaxant baclofen (p-chloro-beta-phenyl-GABA, lioresal) diminished all studied effect of PEA in mice, namely seizures, sedation, excitation, hyperthermia.

On a personal note a relative of mine had her first seizure ever a few hours after using what I would consider a moderate dose of Phenibut HCl with nothing else. The doctors were unable to determine the cause, so make of that what you will.

I just did. The next day. I still have a prescribing doctor (just am not using my rx right now and they know). I took as written unless I was a walking effing disaster, then I would double or even triple my dose, but I would skip doses from my schedule, mostly when I was at work, to compensate so I never ran out. My pain control has been everywhere honestly. So... I lost my insurance between jobs and decided to switch to Kratom (more costly endeavor in the end *sigh*) instead of paying OOP for hydrocodone. No real physical issues transitioning, I'm super constipated on Kratom though. I am still messing around with strains and dosing. As of now I take a mixture of 3 grams of a white and 2 of a green in the morning, 2 grams of a green in the afternoon, and 4-6 grams of a red at night. Initially I was taking a red in the day because it is "most opiate like" and it was knocking me out! So... I'm still all over the place. I seriously ate shit on my stairs last week goofing off with my kid. Slammed my head, neck, mid back, lower back, both shoulders, and both elbows... fell flat down and then I bounced that way down to the bottom instead of sliding. It was a HARD fall. I've had 8 orthopedic surgeries, with a need for L4-S1 fusion and total C spine fusion (poor outcome, won't do it). I am bruised to hell, I took my doses and added another 2 gram dose midday, rested in bed a lot, and pain was hanging around a 4. I was surprised at the efficacy. Today is a bad pain day, my back and legs hurt super bad, but I can't tolerate a higher dose of Kratom (the equivalent of taking an extra Norco or 2) so that kinda sucks. I've been doing it I think for about 6 weeks now and today is the first really bad day. I usually have these bad days a couple times a week though, so it's an improvement. That's an overall snapshot in what it has been like for me. I think it is better and I still don't even have it fine tuned. 


A lot of people say switching to kratom from all kinds of narcs isn't that bad, but I would max out at maybe 50mg hydrocodone a day or it would be a pukefest even with antiemetics, so I imagine it has to be easier for me than heavy users and users of other substances. A lot of people give it praise though. I imagine it is different for everyone. Mindset will be your biggest ally. You need to find a good vendor that sources their product well, is willing to spend time talking with you to help find some good strains to start with, educate you, maybe even provide samples. I also found a group on FB that has been very helpful and there is a vendor in there that has good product, and will talk with you on PM wether you purchase from him or not (I am going with him from pressed tabs and staying with my current vendor for the rest). I guess it's been multifactorial for me, personally. Long ass answer, but I hope it helps.

UEI kratom will make your tolerance super high, super fast. It will cause you not to be able to feel any of the regular leaf. Only do UEI once in a while.


I found a company with good quality liquid kratom shots. I prefer those because I don't have to swallow pills and it's really strong...also expensive. That's only a treat every now and then. I'm sticking to the regular stuff. 


Definitely don't mix UEI with phenibut. You will be sick. UEI alone will give you nausea if you take a lil' too much.

my 2 cents: phenibut is a shit drug. Tolerance builds way too fast. Months ago I began with 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 grams each proceeding week to figure out my threshold and I felt little to nothing each time. The positive effects are minimal and not worth the negative effects. Last week I did 4 grams after months of not using any and I was slightly high but the day after I felt really nauseous and my bodily fluids smelled really bad.

I only take UEMD (like UEI) when I am in extreme pain, need an extra oomph, and in small doses, I knew about the tolerance issues using it and also how to decrease tolerance in general (this is one thing I want to protect). I used plain leaf and soon a vendor will be custom pressing me 1g mix strain tabs. I haven't used liquid, but the product is high quality, just tastes groooooooss! Hence adding the tabs into the family. 


I didn't even think about mixing it with UEMD, I suppose if I chose to get this then I would've hd another thing to bug youth. I kinda though I wouldn't need that with Phenibut? I was just curious about it being used along with Kratom. 


I have decided not to mess with this though. Overall, it sounds like a pile of shit I don't want to step in. The biggest factor is seizures.


Thanks everyone.

Those tabs sound very interesting! Never heard of it being in tab form before. The liquid shots are probably the worst thing I've ever tasted, but so worth it. The shots raise tolerance super quick just like UEI though.


You made the right decision to leave phenibut alone. I've potentiated regular kratom with it and you might get a nice boost for a few times, but then tolerance to the combo ruins it. It's not worth it in the long-run. Take care.

@Inds- I think there is a difference between batches, on top of that some people just don't get much from it.


For me personally it's an amazing additive to other substances.  It's too sedating by itself but mixed with other drugs brings out its best side.


Phenibut mixed with MDMA, LSD or Amphetamine is some fun shit.


First time me and my brother tried mixing it (his first time period) we took 250mg phenibut and 2mg d-meth along with our normal dose of MDMA.  (I normally take 500-800mg phenibut.)  That was one of the top nights of my life...  Still get chills thinking about it 6mos later.  I'll never forget my brother glancing over at me with this blown away look on his face and says, "I'm riding life like a bitch right now."  I've never felt so on top of my game ever in my entire life, even the first line of the cleanest fish scale doesn't have shit on that combo.


It has amazing synergy.  It also makes dosing MDMA easier on my stomach if I dose it an hour or two before the MD.


The one thing I'll agree with is the tolerance.  Very long lasting..

When I very first had kratom, it was pressed tabs from a brick and mortar store. They were small dose those and I had to take a lot of them. This vendor has plain leaf and caps now, but will soon make pressed tabs in 1 gram so I won't need many and he is a trustworthy source so I'm excited for the new product to come out. I don't think it is common, but you should see if you can find it if you can swallow large tablets. Eliminates the nasty taste completely and releases just like plain leaf

as long as it isn't coated. I've never seen the liquid, but I haven't paid attention really I guess. I thought it was dose equivalent? More of a concentrate it sounds. 


Thank you all!

The shot I'm talking about is 8 ml and has 12 grams of Maeng da Kratom. We're not allowed to give names of the product and sources. It's a small shot, but packs a punch. So much better than swallowing all those capsules and it feels...different, like more euphoric.


Don't run out or go cold turkey with kratom or you will have withdrawals similar to opiate withdrawals. I had to warn you. It happened to my ex. He was taking it every day and ran out one weekend. He was very mean and in a lot of pain. I told him it was withdrawals. You have to wean off of it if you take it too many days in a row. Phenibut can help with acute kratom withdrawal, if you take a low dose of phenibut for only a few days. Phenibut is just something I have for backup in case of withdrawals from certain things.

Really? I noticed no such thing. A few caffeine pills were enough to send me into a panic attack. 110mg of ecstasy was making my heart pound out of my chest. I didn't find phenibut stimulating at all.

Isn't the whole point of an anxiolytic to slow you down and not the opposite?

I know,I was surprised too. In fact it didn't feel stimulating, but it did crank my heart rate every time. Unfortunately I think it led to getting booted off methadone, because I think my doc thought my heart was acting funny because of that Qc interval issue or wtf it's called.  On the bright side in the long run I found suboxone to be equally as analgesic with the bonus of tons of doses per month in spite of it working great at half a milligram or less,lol.

I did not feel any heart palpitations. It sounds like you are candy-flipping which might be why you experience them. On the other hand, I did experience some mydriasis with phenibut which is generally a symptom of stimulation. Did you?

I have 2 wonderful vendors that collectively offer everything I need. I've heard of what you are talking about. Personally, I use plain leaf powder, a variety of strains, and down that nasty shit with some grapefruit or orange juice ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)  I have it mostly nailed down now, on a specific schedule. I just made my first order of caps to keep at work and my vendor will soon have pressed tablets, which is what I had to start, but his will be 1g per tab. The first ones I got were like 0.25-0.5, A LOT to ingest! I actually wasn't paying attention to my supply (new job, overwhelmed) and did not order in time from my vendor, so I tried to skip Saturday night's dose and didn't have withdrawl issues, but pain. Serious pain. I used the last of it at about 5 am when I was in tears (that takes a lot, I birthed 2 babies epidural free and didn't cry). We had to go to the most reputable head shop and overspend to match my needs for the weekend and Monday. I use it specifically for pain management and also enjoy the energy from the whites with a back up of the red to mix in small amounts if I get bad in the day. I work in a career where I need to be alert and multitasking constantly, mistakes can cost lives so I can't get tired. Been doing great. On occasion I add UEI/UEMD, mostly when I'm in bad shape at home. I am always at my peak performance as a human right when my hydros would kick in, burst of energy and complete body rush of no pain so I am able to work fast and get a lot done. That's kinda what I was looking for as an overall therapeutic effect, if that makes sense. By the majority of responses, I don't feel like Phenibut is a good decision to try out, especially relative to my shit health. Thanks smooch for your input, keep that husband stocked up lol! I am very thankful for everyone's shared experiences here! It really helped! I hope the various other places I've shared input have helped too.

I just started taking phenibut recently and found it to be an amazing nootropic. Killed my anxiety, made me more social and outgoing, I can actually sleep a straight 8 hours solid, and so far no issues except feeling more emotions. I'm abit concerned it's going to be banned. Any word on when that may happen?

**Phenibut WDs and/or Taper Questions**


SWIM has been using Phenibut for 6 weeks which started out at 1g at first and now about 1.5-2g once a day.  SWIM is wondering if it is possible to not have any wd symptoms if SWIM goes ct?  If wds are imminent then SWIM is asking for a taper schedule.   Currently SWIM has 250mg capsules and no scale.

Phenibut 1.5 g (liftmode powder)

Vyvanse 20mg (d-amph equivalence is 5.9mg dextro-amphetamine)


Both substances reach peak plasma levels in approx 3 hours, so its a wonderful combo ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


combined with my morning Methadone 80mg oral drink, this cocktail has me feeling GREAT ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


At night / bedtime maybe a 0.5mg Etizolam dose

Massive apologies for not reading through this thread before posting but I just discovered it while at work so I've just skimmed through a couple pages...

In my personal experience,  I like 800mg phenibut for sleeping( I can fit roughly 800mg in a large 000 gelcap)

But if I take 2 (totalling 1600mg roughly) I find it extremely stimulating and I cannot sleep even with the addition of etizolam its MORE difficult to fall asleep on 1600mg phenibut. 

But combing 800mg phenibut with mu usual etizolam dose makes just want to sleep for ages...even after I wake up on that combo , I just want to go back to bed....I also find that the 800mg phenibut makes me feel like I've had a more "natural" and well rested sleep.

I should also point out that i have brutal insomnia...not sure if that is a factor making larger doses of phenibut more stimulating or not....but I've never wanted to push the dose of phenibut passed 1600mg.

On 1600mg phenibut it honestly feels very much like being on a stimulant...cant stop talking, jittery, hyper focused and mild euphoria. 

Also, i only take phenibut once in a while (maybe 2 times a month) so it might also be that zero tolorance plays a role in my experience as well...

In my experience this is not the case...

Unless your talking about red vein kratom strains....the white maeng da I have is euphoric and stimulating at any dose...highest I've ever pushed it is about 10-12 grams and I was jittery so fuck and couldn't sleep for over 24 hours.

Same with phenibut....low dose I dont feel much but I sleep like a baby...double that dose to 1600mg total and I'm wide awake, alert, talking my face off and bot even benzos will invoke sleep.

People must be metabolizing these drugs somewhat differently....

Of course skipping over previous use of other gaba type drugs in this class and dosage; Is it FAA (free amino acid) or hcl (salts)? I find that if I dose 1.5g every third day the buz is reproducible and reliable. However, in my predicament it always shines in a social situation (fast paced/demanding work environment, kickin it at a concert, out with a couple friends etc. It really is a sociable drug, IMO.

Hi PtahTek,

[@sewerslide.666mg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/527387/)

I'd say your chance is scoop leveled hopefully be 300-500mgs and if that was the case start with two and give it time and see how you feel work up dose. If you take to much you get this dizzy nausea filled hangover. I like to take about two grams a day but have the dosing staggered. But I haven't taken any in awhile once you get tolerance again might as well take a break. If you can just use Phenibut once a week you can keep it sustainable. Getting addicted to it is rough the withdrawal is sorta like benzos. But not real complusive compared to most things I can manage the stuff fine after learning from withdrawal in the past I get like 50 or 100 grams and that's it for the year kinda situation generally.

I would take a gram and then wait six hours that may even feel a little mild, for me it would. I personally don't think I would feel much off 500mgs. It's always gonna be subtle in some ways it's hard to explain but it has such an extended duration gradual effect.

FAA form of phenibut tastes a lot better, similiar to flour with slight bitterness at the end. I usually use HCL form and just toss and wash it. Some people can feel it with less than 250mg. I personally almost gave up on its recreational effects before trying 1.5-2g and found my sweet spot to be around 3.5g

I've got 40 grams of phenibut on the way for my first time. Seeing as how it's legal, won't show up on the piss test, and is effective enough for anxiety relief in combination with gabapentin and Baclofen, I think it's a great candidate for something I could use. 


Any "need to know" stuff I should know going into it? Plan on starting with a g, without redosing and seeing where it goes. Don't plan on using it daily.

Phenibut is a pretty easygoing drug when used responsibly.

So I can only think of these few things:


Drink plenty of fluids

Try as much as possible to limit your alcohol intake

Tolerance builds up quick


Plus if you ever want to play, I would suggest the Phenibut + microdosing LSD combo. 

It is one of the best functional combo.

Yeah, luckily I don't drink so I won't have to worry about that too much. 


The LSD combo sounds like it'd be good, especially since so many people compare phenibut to a low dose MDMA experience.

Try 1.5g first and do not redose for a day or three. It takes fuckin hours to take effects so don't think "it aint shit" give it that time. It used to "hit" me in 5 hours like clockwork... now around 10 hrs. Waht? Yeah... its kinda weird ime.

And water, water, water.

Eat some fatty food (like a gabapentinoid), personally I like a tbsp peanutbutter but whateva.

And the effects are a *lot *more noticeable in a social situation or work.

Sounds like a plan! Yeah I'm actually really looking forward to it. It's been quite sometime since I've had any anxiety relief. Last time was probably when I got some kava.


I'm pretty worried about it being made illegal, especially because I've just now discovered it and the stupid government will probably make it go away :/ it's really the perfect thing for me since it's not gonna come up on a drug screen. I'm betting that I will enjoy it. Definitely gonna give it plenty of time to kick in without redosing

Yeah I dread the day but we are resourceful and can get by whatever their godlike abilities to control us and our usage.

Hoping the best for your first time, bro. If it works, it will be *nice*, imo. And that anxiety will be... where'd it go...?

Take it early and get the fuck outta the houe and socialize somewher if ya able (i hate people so....). I can eat 4mg xanax and be good til I run out of things to keep me busy... soon as I close my eyes I am out, though.

Just a little sharing from experiences.

If I dose and sit around the house muic is great but there really is no other "effect" that I notice... gotta go out and mix ya will be god-like ime. lol

Thanks for the update.

If I do 1.5g and chilled out on the couch imma knock out for sure.

Imo it's a great drug for social ocassions, you should also try listening some energetic and uplifiting music when you're alone. However i should warn you, as a recreational drug i'd use it only every 2-3 weeks, speaking from personal experience, as i wasted plenty of it mostly as a sleep aid. if your plan is purely for medical reasons and you don't care about the high / magic, then using it more frequently will be ok, but of course, as you know such thing comes with its own kind of dangers, like benzos.


About the gabapentin and baclofen, unless you're addicted or have tolerance to these drugs there is really no point in taking them together with phenibut as phenibut already hits all these receptors..


As far for socializing goes, my favorite and staple combo is phenibut + speed (amphetamine) in dosages from 2000-3750mg of phenibut and 20-30mg of speed. Best taken on completely empty stomach. but i should IMHO note neither of these drugs are for partying, but rather for direct human to human contact and they're virtually undetactable in front of people if you. if the only reason you can't enjoy parties is anxiety than ofc it'll help, but i'd rather take LSD or AL-LAD and similiar drugs.


have you ever tried ephenidine (dissociative)? i have recently tried it a couple of times and i must say it is a very pleasant drug, doses from 10-50mg will not impair you in any way and it makes you feel very warm and content. Just something to think about so you don't fry GABA-B/VDCC with phenibut or get addicted to it. Kratom and CBD might not be that bad for you either. It's a lot better for you to rotate these drugs than taking phenibut only..

i agree with this statement whole-heartedly. for me virtually every drug's high changes depending on where i am-or if im alone, i guess brain tends to compensate by being more sobereish when going out, while at home you can relax and be more introspective.

I'm no doctor (and I have never played one on TV) but the rage you are describing is very real and I get it too.  I'm bipolar 1 and I've been experimenting with phenibut for about a year now.  But I have to be super careful with my dosages and then be absolutely certain to take enough mania meds ahead of time.  And just a little big does big things for me.  LOVED the way it totally took away my anxiety and just made me feel damn good.  Eventually it's just maintenance dosing until can put it down for a few weeks.


What I failed to recognize at first was that phenibut, to me is like alcohol.  It's supposedly a depressant, but for addicts like me, it does the opposite for the most part.  Something to do with the opioid receptors I think.


I now know for sure that phenibut is really a mania inducer and mania accelerator (like turbo).  I mean if I took 1250mg (5 of the 250mg capsules I have), there's a 95% chance I flip the fuck out and end up in the hospital.  No doubt.


Y'all be real careful with this phenibut stuff.   It's some real powerful shit.

Okay. Let me know if this is the wrong place for this. It’s my first time ever posting on bluelight, and I am happy to be here. 


I recently obtained some phenibut hcl. I’m a big fan of plugging, being a former IV-er of all things IV-able. Obviously I know I have to mix phenibut with baking soda or else I’m going to burn a hole in my rectum, at a ratio of 1g phenibut to ~0.4g baking soda. 


Here’s the thing though. When I add water, this white substance bubbles up and forms. It’s crystalline almost, and forms a paste really quickly… to the point where it takes like 10mL of water to even get a liquid out of this mix. Whatever this white stuff is, it doesn’t dissolve in the water, it just hangs there. It actually floats to the top of the water. 


WHAT IS THIS WHITE FLAKY BYPRODUCT???? It’s salty af to taste, is it phenibut FAA created from the solution combo? Lord please someone educate me, I wanna know what this is. It haunts me.

Yikes. I really couldn't say. I've never really mixed Phenibut with anything. I have never heard of anyone plugging anything mixed with baking soda, personally, or plugging Phenibut at all, doesn't sound like a good idea to me.


It works fine just orally, just takes forever to kick in, I feel like Phenibut wouldn't be pleasant in fast acting forms. Feel like it would make me nauseous and gross feeling. It already sorta does that regularly. If you want your Phenibut to kick in quicker, I'd suggest just getting some F-Phenibut and taking it orally.


Believe me, I know all about the IV fetish and the searching for the next rush, but at a certain point you'll have to ask yourself if it's worth doing this kind of stuff to your body in search of it.


Idk I wouldn't do that personally ![🤔](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f914.png) But yeah, maybe someone has spoken about it in years past. Our search engine kinda sucks but if you look back through this megathread and this forum you may run into something about the topic.


Welcome to Bluelight ![🙏](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f64f.png)![❤️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/2764.png) Hope to see you around. Maybe someone will come through with a better answer.

Howdy folks. Been reading this whole thread and there's a lot of variation in people's experience and opinions. One of the main ideas I noticed is the 4,000 mgs per week maximum to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Some seem to think it's better to take the whole four grams in a single day and abstain for a week before doing so again. Others break it up into a few smaller doses with days in between, and some seem to suggest that daily dosing is fine so long as the four gram per week limit is not exceeded. With various people saying they need "at least" a certain amount usually a gram or more to really get something out of it. I'm mainly curious about the dosage vs frequency equation as far as the withdrawal "threat." If a person keeps to the four gram weekly limit does it really matter about the dosing frequency? Like is 500mgs daily much more likely to be a problem vs 4g one day per week, or 2g on two days etc? 


My second question is about combinations. It's suggested that it potentiates or at least mixes pleasantly with kratom. So if a persons typical kratom dose in a day could be between 2 and six grams, what kind of Phenibut dose would go well for a combo experience. I imagine I would start with a light dose of P and then add a light dose of K and titrate up till I hit a sweet spot. Any advice on what to take first or how to conduct an experiment with this combo would be appreciated. 


Third question is how does this go with dextromethorphan? Or DXM/kratom/phenibut combos? I'm talking relatively low doses of all three.


Fourth question is potentiation in general and ROA. Seems as if rectal administration requires a lower dose and has a more rapid onset, and mixing a bit of baking soda in the solution is the way to go. Any insight into the pros and cons of that route (or insufflation) would be appreciated.

Phenibut is my favorite substance mixed with methylphenidate(prescribed) in day and with weed at night) creative loops of or glimpses of some ingenious stuff, ideas.


The thing how I did it even with pregabalin tolerance or just stop pregabs two days before or just when in withdrawal but keep pregabalin, also I have prescription so why?


It helps in my perspective shift like acid or ketamine my 2cnd or third place shared with MDMA...nwm also i had benzos in hand but pregabalin is essential. 


I do or did this with only hundred grams which is like a month maybe less as I need 3g to work because of tolerance or because I am a big guy so I think I need more or my also 10yrs back dependency on  GHB  as pregabalins 600mg 6year or 7 using with some stops and starts again.


I would get work done and I love watching movies and Tv as i watched and red about filmography because of lsd, ketamine and Phenibut I think my headspace is not looking for fun rather curiosity in unknown, that is why used it by myself....people here think still that lsd is making you insane, which is sad considering what tech they possess just to dance or strip themselves, or creating content that is telling you like those guys and girls women now yelling and clickbaiting with GPT 2.5 is Singularity, then fast forward 6 months gpt3.5 is like nothing you see than Jordan Peterson is abusing psychology on youtube. I like the guy but he went to far and that whole gruopie Rogan, huberman, bla bla circle. I like Joe also simply because he did something good in the end I think., knowledge or parts of it just to give someone like me learned Davinci in couple days as Photoshop, also now I'm playing with Blender.

Thanks to phenibut and LSD as some sativa with that. i think ketamine was never when phenibut. I just think there is no need maybe NMDA before to drop tolerance. but I use some light DXM also while dropping pregabalin and benzos which I hated they all are boring in the end even warm beer is better.


So pregabalin is holding withdrawals I dont like baclofen or it is not liking me I git serious like rashes I thought like I'm in Fringe episode. I need help and Walter is tripping as Peter![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)) so I stoped baclofen it got worse like for couple hours and than those like burns or something ugly just fell of and my face was normal. That was witnessed by my dad and mom and they said wtf? you just been here 5 minutes discussing going to the ER. I said well:  I had help from beyond.


Phenibut is like a mix of ketamine and lsd when coming down not when peeking than I just try to not think or atleast I think like alien or a fish it doesn't matter. I forget about other drugs things even anything as Ithink to much stimuli and I saw all with eyes open.

I just like the music as any immersion enhancement as I turn of everything with screen light a joint with phenibut and think! weed helps with ego and dellussions which I also have but I reject them fast enough because I see what is futile and what is not for me.


I know when stopping gabapentinoids some more than others or depending on persons nutrition, health and allergies. can create disbalance in everything thus creating those rashes or some potassium deficiency or similar (there is more on the web about it and if you using it please read everything you can on benzo or pregabs or baclofen, gabapentin, phenibut.


I was through overdoe but conscious overdose with phenibut and that shit is really freaky and vomiting as i twice felt like I have micro seizures not jerks it was like minute is an hour and I knew 20 minutes I will feel a bit better but  it is long and it is bad for you also ,so dont take a gram thinking 5hrs later it is weak than take another-that is very good advice to myself and you whoever. those with tolerance ignore the most as you probably know like me or more.


F phenibut is like baclofen, yes? yet there was no rash so i must thing those baclofen pills were maybe something more. or maybe an inactive ingredient. they were from someone I don't even remember who where. I just remember having 100x 10mg pills.

Old but gaba drugs, especially benoz and alcohol and honestly Most other addictive drugs have something called a kindling effect (look into it) but it's very pronounced with benzos and basically it means if you've ever been dependant on say klonopin even mildly the next time you fuck with your gaba system you can, in some cases go right into withdrawl even after a long period of abstinence and only one moderate dose. Your gaba system is not to be fucked with as someone stated and if you do go poking around there you need to respect the fuck out of it and that means sticking to your original boundaries. Klonopin and phenibut both act on gaba channels so you're at higher risk of dependance in a shorter amount of time than someone who hasn't regularly taken gaba drugs.

That's what I just did, only done it a handful of times and it's been years. I'm also going through opiate withdrawl and have nothing else to help aside from kava and kratom but kratom don't do much for me anymore not when it comes to withdrawals, even subs won't touch this shit.

What type of opioid? RC, street acquired, prescription or other?

I feel phenibut is helpful in many ways also excellent for extending the effects of other substances.

Of course there is the caviat of building tolerance, dependance and addiction if not careful.

How's that taper going with the phenibut bro? It's been a while and I think about that every time I see or think of the word. Hope things are manageable.

A dope habit which varies per day, with a gram of 7oh high purity powder a day. This 7oh shit sucks. Idk if I'm getting fet or maybe 7oh has an unknown mechanism of action but nothing helps these fucking wds.. Subs don't touch it at all, lope does nothing, gaba helps Lyrica helps but not as much as it would with just straight dope. This shit is wild especially for how weak it is in some regards

my first thoughts are adulterants that have a shorter half life and not as cozy of feelings with straight dope. possible a type of fent or other.... idk

hope you have enough gabap and pregab to make it through.

I've got nothing aside from phenibut that I tried yesterday and did fuck all and I have zero tolerance for gaba drugs practically. I have my regular kratom which also does nothing and that's it, I'd be very happy with some gabapentin right now.

Idk if it's laced though. I've thought about it maybe being a fent analogue or maybe on a couple of occasions but I would've died by now

Subs don't touch it either, perks nothing, poppy tea nothing although it's not the best batch, straight morph in doses of 200mg did nothing either. I know they say 7oh is 13x morphine potency but morph is a full agonist so it should've done something since 7 is a partial.

Hey tomorrow is my phenibut day of the week but due to scheduling change it will also fall on a kratom day. 


If I take 1.5g of phenibut in the AM can I take 4 grams of kratom at night? Do they play well together?

Ya you'll be fine. There's anecdotal reports of long term kratom dependants saying due to their chronic dependancy to kratom that the phenibut doesn't work but idk if you're not dependant on kratom they should pair very well together and give the phenibut more of a pregablin type feel

Interestingly enough my chronic gabapentin usage has significantly blunted phenibut. Especially at 1.5 grams
