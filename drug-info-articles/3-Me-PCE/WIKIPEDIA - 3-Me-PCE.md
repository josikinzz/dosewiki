3-Me-PCE is the 3-methyl derivative of the internationally controlled substance Eticyclidine (PCE). It shares structural similarities with 3-MeO-PCE and 3-HO-PCE. 3-Me-PCE first appeared in the scientific literature in 2015 in the context of synthesis and analytical caracterization of a series of arylcyclohexylamines by Wallach et al. It is believed to produce ketamine-like dissociative effects predominantly via antagonism of NMDA receptors. Anecdotal evidence of its efficacy dates back to 2022 and assigns it a potency similar to other PCE analogs. The EUDA issued a notification of its first analytical identification in March 2024.
