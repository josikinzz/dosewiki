## Subjective Experience

I have sampled this as an ingredient of a number of blends, most notably in
combination with MPA. These definitely produced a nice ride, and there is no doubt
that NM2AI brought something to the table. The question, therefore, is whether it
has any value stand-alone.

A couple of years ago I explored a light dose via the oral route, but got little return.
More recently I turned to insufflation. I snorted 40mg, which for this RoA is
probably a reasonable first-time dose. The nose burn wasn’t as bad as had been
suggested online.

There was definite psychoactivity: a slight head buzz, some stimulation, and a minor
mood lift. I drifted gently back to baseline after an hour or so. I experienced a very
modest but not unpleasant sojourn.

On the question of whether there is a sweet spot for a significant take-off, I join the
general consensus in not being sure.

## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: 5 mg
- Light: 50 - 100 mg
- Common: 100 - 150 mg
- Strong: 150 - 200 mg
- Heavy: 200 mg +

**Duration:**
- Total: 2 - 4 hours
- Onset: 30 - 60 minutes

**NM-2-AI** ( **N-methyl-2-aminoindane** ) is a lesser-known novel [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [aminoindane](/w/index.php?title=Aminoindane&action=edit&redlink=1) class. It is structurally related to [2-AI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-AI) and [MDAI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDAI) .

In comparison to [2-AI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-AI) , this compound has a lower potency, a longer duration and very similar effects. It has recently become easily accessible through online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) vendors where it is sold as a [designer drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) .

Very little data exists for the effects, pharmacology, and toxicity of NM-2-AI. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

NM-2-AI, or N-methyl-2-AI, is the N-methylated derivative of [2-Aminoindane](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-Aminoindane) and is analogous to [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) . It features the R 3 terminal carbon of the propane chain of amphetamine bound to the benzene ring. This creates an indane, a bicycle containing a benzene ring fused to a pentane ring. The amino group 2-AI shares with amphetamine is bound to R 2 of the indane group. N-methyl-2-AI contains a methyl group bound to the amino group R N (for which it is named).

## Pharmacology

Due to the lack of research regarding the substance, all discussion regarding the pharmacology of it is speculation purely based upon its structure and subjective effect similarities to other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) such as [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) and [2-FMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FMA) . It is speculated that NM-2-AI most likely acts as both a [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) . This means it effectively boosts the levels of the norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitters in the brain by binding to and partially blocking the transporter proteins that normally remove those monoamines from the synaptic cleft. This allows dopamine and norepinephrine to accumulate within the brain, resulting in [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) effects.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, NM-2-AI is usually considered to be energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is similar to that of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) but stronger than that of [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) or [caffeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Caffeine) . It is similar yet distinct from the stimulation experienced on [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , encouraging physical activities such as dancing, socializing, running, or cleaning. The particular style of stimulation which NM-2-AI presents can be described as forced. This means that at higher doses, it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still as jaw clenching, involuntarily bodily shakes and vibrations become present, resulting in extreme shaking of the entire body, unsteadiness of the hands, and a general lack of motor control.
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)**
- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component can be considered to be less intense when compared with that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of NM-2-AI can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The general head space of NM-2-AI is described by many as one of mental stimulation, increased focus, and euphoria. It contains a large number of typical [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) cognitive effects. Although negative side effects are usually mild at low to moderate doses, they become increasingly likely to manifest themselves with higher amounts or extended usage. This particularly holds true during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of the experience. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This component is most effective at low to moderate doses as anything higher will usually impair concentration.
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)** - This compound can be considered as slightly more functional than that of [2-AI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-AI) and therefore more effective for performing tasks whilst under its influence.
- **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - This compound can be considered as considerably less euphoric than that of [2-AI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-AI) and therefore less effective for recreational purposes.
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Memory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
### Experience reports

Anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) include:

- [Experience:NM-2-AI (Various Dosages) - Brief Description](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience:NM-2-AI_(Various_Dosages)_-_Brief_Description)

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational NM-2-AI use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because NM-2-AI has very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried NM-2-AI within the community suggest that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , the chronic use of NM-2-AI can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of NM-2-AI develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). NM-2-AI presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of NM-2-AI all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) will have a reduced effect.

### Psychosis

Abuse of compounds within the stimulant class at high dosages for prolonged periods of time can potentially result in a stimulant psychosis that may present with a variety of symptoms (e.g., [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , or [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) ). A review on treatment for amphetamine, [dextroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine) , and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) abuse-induced psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. The same review asserts that, based upon at least one trial, [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - NM-2-AI can be potentially dangerous in combination with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) as it can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with NM-2-AI should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - NM-2-AI may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - The neurotoxic effects of MDMA may be increased when combined with [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and other stimulants.

- **[MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs)** - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , and some [antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressants) .
- **[Cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine)** - This combination may increase strain on the heart.

## Legal status

NM-2-AI is currently believed to be a grey area compound within most parts of the world. This means that it is not known to be specifically illegal within any country but people may still be charged for its possession under certain circumstances such as under analogue laws and with intent to sell or consume.

- **Germany** : NM-2-AI is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of November 26, 2016. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.
- **Switzerland** : NM-2-AI is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis E.
- **United Kingdom** : It is illegal to produce, supply, or import this drug under the Psychoactive Substance Act, which came into effect on May 26th, 2016.

NM-2-AI, or NM2AI, also known as N-methyl-2-aminoindane, is a stimulant of the 2-aminoindane family that has been sold online as a designer drug. It is a rigid analogue of methamphetamine. NM-2-AI acts as a selective norepinephrine releasing agent, but also has affinity for several monoamine receptors.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

NM-2-AI acts as a highly selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and releasing agent in vitro and does not release serotonin or dopamine even at very high concentrations (100 μM).
NM-2AI has high affinity (2.4 μM IC50) as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor but also has affinity as a TAAR1 receptor agonist (3.3 μM EC50), an Alpha-2A adrenergic receptor agonist (0.49 μM Ki) and as a binding agent at the 5-HT1A (3.6 μM Ki) and 5-HT2A (5.4 μM Ki) receptors.

### Pharmacokinetics

#### Metabolism

Scientists performed a study on NM-2-AI metabolism in silico and in vivo, in order to identify the main metabolites to be screened in the different biological samples. They performed the in silico metabolism prediction of NM-2-AI using MetaSiteTM software and subsequently verified the presence of metabolites in the blood, urine and hair of mice after NM-2-AI administration. LC-HRMS analysis identified seven main metabolites in the urine. They were identified, by their accurate masses and fragmentation patterns, as 2-aminoindane (2AI), two hydroxy-2-AI and four hydroxy-NM-2-AI; one of the hydroxy-NM-2-AI and one of the hydroxy-2-AI underwent also to conjugation. NM-2-AI and 2-AI were also detected by LC-HRMS in the hair and blood
