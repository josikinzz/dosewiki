## Subjective Experience

I was introduced to cannabis in my late teens. Back then, its primary form was
hashish, a hard but malleable oil-based resin, from which smaller pieces could be
broken off, sometimes with the aid of a lighted match to soften the compound. This
tended to be sourced from Morocco, Lebanon or perhaps Afghanistan. There wasn't
much delineation beyond this, at least in my locale.

As a non-smoker, mixing with tobacco, as was the norm, made me a little dizzy, so I
tended to hot-knife. This dubious technique employed two kitchen knives and a
plastic bottle. I would cut a small hole near the base, large enough to fit the ends of
the two knives. The ends of the knives were then heated over a flame until almost
red, and a small fragment of hash was placed between them, whilst they themselves
were positioned through the hole in the bottle (with the top of the bottle bunged).
The hash combusted into smoke as the knives were pressed together, filling the
bottle. The knives were removed, the hole was quickly plugged with the palm, and
the smoke was inhaled through the neck of the bottle.

The hit came on quickly, and was usually much deeper than that experienced via a
spliff. This wasn't elegant, probably wasn’t healthy, and most definitely wasn’t a great
idea, but from my young perspective at the time, it worked.

When I returned to cannabis many years later, the scene had changed dramatically,
for the better. High quality cannabis was now widely available in bush form, and it
was usually much stronger.

There was also a myriad of choice in terms of varieties and strains, which tended to
have exotic names. I quickly learned that these were not simply marketing or
packaging gimmicks: the differences between them were real.

The two species of the plant offer markedly different experiences. Broadly, sativa is
well known for its cerebral high, and indica for its sedating body effects. Between
these, a huge spectrum is available for the connoisseur, with each strain or hybrid
having its own characteristics. Amnesia Haze, Silver Bubble, Sputnik, White Widow,
Jack Herer, Kush, Super Lemon Haze - the list is endless. Over recent years I have
been fortunate enough to sample these and countless others.

Perhaps predictably, my favourite city for this activity has been Amsterdam, where
quality is almost assured, and the general atmosphere is tailor-made for a relaxing
and pleasant sojourn. Dreamy sunny afternoons sat smoking on the lawns in
Rembrandtplein, watching the world go by, or generally strolling and chilling in a
plethora of coffeeshops, constitute precious and golden memories.

There is also a huge canopy of cannabis experience available via the oral route.
Whilst hash cakes are famed, there are entire cookbooks dedicated to the production
of carefully crafted edibles.

As is the norm for oral-versus-smoking, the former takes longer to come-on, but lasts
longer. Variation between different cooking preparations and different varieties of
cannabis again create significantly different effects.

With so many possibilities, it is simply impossible to describe one of them and state
that it accurately reflects the cannabis experience. The diversity between strain,
preparation and RoA is far too great.

What I can state is that no-one ever died from cannabis intoxication. It is not
realistically possible to overdose. With this in mind, experimentation does at least
carry certain assurances.

In terms of harm reduction I should perhaps mention anxiety, or panic attack. Some
strains do induce this in some people, including in myself. The trick here is to use a
different variety instead, or use less. Whilst in the midst of such an experience,
however, try to relax, perhaps sing, think about pleasantries, do something rather
than just sit, and bring to mind the fact that it will soon pass. Studies have also
demonstrated that snorting or eating black pepper can help alleviate the problem.

\`\`\`
This was a very pleasant hash. It originated in Afghanistan and was procured in
Europe during the early months of 2021.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Master Kush, which originated in the Netherlands, was a popular indica dominant
strain (80%) at time or writing. I obtained this particular sample to test its
frequently cited efficacy as a sleep-aid and general relaxant.
\`\`\`

TERMINOLOGY: CANNABIS
Cannabis is the formal botanical name for a genus of flowering plant, which includes
its two most important species, cannabis sativa and cannabis indica. The terminology
surrounding this, however, has taken a life of its own, with the psychoactive parts of
the plant being referred to by a never ending list of terms, including cannabis,
marijuana, pot, ganga, green, mary jane, grass, and weed.

Another word sometimes used is skunk, the meaning of which varies depending upon
location and context. In the US this tends to refer to certain strong smelling strains
(with reference to the mammal of the same name). In the UK, the media have
frequently used the term generically, to describe all THC-strong strains, a misuse of
the word which has been widely adopted. Notwithstanding this, skunk was and is an
independent strain in its own right, variants of which are still available, and popular.

TERMINOLOGY: HASH & DABS
Wikipedia describes hashish (or hash) rather cumbersomely as "an extracted
cannabis product composed of compressed or purified preparations of stalked resin
glands, called trichomes, from the plant". These words basically mean that the
trichomes from the flower-tops of the plant are collected and compressed/purified,
with the resultant material yielding a higher concentration of psychoactive
chemicals. Collection is usually performed by sifting or rubbing/scraping (Indian
sub-continent), making it solid or resinous.

Finally, the most recently emerged form of cannabis goes by the name of dabs. These
are concentrated (thus stronger) doses of cannabis, created by extracting THC (and
other cannabinoids) via a process involving a solvent, such as butane. The oily
substance produced via this technique tends to be vaporised or smoked (dabbing),
and is known by a variety of terms, including BHO (butane hash oil), shatter, wax,
honey oil, budder and of course, dabs.

TERMINOLOGY: JOINTS v BLUNTS v SPLIFFS
Whilst to some degree there is regional variation in the broad meaning of these
words, the following generally holds true in the UK, US, and most western societies.

\`\`\`
A joint contains only cannabis. It is usually wrapped in normal cigarette
paper, but can also be rolled with hemp or other material. More often than not
the finished article is relatively small, reflecting the size of the standard paper.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
A blunt again contains only cannabis, but is wrapped in tobacco leaf or in
tobacco paper. As a result, it is usually significantly larger than a joint.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
A spliff is the same as a joint, but contains a mix of tobacco and cannabis.
\`\`\`
Whilst I have long understood these differences, I do have to confess that I have not
always found smoking to be as straightforward as most. Fortunately, a chap by the
name of Bob Marley eventually lent a metaphorical hand (see later).

EDIBLES: BHANG LASSI
Whilst my trip to sample bhang lassi didn’t go according to plan, it perhaps serves as
a cautionary note regarding complacency with respect to edibles. With the best of
intentions, and with significant experience, I made a number of wholly avoidable
errors...

Lost In Varanasi
Within any study of the historical use of cannabis an Indian preparation known as
bhang will be prominently listed. As an intrinsic part of the ancient Hindu tradition
it has been used in food and drink dating back to at least 1000 BC.

The epicentre of its spiritual use is widely considered to be Varanasi. Sitting on the
banks of the Ganges this is a place of spectacular classical beauty and for many
westerners, a culture shock; a step back in time.

To this day bhang is openly available there, being sold through lassi shops as bhang
lassi, a smooth and creamy milk-shake type drink. Prior to embarkation, I had
identified three particular dispensaries, and of these, fate delivered me to The Green
Lassi Shop shortly after 12 noon on a warm balmy afternoon.

It was small, almost tucked away, but sitting on a busy street. Approaching the
counter I specifically asked for bhang lassi light: I didn’t really want to find myself
entirely out of mind, as the day was still young.

In truth my expectations were not particularly high. During the 10 year period in
which I wrote this book, it is fair to say that I consumed my fair share of cannabis
edibles. I therefore approached this expedition with what turned out to be an entirely
misplaced degree of complacency.

Let The Stoning Commence
The owner prepared the drink, pouring a heavy green fluid into the milky white
contents of an earth coloured bowl. Plopping a dollop of cream on top he then
handed it over, and I parted with a grand total of 150 rupees (about £1.50, or \$2).

There was no interior to this place, just a bench in front of the counter, and he
indicated that I should face inwards whilst drinking. A couple of others were milling
around doing the same, but I sat down on the bench itself.

The taste was smooth and pleasant, and not cannabis-like at all. I sipped slowly,
taking a few photographs as I relaxed. Finishing off, I dropped the empty bowl into
the bin and continued my walk around the noisy, bustling and typically colourful
Indian streets.

For perhaps the best part of an hour this remained a pleasant stroll. A mild buzz was
emerging, and I slipped in and out of a gentle cannabis ambience. Soon, however, a
somewhat sinister edge began to manifest with almost every passing thought.

From Groovy To Gruesome
Recognising the potential for a difficult ride I headed back to the ghats, by the water,
where I hoped for some relative quiet. On arrival I encountered a Hindu burial
ceremony, which under normal circumstances would have been a fascinating
spectacle to witness. I edged around the periphery and found an inconspicuous place
to sit and contemplate.

Although it now seems obvious, watching bodies being burned in my deteriorating
condition was not the best idea. As might be expected, it was an extremely intense
experience, but one which was increasingly disturbing to my stoned mind. Soon it
was full-on gruesome.

The Journey From Hell
Eventually I decided that I had to make an exit and head for the tranquillity of my
hotel bedroom. This was easier said than done. The hotel was 40 minutes away, via
the only tenable form of transport, tuk-tuk. I didn’t relish the journey but had little
choice, so rejecting an offer from a driver who appeared to be about 12 years old I
grabbed a more mature sensible looking chap. So began the journey from hell.

My normal contented acceptance of the craziness of Indian roads quickly evaporated.
This was traumatic. With traffic attacking at speed from every direction, the noise
and bedlam was now completely off the scale. I was literally hanging on with white
knuckles, as the vehicle ducked and weaved. The drama seemed to continue forever,

as I sought and failed to recognise anything which might indicate that I was close to
base. When would it end? Would I survive it? Had I really done it this time?

Throughout this ordeal my mouth was so dry that I could hardly speak. I desperately
needed water, but even more acutely I needed this horror show to stop. Eventually,
after an eternity, it did.

Sanctuary & Slumber
I had survived, and I reached the sanctuary of my room with a feeling of almost
overwhelming relief. I glugged a bottle of water, turned on the TV, lay on the bed,
and reflected upon my folly. Still anxious, and seeking refuge through slumber, I
closed my eyes and drifted.

I occasionally awoke, again with a parched dry mouth, to view the Indian version of
MTV, which was astonishingly raunchy. This was India, and I couldn’t comprehend
how moves which would not beat the censor’s cut in the US or UK were apparently
routine here.

Some hours later I began to emerge from the morass and managed to eat a hearty
vegetarian meal before bedtime proper. I slept like a log.

In the morning I was back to my usual self, albeit with a bit of heady strangeness. I
felt a little drained, but generally sober, and was good to go again. I headed back to
the ghats, this time as a regular tourist.

Lesson Learned
Clearly, the cannabis strain itself was not entirely one for me. The mix of THC and
CBD is of course a defining factor of the cannabis experience, and under normal
circumstances I am able to select a strain which will deliver what I am looking for.
Here, this luxury was absent, and I had to take what was available. This was clearly
high in THC and a high dose, creating the anxious edge which persisted throughout.

One thought that occurred after the event was: if this was lassi light, what on earth
must the full-Monty be like? Perhaps the guy at the shop had misunderstood and
served a heavy version, but regardless, this was an accident waiting to happen.

If you are going to bhang lassi anytime soon, take it easy. Start low, and double
check that you are really starting low. Equally, be very aware of your set and setting,
taking full cognisance of where you are. Make sure that a safe haven is in close
proximity, and always be ready to remind yourself that you are under the influence of
a drug and that it will end in due course.

Perhaps my story serves as an example of how not to do it, but I am profoundly
aware that this is provided in Varanasi to aid a spiritual journey, rather than to pique
the curiosity of an ageing European psychonaut.

Yes, I would do it again, as this could have been a rich and rewarding experience, but
next time I would learn from these mistakes. Or perhaps I would adhere to the
motto: when in India don’t necessarily do as the Indians do.

A TRICK OF THE TRADE
A tour of Bob Marley’s house and mausoleum in Jamaica was an opportunity I
couldn’t possibly refuse. Despite the hair-raising ride to the centre of the country, via
elevated single track roads, it was an outstanding experience.

Outside the gate, members of the group were able to procure Jamaica’s finest,
including edibles, and the famed and quite exquisite sensimilla, which I simply
couldn’t resist.

For one young woman, however, the strong cannabis, combined with the high
altitude, was too much, and she collapsed with a crash behind me. She was helped
away by the guide, Robert. It was when he returned that he was handed an exhibit,
which she had landed upon and destroyed.

His response was memorable: “Fck!” He then immediately bust into hysterical
laughter. Everyone else followed his lead.

At the end of the tour, I finally learned how to stop my weed dropping out of the end
of a joint when smoking it pure, courtesy of the bus driver, Roy.

He had obviously watched my unsuccessful efforts to keep my big fat one intact as I
puffed furiously at it, and took pity. The trick is to lightly wet the paper at the
business-end before lighting up, so that it doesn’t burn away more quickly than the
contents.

I guess that this is pretty obvious, but after so many years of frustration, wasted
weed, and embarrassment, I finally got there. D'oh!

AN ANECDOTAL TALE (TWO FACES OF CANNABIS)
A common effect of cannabis is to relax, to remove those sharp edges, and to create a
bubble of anaesthetised comfort and cosiness. It can make you chilled and friendly.

So it was when I left the Green House coffeeshop in Amsterdam. Fatally, I also had
my camera to hand.

Between the coffeeshop and the canal, to the left, was a public urinal. This was
particularly prominent, due to the fact that it was a double, designed to enable two
men to urinate at the same time, one at each end.

As these are not a common sight back in the UK, I took a few photos, and moved
inside for a couple of interior shots. Mission accomplished, I then moved to use the
facility for its intended purpose.

At this point, a young man appeared in the doorway. Somewhat stoned, I explained
to him that “I’ve been taking a few photographs” and, “There’s room for two in
here”.

His face reacted with an expression of horror. He turned around, and beat a hasty
retreat.

It then occurred to me how he must have interpreted my friendly greeting, on the
edge of the red light district, in the dark of the evening, in the doorway of a urinal.

Another occasional effect of cannabis suddenly took hold. This was anxiety and
paranoia, as I envisioned him reporting me to the local police for some sort of
solicitation in a men’s lavatory. I shuddered at the prospect of the subsequent public
shaming.

My face must have reacted with the same horror as my unfortunate victim, and it was
my turn to beat a hasty retreat.

THE FUTURE: CHOICE, INNOVATION & SOPHISTICATION
I visited California in February 2022, less than six years after cannabis was first
made legal for recreational use there. As expected I found a flourishing and open
retail market, embracing the sort of innovation and professionalism which might be
expected for high-end consumer products generally.

Stores and dispensaries covered a wide spectrum of approaches, from the relaxed
and browsable shop space, to the pharmaceutical-like consultation and appointment
practice. Hotel delivery was also an option.

The product range was immense, covering an outrageous choice of edible types,
countless vaping and smoking options, and even items such as sexual lubricants and
menopausal treatments.

The contrast with the shady back street dealing forced upon so many citizens of the
world could hardly have been more striking.

DESCRIPTION #
 
[Cannabis Images](https://erowid.org/cannabis_images.shtml)
 
Cannabis is a leafy plant which grows wild in many of the tropic and temperate areas of the world. It is cultivated both indoors and out for the production of its flowering tops. The most commonly used form of cannabis are the leaves and flowering tops (buds) which may be either smoked or eaten; It also comes in a more concentrated resinous form called hashish, and as a sticky black liquid called hash oil. There are three distinct species of cannabis: Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica, and Cannabis ruderalis, though there is some argument as to whether these should be considered varieties rather than species. Most recreationally used cannabis is the result of interbreeding between these three types. The term 'hemp' is generally used to describe low-thc varieties of cannabis which are grown for industrial uses. 
 
[ [Main Cannabis Vault](https://erowid.org/cannabis.shtml) ]
 
[Dose](https://erowid.org/cannabis_dose.shtml) #
 
The strength of cannabis varies greatly from one variety to another. Some, known as 'one-hit-shit', requires only a single lung-full to reach full effects while other varieties require many hits to achieve the same effects. Additionally, the amount that one individual likes to smoke can be many times what another prefers. Generally, 1/8 ounce (3.5 g) of mid-quality bud could get around 20-30 people reasonably high.
 
Price #
 
Cannabis is sold on the street for anywhere between \$25 - \$150 per 1/4 ounce depending on quality and location. In the U.S., prices are generally \$30-\$60 for 1/4 ounce of lower quality and \$60-\$120 for 1/4 ounce of high quality bud. Prices drop quickly as quantity goes up, with prices for one pound of the lowest quality cannabis going from 0 (leaves are sometimes given away during harvest) to \$200 and good quality buds from \$1200 - \$2000 per pound.
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/cannabis_law.shtml) #
 
The legal status of cannabis is currently shifting around the world. Although the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances prohibits cannabis and requires counties to prohibit its use and sale, individual US states and some countries have started legalizing cannabis. As of August 2015, Cannabis has been nationally legalized in Uruguay (2013) and Jamaica (2015). In contradiction of federal law (as of May 2019), ten American states have legalized the recreational use of cannabis; Alaska, Oregon, Colorado, Washington, California, Nevada, Vermont, Massachusetts, Vermont, and Rhode Island. 
 
 Prescription and quasi-prescription medical use of cannabis is increasingly legally recognized, with individual cities, states, and countries exploring approved medical use.
 
[Chemistry](https://erowid.org/cannabis_chemistry.shtml) #
 
The active ingredients in cannabis are called cannabinoids. There are many cannabinoids synthesized by the plant including tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabinol, cannabidiol, cannabinolidic acid, cannabigerol, and cannabichromene. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol is thought to be responsible for most of the psychoactive effects of cannabis and is the active ingredient in synthetic thc pills such as marinol.
 
Pharmacology #
 
Pharmacology Summary Needed.
 
Production #
 
Cannabis plants do grow wild in many parts of the world, but the quality of wild specimens ('ditch-weed') is generally quite low. Most cannabis is cultivated intentionally and can be grown either indoors or out.
 
[History](https://erowid.org/cannabis_timeline.php) #
 
The cannabis plant has been used both medicinally and recreationally for thousands of years. It wasn't until the early 19th century that the use of cannabis as a psychoactive spread from China and the Middle East to the population of Europe and then to America in the middle of the century. Cannabis was made illegal in the U.S. in 1937 and has continued to be a popular recreational substance since that time.
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
The Substance:
 
Cannabis; Marijuana; Marihuana; Pot; Dope; Weed; Grass; Bud; Ganja; Mary Jane; Doobie; Hashish; Hash; Bhang.
 
The Experience:
 
Stoned; High.
 
[EFFECTS](https://erowid.org/cannabis_effects.shtml) #
 
The primary effects sought by those using cannabis recreationally are euphoria, relaxation, and changes in perception. Effects vary depending on dosage, with effects at low doses including a sense of well-being, mild enhancement of senses (smell, taste, hearing), subtle changes in thought and expression, talkativeness, giggling, increased appreciation of music, increased appetite, and mild closed-eye visuals. At higher doses, visuals may become more prominent, sense of time is altered, attention span and memory are frequently affected, and thought processes and mental perception may be significantly altered.
 
Onset #
 
When smoked, the effects of cannabis begin almost immediately. When eaten the effects can take 1 to 2 hours to manifest, based primarily on how much food is in the stomach.
 
Duration #
 
The effects of smoked cannabis peak after about 20 minutes and last for 1-2 hours. When eaten, the effects will peak more slowly and primary effects may last for 3-4 hours.
 
Visual Effects #
 
While most people do not experience a strong visual component to the cannabis experience, some do and some particular varieties of cannabis as well as higher doses are more likely to produce this effect.
 
PROBLEMS #
 
Negative effects can include paranoia, dry mouth, respiratory problems and nervousness/racing heart. Other effects may be negative or inconvenient in certain settings or situations including reduced ability to concentrate, impaired memory, tiredness, and confusion. Side effects tend to increase with lifetime use: as users age, they often report the anxiety-producing and uncomfortable effects increase and the euphoria decreases.
 
Contraindications #
 
Avoid Driving - While there has been little formal study into the effects of cannabis on driving, it is generally a good idea to avoid driving while under the influence of **any** psychoactive or intoxicating substance. Several studies have shown that drivers who use alcohol and cannabis in combination are far less capable than when taking either substance alone. Some studies have shown that cannabis causes impairment in driving performance, but that users often are aware of the impairment and compensate by driving more carefully.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
Regular use of cannabis can lead to psychological habituation for some people making it difficult for them to quit. Studies have estimated that between 5 and 10% of those who try smoking cannabis will become daily users sometime during their life, but most of these smokers will have given up the habit by age 30 and few remain daily smokers after age 40. Most people do not experience signs of physical addiction, but with regular daily use, mild to medium withdrawal symptoms usually occur for less than a week, but can extend for as long as 6 weeks.
 
Long Term Health Problems #
 
The most common negative health impact of regular cannabis smoking are lung and throat problems including: coughing, increased frequency of throat and lung infections, and reduced lung capacity. There are concerns about possible long term carcinogenic (cancer causing) effects of cannabis smoking, but the results are still somewhat controversial. It can be safely said, however, that health risks increase with frequency and duration of smoking anything.
 
Risk of Death #
 
There are no confirmed, published death reports from cannabis-only poisoning. Especially given the wide use of cannabis, it appears that fatal reactions are approximately unheard of. There are a small number of people who report serious cannabis allergies which cause unexpectedly intense reactions, throat & lung irritation, etc.
 
Heart Issues #
 
Because cannabis increases heart rate, it could potentially increase risks of heart problems in those at risk of heart disease. One study found that cannabis use increased the risk of heart attack in men over 40, but its findings were weak and based on a very small number of individuals. In a large study of 65,000 individuals in California [by Sidney et al in 1997](https://erowid.org/references/journal/1997_sidney_amjpubhealth_1/1997_sidney_amjpubhealth_1_text.shtml) , cannabis was not found to increase mortality rates among users under 50.
 
Mental Illness #
 
For those with schizophrenia, paranoia, or symptoms of psychosis, the use of cannabis, alcohol, and other recreational drugs can contribute to worsening symptoms and a decline in normal functioning. It is less clear whether cannabis causes asymptomatic--or otherwise healthy--people more than temporary paranoia and anxiety, though several major studies have documented an association between the use of cannabis by young people and later diagnosis of psychotic disorders. Those with a family history of psychotic disorders or who are otherwise predisposed to mental illness may be at increased risk of problematic mental health issues if they use cannabis.

Duration is strongly affected by dose, tolerance, and individual reaction. Those who use cannabis regularly experience a shorter duration than those who do not. Note that most cannabis users smoke multiple times in a single session and this extends the duration. 
 
 For oral consumption, duration is complicated by stomach contents and delivery mechanism. Taking THC-capsules on an empty stomach lasts much shorter than eating THC-containing cookies or food, which take hours to fully digest. 
 
 There has been some research into the pharmacokinetics of THC (how it moves through and is processed by the body). See [Grotenhermen's research](https://erowid.org/references/refs.php?A=View&ID=6617) , which showed that the peak THC concentration after smoking was between 15-30 minutes and sloped down for 1-2 hours. He also showed that oral consumption caused the THC levels to peak between 2 and 4 hours and last for 4 to 8 hours.

DESCRIPTION #
 
The primary effects sought by those using cannabis recreationally are euphoria, relaxation, and changes in perception. Effects vary depending on dosage, with effects at low doses including a sense of well-being, mild enhancement of senses (smell, taste, hearing), subtle changes in thought and expression, talkativeness, giggling, increased appreciation of music, increased appetite, and mild closed-eye visuals. At higher doses, sense of time is altered, attention span and memory are frequently affected, and thought processes and mental perception may be significantly altered. 
 
 One of the most common comments about cannabis is that it enhances the appreciation of sensory experiences without substantially changing the perceptual experience. Many people attribute their love of music, appreciation for new forms of music, and ability to play instruments to the use of cannabis. 
 
 At overly high doses, the effects are often likened to other psychedelics and panic and dysphoria (bad mood) are more common. High doses, especially when taken orally, can sometimes result in difficult experiences and trips to the emergency room in response to racing heart, extreme confusion, short-term memory loss, and panic. After high-dose experiences, especially among those who are not regular users, after effects can last 1-2 days. 
 
 Paradoxically, although cannabis is normally considered a relaxant / depressant, its effects are stimulating in a substantial portion of those who use it. While some people use it to help them sleep, others cannot sleep for 3-6 hours after their last smoke.

Cannabis & Marinol Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
SMOKED CANNABIS
 Cannabis dosage is fairly easy to manage. A good method for determining your dose is to smoke a small amount (a quarter to two "hits"), wait 5-15 minutes, repeat as desired. The strength of cannabis products increased dramatically between 2000 and 2016. When considering waxes, oils, and other high potency extracts, always start smoking a tiny hit. For sensitive people, a mouth full of smoke from a high potency oil is enough to become confusingly stoned. 
 
 A single intake of smoke from a pipe, water pipe, or joint is generally called a hit. An average size hit from a pipe or water pipe weighs somewhere on the order of 1/20th of a gram. With reasonably high potency Cannabis buds, a small number of hits (1-3) is generally enough. The lower the potency the more hits people will need to achieve the desired effects. 
 
 Below is a chart with very approximate dosages for dry, smoked, high potency cannabis. These numbers will vary greatly depending on individual reaction, potency, and smoking method. Generally, brown leafy cannabis is not as strong as green, gold, purple sticky buds. There does exist "One Hit Shit" that can surprise even the veteran smoker with it's strength. Pay attention to your body's reaction when you first try a new type or a new smoking method, and be careful when introducing others to cannabis. Everyone reacts differently to different doses.

NOTE: In cancer treatments, cannabis and THC are used primarily to treat and reduce symptoms from cancer and cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy. After some confusion, we wanted to note that the use of THC as a medicine during chemotherapy is not usually prescribed for any anti-cancer effect of cannabis itself. THC is prescribed in the US as an anti-nausea and appetite stimulating agent. In California and some other US states, THC and raw cannabis can legally be prescribed for any indication and there are reports of cannabinoids being prescribed as a direct anti-cancer agent. The research evidence does not yet support human use of cannabis as a direct anti-cancer medicine, though *in vitro* (in petri dishes) cannabinoids do show some positive medical effects. Some of the confusion in this area is that a great deal of research has been dedicated to showing cannabis *causes* cancer, however the research failed to validate that theory. One of the explanations for the lack of cancer-causing action of smoked cannabis is that cannabinoids have some anti-cancer effect on lung cells that reduce or block the cancerous effects of the heated chemicals in burned plant material.

Cannabis (Marijuana)
 
Health
 
by Erowid
 
NOTES #
 
Use of cannabis is relatively safe, compared to many recreational psychoactives. There are no confirmed deaths caused by cannabis alone, although deaths can and do result from injuries sustained while intoxicated. Especially when combined with alcohol, cannabis has been shown to reduce driving ability and can contribute to traffic accidents. The primary health concerns related to cannabis use are lung and airway health (but not cancer), accidental injuries, reversible reductions in memory scores, and triggering of paranoid and psychotic thinking in vulnerable individuals. 
 
 It is worth noting that the first large age cohort (people who were in their teens between 1967 and 1980) of heavy, frequent cannabis smokers in the United States is only now reaching the age at which many serious health complications occur. 
 
 For many years, anti-cannabis campaigns have included the theory that the use of cannabis causally leads to use and abuse of other recreational psychoactives. This "Gateway Theory" is now considered a debunked myth, with dozens of scientific papers showing that other factors cause the correlation and cannabis use itself does not cause the use of other drugs. Even the DEA has abandoned this theory. 1,2,3,4 
 
 The political climate around cannabis and other recreational psychoactive substances makes it complicated to find balanced opinions about its safety and risks. Prohibitionist organizations and individuals are more likely to emphasize risks associated with heavy use and those who believe cannabis should be legalized focus on the much lower risks associated with occasional use. 5
 
DEATHS #
 
Cannabis use does not, by itself, cause death. Deaths can result from accidental injuries (such as car accidents). Extreme panic reactions, especially after oral consumption of high dose cannabis, have resulted in many people being briefly hospitalized until they come down, but no deaths from anxiety reactions have been reported.
 
CAUTIONS #
 
- Dramatic Changes in Thinking. Changes to thought processes, while among the primary reasons why people choose to use cannabis, can also impair judgement.
- Respiratory Ailments. Frequent smoking of cannabis can lead to respiratory ailments, including COPD, associated with smoke inhalation. The most common negative health impact of regular cannabis smoking are lung and throat problems including: coughing, increased frequency of throat and lung infections, and reduced lung capacity. 
 
 Although cannabis smokers have used bongs/water pipes to reduce the impact on their lungs, a 1995 study 6 suggests that use of water pipe does not lower the overall ratio of particulate matter to THC and may be counterproductive. In other words, it lowers the particulate matter, but it also lowers the amount of THC, and may cause users to simply smoke more material. Vaporizers are reported to reduce the lung impact of 'smoking' cannabis. 
 
 A large, well-designed study of tens of thousands of hospital patients found that cannabis use does not cause cancers of the airway and lungs. 7,8,9,10 
 In 2013, a comprehensive review of all studies on regular use of cannabis and lung health and found that although regular cannabis use was associated with airway irritation and increased bronchitis, it is not associated with with the development of lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, or bullous lung disease. The author, Donald Tashkin writes: 
"[H]abitual use of marijuana alone does not appear to lead to significant abnormalities in lung function [...] [F]indings from a limited number of well-designed epidemiological studies do not suggest an increased risk of either lung or upper airway cancer from light or moderate use. Overall, the risks of pulmonary complications of regular use of marijuana appear to be relatively small and far lower than those of tobacco smoking." (Tashkin 2013) 13
- Short-Term Memory Impairment. Cannabis intoxication is known to cause memory impairment during the period of acute effects, but the reduced ability to store and recall memories can linger for days and affect cognitive or academic test scores.
- Panic and Anxiety Attacks. Some people may experience panic attacks (including extreme feelings of dread, accelerated heart rate, feeling as if they're going to die) from smoking cannabis. [See the [Psychedelic Crisis FAQ](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/faqs/psychedelic_crisis_faq.shtml) for information about such an occurrence.]
- Increased Heart Rate. Cannabis use causes an increase in heart rate in many users, usually lasting for the period of intoxication and slowing back down as the cognitive effects wane.
- Cannabis and Mental Health. Cannabis use has been implicated in triggering psychosis and other mental health problems. Although these issues are complex and (as of 2015) still an active area of research, a 2011 report by the FDA in their role as US Department of Health and Human Services advisors to the DEA found no clear causal linkage between cannabis use and psychotic mental disorders. 10,11,12
- Cannabis and Brain Area Shrinkage In the 2000s, a new risk was suggested by some researchers that using cannabis by teenagers could cause reductions in the volumes/sizes of certain important brain areas. These were not experimental studies, but instead used brain scans of living humans. Research published in [2015 by Weiland et al.](https://erowid.org/references/8802) found no differences in those brain areas in a tightly controlled study.
- Cannabis and Intelligence / IQ Loss (mostly myth) In 2016, it appears that the National Insitute on Drug Abuse is finally beginning to admit that cannabis does **not** cause reductions in IQ and does not damage intelligence directly. There has been persistent evidence that heavy cannabis use during the teens was associated with lower performance on some academic or intelligence tests, but no studies were able to actually demonstrate a causal link. A [paper in 2016 by Jackson et al.](https://erowid.org/references/9105) using matched twins and studied over a decade demonstrated that no causal hypothesis fit the data. But what the research does seem to suggest is that heavy use of cannabis during high school can reduce interest in performing well in school and thus is associated with lower scores on tests such as increased vocabulary. 15
- Cannabis Interactions. Cannabis is not known to have negative health interactions with many other drugs, but some report unpleasant effects when combined with alcohol or venlafaxine (Effexor). See [Venlafaxine Interactions](https://erowid.org/pharms/venlafaxine/venlafaxine_interactions.shtml) .
 
BENEFITS #
 
- Medical Uses. Cannabis has many possible medical uses. Symptom relief is claimed for ailments such as cancer, AIDS wasting syndrome, and glaucoma. Patients have found that the appetite-stimulating and anti-nausea properties of cannabis can help to mitigate the drastic weight loss and weakness from wasting syndrome and the nausea of cancer chemotherapy, and help them to regain weight. Cannabis reportedly helps glaucoma patients by reducing ocular pressure, which can cause damage to the eye. 
 
 Cannabis and cannabinoids have repeatedly been found to be effective at treating chronic pain, neuropathic pain, and spacicity associated with multiple sclerosis.

Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Cannabis**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Scheduled
- SCHEDULE: Schedule I
- CLASSIFICATION: Hallucinogen
- MOVEMENT: Likely Federally Legalized before 2020
 
The Cannabis plant (listed as "Marihuana") and its major active chemicals including delta-9-THC (listed as "Tetrahydrocannabinols") are Schedule I in the United States. This means they are federally illegal to buy, possess, cultivate, synthesize, or distribute (sell, trade or give) in all forms (cannabis plants, extracts, hash, hash oil, THC, wax, etc.). In one of the incoherent curiosities of the current Controlled Substances Act, a specific synthetic THC (dronabinol; Marinol) is Schedule III. This means THC is both without a "currently accepted medical use" and has a fully FDA-approved medical use. 
 
 Practically, simple possession of small amounts is almost never prosecuted federally. Arrests and punishments for cannabis-related offenses are based on state and local law. For state-by-state laws, see below . 
 
 In 2015, the legal status of cannabis in the United States is rapidly changing towards legalization for recreational and medical use. Several states have already set up legal regulatory systems to allow for the growing and distribution of cannabis inside their borders. These remain in a legal gray area with regard to federal law, and many major U.S. politicians are now saying they will support removal of cannabis from Schedule I, allowing states to choose its legal status. Most non-idealogical expert observers believe that cannabis is well on its way to becoming fully legalized and regulated in most U.S. states in the next decade. 
 
 **History of US Cannabis Law** 
 The federal scheduling of Cannabis was disputed in 1988 by Judge Francis Young, an administrative law judge for the DEA, who recommended that marijuana be reclassified as schedule II on the grounds that if a respectable minority of doctors endorse it, then it has a "currently accepted medical use". [Full text of Judge Young's ruling]](https://erowid.org/cannabis_law1.shtml) 
 
 **Historical Laws** 
 [Text of the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937](http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/taxact/mjtaxact.htm) 
 [The history of the Marihuana Tax Act](http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/taxact/taxact.htm) 
 
 **[MEDICAL MARIJUANA](https://erowid.org/cannabis_medical.shtml)** 
 Cannabis has many reported and demonstrated medical uses. Its most active component (THC) is an approved drug in the United States and the second most active drug in the plant, Cannabidiol (CBD), is heading towards FDA approval for specific indications. Starting in 1975, after losing a court case, the US government was forced to provide a small number of people with medical cannabis based on "medical necessity". Although closed to new applicants in 1992, it is another example of the confusing question of cannabis's medical value. The US Congress has defined through legislation that it has no medical use, but that has never been fully true, and is now just a bizarre historical error encoded into law, policy, and public educational programs. As of November 2015, 23 states and Washington DC have legalized cannabis for medical use.

Alaska #
 
In November 2014, Alaska passed a voter initiative legalizing the recreational use of cannabis for those 21 and older. The new law allows possession up to one ounce of cannabis and grow up to six plants. It creates a legal market and legalizes cannabis-related paraphernalia. See [http://ballotpedia.org/Alaska_Marijuana_Legalization,_Ballot_Measure_2_%282014%29](http://ballotpedia.org/Alaska_Marijuana_Legalization,_Ballot_Measure_2_%282014%29) . Previously, the Alaska Supreme Court and lower courts had ruled that personal possession of cannabis was protected by state constitution's privacy clause. As recently as Sep 14, 2004, the AK Supreme Court refused to overturn a unanimous Appellate Court decision that police were not allowed to enter a home simply based on smelling cannabis smoke outside. See [Pot vs Privacy, Oct 2003](http://abcnews.go.com/sections/us/GoodMorningAmerica/alaska_marijuana031014.html) and [Alaska Supreme Court chooses privacy over pot, Sep 2004](http://www.talkaboutsupport.com/group/alt.support.mult-sclerosis/messages/359885.html) and [Eric Sterling's Response](https://erowid.org/cannabis_law5.shtml) . The Alaska Legislature passed a law banning cannabis, but a judge struck down the law in July 2006: [Judge rules against Alaska marijuana ban law](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003118645_webpot10.html) , Jul 2006, AP.

California #
 
Legalized for possession in November 2016 up to one ounce per person, although the law is not as clear as it should be. Cannabis is nearly legal for any purpose with the caveat that smoking **anything** indoors is banned with very few exceptions. It is unlikely that any sales will be legally allowed prior to 2018. The legalization initiative in 2016 was driven largely by commercial interests that will favor large distributors and growers as small production is outlawed over the next few years. 
 
 Prior to 2016, the penalty for possession had been reduced to a non-arrestable \$100 ticket for under 1 ounce (28.5 grams) on Oct 1, 2010. Previously, possession of one ounce (28.5 grams) or less was treated as a misdeameanor; the new law reduces the penalty for simple possession of an ounce or less of cannabis to an infraction, with a maximum fine of \$100. [2010 SB 1449](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/sen/sb_1401-1450/sb_1449_bill_20100405_amended_sen_v98.html) . Possession of "Concentrated cannabis" products are still subject to penalties including imprisonment. 
 
 The California Supreme Court has upheld the California Medical Marijuana law (state Prop 215, [July 19, 2002](https://erowid.org/cannabis_law4.shtml) ). In January 2008, a San Francisco Appeals court ruled that police may not enter and search a home without a warrant simply because they see someone inside smoking cannabis. 
 
"The possession and cultivation of marijuana is no more criminal -- so long as (the law's) conditions are satisfied -- than the possession and acquisition of any prescription drug with a physician's prescription." CA Chief Justice Ronald George.
 
Colorado #
 
Recreational and medical cannabis are legal in Colorado as of early 2014 for those 21 and older. Individuals are allowed to grow plants and regulated businesses can grow and sell cannabis, its concentrates, and orally ingestible food-type preparations. Use in public is outlawed. 
 
 On Nov 6, 2012, the state of Colorado passed a voter initiative that legalized growing, distribution, and possession, while still outlawing public use. See [http://www.regulatemarijuana.org/](http://www.regulatemarijuana.org/) . City of Denver votes to legalize possession of up to an ounce of cannabis. Although police will still enforce Colorado state law, the city population has clearly expressed that they are disatisfied with the state laws.

Oregon #
 
Cannabis for recreational use is legal in Oregon, and Oregon was one of the first states to permit medical use. Oregon voters passed a cannabis legalization initiative in November 2014 that would allow possession and growing of cannabis and create a legal market for sale and purchase. The law took effect on July 1, 2015. Households can have up to four live plants.

Belgium #
 
No amount of cannabis is legal to possess in Belgium, however possession of up to 3g of cannabis by adults, for personal use, is tolerated. It is also said that 1 female plant is tolerated. We have been told that if the possession meets the informal 'personal use' criteria, the police most often register the offense anonymously (do not record the individual's name) and the state will not prosecute. The criteria for this include: possession of an amount that is consumable in 24 hours (usually 3 grams or less), possession of leaf or bud and not oil or other processed product which are less tolerated; that the use is not around minors or while driving; and other factors that might indicate 'problematic use'. In practice, almost all non-problematic personal users will be registered anonymously. The criteria are described in Het Staatsblad published on June 2, 2003: [http://www.staatsbladclip.be/wetten/2003/06/02/wet-2003009496.html](http://www.staatsbladclip.be/wetten/2003/06/02/wet-2003009496.html) and [http://www.staatsbladclip.be/wetten/2003/06/02/wet-2003009479.html](http://www.staatsbladclip.be/wetten/2003/06/02/wet-2003009479.html) . Erowid has also been told that a new law to allow for medical use of cannabis has lead the police to be more forgiving about possession of small amounts of non-medicinal cannabis. We have been told that there is no legal way to buy or import cannabis or its seeds. See [ejustice.just.fgov.be (French only)](http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi/api2.pl?lg=fr&pd=2004-10-28&numac=2004203248) . (thanks Cholo, CG, FA.) (last updated Aug 2006)

Cannabis possession is criminal, but is not stricly enforced. Cannabis sativa is listed as a controlled substance, making the plant and all of its parts illegal to cultivate, distribute, or possess. Other cannabis species do not appear to be listed, though THC is separately scheduled. Presumably any THC-containing plant is illegal by extension. We have been told that as of 2007 cannabis prohibition is not vigorously enforced. (thanks P) (last updated Nov 14, 2015)

Canada #
 
As of January 2019, Cannabis has been effectively legalized in Canada, though the illegal ('black') markets have continued to thrive. In most places in Canada, it is now legal to smoke, use, and buy cannabis at age 18. There are a lot of complex details, but in most cases it is still illegal to grow cannabis without a license, though this is not enforces in most of the western states. There are further medical laws that allow prescription cannabis and cannabinoids in Canada, though these generally require prescription by medical personnel.

 Although cannabis is technically illegal to possess and sell in the Netherlands, the government does not prosecute individuals (over 18) who smoke cannabis. Possession of less than 5 grams or growing of less than 5 plants will not be prosecuted. Cannabis seeds are reportedly not controlled and are legal to possess and sell. Certain cafes/coffee shops are allowed to sell cannabis and hold 100 grams behind the counter and another 500 grams in the back. Paradoxically, we have received unconfirmed reports that coffee shops are not allowed to legally purchase cannabis. In March of 2003, the Dutch government changed the law to allow doctors to prescribe cannabis for medical purposes through pharmacies. [BBC Sep 2003](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3196849.stm) . 
 
 On Jan 1, 2008, Dutch police will officially be disallowed from smoking cannabis while off duty. [Dutch police complain it is their right to smoke cannabis while off-duty](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=502375&in_page_id=1811) , Dec 15 2007, DailyMail.

New Zealand #
 
Cannabis is a Class B controlled drug in New Zealand. It is illegal to cultivate, possess, or sell. (thanks CH) (last updated Nov 14, 2015)
 
Norway #
 
Recreational use, possession, and distribution of cannabis are ilelgal in Norway and no medical exception is allowed. The penalty for possession of small quantities of Cannabis (less than 15 g) is normally 3000 NOK. For more than 15 g, higher penalties apply and can include community service and jail in some cases. The Norwegian police does not punish use, possession and distribution of Marijuana as harshly as hashish, and hashish in Norway is often adulterated with other ingredients. (unconfirmed) (thanks S and numerous others)(last updated Nov 7 2015)
 
North Korea #
 
Technical legal status unknown, assumed to be controlled, however reports indicate that smoking cannabis is tolerated and not prosecuted. "A 2010 report by Open Radio for North Korea, an American nongovernmental organization based in Seoul, cited an anonymous North Korean source as saying that Kim Jong Un's regime does not consider marijuana to be a drug." See [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/08/marijuana-in-north-korea_n_4067341.html?utm_hp_ref=tw](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/08/marijuana-in-north-korea_n_4067341.html?utm_hp_ref=tw) .

Pakistan / Peshawar #
 
We have been told that in Peshawar and the northern parts of Pakistan, smoking Hash (Charas) is socially acceptable and even sold on an open market where the government does not intrude. One can be jailed for up to six months if they are caught with Charas in other parts of the country, but it's apparently very common to bribe the police with as little as \$5-20 to get out of an arrest. We are also told that many shops have Charas behind the counter, but only sell to known customers.

Peru #
 
According to Article 2999 in the Peruvian penal code, personal possession of small amounts individual drugs is not a crime. The list of maximum quantities include 2000mg of cocaine, 5000 mg cocaine basic paste, 8000 mg of cannabis, 2000mg of cannabis derivatives, 1000 mg of opium latex or 200mg of opium derivatives, 250mg of MDA or MDMA. See [http://howtoperu.com/2012/03/27/drugs-in-peru-laws-of-possession/](http://howtoperu.com/2012/03/27/drugs-in-peru-laws-of-possession/) . (unconfirmed) (thanks cr) (last updated Feb 26, 2013)
 
Poland #
 
Possession of cannabis is illegal in Poland. Even small amounts (1g) are not tolerated and penalties can be high. Since Jun 2005 according to the new law, a new resocialization program for drug addicts has been formed as a alternative to putting young people in prison. Cannabis is still a public enemy treated the same way as 'hard drugs'. (thanks RaN) 
 
 In 2006 an Erowid reader told us that possession of seeds is legal in Poland, and they are available through online vendors. (unconfirmed) (thanks D) (last updated Nov 2015)
 
Portugal #
 
Effective July 2001, personal use of cannabis was decriminalized by Law 30/2000 (see [text of law](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/portugal/lei30-2000.pdf) ). Possession of less than 25 g leaves and flowering tops, 5 g resin, 2.5 g oil, or 500 mg THC is not regarded as a criminal offense, though the substance is liable to be seized and the possessor can be referred to mandatory treatment. Sale, or possession of quantities greater than the personal possession limit, are criminal offenses punishable by jail time. We are told the police have a rather tolerant attitude towards cannabis consumption in major cities, and it is largely ignored. (thanks P)
 
Romania #
 
According to a contributor: "Cannabis growing, possession or selling is prohibited. Seeds have no legal status (neither legal nor illegal). If you are caught with seeds they will take them and you will receive not more than a warning. Possession of small amounts (1-3 grams) is only punishable by a small fine (~ \$150-200). For bigger quantities possession or for growing (only for personal use) you can stay 3 or 6 years in prison. If you sell cannabis you can take over 6 years in prison." (unconfirmed) (thanks EG)
 
Russia #
 
Cannabis is a prohibited drug under Russian law. We have been told that the 2003 change to decriminalize personal possession of small amounts has been rescinded, but have been unable to confirm that. Previously, in Dec 2003, personal possession of up to 20 g of cannabis was legalized (see [article](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8339.php) ). (thanks o, QBM) (Last updated Oct 14 2011)

Spain #
 
It is generally said that it is legal to keep and smoke cannabis inside one's own home with the windows closed. Spanish laws about cannabis possession are not 100% clear. Possession and use are illegal, but there may be an exception for private behavior. If someone can see or detect you using it, it is potentially a crime. Cannabis is illegal in Spain, with small amounts punishable by fine. Larger amounts, cultivation, or sale are punishable by jail terms. Cannabis seeds are legal and are commonly available for purchase. (last updated Nov 14, 2015)
 
Sweden #
 
Possession and sale of cannabis are illegal in Sweden. Possession of up to 50 g usually results in a fine, 50 to 2500 g usually leads to 2 weeks to 1 year imprisonment, more than 2.5 kg generally results in 2 years - 10 years imprisonment. (unconfirmed) (thanks KW, M, H) (Last Updated Apr 11, 2009)
 
Switzerland #
 
Since 2011, a cannabis product is not considered a controlled substance if it contains less than 1% THC. [Ordonnance sur les tableaux des stupÂŽfiants (OTStup-DFI May 30 2011)](https://www.admin.ch/opc/fr/classified-compilation/20101220/index.html) . Over 1% THC, it is considered a controlled substance; penalties for possession up to 10 grams, possession of 10g or higher, or sale are punishable by heavier fines or imprisonment. Enforcement varies by canton. [https://www.admin.ch/opc/fr/classified-compilation/19981989/index.html](https://www.admin.ch/opc/fr/classified-compilation/19981989/index.html)

United Kingom (U.K., England) #
 
Cannabis possession is a crime in the United Kingdom with no exception for medical use. Cannabis was reclassified as a [Class B](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/uk/uk_law_definitions.shtml) drug in Britain in January 2009. 
- Oct, 2008 - A draft order was proposed to return cannabis to Class B, effective Jan 26, 2009. The proposed amendment would add cannabinol, cannabinol derivatives, and cannabis resin to the statute, also under Class B. It is to be debated in Fall 2008. [Draft MDA Amendment](http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/draft/ukdsi_9780110846088_en_1) , OPSI.
- Oct 14, 2008 - Effective Jan 26 2009, possession of cannabis will result in a warning on first offense, an Ł80 fine on second offense, and possible arrest on third offense. [Telegraph UK](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/3191025/Cannabis-users-will-have-to-be-caught-three-times-before-they-are-arrested.html) .
- May 7, 2008 - Home secretary Jacqui Smith accounces intention to reclassify cannabis as Class B, subject to parliamentary approval. [BBC News](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7386889.stm) .
- Jan 2006 - Home Secretary Announces Cannabis will stay in Class C, despite controversy in 2005, but that the Home Office will seek an "overhaul" of the drug classification system. See [http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/jan/20/drugsandalcohol.immigrationpolicy](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/jan/20/drugsandalcohol.immigrationpolicy) and [Home Office News](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/100547/cannabis-reclassification-annexb.doc) .
- Jan 29, 2004 - Cannabis reclassified to Class C. [Q&A: Reclassifying Cannabis, UK Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,580574,00.html) 
 Jul 10, 2002 - [Britain Announces Moving Cannabis to Class C](http://www.guardian.co.uk/drugs/Story/0,2763,753168,00.html) (and [BBC: Cannabis Laws eased by Blunkett](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk_politics/newsid_2120000/2120116.stm) ). Most possessions would be given only a warning, but the plan could take a year to change the rules across Britain. 
 Nov 2001 - [The British government's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs](http://news.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2001%2F11%2F18%2Fncan18.xml) issued a report raising serious questions about total Cannabis prohibition and examining several alternatives.

Uruguay #
 
Cannabis possession is legal for residents of Uruguay 18 and older. Officially, cannabis buyers must register with the goverment. Uruguay was one of the first countries in the world to legalize cannabis completely, although the president postponed implementation of the rules until 2015. See [http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/22/uruguay-legal-cannabis-1-dollar-gram](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/22/uruguay-legal-cannabis-1-dollar-gram) and [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/uruguay-marijuana-sales-delayed-until-2015-president.aspx?pageID=238&nID=68922&NewsCatID=358](http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/uruguay-marijuana-sales-delayed-until-2015-president.aspx?pageID=238&nID=68922&NewsCatID=358) .

**Cannabis** (also known as **THC** , **marijuana** , **weed** , **pot** , **grass** , **hemp** , **zaza** , **kush** , and many others) is a preparation of the cannabis plant that produces psychoactive effects when consumed (via [smoking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Smoking) , [vaporizing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vaporizing) , or [ingestion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Oral) ). It is the most used illicit substance in the world. The mechanism of action is [binding activity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) at [cannabinoid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabinoid) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) distributed throughout the body. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

The principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which makes up one of 483 known compounds in the plant, including at least 84 other [cannabinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabinoid) such as [cannabidiol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabidiol) (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), and cannabigerol (CBG). At least three species are recognized: *Cannabis sativa* , *Cannabis indica* , and *Cannabis ruderalis* . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

The earliest recorded uses of cannabis date from the 3rd millennium BC. In modern times, cannabis is used for [recreational](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use) or medicinal and religious or spiritual purposes. It played a central role in the 1960s youth counterculture movement and is associated with the art and music of this era. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [appetite enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_enhancement) , [immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement) , [creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement) , [increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor) , [increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation) , [visual disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . The effects can vary widely depending on dose, [strain & form](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis#Strains_and_forms) , tolerance, and [set and setting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) . Notably, it can either strongly [suppress](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) or [enhance anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) depending on the individual and situation.

Lower doses are associated with relaxing effects similar to a [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) . Higher doses are associated with mild-to-moderate [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) effects such as [visual hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) , [conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking) and [time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion) , as well as a greater risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , and [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) .

Cannabis is considered to have low to moderate abuse potential. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Chronic use is associated with escalating tolerance and psychological dependence in some individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] It has very low physical toxicity and is essentially impossible to physically overdose on. However, it is capable of exacerbating certain mental health symptoms like [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) or [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) in predisposed individuals (see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis#toxicity_and_harm_potential) ).

Long-term cannabis use may be associated with negative cognitive effects such as brain fog, lowered motivation, difficulty learning, and inattention. These effects are typically reversible with tapered use and time off.

It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## History and culture

The genus cannabis is indigenous to central Asia and the Indian subcontinent.

The **history of cannabis** and its usage by humans dates back to at least the third millennium BC in written history, and possibly as far back as the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (8800–6500 BCE) based on archaeological evidence. For millennia, the plant has been valued for its use for fiber and rope, as food and medicine, and for its psychoactive properties for religious and recreational use.

The earliest restrictions on cannabis were reported in the Islamic world by the 14th century. In the 19th century, it began to be restricted in colonial countries, often associated with racial and class stresses.

Since the early 20th century, cannabis has been subject to legal restrictions with the possession, use, and sale of cannabis preparations containing psychoactive [cannabinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabinoids) currently illegal in most countries. However, there is a recent growing trend towards decriminalization and legalization, with the sale of cannabis made legal in some US states and Canada.

In 2004, the U.N. estimated that global consumption patterns of cannabis indicated that approximately 4% of the adult world population (162 million people) used cannabis annually and that approximately 0.6% (22.5 million) of people used cannabis daily. According to the United Nations, it is the most used illicit drug in the world.

### Potency trends

The potency of illicit cannabis plant material has consistently increased over time since 1995 from ~4% in 1995 to ~12% in 2014. The cannabidiol content has decreased on average from ~.28% in 2001 to <.15% in 2014, resulting in a change in the ratio of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol to cannabidiol from 14 times in 1995 to ~80 times in 2014.

### Etymology

The word *cannabis* is from Greek κάνναβις ( *kánnabis* ) (see Latin *cannabis* ), which was originally Scythian or Thracian. It is related to the Persian *kanab* , the English *canvas* and possibly the English *hemp* (Old English *hænep* ).

### Common names

Cannabis has [numerous common and street names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_names_for_cannabis) . The most common ones are: **marijuana** , **weed** , **pot** , **grass** , **hemp** , , **ganja, THC** .

## Chemistry

Cannabis plants contain a number of different specific compounds at various ratios. Cannabis contains more than 460 compounds; at least 80 of these are [cannabinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabinoid) , chemical compounds that interact with cannabinoid receptors in the brain. The most common cannabinoids are listed below:

### Phytocannabinoids

Upon heating, cannabinoid acids decarboxylate to give their psychoactive cannabinoid.

Phytocannabinoid ← phytocannabinoid acid

**Quasi-psychedelic phytocannabinoids**

- [Δ-8-THC](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%94-8-Tetrahydrocannabinol) . Psychoactive, but about half as potent as Δ-9-THC. 
- Decarboxylation: Δ-8-THCA → Δ-8-THC -- only trace amounts exist in cannabis
- Chemical conversion: [CBD + acid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conversion_of_CBD_to_THC_with_citric_acid_and_water-based_extraction) 8 h → 50% Δ-8-THC
- [Δ-9-THC](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol) ( THC ). Most abundant psychoactive component of cannabis. Is the standard when comparing THC analogs. 
- Biosynthesis: [Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) synthase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinolic_acid_synthase) is an enzyme responsible for catalyzing the formation of THCA from cannabigerolic acid (CBGA). [GMO yeast with a transgenic placement of a THCA synthase gene from Cannabis will produce THC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THC_production_by_yeast)
- Decarboxylation: [THCA](/w/index.php?title=THCA&action=edit&redlink=1) ( [more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinolic_acid) ) → THC -- **The decarboxylation of this compound by heat is essential for the psychoactive effect of smoked cannabis, and depends on conversion of the enol to a keto group when the alpha carbon is protonated.**
- Chemical conversion: [CBD + acid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conversion_of_CBD_to_THC_with_citric_acid_and_water-based_extraction) 8 h → 50% THC
- [Δ-10-THC](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%94-10-Tetrahydrocannabinol) . Psychoactive, but less potent than Δ-8-THC. 
- Decarboxylation: Δ-10-THCA → Δ-10-THC-- only trace amounts exist in cannabis
- Chemical conversion: [CBD + acid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conversion_of_CBD_to_THC_with_citric_acid_and_water-based_extraction)
- [Δ-11-THC](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%94-11-Tetrahydrocannabinol) . Psychoactive, but little is known about this compound.
- [THCB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabutol) ( [more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabutol) )
- [THCH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/THCH) ( [more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabihexol) ). 25 times more potent than THC. 
- Decarboxylation: THCHA → THCH -- only trace amounts exist in cannabis
- Chemical conversion: [CBDH + acid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conversion_of_CBD_to_THC_with_citric_acid_and_water-based_extraction)
- [THCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/THCP) ( [more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabiphorol) ). 30 times more potent than THC. 
- Biosynthesis: CBGPA → THCPA → THCP
- Decarboxylation: THCPA → THCP-- only trace amounts exist in cannabis
- Chemical conversion: [CBDP + acid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conversion_of_CBD_to_THC_with_citric_acid_and_water-based_extraction)

**Quasi-psychedelic phytocannabinoids synthesized through chemical modification**

- [HHC](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hexahydrocannabinol)
- [HHCH](/w/index.php?title=Hexahydrocannabihexol&action=edit&redlink=1)
- [HHCP-O-acetate](/w/index.php?title=HHCP-O-acetate&action=edit&redlink=1)
- [THC-O-acetate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/THC-O-acetate) . 3-5 times more potent than THC. 
- Metabolization: THCAO is a prodrug, meaning it requires metabolization in order to take effect. It metabolically undergoes an activation process of converting to THC through [de-acetylation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylation) , then THC continues into its own primary metabolites similarly to THC's oral route. Because of this, the onset when smoked can be significantly longer ranging from 20-45 minutes, but not as long as ingesting THC orally in comparison. THCAO through the oral route can also have longer onsets than oral THC due to its extra metabolic processes, with an onset of around 90 minutes.
- Decarboxylation: Lack of information on decarboxylation, but it can be inferred that it decarboxylates like its normal parent compound since research suggests that heating it at 340°C (644°F) unbinds the acetyl group, releasing toxic ketene gas.
- Chemical conversion: acetic anhydride + Δ-9-THC/Δ-8-THC → Δ-9-THCAO/Δ-8-THCAO, respectively.
- [THCP-O-acetate](/w/index.php?title=THCP-O-acetate&action=edit&redlink=1)

**Non-quasi-psychedelic phytocannabinoids, some which can be synthesized to quasi-psychedelic cannabinoids with biosynthesis or chemical conversion (see above)**

- CBC ← CBCA
- CBCV ← CBCVA
- CBD 
- Biosynthesis: CBGA → CBDA → CBD
- Decarboxylation: CBDA → CBD
- Chemical conversion: THC + iodine → CBD
- CBDD
- CBDV ← CBDVA
- CBDH
- CBDP 
- Biosynthesis: CBGPA → CBDPA → CBDP
- Decarboxylation: CBDPA → CBDP
- CBE ← CBEA
- CBG
- CBGM ← CBGAM
- CBGV ← CBGVA
- CBL ← CBLA
- CBLV ← CBLVA
- CBN ← CBNA 
- Conversion: [THC + oxidative degredation UV light heating → CBN](https://www.lab1st.com/cannabinoids-conversion)
- CBT ← CBTA
- CBV ← CBVA
- THCC ← THCCA 
- Despite sounding a lot like THC, THCC is more similar to CBD than it is to THC
- THCV ← THCVA 
- THCV is non-psychoactive.

## Pharmacology

The most psychoactive [cannabinoid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabinoid) found in the cannabis plant is tetrahydrocannabinol (or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol), commonly known as THC. Other cannabinoids include delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), cannabicyclol (CBL), cannabichromene (CBC) and cannabigerol (CBG); they have less psychotropic effects than THC, but may play a role in the overall effect of cannabis. The most studied are THC, CBD and CBN.

*CYP2C9* genotype affects THC sensitivity significantly:
*Subjects with the *3/*3 genotype had 3-fold higher THC levels in their blood than subjects with the *1/*1 genotype. Those subjects with one copy of each gene (*1/*3) had intermediate THC levels that were about 2-fold higher than subjects with *1/*1.*
The [entourage effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entourage_effect) is a proposed mechanism by which compounds present in cannabis which are largely non-psychoactive by themselves modulate the overall psychoactive effects of the plant (these resulting principally from the action of the main psychoactive component of cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)).

THC appears to alter mood and cognition through its agonist actions on the CB1 receptors, which inhibit a secondary messenger system (adenylate cyclase) in a dose dependent manner. Via CB1 activation, THC indirectly increases dopamine release and produces psychotropic effects.

Cannabidiol acts as an allosteric modulator of the mu and delta opioid receptors. THC also potentiates the effects of the glycine receptors. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the cannabis high remains subject to on-going scientific investigation.

Drugs that activate the CB1 and CB2 receptors are known to upregulate and enhance 5-HT 2A receptor activity. The ERK1/ERK2 signaling pathway has been shown to mediate this effect, but the exact biochemical mechanism is unknown. This upregulation and enhancement of the 5-HT 2A receptor is why cannabis potentiates the effects of psychedelic drugs and can cause psychedelic effects in very high doses.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - Cannabis may produce a mild sense of [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) at low to moderate doses. Its effects are primarily sedating and can even be [hypnotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnotic) . These relaxing properties are suppressed by consciously forcing oneself to engage in physical activities. 
In terms of its stimulating effects, these subjective aspects of THC typically last 2-3 hours, whereas the half-life of CBD, which is more relaxing, is 9 hours. Thus, the first dose of cannabis after a period of abstinence will tend to be far more stimulating than subsequent doses, which must compete with the relaxing effects of previous doses.
 
Because the relaxation both persists much longer and shares many of the same pathways as the stimulation, regular ingestion of THC also leads to increased tolerance to its stimulating effects, but not to its relaxing effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of cannabis is extremely variable and depends entirely on the individual strain as well as dose and method of intake. In general, however, it can be described as a relatively pleasurable, sometimes warm, soft, intoxicating and all-encompassing sensation. At high dosages, it can cause some users to feel shaky or nerve-wracked.
- **[Appetite enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_enhancement)** - The feeling of increased appetite following the use of cannabis has been documented for hundreds of years and is known colloquially as "the munchies". Cannabis has been shown in recent studies to stimulate the release of the hormone ghrelin which is normally released by the stomach when empty as a signal for the brain to search for food.
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)** - This effect may present itself at the very beginning of the intoxication and is likely due mostly to the cannabinoid THCV.
- **[Gustatory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gustatory_enhancement)** - Cannabis is regularly known to improve the taste of foods.
- **[Bodily pressures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_pressures)** - This can be described a subtle or distinct pressure felt behind one's eye(s).
- **[Bronchodilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bronchodilation)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Changes in felt gravity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_gravity)** - At extremely high doses, many users report a feeling of being pulled backwards across vast distances (sometimes at powerful speeds). This sensation progressively increases in intensity and often eventually becomes unbearable if one leans backwards or lies down; however, it disappears altogether once the user sits up or leans forward.
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** - Decreased blood pressure can result in an increased heart rate, although this varies depending on the user.
- **[Decreased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)** - Cannabis has the potential to cause dizziness at very high doses. However, this effect is far more inconsistent than with substances such as [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) .
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Dry mouth](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dry_mouth)** - This is known colloquially as "cotton mouth" in popular American and United Kingdom culture. Edible forms of cannabis can make this effect feel much more intense and uncomfortable.
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)** - This effect is experienced almost exclusively with the convection of solvent extracted [hash oil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis#Forms) and appears almost immediately upon exhalation. This is likely due to the high THC concentration and a relatively rapid onset that can result in a significant [decrease in blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_blood_pressure) , often causing the user to sweat.
- **[Insomnia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insomnia)** - Chronic intake is associated with insomnia.
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)** - This substance causes a partial to moderate suppression of motor control which intensifies proportional to dose, but rarely results in a complete inability to walk and perform basic movements.
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)**
- **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)** - This effect is usually very subtle and is more likely to occur at high doses.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - At heavy dosages and overdoses, cannabis can be nauseating. This usually passes after the first 30 or 40 minutes of the intoxication and tends to transition later into [nausea suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea_suppression) .
- **[Nausea suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea_suppression)** - Cannabis is effective for suppressing nausea induced by both general illness and substances. It is considered an effective treatment for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and is a reasonable option in those who do not improve following preferential treatment.
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)** - This substance has been reported as useful for treating certain headaches and chronic pain, including pain caused by neuropathy and possibly fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis.
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)** *or* **[Perception of bodily heaviness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_heaviness)** - Depending on the specific strain of cannabis, one can find themselves with a body which can feel either physically heavier or lighter than it usually would in a style that is entirely dependent upon dose or tolerance of the individual.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - This rarely exceeds mild to moderate levels of intensity, and although this effect may be present for many users there are also a number of individuals who report experiencing no euphoria at all. For some, this effect is notably more prominent with [edible forms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis#Methods_of_consumption) of cannabis.
- **[Red eye](/w/index.php?title=Red_eye&action=edit&redlink=1)** - Marijuana induces corneal vasodilation (so called red eye) and a reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP). [Naphazoline](/w/index.php?title=Naphazoline&action=edit&redlink=1) eye drops relieve red eyes.
- **[Seizure suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure_suppression)** - There are many anecdotal reports of the successful treatment of seizures in epilepsy with the use of low THC/high CBD marijuana. However, there is not enough scientific evidence to draw conclusions about its safety or efficacy. Studies in animals have found that cannabidiol, tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), and other cannabinoids have anticonvulsant properties.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Vasodilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasodilation)** - THC decreases blood pressure which dilates the blood vessels and increases blood flow throughout the body. The arteries in the eyeball expand from the decreased blood pressure. These enlarged arteries often produce a bloodshot red eye effect and is the basis for its effectiveness at treating glaucoma. Studies have shown cannabis (smoked or eaten) effectively lowers intraocular pressure by about 25%, as much as standard medications. ### Visual effects
 
- Cannabis inconsistently induces visual and [hallucinatory states](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinatory_states) at higher doses. These hallucinations are very mild and ill-defined compared to the effects of hallucinogens like psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants. 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)** - This effect is often faint, but has been known to increase in its likeness and/or appearance among "regular" users of [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) .
- **[Acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)** - THC is known to decrease intraocular pressure. This can sometimes result in blurry vision for some people. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Brightness alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brightness_alteration)** - THC has been shown to modulate the activity of cone cells in the eye. This can cause an increased sensitivity to light, causing one's vision to appear brighter than normal.
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)** - This effect can occur at high doses
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)** - This effect can be seen at high doses and is generally quite mild. It generally does not extend past level 2.
- **[Geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry)** - Cannabis is capable of inconsistently inducing mild psychedelic geometry at extremely high doses within many users who also regularly use psychedelics. It is capable of inducing these in a visual style which seems to be an averaged out depiction of all the [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) one has used within the past. These rarely extend beyond level 4 and are considered to be mild, fine, small and zoomed out (but often well-defined).
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** - The internal hallucinations of cannabis are extremely variable in their appearance depending on the dosage, tolerance and the individual's brain chemistry. They are very inconsistent and for some even rare but can be described as being fainter in appearance when compared to traditional [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) and do not seem to be as regularly composed of visual [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) . 
The most common way in which they manifest themselves is through [hypnagogic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lucid_dreaming#Fully_defined_hypnagogia) scenarios. They are most common during high dosages in dark environments and can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as both lucid and delirious in believability, fixed in style, autonomous in controllability, equal in new experiences and memory replays in content and are primarily [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in style.
- **[Peripheral information misinterpretation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peripheral_information_misinterpretation)** - This very inconsistent effect tends to be mild and fleeting in contrast to other more powerful [psychoactive substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychoactive_substances) . This effect rarely occurs on cannabis alone but when it does it is often in high dosages and/or when the individual has a low tolerance. It is more likely to manifest itself in certain environments as opposed to others and is more likely to happen if one has used stronger substances recently, typically within the past 24 to 36 hours.
- **[Visual disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** *or* **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is significantly less prominent and consistent than it is with [serotonergic psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelics) and [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) .
- **[Analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - This effect is generally mild and usually only present during the onset and peak of intoxication
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)**
- **[Depersonalization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depersonalization)**
- **[Derealization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Derealization)**
- **[Dream suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_suppression)** - It is commonly reported that regular cannabis use before sleep results in a complete absence of dreams. A day or two of abstaining from cannabis results in an intensification of dreams for a short period of time. 
This claim is supported through studies that demonstrate that measurably reduced eye movement activity and REM states occur when one falls asleep in the THC condition. This state is strongly associated with dreaming. The same study also reported a REM rebound effect; there is more REM activity during the withdrawal from THC.
- **[Decreased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_libido)** and **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** - Although cannabis is commonly reported to increase sexual desire and heighten its pleasure it has also been reported to decrease one's libido as well. 
The decrease in libido typically only occurs during the [onset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Duration) of the intoxication whilst the increase in libido commonly occurs during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Duration) or after the peak effects. However, these components are inconsistent and it is possible for one of these effects to occur without the other.
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)** - The most prominent cognitive component of the cannabis experience is the way in which it enhances the emotions one is already feeling proportional to dose. This can result in [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , extreme [laughter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Laughter) , and increased immersion within tasks and activities or it can result in [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) and [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) depending on the user's current state of mind.
- **[Feelings of impending doom](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Feelings_of_impending_doom)** - This occurs in high doses, it consists of extreme [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) and [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) . It can be compared to a mild "bad trip" on psychedelics.
- **[Focus suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_suppression)** and **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This can depend on the user, dose, [method](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) or the strain of cannabis used. Higher doses tend to cause focus suppression while lower doses can increase one's focus.
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)** 
- **[Laughter fits](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Laughter_fits)** - Cannabis can often cause spurts of laughter for little, to no reason. This is often where the term "giggles" comes from when people are high off cannabis .
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** - Cannabis is known to suppress short-term memory due to inhibition of glutamate neurotransmission in the hippocampus. This effect primarily effects short-term memory, making [ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death) or long-term [memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression) very unlikely.
- **[Mindfulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)** - Relatively consistent, but not as pronounced as with psychedelics. This effect can become more noticeable and/or consistent if the individual regularly takes [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) .
- **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - All [cannabinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabinoids) are capable of inducing paranoia at high doses, with chronic administration, or when administered alongside [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) or [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) .
- **[Personal meaning enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_meaning_enhancement)**
- **[Psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis)** - The prolonged usage of THC may increase one's disposition to psychosis , particularly in vulnerable individuals with risk factors for psychotic illnesses (like a past or family history of schizophrenia).
- **[Sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)** - This effect depends mostly on dose and/or strain of the plant and is most prominent after the peak subsides.
- **[Suggestibility enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Suggestibility_enhancement)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)** - Cannabis can often cause many wandering thoughts and ideas at most doses.
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - Cannabis has been commonly reported to alter one's sense of time. The distortion that occurs is generally mild, and is most commonly reported to be in the form of time expansion. ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Enhancements](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)** - These are usually only present at extremely high doses. ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - This is a very rare and typically non-reproducible effect. It is particularly mild when compared to the states capable of being produced by other [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) , particularly [serotonergic psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelics) . Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood for this effect to occur, but otherwise only seems to be possible among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states.
### Combination effects

- **[Psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics)** - Cannabis strongly intensifies the sensory and cognitive effects of all psychedelics. Extreme caution is advised when combining these substances as this can significantly increase the chances of a negative psychological reaction like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their usual cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits. Many users report that cannabis is effective at briefly recreating the peak of the experience if consumed during the [come down](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Route_of_administration#Coming_down) phase.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Cannabis enhances the cognitive, visual and general hallucinatory effects of dissociatives. Dissociative-induced [holes, spaces, and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids) and [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) become more vivid and intense on cannabis. These effects correspond with an increased risk of [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants)** - Depressants such as [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) reduce the hallucinogenic aspects of the cannabis high. Instead, the focus shifts to bodily sensations, such as [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [information processing suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Information_processing_suppression) , and [anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) .
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - When used with alcohol, cannabis often creates feelings of extreme nausea, double vision, dizziness and changes in gravity. It is generally recommended that people take the cannabis before drinking and not the other way around as this is reported to induce these effects less readily.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Cannabis tends to increase the [thought accelerating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration) , [immersion enhancing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement) and [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoric) effects of stimulants, particularly as it relates to one's [appreciation of music](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation) and sexual pleasure. This combination should be used with caution, however, as it can easily induce states of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .

## Dosage and preparation

### THC

"Our results showed an overall increase in potency of illicit cannabis, from approximately 10% in 2009 to approximately 14% in 2019. These results are in agreement with other potency monitoring programs in several European countries."

Math to calculate the quantity needed weed: Desired THC from divided by the THC strength of the strain. For example, if you want to smoke 3 mg (a common dose) from cannabis with 12% THC:
3 mg / 12% = 3/0.12 = 25 mg
## Strains and forms

### Strains

**Sativa** and **indica** are the two major types of cannabis plants which can mix together to create hybrid strains. Because each strain has its own balance of cannabinoids, each strain has its own range of effects on the body and mind, resulting in a wide range of medicinal benefits.

Indica plants typically grow short and wide compared to sativa plants which grow tall and thin. Indica plants are better suited for indoor growing because of their short growth and sativa plants are better suited for outdoor growing because some strains can reach over 25 ft. in height.

Marijuana strains range from pure sativas to pure indicas with hybrid strains consisting of both indica and sativa (for example, 30% indica – 70% sativa, 50% – 50% combinations, or 80% indica – 20% sativa).

#### Hypothetical phytocannabinoiod differences between C. indica and C. sativa

The effects of *sativa* may be used for a high, while *indica* may be used for its sedative effects. Both types are used as medical cannabis.

- Cannabinoid ratios: On average, *Cannabis indica* has higher levels of [THC](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol) compared to [CBD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabidiol) , whereas *Cannabis sativa* has lower levels of THC to CBD. However, huge variability exists within either species. A 2015 study shows the average THC content of the most popular herbal cannabis products in the Netherlands has decreased slightly since 2005.
- Terpene ratios: Sativa ancestry is associated with farnesene and [ergamotene, while Indica ancestry is associated with myrcene, elemene, and sesquiterpene alcohols.

##### Criticism

In 2022, studies found that plants identified as "indica" or "sativa" based on common methods of differentiation (e.g. plant height or leaf shape) are not, in fact, chemically distinguishable, with many identified as "sativa" having cannabinoid ratios predicted of "indica" plants and vice versa. The authors have concluded that the chemical makeup of cannabis plants cannot be reliably determined by simple inspection of the plants' physical characteristics and that the "indica" and "sativa" labels are not informative as to the cannabinoids (or other chemical components) delivered.

### Forms

- *Whole flower and leaf* is the most widely consumed form, containing 3% to 22% THC.
- *Kief* is a powder which can be sifted from the leaves and flowers of cannabis plants and either consumed in powder form or compressed to produce cakes of hashish.
- *Hashish* (also spelled *hasheesh* , *hashisha* , or simply *hash* ) is a concentrated resin cake or ball produced from pressed kief. Hashish was the primary form of cannabis used in Europe in 2008. Herbal cannabis is more widely used in Northern America. Purities of confiscated hashish in Europe (2011) range between 4-15%. Between 2000 and 2005 the percentage of hashish in cannabis end product seizures was at 18%.
- *Tinctures* are cannabinoids which have been extracted from cannabis plant matter using high-proof spirits (often grain alcohol). The solubility of [THC](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/THC) in [ethanol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ethanol) is greater than 1 g/mL.
- *Hash oil* is obtained from the cannabis plant by solvent extraction, and contains the cannabinoids present in the highly concentrated natural oils of cannabis flowers and leaves. Hash oils in use in the 2010s had THC concentrations as high as 90%.
- *Cannabutter* is one of many varieties of cannabis infusions owing to the variety of non-volatile solvents used. Examples of solvents used in this process are cocoa butter, dairy butter, cooking oil, glycerine, and skin moisturizers.

## Common usage

### Consumption methods

Cannabis is consumed in many different ways:

- **Smoking** typically involves inhaling vaporized cannabinoids ("smoke") from small pipes, bongs (portable versions of hookahs with water chamber), paper-wrapped joints, tobacco-leaf-wrapped blunts, and other items.
- **Vaporizers** heat herbal cannabis to 165–190 °C (329–374 °F), causing the active ingredients to evaporate into a vapor without burning the plant material (the boiling point of THC is 157 °C (315 °F) at 760 mmHg pressure).
- **Cannabis tea** contains relatively small concentrations of THC because THC is an oil (lipophilic) and is only slightly water-soluble (with a solubility of 2.8 mg per liter). Cannabis tea is made by first adding a saturated fat to hot water (e.g., cream or any milk except skim) with a small amount of cannabis.
- **Edibles** are cannabis added as an ingredient to one of a variety of foods.
- **Sublingual/buccal** consumption typically involves the absorption of cannabinoids through the membranes inside the mouth (usually through a candy or tincture).
- **Tinctures** vary from edibles, usually only containing extracted (and potent) THC in liquid form. Tinctures can be taken sublingually, or orally.
- **Topical** consumption typically involves the use of either a cream or lip balm containing cannabinoids absorbed through the skin.

## Medical use

Cannabis is an emerging treatment option for those suffering from many serious diseases, including cancer. Due to its [pain relieving](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) , [nausea suppressing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea_suppression) effects, cannabis can be useful for those undergoing radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Oral doses of cannabis are more effective in reducing nausea and vomiting .

In addition to the anti-nausea effects, the [appetite enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_enhancement) effects of cannabis can combine with the antiemetic effects and make it more likely that the patient will gain or maintain weight through cancer treatment.

## Toxicity and harm potential

Despite its reputation for being a benign substance, it is important to be aware that cannabis use is associated with distinct risks. Acute adverse effects include [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , hyperemesis syndrome, impaired coordination and judgment, suicidal ideations/tendencies, and psychotic symptoms.

It is strongly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) if using this substance.

[Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_hyperemesis_syndrome) (CHS) is recurrent [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , [vomiting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vomiting) , and [stomach cramp](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stomach_cramp) that sometimes occurs due to prolonged, high-dose cannabis use.

Cannabis arteritis (CA) is a very rare peripheral vascular disease similar to Buerger's disease.

Cannabis use during brain development (including during pregnancy and adolescence) has been shown to interfere with a variety of neurobiological systems. Meta-analysis following ~5 weeks of abstinence reveals lasting changes in the central executive and default mode networks, which are involved in attention and working memory. The extent of these changes as risk factors is not entirely clear.

### Suicidality

A NIH study found that suicide risk is higher with marijuana users than non-users.

On the other hand, the largest study as of 2018 in association with cannabis use and the risk of suicide, there was no found evidence between the two. This study shows that it is unlikely a risk factor for suicide, either directly or as a consequence of use.

Not only that, but another study studied the association between cannabis and suicidality also has correlation.

The main takeaway from these studies and more is that while suicide risk may be higher with people who use cannabis, cannabis is unlikely the cause or an additional significant factor.

### Psychosis risk

The prolonged usage of [THC](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/THC) and other [cannabinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabinoids) may increase one's disposition to mental illness and psychosis, particularly in vulnerable individuals with risk factors for psychotic illnesses (like a past or family history of schizophrenia).

Individuals with a personal or family history of mental illness, particularly psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, should **not** use cannabis without the advice of a qualified mental health practitioner.

### Trauma

[use and trauma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_use_and_traumaCannabis) are linked, with trauma playing a role in encouraging both the use and potential misuse of cannabis. Conversely, cannabis use has been associated with the intensity of trauma and PTSD symptoms. While evidence of efficacious use of cannabis is growing in novelty, it is not currently recommended.

### Lethal dosage

No fatal overdoses associated with cannabis use have been reported as of 2010. A review published in the British Journal of Psychiatry in February 2001 said that "no deaths directly due to acute cannabis use have ever been reported."

THC, the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant, has extremely low physiological toxicity and the amount that can enter the body through the consumption of cannabis plants poses no threat of death. In lab animal tests, scientists have had much difficulty administering a dose of THC that is high enough to be lethal. The dose of THC needed to kill 50% of tested rodents is very high, 2.594 mol/kg, about 815.7 grams of THC per kilogram of body weight, and human deaths from overdose are unheard of.

At present, it is estimated that the [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) of cannabis is around 1:20,000 or 1:40,000. This means that, in order to induce death, a cannabis smoker would have to consume 20,000 to 40,000 times as much cannabis as is contained in one cannabis cigarette. A user would theoretically have to smoke nearly 1,500 pounds of cannabis within about 15 minutes to induce a lethal response.

It is worth noting that the rare condition Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS) can cause ongoing nausea, vomiting and severe dehydration which can lead to renal failure and in the worst case this can lead to death.

### Dependence and abuse potential

Cannabis is moderately habit-forming. Research has shown the overall dependence potential for cannabis to be less than that for [caffeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Caffeine) , [tobacco](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tobacco) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [heroin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heroin) , but higher than that for [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) , [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , or [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) .

Dependence on cannabis is more common amongst heavy users. Cannabis use can lead to increased tolerance and [withdrawal symptoms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal#Cannabis) upon stopping usage. Prolonged cannabis usage requires the user to consume higher doses of the substance to achieve a common desirable effect, and reinforce the body's metabolic systems for synthesizing and eliminating it more efficiently.

Tolerance to many of the effects of cannabis develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 1 - 2 weeks for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 2 - 3 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). THC has been detected in heavy cannabis users after 77 days of drug abstinence.

Cannabis exhibits cross-tolerance with all [cannabinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabinoids) , meaning that all cannabinoids will have a reduced effect for a period of time upon using cannabis. The mechanisms that create this tolerance to THC are thought to involve changes in cannabinoid receptor function.

One study found that about 1 in 10 users of cannabis may develop dependence characterized by the occurrence of a withdrawal syndrome after abstinence. This withdrawal syndrome was found to peak 2-3 days after quitting and is mostly complete by 1 week; however, sleep disturbances and vivid dreams may persist for 2-3 weeks.

### Dangerous interactions

## Legal status

For table of countries, see Wikipedia's [global cannabis legalization table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Global_cannabis_legalization_table) .

### United Nations

The legality of cannabis for medical and recreational use varies by country, in terms of its possession, distribution, and cultivation, and (in regards to medical) how it can be consumed and what medical conditions it can be used for. These policies in most countries are regulated by the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs that was ratified in 1961, along with the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances and the 1988 Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.

#### Rescheduling proposals

The World Health Organization (WHO) is calling for whole-plant marijuana, as well as cannabis resin, to be removed from Schedule IV—the most restrictive category of a 1961 drug convention signed by countries from around the world.

## Effects
The most important of a total of 400 active ingredients are THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD (cannabidiol), with THC being responsible for the majority of the psychoactive effects felt. CBD also has analgesic, sedative and narcotic effects.
The main cannabis active substances THC and CBD dock in the body to the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. This activates the body's own messenger substance endocannabinoid. This has a relaxing, appetite-stimulating, calming and pain-relieving effect. Feelings are intensified, serenity and/or groundless cheerfulness set in. The experience of time is changed, usually slowed down. In high doses and CBD-free varieties, cannabis can have hallucinogenic effects. Since it is usually consumed together with tobacco, the joint-typical effect is an interaction between cannabis and tobacco. This usually leads to an intensification and prolongation of the effect, as tobacco inhibits the degradation of endocannabinoids. 

## Dosage
The main active ingredient content and the ratio of THC to CBD differ greatly depending on the product. Therefore, the dosage is difficult to determine. Hashish contains on average more THC and mostly CBD. Outdoor weed varieties contain less THC and less CBD, while indoor weed varieties contain mainly THC and rarely CBD.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Increase in heart rate and pulse rate, reddening of the eyes, dry mouth, excessive feeling of hunger (binge eating), dizziness, nausea and vomiting, general impairment of the ability to concentrate and remember during intoxication, as well as unpleasant intensification of feelings or introversion, drifting into one's own world of thoughts. At high doses and varieties with little CBD, circulatory problems up to circulatory collapse, in the worst case paranoia and depressive moods may occur.
When consuming cannabis products, the dosage is more difficult to estimate, making the risks and side effects more unpredictable.

### Long-term Risks
With frequent and regular use, there is a risk of psychological dependence. Symptoms of mild physical dependence may also manifest themselves; in the case of sudden abstinence, sweating, hot/cold shivers, loss of appetite and difficulty falling asleep as well as irritability are possible. In the case of chronic use, there is a danger of loss of reality; latent psychoses can be triggered. In addition, long-term impairment of short-term memory and the ability to motivate oneself is possible.
Smoking, especially when mixed with tobacco, increases susceptibility to respiratory problems (bronchitis, tracheitis, pneumonia, etc.) when consumed chronically. Due to the deeper inhalation as well as poorer filtering methods (such as cardboard filters), joints are more harmful to the lungs than cigarettes.

## Safer Use
- Currently, there are many misdeclared and stretched cannabis products in circulation. Therefore, if possible, use cannabis drug checking and follow the safer use instructions for synthetic cannabinoids.
- When using new cannabis products for the first time, try a small amount first to see if you notice any suspicious effects (e.g. rapid onset of effects, unusually strong effects, etc.).
- Cannabis products temporarily affect the ability to remember and concentrate. Consumption at work and at school is therefore not advisable.
- When smoking, make sure you use good filtering methods (activated carbon filters) or use a vaporizer.
- Since cannabis products are used mixed with tobacco, there is also a tobacco addiction with daily use. There are some tobacco substitutes such as damiana or coltsfoot that you can use instead of tobacco.
- Eating or drinking cannabis products is easy on the lungs, but the effects are stronger and more unpredictable than smoking. The risk of very high and highly psychoactive doses is high. Carefully approach the right dose, don't add more right away!
- Since the brain is developing until the age of 25, you should not use regularly until that age. You are more likely to be exposed to side effects and long-term risks from cannabis use.
- Do not consume if you are not well, latent psychoses could be triggered.
- In the case of mental illness, cannabis can aggravate the course of the disease or lead to relapses.
- Cannabis use should be avoided in cases of lung disease and existing heart conditions or heart disease.

## Adulterants & Extenders

### Common Adulterants

**Synthetic Cannabinoids**
Synthetic cannabinoids (also described in the literature as cannabimimetics or cannabinoid receptor agonists) are classified as "new psychoactive substances" (NPS). There is little information available on the effects, risks, long-term consequences and interactions.

  "thedrugclassroom": `# Does Cannabis Addiction Exist?
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/cannabis-addiction-exist/*

Cannabis, like most drugs, is something people can become addicted to and it shares some of its action with other drugs and activities that can be addictive. Addiction is more likely when someone isn’t fulfilled in their life, has mental disorders, or has gone through traumatic experiences.

Since a psychological dependence on cannabis rarely results in severe short-term consequences, there may be a comparatively small desire to change one’s use.

On the physical dependence side of the topic (which isn’t actually addiction), cannabis does produce tolerance and withdrawal. The withdrawal isn’t as severe as what’s seen with heroin, for example, nor is it physically dangerous. Nevertheless, withdrawal usually does exist for 1-2 weeks when a heavy user stops taking the drug.

Cannabis, commonly known in some regions as Marijuana, and by various colloquial names, refers to a genus of plants indigenous to Central and South Asia.[1] The genus is scientifically subdivided into three species, Ruderalis, Indica and Sativa[2], however there is little scientific consensus on taxonomy and often little correlation between scientific classification and commercial descriptions of strains as 'Sativa' or 'Indica'. Commercial psychoactive strains of Cannabis are typically hybrids of Sativa, Indica and/or Ruderalis.[3]

Whilst the Cannabis plant has various uses in production of fibres, it is most well known today for its psychoactive effects. Various desirable sensations are reported in individuals who have consumed cannabis, such as euphoria, relaxation, and sleepiness. Adverse effects include decreased short term memory, dryness of the oral cavity ("Cotton-mouth"), impaired motor skills and reddening of the eyes. Occasionally, cannabis can produce anxiety, panic, or paranoia. Rarely, cannabis has been implicated in the development of acute psychosis.[4] [A full range of effects can be found on the Tripsit Factsheets.](http://drugs.tripsit.me/cannabis)

The primary psychoactive agent in cannabis is believed to be tetrahydrocannabinol, however the drug contains at least 65 other cannabinoids, and 485 compounds have been identified thus far in cannabis. The extent to which these compounds produce psychoactive effects is a matter of ongoing research.[5]

Cannabis can be consumed in a variety of ways, such as smoking, vaporisation, consumption as part of foods and in extracts. [6]

Cannabis has been used throughout history as both a recreational drug, medicine and spiritual aid. 128 to 232 million people used cannabis (2.7% to 4.9% of the global population between the ages of 15 and 65) in 2013, making it the most commonly used illicit drug on Earth.[7]

Despite this high usage, Cannabis remains prohibited to various extents throughout most jurisdictions.[8][9] The extent to which laws prohibiting cannabis usage are enforced varies worldwide.

In recent times there have been developments in the legal use of cannabis as a medication for various ailments. Canada, Belgium, Australia, the Netherlands, Spain, and 23 U.S. states have made medicinal cannabis usage legal. [10]

## Etymology

The word 'Cannabis' appears to derive from the Greek 'kannabis', a loanword from Scythia or Thrace, where it was used to refer to the hemp plant. It has been in use in English to refer to 'common hemp', the variant of the plant used to create fibres, from 1798, and in reference to the psychoactive usage of the plant from 1848. It may have provided the origin for the words 'hemp' and 'canvas'.[11]

## History

Evidence of cannabis cultivation dates back to 4000BCE, in China, where it was used for the manufacture of strings, ropes, textiles, paper and food. The earliest known pharmacopoeia, * pen-ts'ao ching* (Classic of Herbal Medicine) describes medical use of the cannabis plant, which may date as as far back as 2800 BCE. [12]

This text also states:

...ma-fen (the fruit of cannabis)... if taken in excess will produce visions of devils … over a long term, it makes one communicate with spirits and lightens one's body…[12]

But Chinese texts otherwise rarely refer to its psychoactive effects.[12]

In India cannabis usage has been widespread for thousands of years, being entwined with recreational usage, medicinal treatments and religious ritual. The Atharvaveda, an ancient text of Hinduism dating back at least 2000 years describes cannabis as one of five sacred plants. Medicinal and religious usage of cannabis likely dates back at least 3000 years.[12]

Cannabis first appears in ancient  western literature in the account of the 5th century BCE Geek historian Heterodotus, who described a practice of burning hemp to release vapour practised by ancient Scythians.[13] This has been corroborated by the discovery of charred cannabis seeds in Scythian tombs. [12]

Whilst evidence of Roman usage of cannabis medicinally is sparse, Greek accounts exist of cannabis being used to treat a number of ailments, such as salves for wounds in horses, tinctures used to treat inflammation in the ears and the consumption of various parts of the plant for treatment of  nosebleeds and even tapeworms.[13]

Recreational consumption of Cannabis is described as early as the 4th century BCE by Ephippus, and also by the famed physician Galen in the 2nd century CE,[13] however it does not appear to have been widely used.[12]

By the beginning of second millennium cannabis began to spread from Central and South Asia to Arabia, appearing in Arabic documents from the period, and by the 16th century was widespread throughout Africa and areas of the Americas in contact with Europeans.[12]

In the Americas the cannabis plant was widely cultivated, and its domestic production encouraged in the United states from 1600 to the 19th century, where it was used for textile and rope production. The 1619 Virginia Assembly made hemp growing mandatory for all farmers in the colony, and hemp was even traded as legal tender in Pennsylvania, Virginia and Maryland.[14]

The first country to outlaw the use of cannabis was South Africa in 1911, followed by Jamaica in 1913, potentially as methods of controlling the non-White population. Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand all illegalised cannabis in the 1920s, as part of a wider programme of banning psychoactives such as opium. Canada appears to have banned the drug several years before any reported use of the drug in the country.[15]

By the 1930s a campaign to criminalise cannabis had developed in the United States. Playing on racism, xenophobia and general ignorance about the drug amongst the population, newspapers filled with editorialised accounts of 'reefer madness' and links between Cannabis and crime, often associated with the Black and Mexican communities. [16]
Around this time the word 'Marijuana', previously uncommon outside of a few Mexican communities became popularised by the anti-cannabis movement in a bid to make it appear foreign, strange and exotic[17]

By 1933 30 US states had some form of legislation against cannabis.[16]
Throughout the 1930s the head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, Henry Anslinger successfully campaigned for the illegalisation of cannabis, associating it with violence, corruption of white american young people by immigrants and Blacks and other polemics which played on the fears of white America. By 1937 a federal \$100-per ounce tax on cannabis cultivation effectively banned the plant nationwide.[16][18]

### Hemp

Hemp is the natural, durable soft fiber from the stalk of Cannabis sativa plants that grow upwards of 20 feet tall. Cannabis plants used for hemp production are not valued for recreational uses as the plants that are cultivated for hemp produce minimal levels of THC, analogous to attempting to get drunk from low-alcohol beer. Cannabis plants intended for any drug cultivation cannot be hidden in a hemp field either, as the size and height of each are significantly different.

Hemp producers sell hemp seeds as a health food, as they are rich in heart-healthy, essential fatty acids, amino acids (both essential and nonessential), vitamins and minerals. Hemp "milk" is a milk substitute also made from hemp seeds that is both dairy and gluten-free.

Hemp is fairly easy to grow and matures very fast compared to many crops, most notably trees used for paper. Compared to cotton for clothing, hemp cloth is known to be of superior strength and longer-lasting. The fibers may also be used to form cordage for industrial-strength ropes. Hemp plants also require little pesticides and herbicides due to its height, density and foliage. This also makes the hemp plant very environmentally-friendly.

Hemp can be utilized for 25,000 very durable textile products, ranging from paper and clothing to biofuels (from the oils found in the seeds), medicines and construction material. Hemp has been used by many civilizations, from China to Europe (and later North America) for the last 12,000 years of history.
Recreational use
Comparison of physical harm and dependence regarding various drugs (the British medical journal The Lancet).
Main article: Cannabis (drug)
See also: Tetrahydrocannabinol, Cannabidiol, and Effects of cannabis

Cannabis is a popular recreational drug around the world, only behind alcohol, caffeine and tobacco. In the United States alone, it is believed that over 100 million Americans have tried Cannabis, with 25 million Americans using it within the past year.

The psychoactive effects of Cannabis are known to have a biphasic nature. Primary psychoactive effects include a state of relaxation, and to a lesser degree, euphoria from its main psychoactive compound, tetrahydrocannabinol. Secondary psychoactive effects, such as a facility for philosophical thinking; introspection and metacognition have been reported, amongst cases of anxiety and paranoia. Finally, the tertiary psychoactive effects of the drug cannabis, can include an increase in heart rate and hunger, believed to be caused by 11-Hydroxy-THC, a psychoactive metabolite of THC produced in the liver.

Normal cognition is restored after approximately three hours for larger doses via a smoking pipe, bong or vaporizer. However, if a large amount is taken orally the effects may last much longer. After 24 hours to a few days, minuscule psychoactive effects may be felt, depending on dosage, frequency and tolerance to the drug.

Various forms of the drug cannabis exist, including extracts such as hashish and hash oil which, due to appearance, are more susceptible to adulterants when left unregulated.

The plant Cannabis sativa is known to cause more of a "high" by stimulating hunger and by producing a rather more comedic, or energetic feeling. Conversely, the Cannabis indica plant is known to cause more of a "stoned" type of feeling, possibly due to a higher CBD to THC ratio.

Cannabidiol (CBD), which has no psychotropic effects by itself] (although sometimes showing a small stimulant effect, similar to caffeine),[citation needed] attenuates, or reduces the higher anxiety levels caused by THC alone.

According to the UK medical journal The Lancet, Cannabis has a lower rate of dependence compared to both nicotine and alcohol. However, everyday use of Cannabis can in some cases, be correlated with some psychological withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, and insomnia and evidence could suggest that if a user experiences stress, the likeliness of getting a panic attack increases due to an increase of THC metabolites. However, any Cannabis withdrawal symptoms are typically mild and are never life-threatening.

### Medical use

A synthetic form of the main psychoactive cannabinoid in Cannabis, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), is used as a treatment for a wide range of medical conditions.

In the United States, although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does acknowledge that "there has been considerable interest in its use for the treatment of a number of conditions, including glaucoma, AIDS wasting, neuropathic pain, treatment of spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis, and chemotherapy-induced nausea," the agency has not approved "medical marijuana". There are currently 2 oral forms of cannabis (cannabinoids) available by prescription in the United States for nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy: dronabinol (Marinol) and nabilone (Cesamet). Dronabinol is also approved for the treatment of anorexia associated with AIDS. The FDA does facilitate scientific investigations into the medical uses of cannabinoids.

In a collection of writings on medical marijuana by 45 researchers, a literature review on the medicinal uses of Cannabis and cannabinoids concluded that established uses include easing of nausea and vomiting, anorexia, and weight loss; "well-confirmed effect" was found in the treatment of spasticity, painful conditions (i.e. neurogenic pain), movement disorders, asthma, and glaucoma. Reported but "less-confirmed" effects included treatment of allergies, inflammation, infection, epilepsy, depression, bipolar disorders, anxiety disorder, dependency and withdrawal. Basic level research was being carried out at the time on autoimmune disease, cancer, neuroprotection, fever, disorders of blood pressure.

Clinical trials conducted by the American Marijuana Policy Project, have shown the efficacy of cannabis as a treatment for cancer and AIDS patients, who often suffer from clinical depression, and from nausea and resulting weight loss due to chemotherapy and other aggressive treatments. A synthetic version of the cannabinoid THC named dronabinol has been shown to relieve symptoms of anorexia and reduce agitation in elderly Alzheimer's patients. Dronabinol has been approved for use with anorexia in patients with HIV/AIDS and chemotherapy-related nausea. This drug, while demonstrating the effectiveness of Cannabis at combating several disorders, is more expensive and less available than whole cannabis and has not been shown to be effective or safe.

Glaucoma, a condition of increased pressure within the eyeball causing gradual loss of sight, can be treated with medical marijuana to decrease this intraocular pressure. There has been debate for 25 years on the subject. Some studies have shown a reduction of IOP in glaucoma patients who smoke cannabis, but the effects are generally short-lived. There exists some concern over its use since it can also decrease blood flow to the optic nerve. Marijuana lowers IOP by acting on a cannabinoid receptor on the ciliary body called the CB receptor. Although Cannabis may not be the best therapeutic choice for glaucoma patients, it may lead researchers to more effective treatments. A promising study shows that agents targeted to ocular CB receptors can reduce IOP in glaucoma patients who have failed other therapies.

Medical cannabis is also used for analgesia, or pain relief. It is also reported to be beneficial for treating certain neurological illnesses such as epilepsy, and bipolar disorder. Case reports have found that Cannabis can relieve tics in people with obsessive compulsive disorder and Tourette syndrome. Patients treated with tetrahydrocannabinol, the main psychoactive chemical found in Cannabis, reported a significant decrease in both motor and vocal tics, some of 50% or more. Some decrease in obsessive-compulsive behavior was also found. A recent study has also concluded that cannabinoids found in Cannabis might have the ability to prevent Alzheimer's disease. THC has been shown to reduce arterial blockages.

Another potential use for medical cannabis is movement disorders. Cannabis is frequently reported to reduce the muscle spasms associated with multiple sclerosis; this has been acknowledged by the Institute of Medicine, but it noted that these abundant anecdotal reports are not well-supported by clinical data. Evidence from animal studies suggests that there is a possible role for cannabinoids in the treatment of certain types of epileptic seizures. A synthetic version of the major active compound in Cannabis, THC, is available in capsule form as the prescription drug dronabinol (Marinol) in many countries. The prescription drug Sativex, an extract of cannabis administered as a sublingual spray, has been approved in Canada for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.

### Religious use

Cannabis is first referred to in Hindu Vedas between 2000 and 1400 BCE, in the Atharvaveda. By the 10 century CE, it was being referred to in India as "food of the gods". Cannabis use eventually became a ritual part of the Hindu festival of Holi. In Buddhism, cannabis has been used in meditation and regarded as a holy plant since 500 BCE. Shamanic use of Cannabis in China has been dated to at least 1000 BCE. In ancient Germanic culture, Cannabis was associated with the Norse love goddess, Freya. An anointing oil mentioned in Exodus is, by some translators, said to contain Cannabis. Sufis have used Cannabis in a spiritual context since the thirteenth century CE.

In modern times the Rastafari movement has embraced Cannabis as a sacrament. Elders of the modern religious movement known as the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church consider Cannabis to be the Eucharist, claiming it as an oral tradition from Ethiopia dating back to the time of Christ, even though the movement was founded in the United States in 1975 and has no ties to either Ethiopia or the Coptic Church. Like the Rastafari, some modern Gnostic Christian sects have asserted that Cannabis is the Tree of Life. Other organized religions founded in the 20th century that treat Cannabis as a sacrament are the THC Ministry, the Way of Infinite Harmony, Cantheism, the Cannabis Assembly and the Church of Cognizance.

## Harm Reduction

- The responsible cannabis user does not operate a motor vehicle or other dangerous machinery impaired by cannabis. Although cannabis is said by most experts to be safer than alcohol and many prescription drugs with motorists, public safety demands that impaired drivers be taken off the road and that objective measures of impairment be developed and used, rather than chemical testing.

- Cannabis consumption is for adults only. Many things and activities are suitable for young people, but others absolutely are not. Children do not drive cars, enter into contracts or marry, and they must not use drugs.

- The responsible cannabis user will carefully consider his/her setting and regulate use accordingly. The responsible cannabis consumer will be vigilant as to conditions -- time, place, mood, etc. -- and does not hesitate to say "no" when those conditions are not conducive to a safe, pleasant and/or productive experience.

- The responsible cannabis user does not violate the rights of others, observes accepted standards of courtesy and public propriety, and respects the preferences of those who wish to avoid cannabis entirely. Regardless of the legal status of cannabis, responsible users will adhere to emerging tobacco smoking protocols in public and private places.

- Recommended time (pauses) between using the substance

- Use of cannabis, to the extent that it impairs health, personal development or achievement, is abuse and should be resisted by responsible cannabis users. Abuse means harm. Some cannabis use is harmful; most is not. That which is harmful should be discouraged; that which is not need not be.

### Research Chemicals

Cannabinoid research chemicals receive relatively frequent media coverage in cases of overdoses. This is generally because cannabinoids are often sold in blends without dosing information or sometimes even the active component - if you are looking to take cannabinoids in an informed manner, blends should be avoided unless accurate information is provided alongside it. When cannabinoids are bought in pure form, they are often active in the microgram range, and can be quite difficult to measure.

Overdoses of cannabinoids are generally known to cause hallucinatory experiences, which in turn often cause panic attacks. Larger overdoses may also cause heart issues. Repetitive heavy dosing of certain cannabinoids are suspected to cause organ damage.

See [Research Chemicals](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Research_Chemicals) for more information.

## Legal status

Both Cannabis and Tetrahydrocannabinols, the active chemicals contained in Cannabis plants, are Schedule I in the United States. This means they are federally illegal to cultivate, buy, possess, or distribute (sell, trade or give) in all forms (cannabis plants, extracts, hash, hash oil, thc, etc) except synthetic THC (Marinol) which is Schedule III.

Practically, simple possession of small amounts is almost never prosecuted federally.

The federal scheduling of Cannabis was disputed in 1988 by Judge Francis Young, an administrative law judge for the DEA, who recommended that marijuana be reclassified as schedule II on the grounds that if a respectable minority of doctors endorse it, then it has a "currently accepted medical use".

Cannabis has many reported medical uses and its active component is an approved drug in the US. The US government has, in the last 20 years, been forced to provide medical cannabis to 8 patients in the form of cannabis cigarettes although as a top level, federal policy has opposed any change in the status of cannabis to move it to a lower schedule. Over a dozen states now allow some provision for the medical use of cannabis, although only around 8 have effective protection (AK, CA, CO, HI, ME, NV, OR, WA).

Cannabis ( ) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cannabaceae that is widely accepted as being indigenous to and originating from the continent of Asia. However, the number of species is disputed, with as many as three species being recognized: Cannabis sativa, C. indica, and C. ruderalis. Alternatively, C. ruderalis may be included within C. sativa, or all three may be treated as subspecies of C. sativa, or C. sativa may be accepted as a single undivided species.
The plant is also known as hemp, although this term is usually used to refer only to varieties cultivated for non-drug use. Hemp has long been used for fibre, seeds and their oils, leaves for use as vegetables, and juice.  Industrial hemp textile products are made from cannabis plants selected to produce an abundance of fibre.
Cannabis also has a long history of being used for medicinal purposes, and as a recreational drug known by several slang terms, such as marijuana, ganja,  pot or weed. Various cannabis strains have been bred, often selectively to produce high or low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a cannabinoid and the plant's principal psychoactive constituent. Compounds such as hashish and hash oil are extracted from the plant. More recently, there has been interest in other cannabinoids like cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG), and cannabinol (CBN).

## Etymology

Cannabis is a Scythian word. The ancient Greeks learned of the use of cannabis  by observing Scythian funerals, during which cannabis was consumed. In Akkadian, cannabis was known as qunubu (𐎯𐎫𐎠𐎭𐏂). It has been claimed by a few scholars that he word was adopted in to the Hebrew language as qaneh bosem (קָנֶה בֹּשׂם), however there is little real backing for this view and other plants have been proposed being named that.

## Description

Cannabis is an annual, dioecious, flowering herb. The leaves are palmately compound or digitate, with serrate leaflets. The first pair of leaves usually have a single leaflet, the number gradually increasing up to a maximum of about thirteen leaflets per leaf (usually seven or nine), depending on variety and growing conditions. At the top of a flowering plant, this number again diminishes to a single leaflet per leaf. The lower leaf pairs usually occur in an opposite leaf arrangement and the upper leaf pairs in an alternate arrangement on the main stem of a mature plant.
The leaves have a peculiar and diagnostic venation pattern (which varies slightly among varieties) that allows for easy identification of Cannabis leaves from unrelated species with similar leaves. As is common in serrated leaves, each serration has a central vein extending to its tip, but in Cannabis this originates from lower down the central vein of the leaflet, typically opposite to the position of the second notch down. This means that on its way from the midrib of the leaflet to the point of the serration, the vein serving the tip of the serration passes close by the intervening notch. Sometimes the vein will pass tangentially to the notch, but often will pass by at a small distance; when the latter happens a spur vein (or occasionally two) branches off and joins the leaf margin at the deepest point of the notch. Tiny samples of Cannabis also can be identified with precision by microscopic examination of leaf cells and similar features, requiring special equipment and expertise.

### Reproduction

All known strains of Cannabis are wind-pollinated and the fruit is an achene. Most strains of Cannabis are short day plants, with the possible exception of C. sativa subsp. sativa var. spontanea (= C. ruderalis), which is commonly described as "auto-flowering" and may be day-neutral.
Cannabis is predominantly dioecious, having imperfect flowers, with staminate "male" and pistillate "female" flowers occurring on separate plants. "At a very early period the Chinese recognized the Cannabis plant as dioecious", and the (c. 3rd century BCE) Erya dictionary defined xi 枲 "male Cannabis" and fu 莩 (or ju 苴) "female Cannabis". Male flowers are normally borne on loose panicles, and female flowers are borne on racemes.
Many monoecious varieties have also been described, in which individual plants bear both male and female flowers. (Although monoecious plants are often referred to as "hermaphrodites", true hermaphrodites – which are less common in Cannabis – bear staminate and pistillate structures together on individual flowers, whereas monoecious plants bear male and female flowers at different locations on the same plant.) Subdioecy (the occurrence of monoecious individuals and dioecious individuals within the same population) is widespread. Many populations have been described as sexually labile.
As a result of intensive selection in cultivation, Cannabis exhibits many sexual phenotypes that can be described in terms of the ratio of female to male flowers occurring in the individual, or typical in the cultivar. Dioecious varieties are preferred for drug production, where the fruits (produced by female flowers) are used. Dioecious varieties are also preferred for textile fiber production, whereas monoecious varieties are preferred for pulp and paper production. It has been suggested that the presence of monoecy can be used to differentiate licit crops of monoecious hemp from illicit drug crops, but sativa strains often produce monoecious individuals, which is possibly as a result of inbreeding.

### Sex determination

Cannabis has been described as having one of the most complicated mechanisms of sex determination among the dioecious plants. Many models have been proposed to explain sex determination in Cannabis.
Based on studies of sex reversal in hemp, it was first reported by K. Hirata in 1924 that an XY sex-determination system is present. At the time, the XY system was the only known system of sex determination. The X:A system was first described in Drosophila spp in 1925. Soon thereafter, Schaffner disputed Hirata's interpretation, and published results from his own studies of sex reversal in hemp, concluding that an X:A system was in use and that furthermore sex was strongly influenced by environmental conditions.
Since then, many different types of sex determination systems have been discovered, particularly in plants. Dioecy is relatively uncommon in the plant kingdom, and a very low percentage of dioecious plant species have been determined to use the XY system. In most cases where the XY system is found it is believed to have evolved recently and independently.
Since the 1920s, a number of sex determination models have been proposed for Cannabis. Ainsworth describes sex determination in the genus as using "an X/autosome dosage type".
The question of whether heteromorphic sex chromosomes are indeed present is most conveniently answered if such chromosomes were clearly visible in a karyotype. Cannabis was one of the first plant species to be karyotyped; however, this was in a period when karyotype preparation was primitive by modern standards. Heteromorphic sex chromosomes were reported to occur in staminate individuals of dioecious "Kentucky" hemp, but were not found in pistillate individuals of the same variety. Dioecious "Kentucky" hemp was assumed to use an XY mechanism. Heterosomes were not observed in analyzed individuals of monoecious "Kentucky" hemp, nor in an unidentified German cultivar. These varieties were assumed to have sex chromosome composition XX. According to other researchers, no modern karyotype of Cannabis had been published as of 1996. Proponents of the XY system state that Y chromosome is slightly larger than the X, but difficult to differentiate cytologically.
More recently, Sakamoto and various co-authors have used random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) to isolate several genetic marker sequences that they name Male-Associated DNA in Cannabis (MADC), and which they interpret as indirect evidence of a male chromosome. Several other research groups have reported identification of male-associated markers using RAPD and amplified fragment length polymorphism. Ainsworth commented on these findings, stating,

It is not surprising that male-associated markers are relatively abundant. In dioecious plants where sex chromosomes have not been identified, markers for maleness indicate either the presence of sex chromosomes which have not been distinguished by cytological methods or that the marker is tightly linked to a gene involved in sex determination.
Environmental sex determination is known to occur in a variety of species. Many researchers have suggested that sex in Cannabis is determined or strongly influenced by environmental factors. Ainsworth reviews that treatment with auxin and ethylene have feminizing effects, and that treatment with cytokinins and gibberellins have masculinizing effects. It has been reported that sex can be reversed in Cannabis using chemical treatment. A polymerase chain reaction-based method for the detection of female-associated DNA polymorphisms by genotyping has been developed.

### Chemistry

Cannabis plants produce a large number of chemicals as part of their defense against herbivory. One group of these is called cannabinoids, which induce mental and physical effects when consumed.
Cannabinoids, terpenes, terpenoids, and other compounds are secreted by glandular trichomes that occur most abundantly on the floral calyxes and bracts of female plants.

### Genetics

Cannabis, like many organisms, is diploid, having a chromosome complement of 2n=20, although polyploid individuals have been artificially produced. The first genome sequence of Cannabis, which is estimated to be 820 Mb in size, was published in 2011 by a team of Canadian scientists.

## Taxonomy

The genus Cannabis was formerly placed in the nettle family (Urticaceae) or mulberry family (Moraceae), and later, along with the genus Humulus (hops), in a separate family, the hemp family (Cannabaceae sensu stricto). Recent phylogenetic studies based on cpDNA restriction site analysis and gene sequencing strongly suggest that the Cannabaceae sensu stricto arose from within the former family Celtidaceae, and that the two families should be merged to form a single monophyletic family, the Cannabaceae sensu lato.
Various types of Cannabis have been described, and variously classified as species, subspecies, or varieties:

plants cultivated for fiber and seed production, described as low-intoxicant, non-drug, or fiber types.
plants cultivated for drug production, described as high-intoxicant or drug types.
escaped, hybridised, or wild forms of either of the above types.
Cannabis plants produce a unique family of terpeno-phenolic compounds called cannabinoids, some of which produce the "high" which may be experienced from consuming marijuana. There are 483 identifiable chemical constituents known to exist in the cannabis plant, and at least 85 different cannabinoids have been isolated from the plant. The two cannabinoids usually produced in greatest abundance are cannabidiol (CBD) and/or Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), but only THC is psychoactive. Since the early 1970s, Cannabis plants have been categorized by their chemical phenotype or "chemotype", based on the overall amount of THC produced, and on the ratio of THC to CBD. Although overall cannabinoid production is influenced by environmental factors, the THC/CBD ratio is genetically determined and remains fixed throughout the life of a plant. Non-drug plants produce relatively low levels of THC and high levels of CBD, while drug plants produce high levels of THC and low levels of CBD. When plants of these two chemotypes cross-pollinate, the plants in the first filial (F1) generation have an intermediate chemotype and produce intermediate amounts of CBD and THC. Female plants of this chemotype may produce enough THC to be utilized for drug production.

Whether the drug and non-drug, cultivated and wild types of Cannabis constitute a single, highly variable species, or the genus is polytypic with more than one species, has been a subject of debate for well over two centuries. This is a contentious issue because there is no universally accepted definition of a species. One widely applied criterion for species recognition is that species are "groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations which are reproductively isolated from other such groups." Populations that are physiologically capable of interbreeding, but morphologically or genetically divergent and isolated by geography or ecology, are sometimes considered to be separate species. Physiological barriers to reproduction are not known to occur within Cannabis, and plants from widely divergent sources are interfertile. However, physical barriers to gene exchange (such as the Himalayan mountain range) might have enabled Cannabis gene pools to diverge before the onset of human intervention, resulting in speciation. It remains controversial whether sufficient morphological and genetic divergence occurs within the genus as a result of geographical or ecological isolation to justify recognition of more than one species.

### Early classifications

The genus Cannabis was first classified using the "modern" system of taxonomic nomenclature by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, who devised the system still in use for the naming of species. He considered the genus to be monotypic, having just a single species that he named Cannabis sativa L. Linnaeus was familiar with European hemp, which was widely cultivated at the time. This classification was supported by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon (in 1807), Lindley (in 1838) and De Candollee (in 1867). These first classification attempts resulted in a four group division:

Kif (southern hemp - psychoactive)
Vulgaris (intermediate - psychoactive and fiber)
Pedemontana (northern hemp - fiber)
Chinensis (northern hemp - fiber)
In 1785, evolutionary biologist Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck published a description of a second species of Cannabis, which he named Cannabis indica Lam. Lamarck based his description of the newly named species on morphological aspects (trichomes, leaf shape) and geographic localization of plant specimens collected in India. He described C. indica as having poorer fiber quality than C. sativa, but greater utility as an inebriant. Also, C. indica was considered smaller, by Lamarck. Also, woodier stems, alternate ramifications of the branches, narrow leaflets, and a villous calyx in the female flowers were characteristics noted by the botanist.
In 1843, William O'Shaughnessy, used "Indian hemp (C. indica)" in a work title. The author claimed that this choice wasn't based on a clear distinction between C. sativa and C. indica, but may have been influenced by the choice to use the term "Indian hemp" (linked to the plant's history in India), hence naming the species as indica.
Additional Cannabis species were proposed in the 19th century, including strains from China and Vietnam (Indo-China) assigned the names Cannabis chinensis Delile, and Cannabis gigantea Delile ex Vilmorin. However, many taxonomists found these putative species difficult to distinguish. In the early 20th century, the single-species concept (monotypic classification) was still widely accepted, except in the Soviet Union, where Cannabis continued to be the subject of active taxonomic study. The name Cannabis indica was listed in various Pharmacopoeias, and was widely used to designate Cannabis suitable for the manufacture of medicinal preparations.

### 20th century

In 1924, Russian botanist D.E. Janichevsky concluded that ruderal Cannabis in central Russia is either a variety of C. sativa or a separate species, and proposed C. sativa L. var. ruderalis Janisch, and Cannabis ruderalis Janisch, as alternative names. In 1929, renowned plant explorer Nikolai Vavilov assigned wild or feral populations of Cannabis in Afghanistan to C. indica Lam. var. kafiristanica Vav., and ruderal populations in Europe to C. sativa L. var. spontanea Vav. Vavilov, in 1931, proposed a three species system, independently reinforced by Schultes et al (1975) and Emboden (1974): C. sativa, C. indica and C. ruderalis.
In 1940, Russian botanists Serebriakova and Sizov proposed a complex poly-species classification in which they also recognized C. sativa and C. indica as separate species. Within C. sativa they recognized two subspecies: C. sativa L. subsp. culta Serebr. (consisting of cultivated plants), and C. sativa L. subsp. spontanea (Vav.) Serebr. (consisting of wild or feral plants). Serebriakova and Sizov split the two C. sativa subspecies into 13 varieties, including four distinct groups within subspecies culta. However, they did not divide C. indica into subspecies or varieties. Zhukovski, in 1950, also proposed a two-species system, but with C. sativa L. and C. ruderalis.
In the 1970s, the taxonomic classification of Cannabis took on added significance in North America. Laws prohibiting Cannabis in the United States and Canada specifically named products of C. sativa as prohibited materials. Enterprising attorneys for the defense in a few drug busts argued that the seized Cannabis material may not have been C. sativa, and was therefore not prohibited by law. Attorneys on both sides recruited botanists to provide expert testimony. Among those testifying for the prosecution was Dr. Ernest Small, while Dr. Richard E. Schultes and others testified for the defense. The botanists engaged in heated debate (outside of court), and both camps impugned the other's integrity. The defense attorneys were not often successful in winning their case, because the intent of the law was clear. 

In 1976, Canadian botanist Ernest Small and American taxonomist Arthur Cronquist published a taxonomic revision that recognizes a single species of Cannabis with two subspecies (hemp or drug; based on THC and CBD levels) and two varieties in each (domesticated or wild). The framework is thus:
C. sativa L. subsp. sativa, presumably selected for traits that enhance fiber or seed production.
C. sativa L. subsp. sativa var. sativa, domesticated variety.
C. sativa L. subsp. sativa var. spontanea Vav., wild or escaped variety.
C. sativa L. subsp. indica (Lam.) Small & Cronq., primarily selected for drug production.
C. sativa L. subsp. indica var. indica, domesticated variety.
C. sativa subsp. indica var. kafiristanica (Vav.) Small & Cronq, wild or escaped variety.
This classification was based on several factors including interfertility, chromosome uniformity, chemotype, and numerical analysis of phenotypic characters.
Professors William Emboden, Loran Anderson, and Harvard botanist Richard E. Schultes and coworkers also conducted taxonomic studies of Cannabis in the 1970s, and concluded that stable morphological differences exist that support recognition of at least three species, C. sativa, C. indica, and C. ruderalis. For Schultes, this was a reversal of his previous interpretation that Cannabis is monotypic, with only a single species. According to Schultes' and Anderson's descriptions, C. sativa is tall and laxly branched with relatively narrow leaflets, C. indica is shorter, conical in shape, and has relatively wide leaflets, and C. ruderalis is short, branchless, and grows wild in Central Asia. This taxonomic interpretation was embraced by Cannabis aficionados who commonly distinguish narrow-leafed "sativa" strains from wide-leafed "indica" strains. McPartland's review finds the Schultes taxonomy inconsistent with prior work (protologs) and partly responsible for the popular usage.

### Continuing research

Molecular analytical techniques developed in the late 20th century are being applied to questions of taxonomic classification. This has resulted in many reclassifications based on evolutionary systematics. Several studies of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and other types of genetic markers have been conducted on drug and fiber strains of Cannabis, primarily for plant breeding and forensic purposes. Dutch Cannabis researcher E.P.M. de Meijer and coworkers described some of their RAPD studies as showing an "extremely high" degree of genetic polymorphism between and within populations, suggesting a high degree of potential variation for selection, even in heavily selected hemp cultivars. They also commented that these analyses confirm the continuity of the Cannabis gene pool throughout the studied accessions, and provide further confirmation that the genus consists of a single species, although theirs was not a systematic study per se.
An investigation of genetic, morphological, and chemotaxonomic variation among 157 Cannabis accessions of known geographic origin, including fiber, drug, and feral populations showed cannabinoid variation in Cannabis germplasm. The patterns of cannabinoid variation support recognition of C. sativa and C. indica as separate species, but not C. ruderalis. C. sativa contains fiber and seed landraces, and feral populations, derived from Europe, Central Asia, and Turkey. Narrow-leaflet and wide-leaflet drug accessions, southern and eastern Asian hemp accessions, and feral Himalayan populations were assigned to C. indica. In 2005, a genetic analysis of the same set of accessions led to a three-species classification, recognizing C. sativa, C. indica, and (tentatively) C. ruderalis. Another paper in the series on chemotaxonomic variation in the terpenoid content of the essential oil of Cannabis revealed that several wide-leaflet drug strains in the collection had relatively high levels of certain sesquiterpene alcohols, including guaiol and isomers of eudesmol, that set them apart from the other putative taxa.
A 2020 analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms reports five clusters of cannabis, roughly corresponding to hemps (including folk "Ruderalis") folk "Indica" and folk "Sativa".
Despite advanced analytical techniques, much of the cannabis used recreationally is inaccurately classified. One laboratory at the University of British Columbia found that Jamaican Lamb's Bread, claimed to be 100% sativa, was in fact almost 100% indica (the opposite strain). Legalization of cannabis in Canada (as of 17 October 2018) may help spur private-sector research, especially in terms of diversification of strains. It should also improve classification accuracy for cannabis used recreationally. Legalization coupled with Canadian government (Health Canada) oversight of production and labelling will likely result in more—and more accurate—testing to determine exact strains and content. Furthermore, the rise of craft cannabis growers in Canada should ensure quality, experimentation/research, and diversification of strains among private-sector producers.

### Popular usage

The scientific debate regarding taxonomy has had little effect on the terminology in widespread use among cultivators and users of drug-type Cannabis. Cannabis aficionados recognize three distinct types based on such factors as morphology, native range, aroma, and subjective psychoactive characteristics. "Sativa" is the most widespread variety, which is usually tall, laxly branched, and found in warm lowland regions. "Indica" designates shorter, bushier plants adapted to cooler climates and highland environments. "Ruderalis" is the informal name for the short plants that grow wild in Europe and Central Asia.
Mapping the morphological concepts to scientific names in the Small 1976 framework, "Sativa" generally refers to C. sativa subsp. indica var. indica, "Indica" generally refers to C. sativa subsp. i. kafiristanica (also known as afghanica), and "Ruderalis", being lower in THC, is the one that can fall into C. sativa subsp. sativa. The three names fit in Schultes's framework better, if one overlooks its inconsistencies with prior work. Definitions of the three terms using factors other than morphology produces different, often conflicting results.
Breeders, seed companies, and cultivators of drug type Cannabis often describe the ancestry or gross phenotypic characteristics of cultivars by categorizing them as "pure indica", "mostly indica", "indica/sativa", "mostly sativa", or "pure sativa". These categories are highly arbitrary, however: one "AK-47" hybrid strain has received both "Best Sativa" and "Best Indica" awards.

### Phylogeny

Cannabis likely split from its closest relative, Humulus (hops), during the mid Oligocene, around 27.8 million years ago according to molecular clock estimates. The centre of origin of Cannabis is likely in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. The pollen of Humulus and Cannabis are very similar and difficult to distinguish. The oldest pollen thought to be from Cannabis is from Ningxia, China, on the boundary between the Tibetan Plateau and the Loess Plateau, dating to the early Miocene, around 19.6 million years ago. Cannabis was widely distributed over Asia by the Late Pleistocene. The oldest known Cannabis in South Asia dates to around 32,000 years ago.

## Uses

Cannabis is used for a wide variety of purposes.

### History

According to genetic and archaeological evidence, cannabis was first domesticated about 12,000 years ago in East Asia during the early Neolithic period. The use of cannabis as a mind-altering drug has been documented by archaeological finds in prehistoric societies in Eurasia and Africa. The oldest written record of cannabis usage is the Greek historian Herodotus's reference to the central Eurasian Scythians taking cannabis steam baths. His Histories (c. 440 BCE) records, "The Scythians, as I said, take some of this hemp-seed [presumably, flowers], and, creeping under the felt coverings, throw it upon the red-hot stones; immediately it smokes, and gives out such a vapour as no Greek vapour-bath can exceed; the Scyths, delighted, shout for joy." 
In China, the psychoactive properties of cannabis are described in the Shennong Bencaojing (3rd century AD). Cannabis smoke was inhaled by Daoists, who burned it in incense burners.
In the Middle East, use spread throughout the Islamic empire to North Africa. In 1545, cannabis spread to the western hemisphere where Spaniards imported it to Chile for its use as fiber. In North America, cannabis, in the form of hemp, was grown for use in rope, cloth and paper.
Cannabinol (CBN) was the first compound to be isolated from cannabis extract in the late 1800s. Its structure and chemical synthesis were achieved by 1940, followed by some of the first preclinical research studies to determine the effects of individual cannabis-derived compounds in vivo.
Globally, in 2013, 60,400 kilograms of cannabis were produced legally.

### Recreational use

Cannabis is a popular recreational drug around the world, only behind alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco. In the U.S. alone, it is believed that over 100 million Americans have tried cannabis, with 25 million Americans having used it within the past year. As a drug it usually comes in the form of dried marijuana, hashish, or various extracts collectively known as hashish oil.
Normal cognition is restored after approximately three hours for larger doses via a smoking pipe, bong or vaporizer. However, if a large amount is taken orally the effects may last much longer. After 24 hours to a few days, minuscule psychoactive effects may be felt, depending on dosage, frequency and tolerance to the drug.
Cannabidiol (CBD), which has no intoxicating effects by itself (although sometimes showing a small stimulant effect, similar to caffeine), is thought to reduce the anxiety-inducing effects of high doses of THC, particularly if administered orally prior to THC exposure.
According to Delphic analysis by British researchers in 2007, cannabis has a lower risk factor for dependence compared to both nicotine and alcohol. However, everyday use of cannabis may be correlated with psychological withdrawal symptoms, such as irritability or insomnia, and susceptibility to a panic attack may increase as levels of THC metabolites rise. Cannabis withdrawal symptoms are typically mild and are not life-threatening. Risk of adverse outcomes from cannabis use may be reduced by implementation of evidence-based education and intervention tools communicated to the public with practical regulation measures.
In 2014 there were an estimated 182.5 million cannabis users worldwide (3.8% of the global population aged 15–64). This percentage did not change significantly between 1998 and 2014.

### Medical use

Medical cannabis (or medical marijuana) refers to the use of cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids, in an effort to treat disease or improve symptoms. Cannabis is used to reduce nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy, to improve appetite in people with HIV/AIDS, and to treat chronic pain and muscle spasms. Cannabinoids are under preliminary research for their potential to affect stroke. Evidence is lacking for depression, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, and psychosis. Two extracts of cannabis – dronabinol and nabilone – are approved by the FDA as medications in pill form for treating the side effects of chemotherapy and AIDS.
Short-term use increases both minor and major adverse effects. Common side effects include dizziness, feeling tired, vomiting, and hallucinations. Long-term effects of cannabis are not clear. Concerns including memory and cognition problems, risk of addiction, schizophrenia in young people, and the risk of children taking it by accident.

### Industrial use (hemp)

The term hemp is used to name the durable soft fiber from the Cannabis plant stem (stalk). Cannabis sativa cultivars are used for fibers due to their long stems; Sativa varieties may grow more than six metres tall. However, hemp can refer to any industrial or foodstuff product that is not intended for use as a drug. Many countries regulate limits for psychoactive compound (THC) concentrations in products labeled as hemp.
Cannabis for industrial uses is valuable in tens of thousands of commercial products, especially as fibre ranging from paper, cordage, construction material and textiles in general, to clothing. Hemp is stronger and longer-lasting than cotton. It also is a useful source of foodstuffs (hemp milk, hemp seed, hemp oil) and biofuels. Hemp has been used by many civilizations, from China to Europe (and later North America) during the last 12,000 years. In modern times novel applications and improvements have been explored with modest commercial success.
In the US, "industrial hemp" is classified by the federal government as cannabis containing no more than 0.3% THC by dry weight. This classification was established in the 2018 Farm Bill and was refined to include hemp-sourced extracts, cannabinoids, and derivatives in the definition of hemp.

### Ancient and religious uses

The cannabis plant has a history of medicinal use dating back thousands of years across many cultures. The Yanghai Tombs, a vast ancient cemetery (54 000 m2) situated in the Turfan district of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in northwest China, have revealed the 2700-year-old grave of a shaman. He is thought to have belonged to the Jushi culture recorded in the area centuries later in the Hanshu, Chap 96B. Near the head and foot of the shaman was a large leather basket and wooden bowl filled with 789g of cannabis, superbly preserved by climatic and burial conditions. An international team demonstrated that this material contained THC. The cannabis was presumably employed by this culture as a medicinal or psychoactive agent, or an aid to divination. This is the oldest documentation of cannabis as a pharmacologically active agent. The earliest evidence of cannabis smoking has been found in the 2,500-year-old tombs of Jirzankal Cemetery in the Pamir Mountains in Western China, where cannabis residue were found in burners with charred pebbles possibly used during funeral rituals.
Settlements which date from c. 2200–1700 BCE in the Bactria and Margiana contained elaborate ritual structures with rooms containing everything needed for making drinks containing extracts from poppy (opium), hemp (cannabis), and ephedra (which contains ephedrine). Although there is no evidence of ephedra being used by steppe tribes, they engaged in cultic use of hemp. Cultic use ranged from Romania to the Yenisei River and had begun by 3rd millennium BC Smoking hemp has been found at Pazyryk.
Cannabis is first referred to in Hindu Vedas between 2000 and 1400 BCE, in the Atharvaveda. By the 10th century CE, it has been suggested that it was referred to by some in India as "food of the gods". Cannabis use eventually became a ritual part of the Hindu festival of Holi. One of the earliest to use this plant in medical purposes was Korakkar, one of the 18 Siddhas. The plant is called Korakkar Mooli in the Tamil language, meaning Korakkar's herb.
In Buddhism, cannabis is generally regarded as an intoxicant and may be a hindrance to development of meditation and clear awareness. In ancient Germanic culture, cannabis was associated with the Norse love goddess, Freya. An anointing oil mentioned in Exodus is, by some translators, said to contain cannabis.
In modern times, the Rastafari movement has embraced cannabis as a sacrament. Elders of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, a religious movement founded in the U.S. in 1975 with no ties to either Ethiopia or the Coptic Church, consider cannabis to be the Eucharist, claiming it as an oral tradition from Ethiopia dating back to the time of Christ. Like the Rastafari, some modern Gnostic Christian sects have asserted that cannabis is the Tree of Life. Other organized religions founded in the 20th century that treat cannabis as a sacrament are the THC Ministry, Cantheism, the Cannabis Assembly and the Church of Cognizance.
Since the 13th century CE, cannabis has been used among Sufis – the mystical interpretation of Islam that exerts strong influence over local Muslim practices in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Turkey, and Pakistan. Cannabis preparations are frequently used at Sufi festivals in those countries. Pakistan's Shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in Sindh province is particularly renowned for the widespread use of cannabis at the shrine's celebrations, especially its annual Urs festival and Thursday evening dhamaal sessions – or meditative dancing sessions.
