## Summary
Changa () is a blend of N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) mixed with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). The addition of MAOIs extends the DMT experience in duration and intensity when compared with smoking DMT freebase alone. Typically, extracts from DMT-containing plants are combined with a blend of different MAOI-containing herbs, such as the ayahuasca vine, and/or leaf or harmala alkaloids from Peganum harmala ("Syrian rue") to create a mix that is 25 to 50% DMT.

## History
Changa was purportedly named and developed by Australian Julian Palmer in 2003–2004. As a principle, however, the basic idea of simultaneous smoking of Harmala alkaloids and DMT, and subsequent altering of effects and duration is documented as long ago as 1994 . The alteration of smoked  DMT effects by smoking B. caapi, separately is reported by Gracie and Zarkov in 1983 . Palmer claims the name came to him during an ayahuasca session.  From the mid-2000s, Palmer promoted the blend internationally, introducing it at festivals and gatherings across Europe, Asia, Africa and South America. The 2008 Boom Festival in Portugal is often cited as a key moment in changa's spread beyond Australia.
The blend gained popularity due to its ease of use compared to vaporising freebase DMT, as well as its longer duration of effect (approximately 10–20 minutes).

## Etymology
The name "changa" was coined by Palmer, who has said it came to him during an ayahuasca session. The intended Australian pronunciation is  (CHANG-ah), though regional variations exist, with European users typically pronouncing it CHUN-gah and North American users CHARN-gah. The word coincidentally has meanings in other languages, including Punjabi (an expression of approval) and Spanish (slang for a female monkey).

## Composition
Changa consists of two primary components: dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), typically derived from plant sources such as Banisteriopsis caapi or Peganum harmala (Syrian rue).
Blend compositions vary widely, with DMT concentrations typically ranging from 25 to 50 percent. Doses vary substantially from one sample to the next depending on ingredients and ratios.
Palmer's "classic" formulation consists of:

30% Banisteriopsis caapi vine and/or leaf
20% mullein
20% passionflower
20% peppermint
5% calendula
5% blue lotus
Palmer has noted that while many herbs can be used, the MAOI component "activates" other herbs in the blend, and new additions may have unpredictable effects.

## In popular culture
Australian electronic trio Pnau titled their November 2017 album Changa in homage to the substance. It reached a peak of number 11 on the ARIA charts.
The 2022 Australian film Everything in Between opens with a scene in which the protagonist smokes what is implied to be changa, leading into a hallucinogenic experience.
