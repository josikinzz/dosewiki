## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as morphinans. These are polycyclic compounds with a four-ring skeleton with three condensed six-member rings forming a partially hydrogenated phenanthrene moiety, one of which is aromatic while the two others are alicyclic.

### Background

Hydrocodone is a synthetic opioid derivative of codeine.
14
It is commonly used in combination with
acetaminophen
to control moderate to severe pain. Historically, hydrocodone has been used as a cough suppressant although this has largely been replaced by
dextromethorphan
in current cough and cold formulations. Hydrocodone's more potent metabolite,
hydromorphone
has also found wide use as an analgesic and is frequently used in cases of severe pain. The FDA first approved Hydrocodone for use as part of the cough suppressant syrup Hycodan in March of 1943.
17

### Indication

Hydrocodone is indicated for the management of acute pain, sometimes in combination with
acetaminophen
or
ibuprofen
, as well as the symptomatic treatment of the common cold and allergic rhinitis in combination with decongestants, antihistamines, and expectorants.
Label
,
16

### Pharmacodynamics

Hydrocodone inhibits pain signaling in both the spinal cord and brain
12
. Its actions in the brain also produce euphoria, respiratory depression, and sedation.

### Mechanism of Action

Mu-type opioid receptor
Agonist
Delta-type opioid receptor
Agonist

### Absorption

The absolute bioavailability of hydrocodone has not been characterized due to lack of an IV formulation. The liquid formulations of hydrocodone have a Tmax of 0.83-1.33 h.
3
,
5
The extended release tablet formulations have a Tmax of 14-16 h.
Label
The Cmax remains dose proportional over the range of 2.5-10 mg in liquid formulations and 20-120 mg in extended release formulations.
3
,
5
,
Label
Administration with food increases Cmax by about 27% while Tmax and AUC remain the same.
6
Administration with 40% ethanol has been observed to increase Cmax 2-fold with an approximate 20% increase in AUC with no change in Tmax. 20% alcohol produces no significant effect.

### Metabolism

Hydrocodone undergoes oxidative O-demethylation to form
hydromorphone
, a more potent active metabolite.
8
Though hydromorphone is active it is not present in sufficient quantities to contribute significantly to hydrocodone's therapeutic effects.
1
Both hydrocodone and hydromorphone form 6-α- and 6-β-hydroxy metabolites through 6-ketoreduction. The hydroxy metabolites and hydromorphone can form glucuronide conjugates. Hydrocodone also undergoes oxidative N-demthylation to norhydrocodone. O-demethylation is primarily catalyzed by CYP2D6 while N-demethylation is primarily CYP3A4.

### Toxicity

Overdosage with hydrocodone presents as opioid intoxication including respiratory depression, somnolence, coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death.
15
In case of oversdosage the foremost priority is the maintenance of a patent and protected airway with the provision of assisted ventilation if necessary. Supportive measures such as IV fluids, supplemental oxygen, and vasopressors may be used to manage circulatory shock.
15
Advanced life support may be necessary in the case of cardiac arrest or arrhythmias. Opioid antagonists such as
naloxone
may be used to reverse the respiratory and circulatory effects of hydrocodone. Emergency monitoring is still required after naloxone administration as the opioid effects may reappear. Additionally, if used in an opioid tolerant patient, naloxone may produce opioid withdrawal symptoms.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
1,2-Benzodiazepine may increase the central nervous system depressant (CNS depressant) activities of Hydrocodone.
Abametapir
The serum concentration of Hydrocodone can be increased when it is combined with Abametapir.
Abatacept
The metabolism of Hydrocodone can be increased when combined with Abatacept.
Abiraterone
The metabolism of Hydrocodone can be decreased when combined with Abiraterone.
Acebutolol
The metabolism of Hydrocodone can be decreased when combined with Acebutolol.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol. Profound CNS depression, including sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may occur.
Take with or without food. Cmax and AUC are not altered by food in a clinically significant way.

### Mechanism of action

Hydrocodone binds to the mu opioid receptor (MOR) with the highest affinity followed by the delta opioid receptors (DOR).
13
Hydrocodone's agonist effect at the MOR is considered to contribute the most to its analgesic effects. Both MOR and DOR are Gi/o coupled and and produces its signal through activation of inward rectifier potassium (GIRK) channels, inhibition of voltage gated calcium channel opening, and decreased adenylyl cyclase activity.
14
In the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, activation of pre-synaptic MOR on primary afferents the inhibition of calcium channel opening and increased activity of GIRK channels hyperpolarizes the neuron and prevents release of neurotransmitters. Post-synaptic MOR can also prevent activation of neurons by glutamate through the aforementioned mechanisms.
Hydrocodone can also produce several actions in the brain similarly to other opioids. 
Activation of MOR in the periaquaductal gray (PAG) inhibits the GABAergic tone on medulo-spinal neurons.
14
,
12
This allows these neurons, which project to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, to suppress pain signalling in secondary afferents by activating inhibitory interneurons. MOR can also inhibit GABAergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, removing the inhibitory tone on dopaminergic neurons in the nucleus accumbens and contributing to the activation of the brain's reward and addiction pathway. The inhibitory action or MOR likely contributes to respiratory depression, sedation, and suppression of the cough reflex.
Activation of DOR may contribute to analgesia through the above mechanisms but has not been well studied.

### Volume of distribution

The apparent volume of distribution ranges widely in published literature. The official FDA labeling reports a value of 402 L.
Label
Pharmacokinetic studies report values from 210-714 L with higher values associated with higher doses or single dose studies and lower values associated with lower doses and multiple dose studies.
2
,
3
,
4
,
5
Hydrocodone has been observed in human breast milk at levels equivalent to 1.6% of the maternal dosage.
11
Only 12 of the 30 women studied had detectable concentrations of hydromorphone at mean levels of 0.3 mcg/kg/day.

### Protein binding

Hydrocodone is 36% bound to plasma proteins.
Label

### Route of elimination

Most hydrocodone appears to be eliminated via a non-renal route as renal clearance is substantially lower than total apparent clearance.
Label
Hepatic metabolism may account for a portion of this, however the slight increase in serum concentration and AUC seen in hepatic impairment indicates a different primary route of elimination.

### Clearance

Official FDA labeling reports an apparent clearance of 83 L/h.
Label
Pharmacokinetic studies report values ranging from 24.5-58.8 L/h largely dependent on CYP2D6 metabolizer status.

### General Function

A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (PubMed:18577768, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:18577768, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Hydroxylates PUFA specifically at the omega-1 position (PubMed:18577768). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of PUFA (PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997). Also metabolizes plant monoterpenes such as limonene. Oxygenates (R)- and (S)-limonene to produce carveol and perillyl alcohol (PubMed:11950794). Responsible for the metabolism of a number of therapeutic agents such as the anticonvulsant drug S-mephenytoin, omeprazole, proguanil, certain barbiturates, diazepam, propranolol, citalopram and imipramine. Hydroxylates fenbendazole at the 4' position (PubMed:23959307)

### Specific Function

(R)-limonene 6-monooxygenase activity

### Gene Name

Hydrocodone is a semisynthetic narcotic analgesic and antitussive with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of codeine. Most of these involve the central nervous system and smooth muscle. The precise mechanism of action of hydrocodone and other opiates is not known, although it is believed to relate to the existance of opiate receptors in the central nervous system. In addition to analgesia, narcotics may produce drowsiness, changes in mood and mental clouding.
 
CAUTION & DISCLAIMER #
 
Erowid's effects information is a summary of data gathered from users, research, and other resources. This information is intended to describe the range of effects people report experiencing. Effects may vary dramatically from one person to another or one experience to another based on a variety of factors such as body chemistry, age, gender, physical health, dose, form of material, etc.

Hydrocodone Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
 
Hydrocodone is most commonly sold as "Vicodin", produced by Knoll Laboratories. Each tablet contains both hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen/paracetamol. It comes in tablet form and is taken orally. Vicodin tablets come in three different strengths ( [see image](https://erowid.org/pharms/show_image.php?i=hydrocodone/vicodin_tablet1.jpg) ). Starting in late 2012, Vicodin brand reforumulated their hydrocodone containing tablets to lower the amount of acetaminophen in each tablet to 300mg, reducing the risk of injury or death from liver damage.

**Onset : 30-90 minutes (depending on stomach contents) Duration : Normal After Effects :**
 
 Acetaminophen/paracetamol can cause liver problems at high doses. It may not be safe for heavy alcohol drinkers or those with liver problems to take more than 2 or 3 Vicodin tablets at one time. Some people take more than this recreationally, but it is generally not a good idea.
 
**Every individual reacts differently to every chemical. Know your Body - Know your Mind - Know your Substance - Know your Source.

**Hydrocodone (Vicodin) Health Concerns** 
 **by Erowid** 
 
 
*** Every individual reacts differently to every substance. * Be mindful at every step. * Know your body. Know your mind. Know your source.** **Respiratory Depression:** 
 At high doses or in sensitive patients, hydrocodone may produce dose-related respiratory depression by acting directly on the brain stem respiratory center. Hydrocodone also affects the center that controls respiratory rhythm, and may produce irregular and periodic breathing. 
 
 **Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure:** 
 The respiratory depressant effects of narcotics and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure. Furthermore, narcotics produce adverse reactions which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries. 
 
 **Acute Abdominal Conditions:** 
 The administration of narcotics may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions. 
 
 **Drug Interactions:** 
 Be careful when combining hydrocodone with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, narcotics, antihistamines, antipsychotics, and anti-anxiety agents. The use of MAO inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants with hydrocodone preparations may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone.

Hydrocodone (Vicodin)
 
Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Hydrocodone**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Scheduled
- SCHEDULE: Schedule II
- CLASSIFICATION: Opiate
 
Hydrocodone and any products which contain it are Schedule II in the United States. This means they are illegal to sell without a DEA license and illegal to buy or possess without a license or prescription. 
 
 Prior to October 6, 2014, products containing less than 15 mg hydrocodone per dosage unit were Schedule III in the United States. Almost all prescription hydrocodone was prescribed in Schedule III dose units (e.g. Vicodin). In 2013, an FDA advisory panel recommending moving these Schedule III preparations into Schedule II at the DEA's request. Further, a group of US congresspeople pressured the FDA to follow that recommendation, and the change in schedule took effect the following year. See [the DEA ruling](http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/rules/2014/fr0822.htm) , [the FDA commentary](http://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2014/10/re-scheduling-prescription-hydrocodone-combination-drug-products-an-important-step-toward-controlling-misuse-and-abuse/) , and [. Schedule II drug prescriptions may only be refilled with a written prescription.](https://www.pharmacist.com/hydrocodone-moved-schedule-ii-dea-final-rule)
 
U.S. STATE LAW #
 
While most state laws are consistent with the federal scheduling system, they can and do vary from state to state. As most prosecutions happen at the state level it is important to be familiar with your [state](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/law_states.shtml) and local laws.
 
INTERNATIONAL LAW #
 
Canada #
 
Although there are many rumors stating that products containing hydrocodone may be purchased over-the-counter in Canada, it appears that Hydrocodone is a [Schedule I drug in Canada](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/law_canada.shtml) , requiring a prescription.
 
China (Macau) #
 
We have heard that products containing hydrocodone (such as Vicodin) can be purchased over-the-counter in Macau.
 
Colombia #
 
One visitor reported that tramadal, codeine with acetaminophen, hydrocodone with ibuprofen (5/200), and dihydrocodeine by itself can be purchased in Colombia over the counter in any drug store. (unconfirmed) (thanks p) (last updated Jun 12 2013)
 
Germany #
 
Hydrocodone is BTM Anlage 3 in Germany making it illegal to possess without a BTM prescription. (unconfirmed) (thanks PM)
 
Italy #
 
Although one contributor told us hydrocodone is available over-the-counter, this may be incorrect. We have also been told by more than one submitter that it is available only behind the counter, where a pharmacist can choose whether or not to dispense it if there is no prescription. (unconfirmed) (thanks N, J)
 
Mexico #
 
Prescription only. Although there are rumors that products containing hydrocodone may be purchased over-the-counter in Mexico, we have been unable to verify these rumors, instead finding that hydrocodone is either available only by prescription or perhaps not available at all, even with a prescription. Lortab, Vicodin, etc are reportedly widely available on the black market (last updated Jan 2004).
 
Netherlands #
 
Hydrocodone is Schedule I and thus prescription-only in the Netherlands. This makes it illegal to possess without a prescription or license. See [http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0014405/geldigheidsdatum_13-05-2013](http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0014405/geldigheidsdatum_13-05-2013) (thanks r) (last updated May 13, 2013)
 
Thailand #
 
We have been told that hydrocodone is not available over-the-counter or by prescription in Thailand. (unconfirmed) (thanks M)
 
U.K. #
 
Hydrocodone is [Schedule II/Class A](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/uk/uk_law_definitions.shtml) in the U.K., making it illegal to buy or possess without a prescription.

## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: 3 mg
- Light: 5 - 10 mg
- Common: 10 - 25 mg
- Strong: 25 - 40 mg
- Heavy: 40 mg +

**Duration:**
- Total: 4 - 8 hours
- Onset: 10 - 60 minutes
**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) , [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or other [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Hydrocodone** (commonly sold as **Vicodin** or **Norco** when combined with paracetamol) is a semi-synthetic [opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) [morphinan](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphinan) synthesized or chemically derived from [codeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Codeine) , one of the opioid alkaloids found in the opium poppy. It is a narcotic [analgesic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) used [orally](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration#oral) as a [cough suppressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cough_suppression) , but also commonly taken orally for relief of moderate to severe pain. Those who take hydrocodone for recreational purposes report a sense of relaxation and euphoria, especially at higher doses.

Hydrocodone is prescribed predominantly within the United States, with the International Narcotics Control Board reporting that 99% of the worldwide supply in 2007 was consumed in the United States.

Like many opioids, such as [dextropropoxyphene](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dextropropoxyphene) , hydrocodone is often combined with acetaminophen (paracetamol) to enhance analgesia and deter abuse. Acetaminophen overdoses and long-term use, often due to recreational use, can cause serious or fatal liver damage. Currently, the only brand of hydrocodone in the United States that does not have acetaminophen is **Zohydro ER** which comes in doses of up to 50mg.

## Chemistry

Hydrocodone, or 3-methyl-dihydromorphinone, is an opioid of the morphinan class. Hydrocodone and other molecules of this class contain a polycyclic core of three benzene rings fused in a zig-zag pattern called a phenanthrene. A fourth nitrogen-containing ring is fused to the phenanthrene at R 9 and R 13 , with the nitrogen member looking at R 17 of the combined structure. This structure is called morphinan.

Hydrocodone, along with other morphinans, contains an ether bridge between two of its rings, connecting R 4 and R 5 through an oxygen group. It contains a carbonyl group bound at R 6 and a methyl group located on the nitrogen atom at R 17 . The carbon-oxygen double bond of the carbonyl saturates the benzene ring it is bonded with, thus hydrocodone lacks the double bond on that ring found in [codeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Codeine) .

Hydrocodone also shares the 3-methoxy substitution found in codeine; the two differ only from their R 6 substituents. Hydrocodone is analogous to the other morphinans including [dihydrocodeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dihydrocodeine) , [heroin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heroin) , [ethylmorphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ethylmorphine) , [codeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Codeine) , and [oxycodone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Oxycodone) .

## Pharmacology

The [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) , [anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) and [pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) effects appear to stem from the way in which [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) mimic endogenous endorphins. Endorphins are responsible for analgesia (reducing pain), causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or excitement. This mimicking of natural endorphins results in the drug's effects. It acts primarily on μ-opioid receptors, with about six times lesser affinity to δ-opioid receptors.

In the liver, hydrocodone is transformed into several metabolites. It has a serum half-life that averages 3.8 hours. The hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6 converts it into [hydromorphone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hydromorphone) , a more potent opioid.

Taking hydrocodone with grapefruit juice may enhance its psychoactive effects. It is hypothesized that the CYP3A4 inhibitors in grapefruit juice may interfere with the metabolism of hydrocodone, although there has been no research into this issue.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - At higher dosages, this compound can result in feelings of sedation but is considerably less sedating than that of [codeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Codeine) , [oxycodone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Oxycodone) or [heroin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diacetylmorphine) .
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)**
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - Physical euphoria on hydrocodone is commonly described as less intense when compared with [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) or [heroin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diacetylmorphine) . The sensation itself can be described as extreme feelings of intense physical comfort, warmth, pleasure and bliss which spreads throughout the body.
- **[Itchiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Itchiness)** - This compound presents greater amounts of itchiness due to higher amounts of histamine release in comparison to other [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)** - At low to moderate doses, this effect results in the sensation that breaths are slowed down mildly to moderately, but does not cause noticeable impairment. At high doses and overdoses, opioid-induced respiratory depression can result in a shortness of breath, abnormal breathing patterns, semi-consciousness, or unconsciousness. Severe overdoses can result in a coma or death without immediate medical attention.
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Constipation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Constipation)**
- **[Cough suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cough_suppression)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

Hydrocodone has not been shown to be toxic and is physically benign at reasonable dosages. As with all opioids, long-term effects can vary but can include diminished libido, apathy and memory loss. Some people may also have an allergic reaction to hydrocodone, such as the swelling of skin and rashes. It is potentially fatal at heavy dosages.

Like most opioids, unadulterated hydrocodone at appropriate dosages does not cause many long-term complications other than dependence and [constipation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Constipation) . Outside of the extremely powerful addiction and physical dependence, the harmful or toxic aspects of opioid usage are exclusively associated with not taking the necessary precautions in regards to its administration, overdosing and using impure products. Hydrocodone commonly being mixed with acetaminophen (paracetamol) however can complicate the drug’s safety profile due to acetaminophen’s toxicity on the liver.

Heavy dosages of hydrocodone can result in [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) , leading onto fatal or dangerous levels of anoxia (oxygen deprivation). This occurs because the breathing reflex is suppressed by [agonism](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonists) of [µ-opioid receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid_receptors) proportional to the dosage consumed. When hydrocodone is paired with acetaminophen however (as is the case with many pharmaceutical preparations of hydrocodone), liver toxicity or even acute liver failure becomes a significant risk, especially if mixed with alcohol; on top of hydrocodone and alcohol’s already heightened risk for possibly inducing dangerous levels of respiratory depression.

Hydrocodone (on its own) can also cause nausea and vomiting; a significant number of deaths attributed to opioid overdose are caused by aspiration of vomit by an unconscious victim. This is when an unconscious or semi-conscious user who is lying on their back vomits into their mouth and unknowingly suffocates. It can be prevented by ensuring that one is lying on their side with their head tilted downwards so that the airways cannot be blocked in the event of vomiting while unconscious (also known as the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) ). In case of overdose, it is advised to administer a dose of [naloxone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Naloxone) intravenously or intramuscularly to reverse the effects of opioid agonism.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Dependence and abuse potential

As with other opiate-based painkillers, the chronic use of hydrocodone can be considered moderately addictive and is capable of causing both physical and psychological dependence. When physical dependence has developed, [withdrawal symptoms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids#Discontinuation) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage. Most of these symptoms (like with other opioids) are somatic in their manifestation.

Tolerance to many of the effects of hydrocodone develops with prolonged use, including therapeutic effects. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Hydrocodone presents cross-tolerance with all [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , meaning that after the consumption of hydrocodone all opioids will have a reduced effect.

The risk of fatal opioid overdoses rise sharply after a period of cessation and [relapse](/w/index.php?title=Relapse&action=edit&redlink=1) , largely because of reduced tolerance. To account for this lack of tolerance, it is safer to only dose a fraction of one's usual [dosage](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage) if relapsing. It has also been found that the environment in which one uses the substance can play a role in opioid tolerance. In one scientific study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the drug in contrast to a familiar environment.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Alcohol** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. Place affected patients in the recovery position to prevent vomit aspiration from excess. Memory blackouts are likely
- **Stimulants** - Stimulants increase respiration rate which allows for a higher dose of opiates than would otherwise be used. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the user and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Benzodiazepines** - Central nervous system and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present. The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position blackouts/memory loss likely.
- **DXM** - Generally considered to be toxic. CNS depression, difficulty breathing, heart issues, and liver toxicity have been observed. Additionally if one takes DXM, their tolerance of opiates goes down slightly, thus causing additional synergistic effects.
- **GHB** / **GBL** - The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position
- **Ketamine** - Both substances bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the user falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
- **MAOIs** - Coadministration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) with certain opioids has been associated with rare reports of severe adverse reactions. There appear to be two types of interaction, an excitatory and a depressive one. Symptoms of the excitatory reaction may include agitation, headache, diaphoresis, hyperpyrexia, flushing, shivering, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor, diarrhea, hypertension, tachycardia, seizures, and coma. Death has occurred in some cases.
- **MXE** - MXE can potentiate the effects of opioids but also increases the risk of respiratory depression and organ toxicity.
- **Nitrous** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position. Memory blackouts are common.
- **PCP** - PCP may reduce opioid tolerance, increasing the risk of overdose.
- **Tramadol** - Increased risk of seizures. Tramadol itself is known to induce seizures and it may have additive effects on seizure threshold with other opioids. Central nervous system- and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present.
- **Grapefruit** - While grapefruit is not psychoactive, it may affect the metabolism of certain opioids. Tramadol, oxycodone, and fentanyl are all primarily metabolized by the enzyme CYP3A4, which is potently inhibited by grapefruit juice . This may cause the drug to take longer to clear from the body. it may increase toxicity with repeated doses. Methadone may also be affected . Codeine and hydrocodone are metabolized by CYP2D6. People who are on medicines that inhibit CYP2D6, or that lack the enzyme due to a genetic mutation will not respond to codeine as it can not be metabolized into its active product: morphine.

*Source: https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Hydrocodone*

**Hydrocodone** is a semi-synthetic opioid derived from codeine. Hydrocodone is used orally as a narcotic analgesic and antitussive (cough medicine), often in combination with paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen. Hydrocodone is prescribed predominantly within the United States; elsewhere it is rare. The International Narcotics Control Board reported 99% of the worldwide supply in 2007 was consumed in the United States.

The relative milligramme strength of hydrocodone to codeine is given as 6 fold, that is 5 mg has the effect of 30 mg of codeine; by way of the Roman numeral VI this is said to given rise to the trade name **Vicodin**.

## History

Hydrocodone was first synthesized in Germany in 1920 by Carl Mannich and Helene Löwenheim. Hydrocodone is derived from codeine. As a semi-synthetic opioid, it is most often used orally as a narcotic analgesic and antitussive. Used mostly in combination with Acetaminophen (Vicodin) or Ibuprofen.  If you have a drug with acetaminophen in it, we strongly recommend you cold water (CWE)  extract the acetaminophen away. CWE methods can be found [Here](http://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Cold_Water_Extraction)

## Dosage

Hydrocodone is a prodrug, insufflated and intravenous dosing is dangerous.

The following refers to hydrocodone in the form of hydrocodone mixture with Acetaminophen/Ibuprofen. 

| Light | 5-10mg |
| --- | --- |
| Common | 10-25mg |
| Strong | 25-40mg+ |

Recommended dosing interval is 4–6 hours.

## Duration

| Onset | 10-30 minutes |
| --- | --- |
| Total duration | 4-6 hours |

Half-Life depends on a lot of factors such as weight, BMI, and metabolism, but average plasma half-life is 3.8 hours.

## Effects

### Positive

- Improvement of mood
- Reduction of pain
- Euphoria

### Neutral

- Itching
- Light-headedness
- Sedation
- Changes in focus and attention

### Negative

- Dizziness
- Constipation
- Nausea and vomiting
- When insufflated, burning in nose and sinuses

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

As a narcotic, hydrocodone relieves pain by binding to opioid receptors in the CNS. It acts primarily on μ-opioid receptors, with about six times lesser affinity to δ-opioid receptors. In blood, 20–50% of hydrocodone is bound to protein.

Studies have shown hydrocodone is stronger than codeine but only one-tenth as potent as morphine at binding to receptors and reported to be only 59% as potent as morphine in analgesic properties. However, in tests conducted on rhesus monkeys, the analgesic potency of hydrocodone was actually higher than morphine. Per os hydrocodone has a mean equivalent daily dosage (MEDD) factor of 0.4, meaning that 1 mg of hydrocodone is equivalent to 0.4 mg of intravenous morphine. However, because of morphine's low oral bioavailability, there is a 1:1 correspondence between orally administered morphine and orally administered hydrocodone. 

## Harm Reduction

### Warning

Any dose of Hydrocodone may be fatal.  Do not mix with other drugs or alcohol. 

Excessive alcohol/grapefruit juice drinking while taking drug that contains APAP, can cause liver damage, other severe medical conditions, and even death.

Please consider [CWE](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Cold_Water_Extraction) if your hydrocodone contains APAP, as APAP is harmful to your liver and doctors recommend no more than 4g.

### Potentiators

The following products may react negatively with hydrocodone and may cause overdose if mixed together.

- Grapefruit Juice
- Diphenhydramine

## Legal status

- Australia - In Australia, hydrocodone is a Schedule 8 (S8) or Controlled Drug.
- Austria - Hydrocodone is regulated in the same fashion as in Germany (see below) under the Austrian Suchtmittelgesetz; since 2002 it has been available in the form of German products and those produced elsewhere in the European Union under Article 76 of the Schengen Treaty—prior to this, no Austrian companies produced hydrocodone products, with dihydrocodeine and nicomorphine being more commonly used for the same levels of pain and the former for coughing.
- Belgium - In Belgium, hydrocodone is no longer available for medical use.
- France - In France, hydrocodone (Vicodin) is no longer available for medical use. Hydrocodone is a prohibited narcotic.
- Germany - In Germany, hydrocodone is no longer available for medical use. Hydrocodone is listed under the Betäubungsmittelgesetz as a Suchtgift in the same category as morphine.
- Luxembourg - In Luxembourg, hydrocodone is available by prescription under the name Biocodone. Prescriptions are more commonly given for use as a cough suppressant (antitussive) rather than for pain relief (analgesic).
- The Netherlands - In the Netherlands, hydrocodone is not available for medical use and is classified as a List 1 drug under the Opium Law.
- Sweden - Hydrocodone is no longer available for medical use. The last remaining formula was banned in 1967.
- United Kingdom - In the UK, hydrocodone is not available for medical use and is listed as a Class A drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. Various formulations of dihydrocodeine, a weaker opioid, are frequently used as an alternative for the aforementioned indications of hydrocodone use.
- United States - In the U.S., formulations containing more than 15 mg per dosage unit are considered Schedule II drugs, as would any formulation consisting of just hydrocodone alone. Those containing less than or equal to 15 mg per dosage unit in combination with acetaminophen or another non-controlled drug are called hydrocodone compounds and are considered Schedule III drugs. Hydrocodone is typically found in combination with other drugs such as acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen and homatropine methylbromide. The purpose of the non-controlled drugs in combination is often twofold: 1) To provide increased analgesia via drug synergy. 2) To limit the intake of hydrocodone by causing unpleasant and often unsafe side effects at higher-than-prescribed doses. Hydrocodone is not commercially available in pure form in the United States due to a separate regulation, and is always sold with an NSAID, paracetamol, antihistamine, expectorant, or homatropine. Pure hydrocodone is a more strictly controlled Schedule II   and sold by compounding pharmacies. The cough preparation Codiclear DH is the purest commercial US hydrocodone item, containing guaifenesin and small amounts of ethanol as active ingredients.

Under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) hydrocodone is listed as both a Schedule II and Schedule III substance depending on the formulation.

Hydrocodone was until recently the active antitussive in more than 200 formulations of cough syrups and tablets sold in the United States. In late 2006, the FDA began forcing the recall of many of these formulations due to reports of deaths in infants and children under the age of six. The legal status of drug formulations originally sold between 1938 and 1962—before FDA approval was required—was ambiguous. As a result of FDA enforcement action, by August 2010, 88% of the hydrocodone-containing medications had been removed from the market. 

At the present time[when?], doctors, pharmacists, and codeine-sensitive or allergic patients or sensitive to the amounts of histamine released by its metabolites must choose among rapidly dwindling supplies of the Hycodan-Codiclear-Hydromet type syrups, Tussionex—an extended-release suspension similar to the European products Codipertussin (codeine hydrochloride), Paracodin suspension (dihydrocodeine hydroiodide), Tusscodin (nicocodeine hydrochloride) and others—and a handful of weak dihydrocodeine syrups. The low sales volume and Schedule II status of Dilaudid cough syrup predictably leads to under-utilisation of the drug. There are several conflicting views concerning the US availability of cough preparations containing ethylmorphine (also called dionine or codethyline)—Feco Syrup and its equivalents were first marketed circa 1895 and still in common use in the 1940s and 1950s, and the main ingredient is treated like codeine under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.[citation needed]
In the U.S., hydrocodone is always found in combination with other drugs such as paracetamol (also called acetaminophen), aspirin, an NSAID, ibuprofen, an antihistamine, an expectorant, or homatropine methylbromide due to compounding regulations. These combinations are considered C-III substances, prescriptions for which are generally valid for 6 months, including refills. The purpose of the non-controlled drugs in combination is often twofold:

The cough preparation Codiclear DH is the purest US hydrocodone item, containing guaifenesin and small amounts of ethanol as active ingredients.[citation needed]
As of July 2010, the FDA was considering banning some hydrocodone and oxycodone fixed-combination proprietary prescription drugs—based on the paracetamol content and the widespread occurrence of liver problems. FDA action on this suggestion would ostensibly also affect codeine and dihydrocodeine products such as the Tylenol With Codeine and Panlor series of drugs.[citation needed] In 2010, it was the most prescribed drug in the USA, with 131.2 million prescriptions of hydrocodone (combined with paracetamol) being written

Hydrocodone, also known as dihydrocodeinone, is a semi-synthetic opioid used to treat pain and as a cough suppressant. It is taken by mouth. Typically, it is dispensed as the combination acetaminophen/hydrocodone or ibuprofen/hydrocodone for pain severe enough to require an opioid and in combination with homatropine methylbromide to relieve cough. It is also available by itself in a long-acting form sold under the brand name Zohydro ER, among others, to treat severe pain of a prolonged duration. Hydrocodone is a controlled drug: in the United States, it is classified as a Schedule II Controlled Substance.
Common side effects include dizziness, sleepiness, nausea, and constipation. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure, seizures, QT prolongation, respiratory depression, and serotonin syndrome. Rapidly decreasing the dose may result in opioid withdrawal. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is generally not recommended. Hydrocodone is believed to work by activating opioid receptors, mainly in the brain and spinal cord. Hydrocodone 10 mg is equivalent to about 10 mg of morphine by mouth.
Hydrocodone was patented in 1923, while the long-acting formulation was approved for medical use in the United States in 2013. It is most commonly prescribed in the United States, which consumed 99% of the worldwide supply as of 2010. In 2018, it was the 402nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 400,000 prescriptions. Hydrocodone is a semi-synthetic opioid, converted from codeine or less often from thebaine. Production using genetically engineered yeasts has been developed but is not used commercially.

## Medical uses

Hydrocodone is used to treat moderate to severe pain. In liquid formulations, it is used to treat coughing. In one study comparing the potency of hydrocodone to that of oxycodone, it was found that it took 50% more hydrocodone to achieve the same degree of miosis (pupillary contraction). The investigators interpreted this to mean that oxycodone is about 50% more potent than hydrocodone.
However, in a study of emergency department patients with fractures, it was found that an equal amount of either drug provided about the same degree of pain relief, indicating that there is little practical difference between them when used for that purpose. Some references state that the analgesic action of hydrocodone begins in 20–30 minutes and lasts about 4–8 hours. The manufacturer's information says onset of action is about 10–30 minutes and duration is about 4–6 hours. Recommended dosing interval is 4–6 hours. Hydrocodone reaches peak serum levels after 1.3 hours.

### Available forms

Hydrocodone is available in a variety of formulations for oral administration:

The original oral form of hydrocodone alone, Dicodid, as immediate-release 5- and 10-mg tablets is available for prescription in Continental Europe per national drug control and prescription laws and Title 76 of the Schengen Treaty, but dihydrocodeine has been more widely used for the same indications since the beginning in the early 1920s, with hydrocodone being regulated the same way as morphine in the German Betäubungsmittelgesetz, the similarly named law in Switzerland and the Austrian Suchtmittelgesetz, whereas dihydrocodeine is regulated like codeine. For a number of decades, the liquid hydrocodone products available have been cough medicines.
Hydrocodone plus homatropine (Hycodan) in the form of small tablets for coughing and especially neuropathic moderate pain (the homatropine, an anticholinergic, is useful in both of those cases and is a deterrent to intentional overdose) was more widely used than Dicodid and was labelled as a cough medicine in the United States whilst Vicodin and similar drugs were the choices for analgesia.
Extended-release hydrocodone in a time-release syrup also containing chlorphenamine/chlorpheniramine is a cough medicine called Tussionex in North America. In Europe, similar time-release syrups containing codeine (numerous), dihydrocodeine (Paracodin Retard Hustensaft), nicocodeine (Tusscodin), thebacon, acetyldihydrocodeine, dionine, and nicodicodeine are used instead.
Immediate-release hydrocodone with paracetamol (acetaminophen) (Vicodin, Lortab, Lorcet, Maxidone, Norco, Zydone)
Immediate-release hydrocodone with ibuprofen (Vicoprofen, Ibudone, Reprexain)
Immediate-release hydrocodone with aspirin (Alor 5/500, Azdone, Damason-P, Lortab ASA, Panasal 5/500)
Controlled-release hydrocodone (Hysingla ER by Purdue Pharma, Zohydro ER)
Hydrocodone is not available in parenteral or any other non-oral forms.

## Side effects

Common side effects of hydrocodone are nausea, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, anxiety, abnormally happy or sad mood, dry throat, difficulty urinating, rash, itching, and contraction of the pupils. Serious side effects include slowed or irregular breathing and chest tightness.
Several cases of progressive bilateral hearing loss unresponsive to steroid therapy have been described as an infrequent adverse reaction to hydrocodone/paracetamol misuse. This adverse effect has been considered by some to be due to the ototoxicity of hydrocodone. Other researchers have suggested that paracetamol is the primary agent responsible for the ototoxicity.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) assigns the drug to pregnancy category C, meaning that no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans have been conducted. A newborn of a mother taking opioid medications regularly prior to the birth will be physically dependent. The baby may also exhibit respiratory depression if the opioid dose was high. An epidemiological study indicated that opioid treatment during early pregnancy results in increased risk of various birth defects.
Symptoms of hydrocodone overdose include narrowed or widened pupils; slow, shallow, or stopped breathing; slowed or stopped heartbeat; cold, clammy, or blue skin; excessive sleepiness; loss of consciousness; seizures; or death.
Hydrocodone can be habit forming, causing physical and psychological dependence. Its abuse liability is similar to morphine and less than oxycodone.

## Interactions

Hydrocodone is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and inhibitors and inducers of these enzymes can modify hydrocodone exposure. One study found that combination of paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, with once-daily extended-release hydrocodone, did not modify exposure to hydrocodone or the incidence of adverse effects. These findings suggest that hydrocodone can be coadministered with CYP2D6 inhibitors without dosage modification. Conversely, combination of hydrocodone/acetaminophen with the antiviral regimen of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir, and dasabuvir for treatment of hepatitis C increased peak concentrations of hydrocodone by 27%, total exposure by 90%, and elimination half-life from 5.1 hours to 8.0 hours. Ritonavir is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor as well as inducer of CYP3A and other enzymes, and the other antivirals are known to inhibit drug transporters like organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 and 1B3, P-glycoprotein, and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). The changes in hydrocodone levels are consistent with CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Based on these findings, a 50% lower dose of hydrocodone and closer clinical monitoring was recommended when hydrocodone is used in combination with this antiviral regimen.
People consuming alcohol, other opioids, anticholinergic antihistamines, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants together with hydrocodone may exhibit an additive CNS depression. Hydrocodone taken concomitantly with serotonergic medications like SSRI antidepressants may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Hydrocodone is a highly selective full agonist of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR). This is the main biological target of the endogenous opioid neuropeptide β-endorphin. Hydrocodone has low affinity for the δ-opioid receptor (DOR) and the κ-opioid receptor (KOR), where it is an agonist similarly.
Studies have shown hydrocodone is stronger than codeine but only one-tenth as potent as morphine at binding to receptors and reported to be only 59% as potent as morphine in analgesic properties. However, in tests conducted on rhesus monkeys, the analgesic potency of hydrocodone was actually higher than morphine. Oral hydrocodone has a mean equivalent daily dosage (MEDD) factor of 0.4, meaning that 1 mg of hydrocodone is equivalent to 0.4 mg of intravenous morphine. However, because of morphine's low oral bioavailability, there is a 1:1 correspondence between orally administered morphine and orally administered hydrocodone.

### Pharmacokinetics

#### Absorption

Hydrocodone is only pharmaceutically available as an oral medication. It is well-absorbed, but the oral bioavailability of hydrocodone is only approximately 25%. The onset of action of hydrocodone via this route is 10 to 20 minutes, with a peak effect (Tmax) occurring at 30 to 60 minutes, and it has a duration of 4 to 8 hours. The FDA label for immediate-release hydrocodone with acetaminophen does not include any information on the influence of food on its absorption or other pharmacokinetics. Conversely, coadministration with a high-fat meal increases peak concentrations of different formulations of extended-release hydrocodone by 14 to 54%, whereas area-under-the-curve levels are not notably affected.

#### Distribution

The volume of distribution of hydrocodone is 3.3 to 4.7 L/kg. The plasma protein binding of hydrocodone is 20 to 50%.

#### Metabolism

In the liver, hydrocodone is transformed into several metabolites, including norhydrocodone, hydromorphone, 6α-hydrocodol (dihydrocodeine), and 6β-hydrocodol. 6α- and 6β-hydromorphol are also formed, and the metabolites of hydrocodone are conjugated (via glucuronidation). Hydrocodone has a terminal half-life that averages 3.8 hours (range 3.3–4.4 hours). The hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6 converts hydrocodone into hydromorphone, a more potent opioid (5-fold higher binding affinity to the MOR). However, extensive and poor cytochrome 450 CYP2D6 metabolizers had similar physiological and subjective responses to hydrocodone, and CYP2D6 inhibitor quinidine did not change the responses of extensive metabolizers, suggesting that inhibition of CYP2D6 metabolism of hydrocodone has no practical importance. Ultra-rapid CYP2D6 metabolizers (1–2% of the population) may have an increased response to hydrocodone; however, hydrocodone metabolism in this population has not been studied.
Norhydrocodone, the major metabolite of hydrocodone, is predominantly formed by CYP3A4-catalyzed oxidation. In contrast to hydromorphone, it is described as inactive. However, norhydrocodone is actually a MOR agonist with similar potency to hydrocodone, but has been found to produce only minimal analgesia when administered peripherally to animals (likely due to poor blood–brain barrier and thus central nervous system penetration). Inhibition of CYP3A4 in a child who was, in addition, a poor CYP2D6 metabolizer, resulted in a fatal overdose of hydrocodone. Approximately 40% of hydrocodone metabolism is attributed to non-cytochrome P450-catalyzed reactions.

#### Elimination

Hydrocodone is excreted in urine, mainly in the form of conjugates.

## Chemistry

### Detection in body fluids

Hydrocodone concentrations are measured in blood, plasma, and urine to seek evidence of misuse, to confirm diagnoses of poisoning, and to assist in investigations into deaths. Many commercial opiate screening tests react indiscriminately with hydrocodone, other opiates, and their metabolites, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish hydrocodone uniquely. Blood and plasma hydrocodone concentrations typically fall into the 5–30 μg/L range among people taking the drug therapeutically, 100–200 μg/L among recreational users, and 100–1,600 μg/L in cases of acute, fatal overdosage. Co-administration of the drug with food or alcohol can very significantly increase the resulting plasma hydrocodone concentrations that are subsequently achieved.

### Synthesis

Hydrocodone is most commonly synthesized from thebaine, a constituent of opium latex from the dried poppy plant. Once thebaine is obtained, the reaction undergoes hydrogenation using a palladium catalyst.

### Structure

There are three important structures in hydrocodone: the amine group, which binds to the tertiary nitrogen binding site in the central nervous system's opioid receptor, the hydroxy group that binds to the anionic binding site, and the phenyl group which binds to the phenolic binding site. This triggers a G protein activation and subsequent release of dopamine.

## History

Hydrocodone was first synthesized in Germany in 1920 by Carl Mannich and Helene Löwenheim. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on 23 March 1943 for sale in the United States and approved by Health Canada for sale in Canada under the brand name Hycodan.
Hydrocodone was first marketed by Knoll as Dicodid, starting in February 1924 in Germany. This name is analogous to other products the company introduced or otherwise marketed: Dilaudid (hydromorphone, 1926), Dinarkon (oxycodone, 1917), Dihydrin (dihydrocodeine, 1911), and Dimorphan (dihydromorphine). Paramorfan is the trade name of dihydromorphine from another manufacturer, as is Paracodin, for dihydrocodeine.
Hydrocodone was patented in 1923, while the long-acting formulation was approved for medical use in the United States in 2013. It is most commonly prescribed in the United States, which consumed 99% of the worldwide supply as of 2010. In 2018, it was the 402nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 400,000 prescriptions.

## Society and culture

### Formulations

Several common imprints for hydrocodone are M365, M366, M367.

#### Combination products

Most hydrocodone formulations include a second analgesic, such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen. Examples of hydrocodone combinations include Norco, Vicodin, Vicoprofen and Riboxen.

### Legal status in the United States

The US government imposed tougher prescribing rules for hydrocodone in 2014, changing the drug from Schedule III to Schedule II. In 2011, hydrocodone products were involved in around 100,000 abuse-related emergency department visits in the United States, more than double the number in 2004.

## Veterinary use

Hydrocodone is predominantly used as an antitussive in dogs. Hydrocodone has low oral bioavailability and provide poor analgesia in cats and dogs. One study in dogs found hydrocodone to be less effective than firocoxib for dogs undergoing a tibial-plateau-levelling osteotomy.
