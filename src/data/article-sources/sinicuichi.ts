## Subjective Experience

Although it isn’t saying a lot, this experiment entailed one of the most convoluted
preparations I have ever performed. It was a glorious failure.

I had created the decoction by mixing the material with water in a jar, placing it in
the sun, maintaining it at the appropriate temperature, and tending it regularly and
carefully.

The next day, when I eventually drank it: absolutely nothing.

To be fair, I knew the risks. Field reports of success are very few and far between, and
its psychoactivity is disputed. However, the temptation of a unique form of
psychedelic experience, including auditory hallucinations, proved too much for me,
and I went for it.

Notwithstanding this, sinicuichi is documented in Plants of the Gods, including
reference to its indigenous use, so I may well have missed a trick.

## Spiritual use

Use of H. salicifolia for shamanic purposes by native peoples of Central America and Mexico has been described.  In the method of preparation commonly used, fresh leaves are collected and allowed to wilt. The leaves are put into a cup or jar, cool water is added, and the mixture is placed in the sun to brew and ferment for at least 24 hours. It is said that during the fermentation process, the knowledge of the sun is embedded into the potion, creating the "elixir of the sun."
