**3-MeO-PCMo** (**4-[1-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexyl]morpholine**) is a new morpholine analogue of 3-MeO-PCP. It is a dissociative NMDA receptor antagonist and anesthetic drug of the arylcyclohexylamine chemical class with a potency of less than 1/10th of that of 3-MeO-PCP.

This compound induces a state referred to as “dissociative anesthesia”
 when ingested and is therefore used as a recreational drug. 3-MeO-PCMo 
has recently become freely available through online research chemical 
vendors^[1] where it is being sold as a designer drug.

Although very little is known about this compound, similar morpholine analogues of phencyclidine have been researched before.^[2]^[3]

In terms of its chemistry, 3-MeO-PCMo, or 4-[1-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexyl]morpholine, is classified as an arylcyclohexylamine
 drug. Ayrlcyclohexylamine drugs are named for their structures which 
include a cyclohexane ring bound to an aromatic ring along with an amine
 group at the same location. The aryl substituent of 3-MeO-PCMo is a 
phenyl ring with a methoxy (CH3-O-) substituent at R3, which is bound to a six-membered cyclohexyl ring. Bound at the same location on the cyclohexyl ring R1 is an amine group which is incorporated into a morpholine ring as R4. Morpholine is a six-membered heterocyclic ring with an oxygen subsitutent at R1. 3-MeO-PCMo is a morpholine analogue to 3-MeO-PCP, which lacks an oxygen moiety in its six-membered amine ring (a piperidine ring instead of a morpholine ring).

In terms of its pharmacology, due to the lack of research regarding the substance, all discussion 
regarding the pharmacology of it is purely based on its structure and 
subjective effect similarities to other arylcyclohexylamine dissociatives such as 3-MeO-PCP, PCP and MXE. With this in mind, 3-Meo-PCMo is thought to act as an NMDA receptor antagonist.
 NMDA receptors allow for electrical signals to pass between neurons in 
the brain and spinal column; for the signals to pass, the receptor must 
be open. NMDA receptor antagonists close the NMDA receptors by blocking 
them. This disconnection of neurons leads to loss of feeling, difficulty
 moving, and eventually the famous “hole.”

The effects listed below are based upon the [subjective effects index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index) and personal experiences of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers).
 The listed effects will rarely (if ever) occur all at once, but heavier
 dosages will increase the chances and are more likely to induce a full 
range of effects.

**Physical effects:**

The subjective physical effects of 3-MeO-PCMo can be broken down into
 several components which progressively intensify proportional to 
dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **[Spontaneous tactile sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_tactile_sensations)**
 - The 3-MeO-PCMo body high is a soft, warm, motionless and pleasurable 
tingling sensation which is all-encompassing across the body and not 
location specific to any area.
- **[Decreased bodily weight](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_bodily_weight)**
 - This creates the sensation that the body is floating and has become 
entirely weightless. This effect is strangely stimulating and encourages
 physical activities at low to moderate doses by making the body feel 
light and effortless to move.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)**
 - It’s worth noting that high dose 3-MeO-PCMo trips can sometimes 
result in nausea and vomiting at the peak of the trip. For most people, 
this is surprisingly not as unpleasant as they would initially expect 
due to the accompanying detachment from the physical senses.
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)**
 - A loss of gross and fine motor control alongside of balance and 
coordination is prevalent within 3-MeO-PCMo and becomes especially 
strong at higher doses. This means that one should be sitting down 
before the onset (unless experienced) in case of falling over and 
injuring oneself.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)**
- **[Tactile disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_disconnection)**
- **[Tactile suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression)**
- **[Physical autonomy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_autonomy)**

**Cognitive effects:**

The general head space of 3-MeO-PCMo is often described as simplistic and shallow in comparison to that of MXE and ketamine. The specific cognitive effects can be broken down into several separate subcomponents which are listed and described below:

- **[Depersonalization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depersonalization)**
- **[Derealization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Derealization)**
- **[Consciousness disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Consciousness_disconnection)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** (ego death)
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Information processing suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Information_processing_suppression)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**

- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)**

**Visual effects:**

*Suppressions:*

This substance does not enhance visual stimuli; instead, it tends to 
degrade and decrease visual aptitude in a variety of ways which 
generally include:

- **[Visual disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection)** - This eventually results in the 3-MeO-PCMo equivalent of the famous “k-hole” or, more specifically, *[holes, spaces and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids)* alongside of *[structures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Structures)*.
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)** - This component is prevalent at moderate to heavy doses and makes reading impossible unless one closes an eye.
- **[Pattern recognition suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_suppression)** - This effect generally occurs at higher doses and makes one unable to recognize and interpret perceivable visual data.
- **[Visual acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)**

*Distortions:*

- **[Perspective distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_distortions)**

*[Geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry):*

The visual geometry found within 3-MeO-PCMo can be described as very dark and bland when compared to that of ketamine or DXM.
 It often consists of many tiny interlocking and woven lines. It does 
not extend beyond level 4 geometry and can be comprehensively described 
through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations)
 as simplistic in complexity, algorithmic in style, synthetic in feel, 
unstructured in organization, dimly lit in lighting, multicoloured in 
scheme, glossy in shading, soft in edges, small in size, slow in speed, 
smooth in motion, equal in rounded and angular corners, immersive in 
depth and consistent in intensity.

**Auditory effects:**

- **[Suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_suppression)**
- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)**

**Physical health effects, potential addiction and tolerance:**

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 3-MeO-PCMo 
use have not been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic 
dose is unknown. This is because 3-MeO-PCMo is a research chemical with 
very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who 
have tried 3-MeO-PCMo within the psychonaut community suggests that 
there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this 
drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (but nothing 
can be completely guaranteed).

There is a tolerance build up with 3-MeO-PCMo which results in the 
need to consume increasingly large doses in order to achieve the same 
level of effects. This should reset to baseline after 1 - 2 weeks. There
 may be some addictive potential, but this is still unknown.

In terms of its long-term health effects when used repeatedly and 
with excess for extended periods of time, 3-MeO-PCMo seems to exhibit 
almost identical bladder and urinary tract problems to those found 
within ketamine, MXE and other arylcyclohexylamines,
 but to an even more extreme extent. This is because 3-MeO-PCMo is 50% 
less potent than that of ketamine which means significantly more of the 
drug must be consumed in order to achieve the same effects. Symptoms of 
3-MeO-PCMo-induced cystitis can become extremely serious and can be 
described as:

- **Urinary frequency** - Urinary frequency is the need to empty the bladder every few minutes.
- **Urinary urgency** - This can be described as a sudden and compelling need to urinate.
- **Urinary pressure** - This is experienced as a constant sensation of fullness in the bladder that is unrelieved by urination.
- **Pelvic and bladder pain** - Pain can develop suddenly and severely, particularly as the bladder fills with urine.
- **Hematuria** - Hematuria is visible blood in the urine.
- **Incontinence** - This is the leakage of urine.

All of these, however, can easily be avoided by simply not using 
3-MeO-PCMo on a daily or even weekly basis and manually limiting one’s 
usage of the substance.

**Legal issues:**

3-MeO-PCMo is currently a legal grey area drug worldwide and is 
freely available through the use of online research chemical vendors. 
However, this does not guarantee anyone to be immune from legal 
prosecution should they be found in possession of this substance as the 
legality is likely to vary from country to country.

Within the U.K. specifically, as 3-MeO-PCMo is the morpholine analogue of 3-MeO-PCP,
 it is therefore an arylcyclohexylamine (ACH) that is not controlled in 
the U.K. because a morpholine substituion on the amine is not proscribed
 by the country’s generic ACH laws.

**Conclusion:**

3-MeO-PCMo is by far the closest experience to that of MXE or ketamine currently available in the U.K. legal research chemical market. Its absurd lack of potency, however, makes it unusable for regular usage due to its proportionally adverse effects on the bladder.
