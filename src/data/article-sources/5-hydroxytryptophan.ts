## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as serotonins. These are compounds containing a serotonin moiety, which consists of an indole that bears an aminoethyl a position 2 and a hydroxyl group at position 5.

### Background

5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), also known as oxitriptan (INN), is a naturally occurring amino acid and metabolic intermediate in the synthesis of serotonin and melatonin. 5-HTP is sold over-the-counter in the United Kingdom, United States and Canada as a dietary supplement for use as an antidepressant, appetite suppressant, and sleep aid, and is also marketed in many European countries for the indication of major depression under trade names like Cincofarm, Levothym, Levotonine, Oxyfan, Telesol, Tript-OH, and Triptum. Several double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of 5-HTP in the treatment of depression, though a lack of high quality studies has been noted. More study is needed to determine efficacy in treating depression.

### Indication

For use as an antidepressant, appetite suppressant, and sleep aid.

### Pharmacodynamics

The psychoactive action of 5-HTP is thought to be due to increased serotonin production in central nervous system tissue.

### Metabolism

5-Hydroxytryptophan is decarboxylated to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) by the enzyme aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase via a vitamin B6 dependent reaction in nervous tissue and in the liver.

Tryptophan--tRNA ligase is an active unit within the tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase.

### General Function

Catalyzes the formation of 5'adenyl-Trp and tRNA(Trp) but with 5-fold less activity than TrpRS. Increases the solubility of the nitric oxide synthase oxygenase (nos), as well as its affinity for substrate L-arginine and its nitric-oxide synthase activity. The complex between trpS2 and nos catalyzes the regioselective nitration of tryptophan at the 4-position.

## Subjective Experience

5-HTP is commonly sold as an over-the-counter supplement for a range of
conditions, including insomnia and depression. As a precursor to serotonin, it is also
frequently used during the recovery process following experiences with a number of
psychoactive drugs.

For this experiment I took 200mg the morning after a speed binge, as I had done on
several occasions following previous sessions with heavy serotonin depleting agents.
I have never really noticed much effect, although certainly it could have helped to
mitigate the comedown and the aftermath. This is not something which is easy to
measure or confirm.

On this occasion I also took another 200mg at about 8am on the second morning
after the event, giving a total of 400mg (two 200mg doses 24 hours apart).

I noted that I was slightly heavy headed throughout this second day: a minor drifty
feel was there but without any sort of intoxication or inebriation. I was also
particularly sleepy in patches.

I took at nap at 3pm and fell into a strangely deep slumber with what could well have
been potentiated dreaming. I awoke after approximately 45 minutes, a little
disorientated.

During the following hours, as the headiness remained, it occurred to me that I was
indeed experiencing a form of psychoactivity and that this must be related to that
morning’s 200mg intake.

Having felt somewhat chilly all morning, by late afternoon I was warm, perhaps as
the effects of 5-HTP became more prominent; or this could have been a coincidence.

This was a strange one. It came on slowly, wasn’t particularly like a traditional drug
trip, but certain manifestations became increasingly evident. I wasn’t high at any
stage: I was just aware of the neutral but mellow headspace and to some degree my
slightly enhanced mood. The mellowness was a dominant feature, immersed in a
semi-somniant zone of contentment.

By early evening the effects had largely diminished, although I still felt a little odd
and dreamy.

I regretted not paying more attention earlier in the day, but I simply did not plan for
or anticipate any discernable effect.

Like the previous night (following the initial 200mg ingestion) the second nights
sleep was deep with numerous vivid dream strings.

It is difficult to untangle the effects of the depletion of serotonin and other aftermath
effects of amphetamine, and those of the two-day ingestion of the 5-HTP, but it
seems unlikely that all these were exclusively due to the former. The intensification
on the second day was a very strong indicator of this. These effects also persisted at a
lower level to a third day in terms of the general heady feeling.

To the question, therefore, of whether 5-HTP is psychoactive, either directly or
indirectly, I would have to answer yes.

NOTE: One issue relating to the presence of 5-HTP in this book is that of
classification. It could arguably live under Section 2.4 (Anxiolytic & Sedatives) but on
balance, given its other functionality and supplemental nature, I have followed
Psychonautwiki in (very generally) classifying it as a nootropic.

RELATED SAFETY WARNING
TripSit makes the following warning: Do not take this while on a serotonergic drug,
only afterwards. Wait at least 12 hours following the last dose in the case of MDMA.

## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: 25 mg
- Light: 50 - 100 mg
- Common: 100 - 300 mg
- Strong: 300 - 500 mg
- Heavy: 500 mg +

**Duration:**

**5-Hydroxytryptophan** (also known as **5-HTP** and **oxitriptan** ) is a naturally occurring chemical substance and a metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) in the human body. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

5-HTP is available over the counter in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada as a dietary supplement and is sometimes used as an [antidepressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressant) , sleep aid, and appetite suppressant. It is marketed in some European countries as a prescription drug for the treatment of major depression.

5-HTP is also popularly consumed by users of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and other serotonin-releasing agents to try to reduce the negative [after effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA#After_effects) that begin during the substance's [come down](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Duration) period, including [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression) , and [cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue) . Since 5-HTP is a precursor for the neurotransmitter [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and MDMA administration both depletes serotonin levels in the brain as well as inhibit the enzyme needed to produce it (i.e. tryptophan hydroxylase) for a short period after, it is believed that taking 5-HTP in the days after coming down will speed up the production of serotonin and decrease the time needed to recover (though there are many popular misconceptions and controversies as to just how effective it is for this purpose). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

5-HTP should not be taken until 12 hours after one's last dose of MDMA because combining the two substances could interact to increase the brain's serotonin levels to dangerous levels, which can result in a potentially life-threatening condition called [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .

## Chemistry

5-HTP or 5-Hydroxytryptophan is a synthetic indole alkaloid molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicyclic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. 5-HTP is substituted at R 5 of its indole heterocycle with a hydroxy (OH) functional group. It also contains propanoic acid group bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone. 5-HTP is the 5-hydroxy analog of [tryptophan](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptophan) , and is sold in its levorotary isomer form. 5-HTP contains the core structure of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) with the addition of a propanoic acid at R N , and is converted by the body into serotonin by metabolic reactions.

## Pharmacology

The psychoactive action of 5-HTP is derived from its increase in production of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) in central nervous system tissue. 5-HTP is decarboxylated to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) by the enzyme 'aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase', with the help of vitamin B 6 . This reaction occurs both in nervous tissue and in the liver. 5-HTP crosses the blood–brain barrier, while 5-HT (serotonin) does not.

Excess 5-HTP, especially when administered with vitamin B 6 , is thought to be metabolized and excreted.

- [Experience:5-Hydroxytryptophan (100mg, oral) - strong imagination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience:5-Hydroxytryptophan_(100mg,_oral)_-_strong_imagination)

Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: 5-HTP](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Tryptophan_5HTP.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

Due to the conversion of 5-HTP into serotonin by the liver, with prolonged use, there may be a significant risk of heart valve disease from serotonin's effect on the heart, which is thought to be due to agonism of the 5-HT 2B receptors present on it.

It has been suggested that 5-HTP may cause eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS), a serious condition which results in extreme muscle tenderness, myalgia, and blood abnormalities. However, there is evidence to show that EMS was likely caused by a contaminant in certain 5-HTP supplements instead of the substance itself.

### Dangerous interactions

Although many substances are safe on their own, they can become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with other substances. The list below contains some common potentially dangerous combinations, but may not include all of them. Certain combinations may be safe in low doses of each, but still increase the potential risk of death. Independent research should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

Combinations in the list below may increase the amount of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, to dangerous or even fatal levels, resulting in life-threatening [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .

- **SSRIs** - When combined with antidepressants of the SSRI class, high doses of 5-HTP can cause acute serotonin syndrome in rats.
- **SNRIs**
- **Serotonin releasers** such as **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** , **[mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone)** , **[4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA)** , **[MDAI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDAI)** and **[αMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91MT)** - To prevent serotonin syndrome, 5-HTP should only be taken once the user has come down from the MDMA (or other serotonin releaser), roughly 12 hours after the last dose.
- **MAOIs** such as **[syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue)** , **[banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi)** , **[2C-T-2](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-2)** , **[2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7)** , **[αMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91MT)** , and some **[antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressants)** - When combined with antidepressants of the MAOI class, high doses of 5-HTP can cause acute serotonin syndrome in rats.
- **Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)**
- **Tramadol**

## Legal status

5-HTP is commonly sold over the counter as a dietary supplement in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and most of Europe and is not subject to any illicit substance control laws.

In some parts of Europe, where it prescribed as an anti-depressant, there may be some controls on its sale and distribution. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-Hydroxytryptophan*

5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), used medically as oxitriptan, is a naturally occurring amino acid and chemical precursor as well as a metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin.
5-HTP can be manufactured and used as a drug and supplement with the INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name oxitriptan. Brand names include Cincofarm, Levothym, Levotonine, Oxyfan, Telesol, Tript-OH, and Triptum. As a drug, it is used in the treatment of depression and for certain other indications.

## Production

5-HTP is produced from the amino acid tryptophan through the action of the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase. Tryptophan hydroxylase is one of the biopterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. Production of 5-HTP is the rate-limiting step in 5-HT (serotonin)  synthesis. 5-HTP is normally rapidly converted to 5-HT by amino acid decarboxylase.

## Metabolism

5-HTP is decarboxylated to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) by the enzyme aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase with the help of vitamin B6. This reaction occurs both in nervous tissue and in the liver. 5-HTP crosses the blood–brain barrier, while 5-HT does not. Excess 5-HTP, especially when administered with vitamin B6, is thought to be metabolized and excreted.

## Dietary sources

Though 5-HTP is found in food only in insignificant quantities, it is a chemical involved intermediately in the metabolism of tryptophan, an amino acid found in all unfractionated foods, with lower total amino acid content correlating with increased tryptophan absorption.

## Use as a medication and supplement

5-HTP has been used medically and as a supplement under the name oxitriptan in the treatment of depression and for certain other indications. As of 2025, there are no current FDA approved medications containing 5-HTP.
It can be potentiated in combination with a peripherally selective aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD) inhibitor such as carbidopa or benserazide. These agents increase the strength and duration of oxitriptan. An investigational combination formulation is oxitriptan/carbidopa.

## Research

### Psychedelic effects

5-HTP robustly produces the head-twitch response (HTR) in rodents when administered at relatively high doses. It dose-dependently induces the HTR in mice across a dose range of 50 to 250 mg/kg via intraperitoneal administration, with an inverted U-shaped dose–response curve and maximal induction of the HTR at a dose of 200 mg/kg. Similarly to the case of 5-HTP, intracerebroventricular injection of serotonin, but not peripheral administration of serotonin, produces the HTR. The HTR is induced by serotonergic psychedelics like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin and is a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects.
The HTR of 5-HTP is blocked by serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists, which block the hallucinogenic effects of serotonergic psychedelics in humans, is prevented by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD) inhibitors, which block conversion of 5-HTP into serotonin, and is potentiated by monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibitors, which prevent the degradation of serotonin and other endogenous tryptamines. It is also suppressed by the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor full agonist 8-OH-DPAT, is greatly augmented by the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor antagonist RS-102221, and is reduced by the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) antagonist EPPTB. In addition, the HTR of 5-HTP is abolished by indolethylamine N-methyltransferase (INMT) inhibitors, which block conversion of serotonin and other endogenous tryptamines into N-methylated tryptamines, such as N-methylserotonin (NMS; norbufotenin), bufotenin (5-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine; 5-HO-DMT), and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). These N-methylated tryptamines are well-known for their psychedelic effects, whereas serotonin itself, without biotransformation, does not seem to produce psychedelic effects. 5-HTP has not been found to produce psychedelic effects in humans, which has been attributed to the high doses required to produce such effects. The 5-HTP doses that produce the HTR in rodents are orders of magnitude higher than the doses of 5-HTP that have been used safely and therapeutically in humans. It remains unknown whether 5-HTP can produce psychedelic effects in humans. The highest dosage of 5-HTP that is known to have been evaluated in humans is about 3,000 mg per day. Serotonin syndrome and associated hallucinations have been reported with overdose of serotonin-elevating drugs, but psychedelic-like effects have not been reported.
The lack of the HTR and psychedelic effects with serotonin itself has been attributed to the fact that these effects appear to be dependent on activation of a population of intracellular 5-HT2A receptors expressed in cortical neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that lack the serotonin transporter (SERT) and are inaccessible to serotonin. Serotonin itself is too hydrophilic to enter serotonergic neurons without the SERT, whereas serotonergic psychedelics and serotonin's N-methylated metabolites and analogues are lipophilic and readily enter these neurons. These findings may also explain why selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and related serotonergic agents do not produce psychedelic effects.
The properties of 5-HTP in animal drug discrimination tests have been studied. 5-HTP generalizes with the serotonin releasing agent fenfluramine and its cue is markedly potentiated by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine. However, numerous serotonin receptor antagonists, including methysergide, cyproheptadine, metergoline, methiothepin (metitepine), ketanserin, pirenperone, pizotifen, and mianserin, all failed to block the discriminative stimulus properties of 5-HTP. Conflictingly however, in a subsequent study, pizotifen was able to fully block the discriminative stimulus properties of 5-HTP. The inability of serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists to block the discriminative stimulus properties of 5-HTP is in notable contrast to their ability to block the 5-HTP-induced HTR. 5-HTP only partially substitutes for LSD in drug discrimination tests, whereas LSD and quipazine fully substitute for 5-HTP. The full substitution of LSD and quipazine for 5-HTP can be blocked by the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin. The findings of drug discrimination tests suggest that 5-HTP has a more complex or compound discriminative stimulus compared to other agents like LSD and that its stimulus properties may not be readily explained by either the serotonin 5-HT1 or 5-HT2 receptors alone. Instead, a combination of actions at these and/or other receptors may be involved in its stimulus effects.
