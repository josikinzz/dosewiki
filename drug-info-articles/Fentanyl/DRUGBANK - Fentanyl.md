## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fentanyls. These are compounds containing the fentanyl moiety or a derivative, which is based on a N-(1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl)-N-phenylpropanamide skeleton.

### Background

Fentanyl, a potent opioid agonist, was developed in the 1950s to fill a need for strong and rapid analgesia.
8
Because of these characteristics, fentanyl is commonly used to treat chronic cancer pain or in anesthesia.

Fentanyl is related to other opioids like
morphine
and
oxycodone
.
Fentanyl's high potency has also made it a common adulterant in illicit drugs, especially heroin.
8
In 2017, 47600 overdose deaths in the United States involved some opioid (over 2/3 of all overdose deaths).
22
Opioid overdoses kill an average of 11 Canadians daily.
23
Fentanyl was FDA approved in 1968.

### Indication

Fentanyl intravenous or intramuscular injections are indicated for short term analgesia during induction, maintenance, and recovery from general or regional anesthesia.
Label
These injections are also used with a neuroleptic for premedication, induction, and as an adjunct to maintenance of anesthesia.
Label
Finally, fentanyl intravenous or intramuscular injections are used with oxygen for anesthesia in high risk patients.
Label
Fentanyl sublingual tablets, transmucosal lozenges, buccal tablets, sublingual sprays, transdermal systems, and nasal sprays are indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in opioid tolerant cancer patients who require around the clock pain management.

### Pharmacodynamics

Fentanyl produces strong analgesia through its activation of opioid receptors.
Label
,
6
It has a duration of action of several hours and a wider therapeutic index as patients develop tolerance to opioids.
Label
Fentanyl is associated with a risk of addiction and abuse and should not be mixed with alcohol or benzodiazepines.

Agonist
Delta-type opioid receptor
Agonist

### Absorption

Fentanyl sublingual tablets are 54% bioavailable
15
, transmucosal lozenges are 50% bioavailable
16
, buccal tablets are 65% bioavailable
17
, sublingual spray is 76% bioavailable
18
, and nasal spray is 20% more bioavailable than transmucosal
20
(or approximately 64% bioavailable).
Fentanyl transmucosal lozenges reach a C
max
of 0.4±0.1ng/mL for a 200µg dose and 2.5±0.6ng/mL for a 1600µg dose with a T
max
of 20-40 minutes.

max
of 0.69-1.25 hours, decreasing as the dose increased.
12
The AUC was 1.25±0.67ng*h/mL for a 100µg dose and 10.38±3.70ng*h/mL for a 800µg dose.
12
Fentanyl transdermal systems reached a C
max
of 0.24±0.20ng/mL with a T
max
of 3.6±1.3h for a 25µg/h dose.

### Metabolism

Fentanyl is metabolized to a number of inactive metabolites.
5
Fentanyl is 99% N-dealkylated to norfentanyl by cytochrome P450.
5
It can also be amide hydrolyzed to despropionylfentanyl, or alkyl hydroxylated to hydroxyfentanyl which is N-dealkylated to hydroxynorfentanyl.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of adverse effects can be increased when Fentanyl is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Abacavir
Fentanyl may decrease the excretion rate of Abacavir which could result in a higher serum level.
Abametapir
The serum concentration of Fentanyl can be increased when it is combined with Abametapir.
Abatacept
The metabolism of Fentanyl can be increased when combined with Abatacept.
Acebutolol
Fentanyl may decrease the antihypertensive activities of Acebutolol.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol.

### Mechanism of action

Fentanyl binds to opioid receptors, especially the mu opioid receptor, which are coupled to G-proteins.
6
Activation of opioid receptors causes GTP to be exchanged for GDP on the G-proteins which in turn down regulates adenylate cyclase, reducing concentrations of cAMP.
6
Reduced cAMP decreases cAMP dependant influx of calcium ions into the cell.
6
The exchange of GTP for GDP results in hyperpolarization of the cell and inhibition of nerve activity.

. The oral volume of distribution is 25.4L/kg.
17
In hepatically impaired patients, the intravenous volume of distribution ranges from 0.8-8L/kg.

### Protein binding

Fentanyl is 80-85% bound to plasma proteins.
15
,
16

20
In one study, a 0.1µg/L solution of fentanyl was 77.9±1.1% bound to human serum albumin and 12.0±5.4% bound to α-1 acid glycoprotein.
7
A 0.1µg/L solution of norfentanyl, the primary metabolite of fentanyl, was 7.62±1.2% bound to human serum albumin and 7.24±1.9% bound to α-1 acid glycoprotein.

### Route of elimination

Within 72 hours, 75% of a dose of fentanyl is excreted in the urine with <7% unchanged, and 9% is excreted in the feces with <1% unchanged.

### Clearance

Total plasma clearance of fentanyl is 0.5L/hr/kg (0.3-0.7L/hr/kg)
16
or 42L/hr.
17
,
20
Following an intravenous dose, surgical patients displayed a clearance of 27-75L/h, hepatically impaired patients displayed a clearance of 3-80L/h, and renally impaired patients displayed a clearance of 30-78L/h.

### General Function

Translocates drugs and phospholipids across the membrane (PubMed:2897240, PubMed:35970996, PubMed:8898203, PubMed:9038218, PubMed:35507548). Catalyzes the flop of phospholipids from the cytoplasmic to the exoplasmic leaflet of the apical membrane. Participates mainly to the flop of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, beta-D-glucosylceramides and sphingomyelins (PubMed:8898203). Energy-dependent efflux pump responsible for decreased drug accumulation in multidrug-resistant cells (PubMed:2897240, PubMed:35970996, PubMed:9038218)
