[original post:]


I sometimes use a plant known as Brugmansia, commonly referred to as Datura, though it is no longer known to be of that family.

What i am curious to know is, has anyone taken (not at the same time either) all three of these plants Deadly Nightshade, Datura and Brugmansia, if so, could they tell me any differences in the effects of these plants. As i have heard of many unpleasant experiences on datura though i could see how people would find it unpleasant if it is the same as Brugmansia,but im wondering if it is just that maybe the Datura species contain other alkaloids which are more poisonous than that of Brugmansia...


btw, this plant is legal and grows everywhere throughout Melb suburbs and i imagine right accross Aus and other countries. However, its legal status does not mean that it is a drug to be taken lightly. 'friends' have used prob every you could name and will testify this to be the strongest substance around. It can be extremely dangerous, not so much in toxicity, but your actions under the influence is where the danger lies. This is not a recreational drug and should not be used without a trusted "sitter". However, it is also noteworthy that i have never had an unpleasant experience on this, though, keep in mind, I happen to enjoy 48+hours of hulicinations and virtual amnesia 8(

I don't know if 'strongest' is the right way to describe it, but the effects are completely transparent, as in you don't realise you are on a drug and therefore completely believe your delerium.

If taken in large dose's, beleive me, you know your on the drug, for the first 3 hours, its like taking 100tabs of acid, its only after this wears off that the delerium kicks in and you think your down then the fun begins...

However, no-ones answered the question yet... Is Datura different to Brugmansia.. Im guessing not.. But would be good to get some feedback from someone who has done both. I've heard Brugmansia is ment to be a lot more visual. (Maybe you only experience the "100 tabs of acid" syndrome on Brugmansia not datura ??)

bruggies have a rep that they have more scop than atrop & hyosc... but i suspect that one would have to search the lit (or do some lab quant. anal.) to get the full scoop on the scop...

i don't think there is a difference between the two...I have taken dartura once and a tree style once as well...I forget which type erowid said it was,,,but I had the same effect..and to correct you on saying that in large doses it is crazy strong. 

       It is crazy strong at a fration of what your thinking. Its nothing like acid and nothing like anything you have ever tried. Most people stories end with them in jail or in the hospital,,I have friends that watched me and helped me through it ..but I made tea with mine and drank a shot...thought I wasn't feeling anything, made a second and the rest is history. I have reported my tale a few times on here to people looking to try lady Dartura. 


I don't tell people not too, I just warn..I did it. And it expanded my mind,i saw things I might never of seen..but I am also not the same...I know what it's like to be there...were you have not control..and you don't know you don't have control...if this is your wish...to see the unseen..be careful , Shamens(sp?) would eat one or two seeds..and thats it..go slow and be ready for the ride.


There are alot of plants in this family, and alot real close to the family I'm sure. just research erowid, and be safe ......

Haha. Im not lying you know, high doses of Brugmansia/ Angels Trumpet, the plant i use definately causes acid-like visuals, not quite like the patterns you get with acid. But very intense visuals none-the-less. Normally if i take this dosage, after the intense visuals i go into the "daze" for about two days. Maybe you don't get these intense visuals with the other plants ??

btw: I've seen documentaries where the shamans eat very large doses and lie on their back convulsing and frothing at the mouth for a few hours, then 'wake-up' to share their visions.

i wasn't saying your lieing about the dose..just saying that you only need a slight dose of Dartura to way out do Lsd..I find there is a ego-loss and complete loss of real and not real...you don't even know when your coming out or going into phases ....high doses normally end up with someone in the hospital..unless you have a few babysitters..

**Datura/Jimson Weed**


It grows around here, and I've been wondering if I should try it.  The stuff on the net is kinda iffy at best, and I was wondering if anyone on the board had any advice.

You're talking about two different drugs,


Jimson weed is Salvia Divinorium.


Datura is Scopolamine.

wrong, the original poster is correct...


jimson weed is Datura stramonium.


if you are going to try datura, i would encourage you to learn EVERYTHING YOU CAN about it. even then it's unlikely you will be prepared for what you experience. datura is a deleriant, not a hallucinogen. it makes you see and experience things which do not occur. you lose touch with reality. this is a DANGEROUS DRUG!

Well it's one against one.  The only time I've heard "Jimson weed" was in reference to salvia d.


Enlighten us BL. What's Jimson weed?

jw is not sd. first contains alks: scop etc which are definite deleriants, as well as others whose mech of action is not known; enjoy your trip to the hospital, jail or both. 


latter contains salvinorin A, - the longest psychoactive molecule known afaik, and per/u, mayhap the strongest.

i have posted my story in a few posts...please look up others , most end in a hospital trip or jail..mine did not but I had alot of friends looking after me..I wouldn't recemend it to anybody who doesn't want a full on top level trip which puts you through delirium and back without you knowing it. I wouldn't say that I wouldn't do it again in another life but I sure won't in this one again..but it did help me see things from a different light. You can say you have been there..you have seen her..but at risk is your sanity...the wall between real and not..be safe, research and gather a good group of friend who know how to take care of a person who is out of their mind,(without calling the cops) and perpare for a ride that will change you forever..


be safe if you do take some..

Well what I was saying was that I thought Jimson weed was slang for salvia not datura.  I know now that jimson weed refers to datura.  I still consider "Jimson weed" to be slang and yes the only time I've heard the term was before some dude whipped out a bag of salvia.  I consider myself to be only 99.9999998% wrong.


So there, I guess.

Datura stramonium

[http://users.lycaeum.org/~crzkieri/home.html](http://users.lycaeum.org/~crzkieri/home.html)

jamestown weed... settlers at jamestown VA colony (founded 1609) didn't ask the local indians about what was good to eat & what was not so good; they had a rotating "test crew" to check out local plants for safety by ingestion... well, one day the test crew had angelflower salad... & when they finally came down (about a week later) it was decided that maybe the whole town had better avoid eatin' that particluar plant, hehheh... in writings from that era, it was described as "the greatest cooler in the world"...

twain's huck finn knew about jimpson weed...

there are other solanaceous genera with similar alkaloids: Hyoscymous, Atropa, Brugmansia, etc.

possibly useful as antidote to nerve gas (& insecticide) poisoning; has been used for inducing sleep, relieving pain, calming upset stomach, relieving allergy symptoms, treating seasickness, etc... a tiny amount can strengthen cannabis, opium, & many psychedelics (often added to sanpedro or ayahuasca beverages)...

but a bit too much, and most people become "dazed and confused" at best... & visually impaired, hospitalized, jailed, or toe-tagged at worst...

I took some seeds (Don't remember how many now, I was high at the time) and I just walked around hallucinating crazy things, like people cooking shrimp and giving them to me, when in fact I was eating bark off trees, and I started talking to myself in the mirror, at one point getting kinda mad at myself. It was pretty cool, and lasted about 7 hours.  I feel somewhat woozy today, but not too bad.  I just took an Ibuprofen and everything is A-OK.

I am glad to hear that everything is ok, If you didn't have friends your lucky nothing bad happened...but now that you have seen her are you done..or do you seek a even high truth with her? I went back a second time only to reach farther than before....but it ended even worse than the first time I did...Where does your mind see you going from here..?

I think that I will not do it again for awhile, and I did have a "ground crew," and they had to stop me from fighting a plant...that drug is weird.  I think I'll lay off the truly weird psychedelics for awhile, I'm thinking about doing mushrooms again.

good choice..and I'm happy to here you had help with your adventure..very smart. Alot of people don't take other peoples warnings serious...If you would I would love to here a trip report if you can piece one together from your memory and friends help... showing people with reports keeps people from hurting themselves..

I love that plant. I've used it a few times. The only reason i dont use it all the time is cause I know i'd go nut's for good. But it can be great fun. Just so long as you've got a sitter around. Here's my tips if anyone wants hear:

1. Have at LEAST 1 sober person. If this is true for any drug, its true for datura. I think unless you consumed a ridiculous quantity you're not very likely to come to harm directly from the drug itself. However, the hulucinations you see under the influence aren't like the pretty visuals you get on acid. THe best way to describe it is that your dreaming, but instead of laying still like when you asleep, your body acts out what your doing in your dream. Under light doses your more often in reality than dreamworld, and most of what you see/hear is real. As the dose increases, more and more of what you see/hear is halucinated and reality has less and less to do with what your senses are experiencing. Under extreme doses your body dose stay immobile though, and you start frothing at the mouth and have convulsions. Scary to watch, but from my experiences is not dangerous so long as someone keeps an eye on you. Take for example this setting:

Your sitting in your loungroom with 3 friends watching TV.

Light dose: Your still in your lounge with 3 friends watching TV, you may hear your freinds say things that really weren't said. You may have some memory loss. You may smoke some imaginary cig's. You may see things on the tv that aren't real.

Medium dose: Your stilll in your lounge. You might be in the company of any number of "freinds" though. The TV may be turned off but your enjoying the episode of simpsons anyway. You may have complete conversations with your invisble friends. You may believe your in a place other than your lounge such as a club or something. You may slip in and out of catatonic states.

Heavy dose: You have no idea where you are. You may think you outside in a park. The television may be a cinema screen. You might be  at a party. You might eat a bunch of things that either aren't food are aren't there at all. You might consume halucinated drugs and *feel* there effects. You may slip in and out of a sort of coma. This may last for days/weeks. You are no longer in reality. In short. Your dreaming.

Extreme dose: Your lying on your couch unconsious, your frothing at the mouth and having some kind of fit. When you come to you'll eperience what i wrote for heavy dose. You probably weren't feel normally for months/years.. maybe never again.


I never thought i could "lose control" until i took datura. So i wasn't with i sitter my first time.. i was real lucky though. I enjoyed the trip. But it scared the hell out of me that i could believe my toilet was a drug dealer. Or a tree was a cop trying to arrest me. Shit like that. If you think you can stay in control dont kid yourself. Reality will slip away, in a very subtle way. You may tell the person next to you that the datura isn't working for you.. but then realise your pet dog has no idea what your on about.


Basically, I love datura. SO don't be detered from trying it. But it will fuck you up. So dont think "Hey, im mentally stable, i dont need a baby sitter, i can handle drugs". Cause you can't *handle* datura.


BTW: 6 out of a group of 7 in Tasmania who tried datura drowned in a few inches of water because they believed they were marine animals. Lol--> Tasmanians !

Lol, those wacky tasmanians.  Apparently, it grows everywhere along the coast of California, and every year when it is in season like 15 people die because they just swim off into the ocean and don't come back.

Datura is similar to belladonna (beautiful lady) which is called that because back in the old days women used to put drops of liquid extract of it into their eyes to dilate their pupils, which was thought to make them more beautiful.  Both of these plants active ingredients are anticholinergenics, a class of drug which a common OTC product also fits into.  I'm speaking of course of dramamine/benadryl/nytol, if taken in the right quantity you can experience the same type of delirium from these OTC products as you can from the plants, but it is my understanding that the duration is a bit less with the pills.  So I would suggest that if you really do plan on trying a deliriant that you start with one of the aforementioned products.

i was gonna say datura and salvia are the same thing LMFAO, you really wanna hit erowid mate and read the datura vault, after all the k, dxm etc i have done i am still unsure about taking datura. i want to try it for ages and i ALLWAYS check my info before i do anything i suggest the datura FAQ at erowid or any other good site.

Igronence with drugs like that will lead to you ending in a mental hospital, jail or even death!

And yes you can die from datura poisoning!!!!!!!!

Research saves lives dont be so stupid as to jump ito it blind for god sake!

i once plucked like 20-30 of these plants. not sure exactly what it was but it grew on a short tree/bush thing and it was that same bellshaped white thing like the pics on erowid, friend said it was brugmansia though im not sure.


so anyways i boiled these 20-30leaves in a big pot and then chugged like 3cups of this shit. all that happened was i lost my short-range vision for the next 2-3days, got INCREDIBLE cottonmouth and felt like i was mildly drunk.


would i recommend this to anyone else? NO.

**Datura**


I don't know how to classify this story, but here it is.  This is all true.


My day started out good, woke up knowing later I was going to eat datura seeds.  When it came to the time, me and 4 other friends consumed them.  I ate 200 seeds from the pods of the plant and my friends consumed 150 seeds.  Within the first ten minutes, my eyes were pure black, dialated to the max.  This was at about 4:30 PM and the only effects i could feel was that i had a floating feeling.  Then at about midnight, everything just went down the hole.  My friend and I were driving and we ended up stopping in the middle of the road.  I told my friend to leave and we drove to some side street.  He ended parking his car and he said he had to pee.  I said "okay, I'll stay here."  Well I did stay there, but he never returned.  In front of me I could see 3 cop cars and they arrested him because he was pounding on houses and shouting.  So during this time, I was sitting in the car talking to people that weren't even there (But I could picture them perfectly, like they were in the flesh).  The funny thing was, they were people I knew too.  After the cops left, I got out of my arrested friend's car and started walking the streets.  I was walking down the street, talking to my best friend who vanished into the air about 20 mins. later.  I thought to myself.....am i dreaming?  Well,  I ended up walking into someone's RV and looking around seeing people in it thinking they were going to kill me.  I ran out of the RV and booked it to the street, I was seeing creatures and people all over the place.  I didn't know what to do or who I was.  At about 3am, My parents, I still have no idea how they found me, found me talking to a mailbox about British news (im american lol) and they ended up taking me to the hospital.  They drug tested me and only found THC in my system and they thought I was on a high dosage of LSD.  Well, they were wrong, I was on something a lot worse, DATURA.  For 3 days, I was in a really bad delirium, not knowing who I was and I was still "hallucinating" (if you want to call it that).  Not to mention, I couldn't see/read anything that was 5 ft. or closer to me.  After this was all over, I didnt touch drugs for half a year.  All I have to say is if you plan on trying this "legal drug"  DON'T!......unless you want a night like mine.  Thanks for reading and I hope I shed some light on this subject.

Belongs in trip reports.


But yes, dileriants are not "recreational" drugs.  You take then if you want to go crazy for a while.  Usually not a fun kind of crazy.


Anyways, did your friend really get arrested?  Or was that delirium speaking too?  What happened to the rest of 'em?

further proof that harm reduction sites like this on are vital in the psychedelic community.


I think we're all pretty fortunate that datura and other deleriants don't come with any kind of euphoria, like most traditional psychedelics, or we as a community would be fucked. I can imagine hoardes of people wandering onto highways, and into peoples houses like zombies.


If you're planning on experimenting with datura, wait for a trip sitter who is strong enough to restrain you, and do it in a place where you wont get yourself into any trouble. Otherwise, you might end up with a criminal record and a hospital bill.

my night with datura has me meeting people 3 years later who've heard of me as the "guy who ate those seeds." it's a ludicrously dificult test of will that seems to grant no feeling of pain and lots of strength along with absolute and utter confusion. it's fun on some level, kind of like it's fun to stay up for a few days just to see how long you can go. i'd definitely say it was dangerous though, and i don't say that about many substances at all.

I'd like to try it out in the middle of the desert somewhere, where there's nothing nearby to hurt myself or get in trouble with.


Reminds me of staying up WAY too long, I was talking to people who weren't there when I did that.  I thought there was a party at my house, but I was the only one there, and I kept asking everybody when they were going to leave because I wanted to go to bed... lol

I disagree on the "safety" of using this in the desert.


One of the biggest risks with Datura and Belladonna (which I've done, and am not proud of) is deathly dehydration... that shit is no fun no matter where you do it.


I was in a daze for three days and was completely convinced that I was in a Wiccan circle, being judged about how clean my soul was, and watching those that Isis deemed impure be smitten before me, in horribly tormenting, brutal ways. It was like spending 3 days in hell, and I'm lucky I had someone around to take care of me....


The shit is FAR from safe.

i don't even know if a sitter can really "fix" datura. i crushed a coffee pot in my bare hands, ripped a bunjie cord apart, and destroyed a toilet in a four hour period[among a host of other strange shit, i ended up naked talking to myself under an outside stairwell at one point and i can't remember at all how i got there or what happened after that]. i'm normally a really happy guy, drugs or no drugs, and i wasn't exactly filled with malice or anything: i just had no fucking idea what i was doing. i'm even somewhat familiar with the dilerient feel and it was still more than just a little overwhelming.  imagining the kind of things that could happen with someone who'd never played with other dilerients and who had a tendency to "spook" sounds like a really horrible time that'll probably result in jail time ;[ even though it can be very challenging[bordering on not fun, same with datura], i'd suggest doing diphenhydramine[benadryl, sleep aids] before datura so you'll know what to expect as they are pretty experientially similar. dph doesn't come with that inability to feel pain or superhuman strength so it's alot safer for anyone who might be around and for yourself. the confusion is still there, you just feel so weak that you're almost incapacitated and will typically end up in a shivering ball on a couch or bed. although the come on for dph always felt like the euphoria from an opiate's come on, which was always nice, the rest of it is just so tasking in everyway that there's little motivation to use it. the next day brings unquenchable thirst, speech patterns that make you sound like you're braindamaged, a brutal case of the shakes, incessant headaches, itchy skin, and general bodywide exhaustion. hurray!


edit: ya liteage is right on about that too. it destroys your vision for a while and you don't really remember much about your trip so you'll spend the next few days wondering what happened that night and how it's possible for you to feel like that

if yer stupid enough to want to try datura then you've got what's coming to ya. There is a difference between a drug and a poison, datura is a poison.

I did take diphenhydramine to get fucked up one time and it wasn't anything like I've heard datura described. It was more like a trip. I never hallucinated but I did get interesting visuals. Shit swirled around like acid but in different motions, it was night but it would look like it was daylight sort of like lightning flashes and a would see bubble and a giant amoeba looking thing infront of me. I had alot of odd sensations but never anything bad but I don't think I would ever care to repeat the experience. I don't think using it in the desert would b a good idea, u might end up making love to a cactus or drinking sand (don't u ever watch cartoons).

I've always been interested in datura, i really don't know why, it seems like the sort of completly insane stuff for days..i really wonder if i'll try it some time later in life.


A lower dose would be something i would do though, a very low dose to start with.

Because too many people are reading those "Legal/Natural Highs" articals.  They see a plant(Datura), that makes them see shit and is completely legal.  Ding ding, legal drugs that make me see shit, I've got to get some of that.

I'm actually wondering now...if someday I would like to do it...just to see if it's possible to remember it...and learn something from it along the same lines as LSD, but maybe much more hardcore knowledge.


I dunno, I'm definitely not even considering it right now. Maybe a couple years down the road when I am over things like LSD...and adjusted better spiritually, or whatever you wanna call it.


Anyone have any thoughts like this?


Also, I don't place any distinction between drugs and poisons. Drugs are just poisons that have a really high LD50. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Datura is the drug in which I most want to do but at the same time, will still never touch it... ever.

It amuses me so much how a plant can make us go totally insane like that. I just HAVE to know what it feels like/if I really do lose all control.

Are there any studies that show what it's doing to the brain during that time?

**TO RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE ONLY.**


So, here is some info about datura use (Datura spp.)

Note that it's exactly the same thing for any solanaceae plant as Atropa Belladonna aka Belladonna, Mandragora Officinarum aka mandrake, Hyoscyamus Niger aka henbane, Brugmansia spp. aka tree datura...I mean same risks, same effects (exepting that belladonna and mandrake are the most toxic ones: they have also been used as deadly poisons to kill people), same preparation (not tea!! make an ointment!), same advice about increasing dose progressively...the same.


MOST USED SPECIES OF DATURA:


Datura Inoxia (also called Datura Meteloides): 

this is the one mexico shamans use for visionnary purposes, probably the best specie to be used


Datura Metel (also called Datura Fastuosa): 

another specie used by shamans


Datura Strammonium: 

said to be more toxic than the two other species, it's the one that was used by european middle age witches


Note that there are many other species of datura but these are the most famous one (and "tree datura" is refering to another specie of solanaceae plant: Brugmansia spp.)


HOW TO USE DATURA:


Datura ?

Well, I believe all of you are responsible people. So I know all of you 

have been making lots of researches (on bluelight AND erowid.org) before even thinking about using such a dangerous (who did say poisonous ?) drug.

So, I would say that any of you who would think about using datura is aware of this:


Datura potency vary greatly from one plant to another (including between two plants of the same strain)...


MUCH better using the seeds since their potency vary much less than leaves & flowers (wich potency may vary greatly from one to another)

This doesn't mean seeds aren't dangerous. They are.

Note that roots portency also doesn't vary much so it's ok too.

BUT (!!) as someone previously said that 

" the root has an adittional additional alkaloid, apoatropine, which is extremely toxic, and likely to prove lethal even when taken in very small amounts, and by small amounts, we are talking 0.5-1mg or so" 

then I guess that for belladonna you should REALLY avoid using the roots (I think that considering this, if you're not stupid, you won't use the belladonna root).


Datura dosages often vary greatly from an individual to another. 

Some would get complete delirium with 30 seeds, other would need as much as 200 (!!). So if one would need 30 but use 200 as a friend who used 200 successfully told him to do he would just overdose...death can occur in two ways with datura: from cardiovascular troubles (greatly increased heart rate, up to 150bpm, and severe hypertension) leading to haemorrhage, heart failure... OR from overheating up to 42-43°C !

You'll HAVE TO start with low dose (20-30) and work your way up progressively until you find your OWN dose (for me it's around 100 seeds with datura strammonium, the only specie I've tried)


Smoking leaves/flowers is said to be the safest way to use datura but I tried to smoke datura stramonium leaves, flowers and seeds with NO results. Just a very slight high feeling. Maybe this could work if your plant is very concentrated but I doubt it would give any hallucinations, I think at most would you get a high and weird feelings.


So here is how to get hallucinations:


The WRONG & most dangerous way to use Datura (& other solanaceae) is to take them orally (eating the seeds or making a tea)... hospitalisations and death have often happened with oral use.


The ONLY "SAFE" (note the " ") way has to be the way people who used datura for thousand years have choosen:

Shamans & european witches believe the good way to be transdermal use in the form of an ointment wich is spread over specific parts of the body.


The wise guy knows the only way to choose to be the shaman's way (not 

the "people on the internet" or "friend of mine" way)


Yess, shamans & witches know what they are doing. 


Datura has two active principles. One is "good" for tripping. The other is not. The good one can pass through the skin. The bad one can't. So using datura transdermally is the way to keep the bad one out of you're body (that sounds great because you don't want this one to be in your system)

Don't ask me how could shamans be aware of this, centuries ago...


Ow! People on the internet claim they have been using a tea successfully ? Congratulations ! (note that some didn't had any congratulations for their tea because they are no more here to tell anyone about their own tea-death story )

Fun, isn't it ? 

So don't listen to internet people saying stupid things like "make a tea, drink it, that's a great high, it worked for me"...because it was fatal to many.


SO, I hope nobody is fool enough to use datura orally when they know it's not good for them


...& here is the ointment recipe (so nobody has any excuse for not doing it):


-Crush the datura seeds in a fine powder. 

-Place the powdered seeds in some lard (= pork fat).

-Add some organic soot (how to make it: see below).

-Blend well.

-Cook over a gentle heat (below 100 °C) for 2-4 hours while stiring regularly.

-Let sit for a week (at least) in a dark place, stir regularly (several times a day).

-Filter (see the note below).

-Keep the fatty ointment in a sealed glass jar, in a dark & cool place.


Note: you'd better handle the ointment wearing gloves (since the ointment is absorbed through the skin).


How to make organic soot ? Just place some lard in some aluminium foil to make a foil parcel. Place it in the ambers until the lard is completely grilled (you should obtain some black organic soot).


How to use the ointment: 


Witches used to spread it...

-over their temples

-under their armpits

-over their vagina

-just behind their ears

-over their neck

-over the interior part of their forearm

-over the left part of their stomach

-over their calves

-and under their sole (of the feet).


NEVER spread any on your forehead (risk of death).


I would suggest starting with only the temples & armpits (very suitable areas for transdermal absorption).


Note that the calves & sole are for producing a feeling of flight (I don't know about other areas specificties).


NOTE (!!) that there is a more elaborated preparation (and probably SAFER) for the ointment explained in castaneda's books (in "The Teachings of don Juan" or "A Separate Reality", I don't remember which one exactly)...


I never tried any ointment myself: I only tried 60 seeds orally, and as it didn't produce any hallucinations and was so damn unpleasant, then I just stopped experimenting with it, but many reliable books about shamanism and entheogens I read do claim that making an ointment is the safest way to go if one would want to get hallucinations from solanaceae plants, and they say that oral use is just too risky (the ointment is the shaman & witches method so I just trust it).


Always keep in mind that there is no "safe" datura trip. This is a VERY dangerous drug. Be careful.

HAVE a trip-sitter !!! (you won't be able to control yourself)


WHY IS THERE SO BIG NOISE ABOUT DATURA USE ?


1)because the effect is more like toxik than hallucinogen, it's not much enjoyable (you feel sick, no ophoria effect at all, you vomit, your eyes can't see clear so you can't read anything even if it's writen in big letters, your mouth is completely dry, so you drink a lot but you can't piss anymore, your body temperature rise and you may get feverish (!), so does your blood pressure, your heart rythm become faster, your in complete delirium so you don't understand anything of what's happening around you, you don't realize that your hallucinations aren't real so you don't even have fun hallucinating because you don't know you are, and you almost don't remember your night on the next day, 

the only "fun" thing is that later on you can remember "well last night I was really fucked up and I had real hallucinations, I don't remember much of all this, I didn't have fun doing this, but now it's really fun to think about how fucked up I was".

Also unpleasant because the delirium state can last for 3 days (yess with dry mouth and inability to piss...) and then there is an additional period of 3days-1 week you cannot see clear (you can't read) because your eyes are still fucked up.

Note that regular use both fuck up your mental and your body (serious consequences!)...and by the way, there have been a few people who stayed stuck into their trip for month after one single use.


My point is that datura isn't for fun, it has nothing to do with a recreational drug, the only use of interest could be visionary shamanic practices, and even in this case I would rather take something else (shrooms, peyote, salvia are both much more fun and much more safe than datura)


2) because there have been GREAT amount of death with this plant for many reasons:


-dosages can vary greatly from one people to another . for instance, one would need 30 seeds to hallucinate while another would need around 150-200 ! if someone (who would need no more than 30) had no experience with datura and was told by a friend (who successfully used 200) that 200 is the right dose, he may probably die (overdose from heart attack or overheating)

You have to start with low dose (30 seeds at first) and increase progressively (wait 3 days between each trials).


-plant potency can vary greatly from one plant to another, depending on the growing location, the subspecies, the harvesting period...for instance, green fruits of solanaceaes are said to be much much more potent than mature fruits... (so even if you know your dose with one plant you've tried, it can be different with another one)


-different parts of one single plant can have very different potency. Better use seeds because their potency doesn't vary much.


-because people don't know that shamans and witches who used datura for centuries all used to take datura transdermally (absorption through the skin in form of a fat cream) and almost never used it orally 

Why? because there are two different active drugs in datura : atropine wich is very toxik and a little hallucinogenic, and scopolamine wich is very hallucinogenic and less toxic than atropine. So the one you want is scopolamine only. The problem is that if you use datura orally, you get both in your body, unless you use it transdermally because only scopolamine can pass through the skin (atropine will stay out of your body this way).


-because people are so delirious that they kill themselves making stupid things (like swimming in such a delirious state, or passing through a window...)


-because people arent' aware of drug interactions and contraindications:

you must never use datra if any cardiovascular troubles, if glaucoma, if on antidepressants.

you must never mix datura with any medecine or drugs (even weed is said to be a bad idea !) because this could rise your blood pressure so hard that you would die.


-also note that doing any physically exhausting activity (such as dancing at a rave) can be dangerous on datura (risk of rise in cardiac rythm(& blood pressure) or rise in body temperature wich are both already much higher than normal when you're on datura)


So : read ALL informations on bluelight.ru AND erowid.org before considering about trying such a dangerous toxic plant!!!

I did datura once a while ago.. I ate 10 seeds from a seed pod.. Nothing happened.. All I got was horrible side effects.. Every HOLE in my body was dryer than a fucking desert. And towards 6 hours after eating it I started to hear voices, but for the most part I got nothing out of it..

*Datura* and *Atropa* contain Hyoscyamine, Scopolamine and Atropine. *Datura* has more of the first two and *Atropa* has a lot more Atropine. It is generally regarded that Atropine is nastier than the other two (thus, **deadly** nightshade). 


I do not know about "acid-like visuals" - what I do know is that these three cause your mucus glads to stop secreting, thus drying up your mouth, throat, trachea, nose, rectum and vagina - severely. 


The effects also last for several days.


If that is your idea for a trip, then be my guest.

^Every drug dehydrates you...Datura is one of the most powerful drugs (Maybe the most powerful?) so it dries you out like no other.


I am thinking of trying Datura. People who have had good datura experiences: did you eat the seeds or the leafs?

Seeds are more mental, leaves causes heavier delerium, and flowers seem to be more visual.  Be careful with this stuff.  You get a really bad feeling from it.  I know that sounds blunt, but that's all I can really say.  Same thing with diphenhydramine.  Like death impending or something, but worse.  Anyway, be careful.  Peace.

I have also heard anecdotal reports that burgmansia is worse than datura... But then, I haven't heard much positive about datura either (except for some new age guy who combines it with deep meditation and has spectacular results).


There was also a death case involving burgmansia around here say, two years ago - some kid drowned in a 30cm deep spring (!!!) - so maybe that's what triggered the rumour.

I am sorry, but there is so much that is wrong with this post!


No, not every drug causes dehydration. I have never felt dehydrated on, say, 2C-I. 


And just because a drug is "more powerful" (whatever that is), doesn't mean it will cause more dehydration!


The only way I tried Datura is by smoking a tiny, TINY (about that big [---]) piece of leaf material with a bit of weed and a bit of tobacco. I felt floaty and my mouth was dry for at least 24 hours.


I can't imagine how horrendous it would be if youeat the seeds.

Says who?  All parts of the plant contain scopolamine.  Seeds are/were commonly consumed by many cultures in the New World.  Obviously the seeds contain a higher quantity of scopolamine, so you would need to consume much less than if you had eaten the leaves.


How much less?  Who knows.  The scopolamine content can vary from plant to plant, leaf to leaf, and even from the time of day it is picked.  This is why (as well as the general nature of the experience itself) experimenting with this plant is downright dangerous.  This one should really be left to the shamans.


If you must work with datura, I recommend you follow Jamshyd's advice and smoke a tiny quantity.  This way, you can at least titrate the dosage (to some degree anyway) and reduce the chances of winding up naked in a field, smoking invisible cigarettes, and talking to your ansestors.  8(

me and 2 of my friends were chilling at my house and decided to go smoke some of this amazing weed (headies) in this graveyard by my house. 


it was around 1 am so it was pretty dark and we were heading back when we all saw this blinding light for 2-3 seconds, it made us all jump and sort of stumble to the ground.. 


i dont know if this was supernatural and actually real or just a hallucination because of all the THC we'd consumed, but it had a weird feel to it that i had never felt on any of my other trips ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) 


we didnt know what to believe..plus the fact we had all witnessed it at the same time makes me think even more it wasn't just a hallucination.

please do yourself a favor and stay away from datura.  Just have

a look at the reports on erowid and 90% of the users tell you not to 

do it....could this be a wise advice?


If you decide to do it anyway,  you NEED a sober sitter to watch you at

all time.  The delirium induced by this plant can possibly endanger your

life or the life of others.

Sorry morninggloryseed for being so ambiguous. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


Not to start up an argument (chime in if you want to), but wouldn't the Old World have better uses and knowledge about the plant rather than the New World?  When I hear New World, I think of ignorant Europeans who have no knowledge of plants and the likings compared to the Old World people.


mgs - I'm a tad bit confused. So it doesn't matter what part of the plant you take? Or is avoiding the seeds and using a portion of the leaves the best route?


Oh, and lsdod, one more thing. It is required by Bluelight law for you to write a trip report about this strange plant. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Old world = Europe

New world = N & S America


Shamans in the new world are very skilled at what they do.


It doesn't matter which part you use (leaves or seeds) as long as you significantly adjust the dosage.  The effects of each are the same, but leaves are significantly weaker in potency as compared to seeds.  So one would use much less seeds.

Hmm jus tout of interest is the deadlynightshade you are referring to the same as the deadlynightshade you get growing in the UK which kind of looks like berries growing out of the ground? If so a relative of mine ate about 4 of them when he was 7 and went mad and was frothing at the mouth for hours before being takne to hospital, I'm thinking it must be differnt though because it would be deifnaltey recognsed as something hallucinogenic as opposed to something compleatly toxic..

yes rasclatt, they are the same plant. also deadlynightshade can be toxic in relatively small amounts. 1 dry gram of atropa belladonna leaves will produce an almost 48 hour trip. and a little more might cause death.

First, I'd have to disagree with the comment several posts earlier that Daturas/Brugmansias are not dangerous in terms of toxicity, it's well documented that the dosage curve is pretty steep and that a strong dose can be quite toxic or potentially lethal. It doesn't help either that there isn't a reliable way to to determine the concentrations of the anticholinergens in the plant, even throughout the same plant. 

Also, while different people at different times and places have consumed different parts of the plant matter, most recepes Ive come across involve brewing a tea from the seeds (and sometimes leaf matter).


While Datura probably has a higher concentration of atropine than Brugmansia and one may be a more potent anticholinergenic plant, I'm pretty confident that the difference between the two would be one of degree rather than dimension. Both involve the same chemicals in different concentration.


Another point of interest is that dramamine, gravol and certain other over-the-counter antihistamines appear to contain anticholinergenic deleriants. I haven't put this to the test, nor am I in any hurry to do so, but I imagine that the intoxication produced by these substances would be comparable in terms of their effects to small doses of Datura or the like. 


In any case, it's been quite rightly pointed out by a few people on this board more than a few times that trippping on anticholinergens far more often than not leads to dramatically unpleasant experiences. This is most of all the case with Datura and her relatives. While some of strong head in ideal set and setting and specific purpose for the experience may well have a pleasant or constructive experience, taking it for purely recreational experiences or to "get fucked up"seems to almost invariably lead to horror stories. 

Deleriants aren't acid and I think any comparison to any dose of LSD or her analogs would be completely baseless. From what I understand, the only level on which they might be comparable would be how both substances can cause dissociation and loss of context of the world around one. However, unlike with deleriants, a person on LSD is usually quite able to distinguish reality from hallucination, and the possibility of a toxic overdose is pretty much never an issue. 

Id think long and hard about your motives for messing around with Datura. Personally, sitting in a room with a buddy, looking away to light a cigarette only to find that the person whom I took to be present had disapeared entirely in the brief moment during which I diverted gaze sounds pretty unpleasant and not like a particularily great kick. There's also a lot of trip reports with people reportedly finding that "they aren't quite the same" weeks or months after ingestion. Granted, LSD and other psychedelics can cause perspective and paradigm shifts in people which sustain long after consumption. But in the case of deleriants, the sustained state is more often described as a prolonged state comparable to some kind of mild psychosis. Granted, these reports could be overembelishments. But given what I've heard and understand of these drugs, I'm inclined to believe them. I may try them at some point, but not in anything less than an ideal set and setting and within a context where I have something I specifically hope to gain from venturing down that path. For now, they just seem extremely menacing and potentially quite dangerous.

"1 dry gram of atropa belladonna leaves will produce an almost 48 hour trip. and a little more might cause death."


Not neccesarily true. The reason Erowid and many other sites avoid specifying dosages for Datura and the like is because two plants grown beside each other in the same garden under the same condition could have dramatically different concentrations of anticholinergenics. Sometimes distribution within the same plant is radically uneven. 


The only resonsible way to determine dosage with Datura is to take a bunch of seed or whatever you want to use.. ground it and mix it (to distribute concentration evenly) ... and start with a very conservative dose and slowly work your way up. after you're done with that batch, the particular dose determined means nothing in relationship to any subsequent batch.

**Does anyone here like belladonna/datura**


Where I live , there are datura trees growing all over the place.  Of course this means that when i am bored, I run up to someone's yard and pick a leaf or two for munching purposes.


I find the effect to be quite pleasurable at "museum-level" doses.  It provides a sense of well-being that lasts all week; it is an effective, natural, long-lasting, antihistimine (i have bad allergies), and it gives you crazy lucid dreams.  What's not to like?


Does any one else feel the same way?  Or am i in the loner category here.

**I'm bored repeating myself, but I guess it's better if I do so...**


OK, first I want to say that belladonna (Atropa Belladonna) has exactly the same effects than datura, but belladonna contains much more atropine than datura (which is not good as the interesting compound in solanaceae plants is scopolamine as it is more hallucinogenic and less toxic than atropine)


So, here I'll just cut and paste what I said about datura as it is exactly the same thing for beladonna (and other solanaceae as Mandragora Officinarum aka mandrake, Hyoscyamus Niger aka henbane, Brugmansia spp. aka tree datura)...I mean same risks, same effects (exepting that belladonna and mandrake are the most toxic ones: they have also been used as deadly poisons to kill people), same preparation (not tea!! make an ointment!), same advice about increasing dose progressively...the same.


MOST USED SPECIES OF DATURA:


Datura Inoxia (also called Datura Meteloides): 

this is the one mexico shamans use for visionnary purposes, probably the best specie to be used


Datura Metel (also called Datura Fastuosa): 

another specie used by shamans


Datura Strammonium: 

said to be more toxic than the two other species, it's the one that was used by european middle age witches


Note that there are many other species of datura but these are the most famous one (and "tree datura" is refering to another specie of solanaceae plant: Brugmansia spp.)


HOW TO USE DATURA:


Datura ?

Well, I believe all of you are responsible people. So I know all of you 

have been making lots of researches (on bluelight AND erowid.org) before even thinking about using such a dangerous (who did say poisonous ?) drug.

So, I would say that any of you who would think about using datura is aware of this:


Datura potency vary greatly from one plant to another (including between two plants of the same strain)...


MUCH better using the seeds since their potency vary much less than leaves & flowers (wich potency may vary greatly from one to another)

This doesn't mean seeds aren't dangerous. They are.

Note that roots portency also doesn't vary much so it's ok too.

BUT (!!) as someone previously said that 

" the root has an adittional additional alkaloid, apoatropine, which is extremely toxic, and likely to prove lethal even when taken in very small amounts, and by small amounts, we are talking 0.5-1mg or so" 

then I guess that for belladonna you should REALLY avoid using the roots (I think that considering this, if you're not stupid, you won't use the belladonna root).


Datura dosages often vary greatly from an individual to another. 

Some would get complete delirium with 30 seeds, other would need as much as 200 (!!). So if one would need 30 but use 200 as a friend who used 200 successfully told him to do he would just overdose...death can occur in two ways with datura: from cardiovascular troubles (greatly increased heart rate, up to 150bpm, and severe hypertension) leading to haemorrhage, heart failure... OR from overheating up to 42-43°C !

You'll HAVE TO start with low dose (20-30) and work your way up progressively until you find your OWN dose (for me it's around 100 seeds with datura strammonium, the only specie I've tried)


Smoking leaves/flowers is said to be the safest way to use datura but I tried to smoke datura stramonium leaves, flowers and seeds with NO results. Just a very slight high feeling. Maybe this could work if your plant is very concentrated but I doubt it would give any hallucinations, I think at most would you get a high and weird feelings.


So here is how to get hallucinations:


The WRONG & most dangerous way to use Datura (& other solanaceae) is to take them orally (eating the seeds or making a tea)... hospitalisations and death have often happened with oral use.


The ONLY "SAFE" (note the " ") way has to be the way people who used datura for thousand years have choosen:

Shamans & european witches believe the good way to be transdermal use in the form of an ointment wich is spread over specific parts of the body.


The wise guy knows the only way to choose to be the shaman's way (not 

the "people on the internet" or "friend of mine" way)


Yess, shamans & witches know what they are doing. 


Datura has two active principles. One is "good" for tripping. The other is not. The good one can pass through the skin. The bad one can't. So using datura transdermally is the way to keep the bad one out of you're body (that sounds great because you don't want this one to be in your system)

Don't ask me how could shamans be aware of this, centuries ago...


Ow! People on the internet claim they have been using a tea successfully ? Congratulations ! (note that some didn't had any congratulations for their tea because they are no more here to tell anyone about their own tea-death story )

Fun, isn't it ? 

So don't listen to internet people saying stupid things like "make a tea, drink it, that's a great high, it worked for me"...because it was fatal to many.


SO, I hope nobody is fool enough to use datura orally when they know it's not good for them


...& here is the ointment recipe (so nobody has any excuse for not doing it):


-Crush the datura seeds in a fine powder. 

-Place the powdered seeds in some lard (= pork fat).

-Add some organic soot (how to make it: see below).

-Blend well.

-Cook over a gentle heat (below 100 °C) for 2-4 hours while stiring regularly.

-Let sit for a week (at least) in a dark place, stir regularly (several times a day).

-Filter (see the note below).

-Keep the fatty ointment in a sealed glass jar, in a dark & cool place.


Note: you'd better handle the ointment wearing gloves (since the ointment is absorbed through the skin).


How to make organic soot ? Just place some lard in some aluminium foil to make a foil parcel. Place it in the ambers until the lard is completely grilled (you should obtain some black organic soot).


How to use the ointment: 


Witches used to spread it...

-over their temples

-under their armpits

-over their vagina

-just behind their ears

-over their neck

-over the interior part of their forearm

-over the left part of their stomach

-over their calves

-and under their sole (of the feet).


NEVER spread any on your forehead (risk of death).


I would suggest starting with only the temples & armpits (very suitable areas for transdermal absorption).


Note that the calves & sole are for producing a feeling of flight (I don't know about other areas specificties).


NOTE (!!) that there is a more elaborated preparation (and probably SAFER) for the ointment explained in castaneda's books (in "The Teachings of don Juan" or "A Separate Reality", I don't remember which one exactly)...


I never tried any ointment myself: I only tried 60 seeds orally, and as it didn't produce any hallucinations and was so damn unpleasant, then I just stopped experimenting with it, but many reliable books about shamanism and entheogens I read do claim that making an ointment is the safest way to go if one would want to get hallucinations from solanaceae plants, and they say that oral use is just too risky (the ointment is the shaman & witches method so I just trust it).


Always keep in mind that there is no "safe" datura trip. This is a VERY dangerous drug. Be careful.

HAVE a trip-sitter !!! (you won't be able to control yourself)


WHY IS THERE SO BIG NOISE ABOUT DATURA USE ?


1)because the effect is more like toxik than hallucinogen, it's not much enjoyable (you feel sick, no ophoria effect at all, you vomit, your eyes can't see clear so you can't read anything even if it's writen in big letters, your mouth is completely dry, so you drink a lot but you can't piss anymore, your body temperature rise and you may get feverish (!), so does your blood pressure, your heart rythm become faster, your in complete delirium so you don't understand anything of what's happening around you, you don't realize that your hallucinations aren't real so you don't even have fun hallucinating because you don't know you are, and you almost don't remember your night on the next day, 

the only "fun" thing is that later on you can remember "well last night I was really fucked up and I had real hallucinations, I don't remember much of all this, I didn't have fun doing this, but now it's really fun to think about how fucked up I was".

Also unpleasant because the delirium state can last for 3 days (yess with dry mouth and inability to piss...) and then there is an additional period of 3days-1 week you cannot see clear (you can't read) because your eyes are still fucked up.

Note that regular use both fuck up your mental and your body (serious consequences!)...and by the way, there have been a few people who stayed stuck into their trip for month after one single use.


My point is that datura isn't for fun, it has nothing to do with a recreational drug, the only use of interest could be visionary shamanic practices, and even in this case I would rather take something else (shrooms, peyote, salvia are both much more fun and much more safe than datura)


2) because there have been GREAT amount of death with this plant for many reasons:


-dosages can vary greatly from one people to another . for instance, one would need 30 seeds to hallucinate while another would need around 150-200 ! if someone (who would need no more than 30) had no experience with datura and was told by a friend (who successfully used 200) that 200 is the right dose, he may probably die (overdose from heart attack or overheating)

You have to start with low dose (30 seeds at first) and increase progressively (wait 3 days between each trials).


-plant potency can vary greatly from one plant to another, depending on the growing location, the subspecies, the harvesting period...for instance, green fruits of solanaceaes are said to be much much more potent than mature fruits... (so even if you know your dose with one plant you've tried, it can be different with another one)


-different parts of one single plant can have very different potency. Better use seeds because their potency doesn't vary much.


-because people don't know that shamans and witches who used datura for centuries all used to take datura transdermally (absorption through the skin in form of a fat cream) and almost never used it orally 

Why? because there are two different active drugs in datura : atropine wich is very toxik and a little hallucinogenic, and scopolamine wich is very hallucinogenic and less toxic than atropine. So the one you want is scopolamine only. The problem is that if you use datura orally, you get both in your body, unless you use it transdermally because only scopolamine can pass through the skin (atropine will stay out of your body this way).


-because people are so delirious that they kill themselves making stupid things (like swimming in such a delirious state, or passing through a window...)


-because people arent' aware of drug interactions and contraindications:

you must never use datra if any cardiovascular troubles, if glaucoma, if on antidepressants.

you must never mix datura with any medecine or drugs (even weed is said to be a bad idea !) because this could rise your blood pressure so hard that you would die.


-also note that doing any physically exhausting activity (such as dancing at a rave) can be dangerous on datura (risk of rise in cardiac rythm(& blood pressure) or rise in body temperature wich are both already much higher than normal when you're on datura)


So : read ALL informations on bluelight.ru AND erowid.org before considering about trying such a dangerous toxic plant!!!

i was thinking about trying datura, but after making a post just liek yours on BL, and readng what every1 has experienced(trip reports and such), im never even gonna go near the stuf.


only beneficial way of doing datura that i can see, would be if u wanted to get yourself thrown into a mental home.

hahaha you just didn't understand: as belladonne is much more toxic than datura (too much nasty atropine in the plant) then it means that it is much less fun than datura (if datura can be considered as "fun"). Belladonna will give you exactly the same trip (not more fun, not less fun than datura: just delirium) but with much more nasty toxic side effects (dry mouth, fever, overheating, heart troubles, inability to piss will be increased) and that's all it is about. You get it?

The safest and most enjoyable way to take Datura is to smoke little pieces of the dried flower.  Mix a little bit with some MJ and it will add some minor psychedelic effects and not make you delirious.  This way you can slowly adjust your dosage to a comfortable level.  In my opinion this is the only viable way to take Datura.

I know datura is extreme stuff when you take alot, and it can be difficult to gauge what "alot" is.  However, i was really only talking about taking miniscule doses.  I like to take like half a leaf and just chew on it for for a while.


It's actually pretty easy stuff if you aim low.  Instead of trying for delerium, i would encourage anyone who decides to take the stuff to only take the smallest amount possible.


That way you can really enjoy the subtleties like vivid color enhancement and stimulation of dreaming.  And you can avoid the nastier side effects of insanity and bad physical effects (aside from cotton mouth which is unavoidable with this drug).

As I was working my doses up to find which quantity would start to have hallucinogenic effect in me, I found small oral doses of datura (seeds) to be very very very unpleasant : with small quantities I had no hallucinations (no high, no oforia, nothing) but I had all the negative effects for 6 hours: comletely dry mouth, inability to piss, blurred vision and confusion. Really bad. 

If you want to get some slight high from datura without getting into delirium and negative side effects, then the only way to go would be to smoke crushed flowers or leaves (but I found it poorly efficient).

**read better what I said...**


Oral use is the most dangerous way to use datura, to get hallucinations the best way to go is absorption through the skin (make an ointment) as it is much less toxic this way...

Smoking it is a lot safer than both oral and transdermal use (almost not dangerous), BUT from personal experience it doesn't produce any hallucinations (at most it will give you some high/weird feeling if your leaves/flowers are potent enough).

Smoking it should produce no delirium, no hallucinations and no negative side effects (no dry mouth, no blurred vision, no inability to piss and such)...just a slight high.

Just dry some flowers.  Add little pieces in with some MJ and roll a spliff.  Smoke it and see how you feel.  If your flowers are somewhat potent you won't need much to get noticeable effects.   Much better then ending up in the hospital.

I have tried datura a few times but all it did was give me really bad dry mouth and made me piss a lot. I got very little if any mind effects or visuals. I may try again some day but not any time soon. I have tried using small amounts to see how it would effect my dreams. It may have made my dreams more vivid but I am not sure. I have vivid dreams pretty often so it may have not been the datura.

Akoto, use a normal amount of marijuana.  Dry your flower.  It should be fairly long, I'm not sure of the exact species I was using.  Only a very little was necessary, maybe an 1/8th or so of the flower.  Break it up and spread out evenly in the joint and roll as usual.  Depending on the potency of the flower you may need to increase your dosage until you find a comfortable range.  The flowers I used only needed small amounts to achieve effects that I was comfortable with.


Do not expect to be blown away with visuals or to trip at all.  Do expect to get higher then normal, have some minor visual stuff out of the corner of your eyes, and have a very dry mouth.  Start small and see how you feel.  You can always increase your dosage once you establish how potent your flowers are.


I experimented with this for a week and found it interesting, just don't expect too much.  Any higher dose, I imagine, would begin to get uncomfortable.

**I did check the smoking method again, here are the results...**


2 years ago during the summer I found a sunny field covered of mature Datura strammonium plants.

There were both "purple stem" and "green stem" datura strammonium strain on this field. I collected flowers, dried them and stored them (dried flowers are 5-6 cm long)


This morning I decided to smoke some. I finely crushed almost 1g of these, added some tobacco to it, and smoked it as a (big) joint. Each toke was kept in the lungs for 5-10 seconds. The taste was OK.

I found it to produce a mild high. The effect lasted for 30min to 1h (more like 40min).

I was feeling light headed and slightly anaesthesied/relaxed.

There was a short slight headache after 30 min.

The high somewhat reminded me of when you're laying on some beach with the sun on your face so you feel light headed and sleepy at the same time. 

But there was no "stoning" as with marijuana... and no hallucinations/visuals like with oral/transdermal datura use.

No pupils dilatation, I experienced slightly increased heart beat & blood pressure (but less intense than when smoking lots of marijuana), slightly dry mouth (much less than after smoking some marijuana).

The good point was that smoking datura would not produce any unpleasant side effects such as the dry mouth/inability to piss/blurred vision you get when using it orally.

Thanks for your exhaustive posts genaro - very useful.  I've taken datura twice, orally both times, using 25 and then 60 seeds of datura stramonium.  I had no trip at all in either case, just felt very ill.  Now I guess I know why!


Quick question - when preparing the ointment what's the best way to do the filtering bit - are normal filter papers as you use for ground coffee OK?

Would it be benificial in any way to inject scopolamine? I have these Scopoderm patches that contain 1 mg, but I have no idea on how to purify the gel or extract it from the patch. I've tried eating them before mostly to potentiate opiates, but only got minor effects.

Use some fine piece of cloth (press well to recover all the fatty mixture from the plant material)...filter paper won't work for fat substances.

I higly recommend you never attempt it: scopolamine is a deadly poison (same for atropine) and it can kill you if ingested in mg doses so injecting it would be really suicidal !!!


Lethal doses: 

atropine= over 10mg

scopolamine = over 2-4 mg !!!


But as it's a gel for transdermal use, then I guess you could use the gel from the patches just like the ointment...


Also note I edited my post about smoking datura, adding some more details.

**vegetarian alternative for organic soot?**


Hello all, this is a first post in years so please pardon me for reviving an older thread.


I've been experimenting with *Datura strammonium* for the past year.  In the maximum dosages/sitting, I have ingested up to 60 seeds and also smoked up to what I would approximate as 1.5g of dried pod cases.  Neither of these have offered any extreme effects, mostly minor changes to my thought patterns, altered perceptions and various aching feelings.  


The most visually active experience I've had was with sharing two joints of the pods and mj and consuming 30ish seeds with alcohol.  Even this experience was fairly minor, with the company at the time becoming 2 dimensional (moreso in perspective than personality) and this annoying yellow rectangle that tinted the center of my field of vision for an hour.


It is possible that the variety that I have is fairly weak.  It was grown in full-sun, good soil structure and nutrition in a Boreal Plains Ecozone (semi dry, moderate length growing season).


I've come to believe that ingesting the seeds can give somewhat cumulative effects.  I was consuming an average of 15 seeds a day while I read Castaneda's "Journey to Ixtlan" over a period of about a week and my thoughts, perceptions and mind state were certainly quite different from baseline near the end... but that could be the mystical abilities of Castaneda's words ~;)


Anyways, now **to the purpose of this post**:


I would like to try the ointment recipe in order to increase the potency of the dosages that I have been consuming without having to get the shitty after effects that I have had with higher dosages of seeds orally (which I am assuming is coming from the atropine and other nasties).


My spiritual beliefs require me to abstain from consuming meat prior to major psychadelic experiences in order to improve the result.  I respect the power and danger of Datura use and have no intention of letting myself weaken in the face of "the green temptress" (this name coming from a trip report on erowid if i remember correctly).


I was wondering if there was any alternative to using organic soot?  I assume that vegetarian shortening a/o oil can be used to substitute the lard (or perhaps even something wonderfully soothing like a burt's bees product) but I do not know what would be a suitable substitute for the soot.  Would a certain type of ash be sufficient?


Essentially, what is in the organic soot that is required?  toasted proteins, a caustic residue, some minerals, broken down fats?  any educated guess/conjecture would be appreciated.  Thanx so much

I was going to protest against the very idea of playing around with your life and sanity on a poison, but then I remembered that you all have access to all the relevant information. From here on it's up to ol' Charles.

*Morrison's Lament*, you're a sweetheart to make such a remark ~:D

but i'm an evolutionary biologist myself and well aware of the potential reprecussions, though the esteemed Mr. Darwin would likely not approve... but he has never claimed to be an arbiter to my knowledge.


having never incinerated lard or flesh, i have no idea of the composition of the remains and that is my reason for asking.  anyone?

before i'd smoked salvia, datura was the 'most powerful' drug i was aware of. i ate a bunch of seeds and was stupified into a very severe confusion like what you feel on benadryl or ambien. on top of the confusion there was a physical pain all over and feelings of dread. memory holes and nonsense are what i took away from that night. i recall the comeon feeling like my bones were on fire under my skin, which felt dry and ichy. the two people who saw me said i was hardly human and that they'd never seen anyone that twisted. i broke a door, some mugs and a coffee pot, a toilet, and took off naked at one point and had no idea what i was doing during any of that. my vision was totally ruined for about 10 hours thereafter. i don't really understand how it could ever be pleasant. that salve idea sounds interesting but i can attest to the hellishness of an oral dosse of seeds.

I've always wondered how datura+mdma would be or perhaps datura+lsd. other then the insane risk of dying over dehydration before that set in I wonder how the datura+mdma would feel. would it be pleasent and would the hallucinations you have be good?

It's not that smoking is safe *per se*, it's more to do with the fact that smoking produces an almost instant effect, so it's much easier to titrate your dose. If you were to smoke a concentrated extract, or the pure alkaloids, you could still do yourself a lot of damage

Heres some information on Belladonna


**Belladonna *Atropa belladonna* "Deadly Nightshade"**


All parts of plant contain alkaloids, mainly 1-hyoscyamin, minor scopolamine (=hyoscine)


Extraction from plant involves alkali (NaOH, KOH or ammonia water)

--produces "racemization" from pure 1-hoscyamine to 50% 1-hyoscyamine 50% d-hyoscyamine to yield d,1-hyoscyamine = atropine (still active, anticholinergic)


Symptoms of eating plant parts same as atropine (hyoscyamine)

--Enlarged Pupils - Blurred vision

--PNS: Drying up of all secretions: sweat, tears, salivation, extreme thirst

--CNS: Hallucination, stupor, loss of conciousness, **death**


Alkaloids highest in fruit, seed (.8% total alkaloids), root (.6% )

An interesting side note:

Datura seeds were used as a part of medicinal smoking mixtures by native Americans. This is because they act as bronchodilators. I don't know of any North American people outside of Mexico who used datura as an inebriant, though.

Datura stramonium is one I've had before. We did have to use a bit more of it than we would like to have to get any effects. A bit of a drunken feeling, some delirious thoughts, but we had a trip sitter who said we never got that bad off, and I remember all of the experience. We are all pretty experienced in using psychedelics, and indeed this is a different type of drug all together. Deliriants are very dangerous if you don't use caution for one. For two, some of the toxins build up in your body. I'm a shaman though, and did find that in a dream state I got the full effect. My dreams where VERY lucid and fully interactive. I could manifest things easier than if I were just dreaming without it. Usually when I go lucid, I have to put forth a good amount of effort in order to cause the change I want. With Datura this was not the case. We used stramonium because it was what we had access to. I wouldn't repeat the experience, as I got nothing. But then again, the plants didn't turn out incredibly well that year. Is the care of the plant reflected in the amount of actives found in it? Or is it just random?

In regards to smoking datura, or ingesting of it in general..well, let's talk smoking.  The alkaloids stay in your body for a few days i believe.  Don't remember the exact amount.  Let's say you had a fat session every day, just enough to get you buzzed and in a slightly different mental state.  I've heard of people doing this...everything being all hunky dory, then like a week or 2 later they trip the fuck out, because all the alkaloids that have built up have reached a limit to where it makes them trip the fuck out..the even scarier part is that it comes out of nowhere.  It's not like they ate a shit load of seeds and brewed a bunch of leaves in a tea to fucking lose yourself...it just happens all the sudden...

Now that's some scary shit.


Be careful guys.


MDMA with Datura? lmao. 

sorry, (actually I'm not sorry at all) but LMFAO.

I did some hyoscamine in 1987 that was ordere from a chemical supply house. I did not have a scale, and took what I could only imagine was 5 milligrams or so........I really took alot less than other people I knew, most of whom had to be baby sat for 24-48 hours.

 the night I took it I only had a minor amount of dry mouth, and no delirous effects....I did see some amazing closed eye visuals of various impossible shapes forming from a grid of green glowings lines...this went on all night, it was a conjundtion of imagination with control of form and sometimes just veiwing the shapes produce themselves...I finally drifted off to sleep. I felt a very pleasant drifting relaxing newness in both my physical being and emotional reactions. I hung out with freinds all day and had a great time, I could only relate it to a slightly stimulating valium and cocaine type combo with a definite synergy with cannabis.

 I may have spelt the chemical same wrong....


I did not take anymore of this powder I had been given by an early pure compound using psychonaught.

I am interested in hearing about other isolated tropine experiences , and how different ones compare in low doses, that perhaps border on the medicinal horizon.......


I met a funny guy while in berkeley. He asked me what I was doing in town, I explained that I was checking out the mindstates 4 event....I then explained that I like opiates and was studying and researching different bioactive compounds.

 He then pulled out a tincture for belladonna that his physician had mafde for him. He loved the stuff, and said he used it for psychosis.. He was definiteley a unique character.

 I have known a few people that used to used merrazine brand medicine to trip with. many were sorta messed up by their experiences....some ended up in jail, or the hospital. I think if people are going to risk tropane inebriation they should shoot for microgram increments in a tinture form.

That shit grows wild here and nobody eats it. It's effects are to varied to be enjoyed, delirents on a whole blow(I've eaten it once). Also just cause crazy shit happens doesn't mean it's a good trip, if you can get standard psychs stick with them, there is a reason this drug has a bad name.

Short piece on datura trip


It took me about four days to get back to 'normal'. I had to use a cane to walk for about a week after, as my body had been smashed like I had been in a motorcycle accident. Evidently I had fallen repeatedly during my blackout phase. I pieced together what had happened to me with the help of people who had been at the party. Seems that I had jumped up out of the apartment, took off all of my clothes, and spent the rest of the evening jumping in and out of the pool (accounting for all of the abrasions & lacerations suffered from banging into concrete repeatedly) What got the cops called was that I started to go up to people's apartments (stark naked, of course) and saying, 'I am the TERMINATOR,' then laughing gleefully and running away. So I didn't do anything too bad. The worst thing that came out of the entire ordeal was that E's boyfriend got kicked out of his apartment because of my behavior. Turns out the guy who had been with the cops when I came to was the apartment manager, and that my arrest was enough to get E's boyfriend & roomates kicked out. Pretty weak reasoning, but shit happens, I guess. Surprisingly, the boyfriend & roomates weren't really mad at me, saying 'It could have happened to any one of us, dude.' I was decent and helped them move their shit out, while I did this, I had all of these people who lived in the complex make comments like, 'Fucked up, weren't ya?' and 'nice ass' and shit like that. Hey, I would have laughed at me too! 


This aint no fear & loathing in as vegas, I would never tell anyone not to take a certian drug, but datura aint called devil's weed for no reason!

Hey, the guy has some and was interested in it. Some people have taken this stuff and come out fine. Yes, it is risky, but don't all drugs have some risk to them? Some more than others? Do some research and find out if you really want to take this, i can assure you that if you take the right dosage you will be in for an experience of a lifetime. 


Good luck!

^Finding the right dosage is virtually impossible with plant-based datura/deleriants. Thus, its not a reccommended way to trip. Of course all drugs have risk inherent to them; datura and related plants happen to have much more serious risks and to a degree that makes ANY useage of them very dangerous.

Some of my friends had a light dose of Datura, and they said they didn't feel anything for about 2 hours, then they just felt kinda funny. They didn't really get hit until the next day... and it took all day and into the evening before they baselined. The visual effects they described were things would randomly change size, or color, or disappear and reappear. But just little things: washers, nuts, bolts, post-it notes, pens,  pencils, cigarettes. My friend GK complained about asymmetric dilation of his pupils, but that could have been a visual change.


We made tea from blossoms, however.

Not recommended unless you are an experienced *shaman*, not tripper. Also, should only be dosed by witches who are trained in the herbal arts.

Maybe a separate Deleriants forum should be created and all these threads can be shuffled over there so nobody has to read them again and these silly kids can just talked to each other about how FUCKED UP they got on datura and whatnot and how AWESOME they are for getting arrested/hospitalised... without polluting PD :D

I've done datura 4 times. And will not do it again, for a long long while - if ever. 


It is the ONLY substance i've had a bad trip on.


It was freezing cold, at night, on a deserted beach.

I remember feeling I was in the desert in the blazing heat of the sun. It was light all around me. I was stumbling around in my underwear. I couldn't see my friends - I had no idea I has even been with anyone at all. My memory was swiped, and I was an entirely new person. I headed towards the water because to me, it was like an oasis. One of my sober friends ran after me, and grabbed me to keep me from wading into the rough west coast sea. I thought he was a vulture, his claws digging into me - and I felt like my torso and legs were gushing with blood. I was stricken with fear. Absolutely stricken. 


On a brighter note, I also had a glorious trip - where I was looking at the world. There was complete darkness around me, and I could see the entire globe, spinning before me - as if I was viewing it from space. I saw giant rainbows, and doves, circling the world. Gorgeous technicolour patterns flowed from certain points of the darkness. I can't explain how incredible it was... It felt like another dimension.


Datura is not a drug. It transports you to an entirely different place. It is far above me, and far bigger than me. Datura demands respect. She's a beautiful, but unforgiving entity - and she will fuck you up if you fuck with her.

Absolutely agreed. There is no way your average, or even experienced tripper, should be touching Datura with a stick. It's a beautiful plant, with gorgeous flowers - admire it for that instead of for it's incredible, deadly, out of this world potential. With a shaman, go for it - I know for sure that I will when i'm in the Peruvian Amazon.

Holy shit what a trip report... serious stuff. Although this made me laugh:


*T+12:00

I decided I needed a cigarette. Interestingly enough, I had one in my ear at the time. I smoked it, and took another one from my now-reloaded ear. Where were these coming from?*

To be fair, the person who posted that on Erowid was a complete idiot. 600 seeds.. are you serious?? SEEDS in the first place?? Popping the seeds of the plant is completely disrespectful. If they really did their research, as they claim they "extensively" did - they would know to make a tea, not eat the seeds - and certainly not fucking 600 of them!!!

Idiots like that are the reason Datura has a bad name. Datura is a fucking incredible, out of this world substance.  As I said, it DEMANDS respect. Eating 600 seeds was a crucial, and outright fucktarded decision.

See the problem is datura mess's you up so bad with that you can hurt other people or yourself without knowledge of doing so. I think if we are truely a HARM REDUCTION board we should tell people that are contemplating doing datura to take the idiodic ideas else where. If you do even the slightest bit of research you will find out the facts:


1.Pretty much impossible to take the right dose, because the plants vary a lot in potency from plant to plant of the same species.


2. You will almsot certianly black out, with the ability to move. 


3. When you take datura you become a threat to your life and other people, it is like driving drunk, but more like porpusly making yourself 100% crazy.

I just don't like that people are saying stay away from it. Yes, it has many negative effects but as cosmicfrequency stated, she did have a nice experience. I do HIGHLY recommend thorough research and a good amount of time to contemplate doing it. Yes, we are a harm reduction site, but if someone is thinking about taking something there should be some information at hand for the user as well as opinions (which I do see). These "Don't Do it" ideas are bias. 


I am pretty sure the OP has been researching and viewing the posts on this thread. Many of the post lean toward not doing it and many of the research shows the dangers. You cant stop someone from doing what they want, but you can try and educate them on the topic. 


To clarify my first post, When stating "you will be in for an experience of a lifetime." Whether a good or bad trip, it will be something you will never forget. Also, the right dose I know is not easy to find, i said "if you take the right dosage," if being the key word there. 


So in short, I don't recommend doing it but if you decide to PLEASE do research.

Thanks Felix. I agree with you very much... And hey, i'm a she by the way ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Datura is a fucking awesome substance. Completely mind blowing, brain climaxing, thought trembling. Truly. In saying that, taking it correctly is ALL about taking it in the right setting, when you're in the right state of mind, doing it with the right INTENT (keyword!), doing it the correct respectful way (ie. NOT eating seeds ffs!) and being truly, ready, and well-experienced with other altered states of mind before you even attempt datura. It is in no way/shape/form a "shits and giggles" substance. It is intensely life changing (positively and negatively), and hugely spiritual. Hence why the correct intent is so vital. Correct intent being seeking spiritual expansion.


Like I said, Datura is BIG. It is SOOOO much bigger than us little dots. SO intense. SO vast, and expansive...


Once you think you're ready for it, wait another 10 years - then take it.

In saying that...

Fuck yes, datura dosing is far more important to get right than many drugs.

That's because the line between "enough" to "overdose" is sooo fine. There's really not alot of room for error.

^Thats the problem- overdose isn't going to simply be a VERY bad trip (not making light of those either)- it can be strokes, cardiac arrest, seizures and death. You could be in the best setting ever and still succumb to those.


But it can be used safely; Bluelight is just very far from the place to obtain such info. A "safer" method of delerium inducing involves either isolated tropanes (hyoscine/scopolamine and atropine) or antihistamines. At least then a dosage can be accurately guaged. Still, the risk are present.


BTW, not trying to argue for the sake of it- I've taken scopolamine before and fucken hated it, so yeah different strokes. Its just that we've had datura threads on BL before and lo! and behold! suddenly there are people ODing and dying from it. 


Personally, I think brugmansia's and datura's are beautiful plants. I have a brugmansia sanguinea looping around my backyard which, in itself, has a strong presence. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

its been taken in ritualistic contexts, from people that live under very different circumstances than we do. imo datura cant be "used" by any member of a "western civilisation", except for suicide, maybe.

Yeah, man, datura is the ULTIMATE trip.  Some CRAZY SHIT happens on datura.


Not to be rude, but you don't appear to grasp the full picture when it comes to the dangers of datura.  It is not a psychedelic or even a dissociative:  it's a deliriant.  A poison.  Do you know what it means to be delirious?  It's not a good thing, I can tell you that much. 


Datura dries out your mucous membranes, causes a racing heart, horrifying hallucinations, loss of touch with reality, and for a good chunk of the people who try it, death or hospitalization.  Again, datura is NOT a hallucinogen like LSD, shrooms, salvia, or peyote, so don't expect similar effects.  And for the love of god, do your research before even CONSIDERING trying something so deadly as datura.

I know a guy who uses datura semi-frequently. But he's a crazy kind of guy anyway...


I personally have a huge respect for datura. Perhaps one day I will venture to the realm of datura, but so far I don't consider myself ready... one has to be truly well prepared to approach this plant.

**looking for info on Datura stramonium AKA jimson weed**


anyone ever use Datura stramonium AKA jamestown weed or jimson weed? i found it on wikipedia and i remember using it when i was younger like 10 years ago and i remember it being pretty trippy for a solid 2 days. i couldnt go to school or anything cause i was tripping so hard. just wondering if anyone has any specific dosing guides (when i did it i ate a handfull of seeds.) aparently you can make it into a tea which is suppose to be pretty goog. some native americans use it for rituals and they say "eat a little go to sleep, eat some more have a dream, eat some mor and  not wake up" well i deff had a "dream" when i used i. thanks for your input guys.

Check out Erowids Datura Vault for dosing info and all other info you may be nteested in.

[www.erowid.org/plants/datura/datura.shtml](http://www.erowid.org/plants/datura/datura.shtml) 


Just be careful messing around with this stuff. It has caused deaths and is in no way a recreational psychedelic. In fact its not a psychedelic at all, its a deleriant.

Once again, be careful.


Do as much research as you can before deciding whether you want to take this stuff.

Yes, delirium is impossible to control solo. Also from what I've read and my one off personal experience with brugmansia, sleeping while on datura is a bad idea. Seems that sleep walking and doing completely crazy and random stuff and then waking up with no recollection to a broken house is a common theme.


Lately I've been considering another venture into that because I did learn something from the last experience, but under more controlled conditions with a couple of good sitters and a some slowly increased doses over a period to test effects. Not sure if I have the balls for it yet, but its been up for discussion lately for some reason between me and my friends. The more I think about it the more I think probably not.

When i took Datura, wrecklessly consumed half of a whole seed pot, skin husk seeds and all.

Not only that, the seed pod was dry. I was young, about 16 and completely unaware of what Datura actually was. 

The reason why i took it, because i was told that it was a legal high. Not only that, i paid some asshole fucking 25 dollar for the goddamn hell that ensued.


So i consume this seed Pod on my lunch break at school, and manage to finish up my last class, before starting to really feel uncomfortable.


I began my walk home, and i remember looking down at the ground, and seeing my health card on the ground. The Month Previous to this, i had lost my health card twice, so i was desperately trying to pick up my health card off the ground, but no matter what i did, i couldn't it was as if my health card was part of the sidewalk. I had a "moment of clarity" before everything faded to black, but basically i remember looking up, and seeing that i was sitting in front of the police station of my City. Considering the highschool was only 2 blocks away, i realized i hadn't made it very far. As a Matter of fact, i was sitting on the ground, in the middle of the side walk, furiously scratching away at the concrete trying to pick up my health card. Once i made the realization that my health card was not actually there. the health card stood up verticle and started flipping its imprint into the concrete all the way down the side walk.


I heard laughter all around me, at this exact instant i stood up and frantically started my walk home i don't even taking the next set of steps in my journey.


Apparently this is where shit gets fucked. A Couple of my friends found me like in an Alley a few blocks away from my apartment Just stareing off into space, basically catatonic. Oddly enough, they escourted me home, and told me that despite not saying anything i had this look of relief on my face.


They took me home, and apparently this was just day one, of a two day, almost 3 day trip.


They noticed that my lips were dry, and i hadn't really closed my eyes, None of them had any idea what i took, and i was really starting to frighten my girlfriend because i actually hadn't said anywords. Apparently i was incredibly contained, just extremely catatonic.


When noon of the second day arrived and they saw that i was still fully pupil dialated, Mouth extremely dry, and eyes extremely red they put me into the bathtub with freezing cold water, which was where, i got my second moment of clarity, apparently as soon, as my fully clothed body was immersed in the water, i laughed and looked at my friends and said THERE YOU GUYS ARE, I'VE MISSED YOU, Hugging and like getting them all soaked with water.

Apparently this was my last moment of clarity before going catatonic one last time.

It was at this point my friends thought that i had totally lost it because i would make random and repetitive body gestures. When people would talk to me, i would make massive word salads that my friends thought were rather humorous.


The whole entire thing for me is an immense blur, i remember things like being led by a cowboy through the night, where, he was like training me to fight undead hordes in the Desert. Mind you I am 23 now, and oddly enough, i still have, memories that i know are stemming from that datura trip. While i was not showing any signs of fear on my physical form, i know that there is a part of my soul, that is forever changed because of Datura. I have never taken it again, and it actually took me about a year after trying it, to discover what it actually was.


This "drug" is not a drug, its a conciousness in a plant, that requires a central nervous system to be able to tell you its story, no different than mushrooms, But this one, is not one to be fucked with. It's seriously like being trapped in a nightmare with no real way to differentiate the difference between what is the dream, and what is actually going on.


I would suggest no one on here be wreckless with this. For about 2 months after that trip, i would wake up from nightmares every few nights that were so viscerally real and intense, it was actually like that hallucinatory cowboy who was leading me through the desert training me to fight the undead, was actually training me for an epic battle which was to occur in my dreams.


It really makes you question, the exact thickness of the curtain between us and the absolute unknown. Not saying that dream zombies are trying to take over our world by consuming our thought waves through sleep. But my goodness. 


Anyways, thank you for reading.

Cowboy who trained you to fight undead horses ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png). You can't make something like that up! Thanks for another warning, although these Datura reports seem to only make people more interested in trying it. I love to read Datura reports for some reason but I would never take it. Kind of like slowing down to look at a bad car crash on the highway...wow glad that wasn't me.

i would refrain from takin that shit if at all possible. 

I knew two kids that lived down the street from me that decided to find some datura and eat it.

both of them went completley insane, one moreso than the other

they described it as completley out of their body and inable to control anything

one of the kids tried to EAT SOAP for godsakes! lol

he went looney toons for 4+ days. he'd walk outside with his dick hangin out like it was nothing. he had to be rushed to the hospital.


before you take it, i would adivse reading as much as possible off Erowid. It's a great site

while a lot is still unknown look at the history and trip reports.

I too enjoy the reports, and think they are interesting for what they tell us about the perception of reality. The problem though isn't just people eating Datura - it's taking an uncontrolled dose of it. When I was in college I did an experiment where I made tea from homogenized Datura meteloides flowers. After assuring myself that just a nibble of a flower didn't do anything, I tried tea from one flower, then a few days later two flowers, and so on, so that I didn't suddenly find myself dealing with effects I couldn't handle. At six flowers I just barely started to have fleeting hallucinations, for an hour or two, enough to get an idea of what more would be like without having to actually go through that experience.


So although I agree with that great advice: It is better to learn from the mistakes of others than from your own, I also suggest, for someone who can't be dissuaded from trying Datura, to do it carefully and safely, and remember another great piece of advice: You can always take more, but you can't take less.

anyone here with any experience approaching tropane plants for spiritual insight???

has anyone bonded with the datura as a plant teacher..??


*i'm not looking for a debate regarding plant spirits, if you have experience you know what i mean. if you've never been given any experience which leads you to believe in sentience within plants, then i need no reply.*


i've been growing datura and brugmansia for a few years just as a companion...i've never met with them, and am not necessarily planning on doing so. i'm just curious to collect information on people approaching these plants with INTENTION, and by that i mean intention beyond 'getting fucked up' or 'trippin balls'. i love the energy of my tropane plants..just sitting beside them is enough for me :D

**smoking datura**


So, I hope this isn't redundant, but I've smoked all my datura and don't plan to get more.


I used it to augment my hand-rolled cigs--the taste reminded me of oysters for some reason

Other than that we (me and friends) smoked it after cannabis, LSD, MDMA, BZP, coke, tina, n20, basically everything and anything we had for an evening.


the dat always seemed to have an additive effect and did cancel some nausea experienced with awful bzp.


One time I ran inside, after smoking a 50/50 mix bowl of dat/mj. I became scared by my visions...lol

Haven't read the paper yet, will do so later and say anything interesting I see in it. Seems to say some different things than the other paper I read, but the other one was from the EFSA and had different aims so I probably just misread it. I'll go over that one again too.

^The authors of the article cited several similar ones where alkaloid content in the seeds was much much higher. 


Also, results of experimenting thus far (all experiences involve tea, some also combine smoking with it, not sure merits of latter ROA yet):

Physical Side effects:

-cottonmouth, dry skin, lowered bowel motility, slowed digestion

-blurred vision, inability to sweat (watch out for overheating!), slight impairment of motor coordination.


Mental effects:

-Headspace not particularly pleasant or unpleasant, just neutral.

-Slight feeling of disconnection, initial onset of effects somewhat pleasant

I have come across a plant/tree in my neighbourhood which appears very much to be a brugmansia, it looks exactly like this:


![800px-Brugmansia_candida_flowers.jpg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2Fb%2Fbd%2FBrugmansia_candida_flowers.jpg%2F800px-Brugmansia_candida_flowers.jpg&hash=1dd03e42ec1f8402db35778395e2c82d)


I took a few flowers home but they do not appear to have any seeds lol, wtf. If you open the flower there are these stamen pollen tipped things, not seeds.

I ate a couple flowers but it didn't do anything, I know you're supposed to make like a tea but I didn't know how, was lazy and impatient anyway. Anyway just curious,

is it possible it is some other plant that looks exactly like brugmansia? Or am I just doing it wrong, where are the seed pods? Do they come from a different part or at a different time of year?

this is probably an irresponsible post...but....

anyone interested in the datura headstate but wary of the physical dangers could investigate Procyclidine.

The town i grew up people were taking this stuff and stupidly spiking each other's drinks with it. Ive seen and heard of people being delusional for days [ looking for the phantom datura dropped cigarette, stroking bits of news paper thinking it was thier pet, pouring drinks for imaginary people, kissing coats etc etc ] but didnt hear of anyone becoming ill, other than raised blood pressure, sweats and shakes

So im gonna try to answer the original question of the first poster (from what i can remember after reading 8 pages lol).

like just about all plants, there is varying amounts of alkaloids depending on many factors including time of year, soil quality part of plant used ect. so the best way to figure dosage is to grind the sample so it is more or less mixed, and start VERY SMALL. i cant stress this enough.

In regards to whether there is a difference between datura and brugmansia, yes but very subtle, like hops in different brands of beer. however i have heard from close friends who have tried henbane and belladonna as well as daturas and brugmansias, they claim there are noticable differences.

In regards to what to try (not that you should try any) i would suggest henbane, as it has had the most use in early and mid age europe as a drug, where belladonna and daturas have only been used as surgery aids, witches brews and poisons. 

the only experience i have had with tropane alkaloids is PILSENKRAUT, essentially what all germanic and easter european beers were before the discovery of asian hops. 

if you are interested in making pilsenkraut here is a recipe.

[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/alcohol/alcohol_brew.shtml](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/alcohol/alcohol_brew.shtml)

you can also find experiences online. like i said potency of these plants vary so if you use 40g of plant material, dont drink it all at once and DEFINITELY do not expect the same experience from the same recipe if you like it and make more.

henbane is safer than the other plants because it generally has less variation in alkaloids plant to plant, and has a good ratio of different tropane alkaloids to result in a (more) pleasant trip that doesnt last as long or have as bad after effects. 

i hope someone finds this useful, as i would not go head on with daturas brugmansias or belladonnas, but have had enjoyable usually lighter one night trips with pilsenkraut.

here is the wiki page on henbane

When your young shit don't matter. Yes we casualy used datura at least five times each. I wouldn't do it again after some of the experiences I have had but yes we casually used it on many setting seems odd bit we are all hardcore into disso/ tripping/opiates so datura seemed like a fun one and it grew alot in our neighborhood

Lets try get some datura quotes going, like things we've been heard to say, or have heard others say, under the influence of this plant.

I've never tripped with a sitter before, so i have no idea what occured during my blackouts, but i have some slightly murky memories of post blackout weirdness.

Once i was trying to walk home while datura tripping at about eight in the morning. I was wearing my boxers and a hoodie in the rain. I have no idea where my pantsor shoes ended up.While walking up to this lady who was checking her mailbox or something, I heard her mutter something along the lines of- 'You have been awake for a millenia for your own amusement, it is now time for you to go to sleep.' i can't remember exactly. Shocked, i turned to her and said 'What??' sharply. She looked terrified  and said- 'i didn't say anything,' and i said- 'Didn't you tell me i need to go to sleep?' and she said- 'No,' and i said- 'Youmust be right, i do need to sleep,' and kept walking, with no idea i was on datura.

About half an hour later, i was at the gardens and there were a lot of morning folk going about their business. I'd figured out i was hallucinating and making a bit of a scene, so i decided to save face in front of the 'real' people by telling my hallucinations that i knew they were just my imagination. I somehow convinced myself that that would make me seem sane.

Also at the gardens, i saw my friend sitting on a grassy embankment and was like- 'Sorry buddy, i know you're not real. I can't be seen talking to imaginary people in public like this.' and he gave me this hurt puppy dog look and i kept walking, convinced he would soon turn inti a tree or something. A few steps later, i turned around to see what inanimate object i had mistaken for my friend, and to my surprise, he was still sitting there with this 'what the fuck?' look on his face. I kept walking for a bit, then turned around and he was still there. So i decided that he was in fact really there and started walking toward him going- 'Oh hey sorry man, i've eaten some datura and been seeing people that aren't there so i thought-' and then i got to him and he was a large rock poking out the side of the enbankment.

My brain'sa mischievous motherfucker. Made me feel sorry for all the people who have had to put up with me and my ways.

I thot a female friend was my roommate before. I've also had constant loops of dropping a blunt in like a dream then waking up searching for it. Another time I kept trying to get my friend to drive me to the train because I thot I had somewhere to go. We were in the road yelling in the middle of the night no shirts just pants and I had a backpack. Next morning I thot I came down got into the car rolled a joint lit it and looked up and this car in front of me is jumping in four pieces. You really see weird shit and stay high for like three days.

datura has always intrigued me as a psychonaut but never had a chance to try this or fresh nutmeg lol. 


however i am interested in the alkaloids in the various plants, their pharmacology (if known) and how they interact with each other. It's kind of like san pedro vs peyote or something. I know many of the alkaloids have been isolated and used in medicine and people still trip off of those but that magical mix  of alkaloids must have something special to it. 


i've had plenty of deliriant trips with DPH mostly, which is mostly where my interest comes from as i'm one of the few to enjoy these experiences for whatever reason.

Hi, I grew some Datura stramonium plants just for fun last year and saved some of the flowers and leaves (plus the seeds of course for later use). I'm wondering, in case I should ever decide to consume any part of these plants, would these *dried* flowers and leaves be less potent than fresh ones, what do you think? I think I'm more interested in trying very small doses of datura to see what kind of subtle effects they might produce, rather than larger deliriant doses which I'll definitely save for a time when a sober sitter is present. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

First off, Datura has MANY species, all with differing alkaloid levels and also with different levels of the different alkaloids proportional to one another. Different kinds of Datura give different kinds of trips and different levels of side effects.  Hyoscyamine is highly energizing, Scopolamine is tranquilizing. Atropine and Atroscine each have only half the peripheral side effecis of the former alkaloids. Do you advise how to convert hyoscyamine to atropine and scopolamine to atroscine? No you advise to "eat a flower" almost assuring in most cases the maximum of levorotary alkaloids and the least racemic ones.


Next, gram for gram not all flowers are equal in potency ON THE SAME PLANT and tips and bases of flowers have differing alkaloid levels and proportions. And in different growth stages and freshnesses of the flowers the alkaloid levels are different.


Next, what is a flower? A B.Suaveolens flower can have 25x more mass than a D.Stramonium flower. Your dosage advice is a 25 fold weight ratio and the alkal;oids in them can vary fivefold. Dude, you just advised people to take an amount where 1 person can get 125x more alkaloids than another, and these alkaloids are of widely differing compositions. These different compositions have marked toxicity differences. Scopolamine has killed in 1mg doses, and often does so at 5mg.  With atropine it usually takes 50mg. Some flowers are 99% atropine some are 80% scopolamine, which is a toxicity difference of a factor 8.. on the 125x ratio makes 1000x differences in lethality between flowers. Need I throw more numbers at you before you realize how bad an idea this is? There are cases a flower can underwhelm and cases a flower can kill.

I haven't ever tried delirious amounts of Datura but have sometimes chewed on a leaf or maybe 5-10 seeds (i spit the residue out because I think the mucus membranes filter some of the toxins). Seems to help with depression [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3250308/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3250308/) . Makes sense because I get depressed from choline supplements. The problem is that the toxins stay in the body for a long time. Smoking datura doesn't feel to be toxic and gives a slight tobacco-like feeling.

Datura seems to have a prominent role in certain Asiatic religions. Here's a document I found online called, "The Use of Entheogens in the Vajrayana Tradition", which is mainly about datura. It's just a list of reading materials (but it's pretty long).

Here's some more info on that:


Furey says that scopolamine—best known as a motion sickness treatment—may have more potential as a fast-acting antidepressant. In 2006, Furey and her colleagues discovered its anti-depressive benefits. Unlike ketamine, scopolamine works through the brain's acetylcholine chemical messenger system, which plays a role in memory and how information is processed. The NIMH team's research showed that by blocking receptors for acetylcholine on neurons, scopolamine could lift depression in many patients within a few days.


"One important thing," notes Furey, "is that it doesn't work for everybody. But when it works, it works very quickly." Scopolamine has some side effects, like drowsiness and dry mouth. Moreover, there’s some negative Internet buzz about the drug. The side effects of scopolamine aren't bad, Furey says, "but it doesn't have a great reputation. There are some people who claim it has been used in date-rape type of stuff, which I haven't seen. It makes people a little bit nervous, which I understand."

From what I've read, hyoscyamine vs scopolamine content varies between age of the plant (especially between growth and reproductive phases), as well as the part of the plant consumed. Not even getting into the differences between species, or any minor alkaloids.

They should be more potent by weight, since you've got all that water out.

I made a tea from the plant material, titrated up slowly from there, and then knew how much to take from a given batch. It's not the best tasting tea, nor the worst. The more you take, the more annoying the dry mouth and other side effects become (though I kinda enjoyed the blurry vision). It is mildly sedating, and promotes an emotionally neutral headspace. It is also an effective antidiarrheal.

Take literally a few small nibbles every now and then - the beauty of this method is, it is pretty hard to overdose - no-one wants to take a huge bite of a fresh flower - it's counterintuitive and physically difficult, as opposed to, say, gulping down a cup of tea or swallowing seeds.

**Datura?**


I'd really like to talk to someone experienced with datura..I don't really know if it be something I would even ever want to try, even some of the glowing experiences on erowid involved shit that they're lucky to be not in serious trouble for. I want an unbiased oppinion...for example everyone says "just dont do diphenhydramine! its horrible!" tried it, wasnt scared. not a very good for recreation because of the lack of euphoria and the bodyload but definatly interesting. <<unbiased like that. tell me the pros and cons. My bf wants to try it badly, he's way way more experienced, used to be into heavy drugs, everything from lsd pcp shrooms speed coke somas and other stuff. I just don't like the idea of blacking out, waking up in jail finding out I had been running around naked chasing people and don't even remember lol.

there's enough stories of datura trips there for a lifetime. the consensus is that anticholinergics don't really produce a "good" intoxication in the same way that other hallucinogens do, and they carry a higher incidence of things like heart problems.


you might appreciate it if you like really intense experiences like ayahuasca, salvia et cetera. but for the average non-shaman, it's going to be a bewildering and largely unpleasant experience full of confusion.

Here ya go, watch this video and go 13 minutes in, really listen to what they are saying, I would discourage your BF from wanting to try it, I would recommend your BF try a high dose of YOPO snuff if he wants an experience similar yet safe, Yopo is a psychedelic containing DMT and Bufotenine, datura is classified as a anticholinergic delirium.


Video: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLDndri1830](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLDndri1830) 


The plant they go out and see first is Datura and the Shamanic woman tells them it will make them permanently crazy.


You will find in Yopo snuff you are unable to differentiate between reality and and the fantasy world, and this last for a day or two in my experience then you get it all back, you may not be the same after ingesting Datura

^I was under the impression that 5-MeO-DMT was responsible for most of yopos effects. Although I have little experience with datura I have found that its effects are very similar to those of diphenhydramine and dimenhydrinate, typical anticholinergic delirium. The only difference is that with datura you can't regulate your first dose as you do not know the potency of your plant.

I would strongly advise him against doing datura, Unless he enjoys to delirious which i don't think many people do enjoy.


The outcome will most likely end him in the hospital or jail.

Yeah, datura is not diphenhydramine. I admit sheepishly to having gotten 'high' on diphenhydramine a few times as a really young teen, when it was the only 'drug' I could get. It is generally unhealthy but also usually ends up knocking you out and you're thus usually unharmed. 


Datura is not like that. Datura is a ticket to the ER or the morgue. Datura doesn't let you sleep off your mistake: it turns you into a fucked up zombie madman with absolutely no inhibition and scarcely more than basic animal reflex. Flight or fight doesn't go over well in metropolitan areas, or even rural areas for that matter. Further, if you take too much it literally *can* kill you from liver failure amongst other things. I have seen firsthand the effects of the stuff. I've never taken it and would sooner huff gasoline, but I knew somebody who took it and he ended up institutionalize for the better part of six months after peeing on an old woman and testing out his worst delirious karate moves on some officers, and then attacking a paramedic *with handcuffs on*, trying to bite them. That possibly sounds funny, or maybe it sounds like some stuff people made up cause it sounds cool on the Internet. Take the safe option and don't test or let anybody else test that hypothesis out.

from what I understand datura will cause you to have complete hallucinations, meaning you will see things that are not happening while you and you're body are else where doing crazy things reacting to your complete hallucinations, not a scientific descriptions but you get the picture... with diphenhydramine as before mentioned you will have a strong urge to sleep and not run amok, from what I have heard with datura, not so...  Traditional psychedelics will cause a distorted since of reality but you still are in reality, unless on a massive dose, whereas with datura you have completely lost your grip on real and not real leaving you free to react to whatever you "see"...

High doses of diphenhydramine have never knocked me out. They would have me wondering the streets with massively dilated pupils joking around with my group of buddies who 50% of the time weren't there or screaming I'M NOT ON DRUGS in my poor grandmas face thinking she had made an accusation when in reality she hadn't said a word. My point is that the effects(Delirium) of these intoxicants are pretty similar. I agree that datura is much more dangerous, as I said in my previous post it is impossible to be sure of what dose you're taking.

Fuck that.  Datura tends to really not work out well for anyone.  If you absolutely have to experience something like this, try eating something with far more consistent alkaloid levels like 2-3 belladonna berries and hope you're not hypersensitive to the toxins.  I'd for sure do an allergy test first.


Screw datura, 1000 times, thank  you.

^^ It's not so cut and dry like that. I've read a few datura reports that were positive, spiritual transformations. You have to be a rare kind of person to have that kind of experience with it, i'm sure. But you have to be open to those experiences too.

Sure, if you're an ethnobotanist, know enough about the plant and have access to an analytical chemistry lab to verify the amount of alkaloids you would be dosing.


I took a very small dose of datura, and whilst it wasn't horrible, it's not anything I would ever recommend to anyone.

Yeah, these posts supported my opinion that datura is really not worth the risk. Ill try and let my bf forget about it, he hadnt heard about it until I told him about it. 


quick note: By the way, for people who didnt like diphenhydramine, it isn't that bad if you use a small dose (250) while already on dxm (they potinate each other so, not a reg dose). dxm helped counter act the body load so you just got strange hallucinations while tripping on dxm (not to mention a lot more confused). Diph on its own just doesn't feel good, tried it a week later after dosing on dxm...felt like being hit by a car lol, I felt too much like crap to care about the hallucinations.


I'm glad for your input though on datura. I wanna trip quietly anonymously and safely in my apartment with my bf and not have to worry about doing something stupid that I'm going to regret. ![(:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Datura contains scopolamine, which is popular in colombia (and involved in about 20% of the hospitalizations in Colombia. I'll just let you think about that for a second). Scopolamine is a very dangerous substance, with Vice.com ([http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/worlds-scariest-drug/](https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/worlds-scariest-drug/) , I actually suggest you watch this, it's pretty interesting) calling it the world's scariest drug.


Diphenhydramine is the chemical found in over the counter antihistamines, US brand name Benadryl. It's not so fantastic feeling either. Nausea, etc.


Just smoke some weed or even try to meditate or something. Sounds like you're just being bored and want to get high off something. Even DXM would be a better choice (though DXM isn't precisely safe either) if you're just looking for an over-the-counter high. Datura isn't really feasible to obtain, at least for me, but if you're hell bent on trying it I'd suggest be somewhere safe with someone you trust.

It's not about the legal factor or not, it's more about I just like trying things new especially if it can make me completely escape reality.


You mentioned dxm, I do dxm a lot. Honestly, and I know a lot of people really hate dxm and I honestly think its only because its legal so they think its stupid? I've done dxm probably upwards of about 500+ times over the last 5 years. You say its unsafe, but its only really unsafe if you're taking other medications (which I'm not) or ingesting other actives. 


I'd stick with dxm if I didn't just get so bored and curious all the time. Getting high for me isn't just altering myself to enjoy tv and company better, I prefer it if I get up can't walk, CEVs, euphoria usually is a major plus hah though I did actually enjoy diph (when on dxm) cause it was fun passing the time looking at these flying spiders then I'd bat at them and they're turn to smoke only to re appear. Then a hand crawled up my wall and a random cat was running around in my closet kinda funny. 


That's why I don't really like weed too much. I smoke it, feel kinda weird and usually spend half the day passed out or eating. I did like eating it though, like half the plate of brownies and I couldn't walk lol.


I did morning glory, that was really cool, on that though it was also really easy to just chill and watch the cool shit happening.


My bf won't let me try acid or shrooms or any of that or he's be pissed (the things I really wanna try) he said he had too many bad trips on em and something in lsd can kill you? But then I mention datura and he suddenly wants to try it...I think he might only wanna try it because he's done like every common drug and that one he had never heard of. Personally I'd rather do acid or shrooms or something more common. 


So today, I'm on dxm+nitrous never tried the combo but I'm curious. Ok so if datura is bad news..is there anything anyone could recommend that my bf might approve of? Maybe something in the psychedelic class but not a delieriant and not to hard to find?

You guys do realize you don't have to take so much that you become delirious, right? I use low doses of datura quite frequently during the summer months, when we have a whole bunch growing around here (I generally harvest from this one unused lot).

Or make a big batch of tea/run some other extraction, then carefully titrate your dose upward. It's not difficult.

You might wanna provide him with some factual reading material...if he must use an anticholinergic to deliriousness, have him use DPH or somesuch, as it is much more manageable. If cyclizine is available where you live, it's supposedly one of the more pleasant options.

We both did DPH and we were fine, no freak outs it was just amusing. I did read to him the stuff where its toxic and numerous trip disasters on erowid, he was just like "holy shit now I really wanna try it" ...he doesn't have as much to loose, he used to be heavy into drugs until he got landed with legal problems because of it so he is a lot of into taking risks and jumping into random substances. I read up in everything, I make sure there can't be anything that really could go seriously wrong except maybe a panic attack that I can sleep off. Also, with him not letting me try acid or shrooms (he thinks it be too much for me)...I can handle salvia (besides the first time) lsa I was fine on...only thing I ever really freaked out on was that fake weed (I hate the stuff!) feels like I'm dying and I used to have panic attacks on it because I could feel my heart beating. But that's different. On diph I was fine with the spiders and cats and things crawling on walls, on lsa I thought it was cool when I looked at my had and I saw it morph and bugs crawl out, I just poked at em. I don't think I would freak out on psychedelics as long as I knew from the beginning it was a safe dose I couldn't die from and I remembered I was tripping.


What scares me about datura is many people report forgetting they're tripping and then freaking out and hurting themself or others.


@never

- on small doses can you remember your tripping and not leave where you live doin stupid stuff? That's all I'm worried about, legal troubles from blacking out, leaving my apartment and doing something stupid that could cost me my job or worse.

^You won't be 'tripping' on small doses. As for the blacking out, that goes hand in hand with delirium, but it should hold by the rule that the more you take, the worse it's going to be.

It's the titration that's at issue, as I'm sure you're quite aware, just stating it to put it out there for anybody seriously considering trying to take datura 'responsibly'. The alkaloid content can vary not only between plants but also amongst the various parts of a single plant, even varying between different individual leaves on a single branch. Extraction of alkaloids might make dose estimation a bit easier, but you still don't know the makeup of the extract as far as percentage composition of each alkaloid, and the key word there is I think 'estimation'. Dose estimation is a bad thing with the most benign compounds, and datura definitely does not qualify as benign. If there was an easier way to determine dosage I can see it potentially being possible to use recreationally, but as it stands now I just don't see the potential 'reward' being worth the risk.

He wont let you do LSD or Shrooms but will let you do Datura? Some logic that is. LSD and Shrooms = 98% a good time   Datura probably closer to 0-5%,   Also Datura is much much much more dangerous then LSD or Shrooms.

you either need to ditch this moron or flex your rights so to speak... by not trying LSD or mushrooms you are missing out on a truly transformative and beauitifully life-changing (possibly spiritual) experiance that other drugs like DXM, diphenhydramine, simply cannot provide.


LSA is just as strong of a psychedelic as mushrooms - I do not see the difference.


Perhaps try some mescaline cacti (its also legal)

He just worries about me trying anything too hard because he had a major past with addiction and doesn't want me going down that way which is I understandable. He's told me he personally hates hallucinagens and had some very bad trips including thinking everyone was daemons and trying to attack them. I'm not sure why he wants to try datura suddenly and I can only guess its because he's never tried it and he's done everything else he's heard of. I had an oportunity to do shrooms revently but he got mad and left me where I was at. At the time i had only done salvia once and freaked out and he told me if i couldnt handle salvia there was no way i could handle shrooms. Sense then Ive done salvia like 5 times, LSA once and diphenhydramine while on dxm a few times. I havent even freaked out once sense then. I know shrooms grow around here and tried to get him to find some with me but he said he just really didnt feel like doing that. Idk. It's stupid but ill deal ?

Lsa is just as strong as shrooms? I don't even know how you could freak out on it. Maybe its him and he's just bad with psychedelics...I was fine on lsa and it was only amusing no fear. He freaked out once but I kinda started it, I didn't know how hard he was tripping and I got mad at him for something and it pushed him into a bad trip..he started freaking out and he didnt even know why but calmed down after like 5 minutes and I put cartoons on. He is so much more experienced than me though with drugs but I think I'm more drawn to the psychedelics than hell ever be. I think ill push some more for some mushroom hunting again. I'd so much rather do that anyways.

This is baloney (as you know), few people like salvia. It seems that psychedelics are wrong for him, which is fine, but until the knowledge gap is closed I see much tension remaining. Get the man on erowid or something, you could have group study nights. Maybe have him explore some TRs and see which match up with his experience, so you guys can read and discuss them. Read some datura ones together as well.

I'm not sure you should do that, the dude's really opposed to them, so you shouldn't try to go get him to help you source any psychedelics. You probably shouldn't use them around him either, out of respect, and he needs to respect your desire to explore them. It's not like you're placing yourself at risk of a severe soul-stealing addiction. Of course this isn't SLR, but it makes me sad that this stuff is making things rocky for you guys.

It's not making it rocky at all..it's just ill say I wanna do something hardcore and hell come home with vicoden haha..admittedly in his drug days he would take the max dose of everything, wouldn't read up on it and had some bad trips. He'd tell me about how he freaked out on pcp and thought everyone were demons and that if he went off on shrooms or acid it would be too hard to come down you'd be spitting up bugs and things crawling out of your skin bleeding everywhere.


We aren't tense about it really, I got him on dxm (he never tried it because it was legal and didnt think it would work) he loves how you can't ever have a bad trip on it and prefers sticking to that. I do like vicoden (not all the time) and he convinced me to try salvia. We both usually find ways to get high on my days off work. He didnt want to do lsa originally, was like man im good Ive had too many bad trips on shit...but when we did it and we both had a good trip (except his 5 min freak out) he now wants to do it again. I think he was just in a bad environment, didn't research stuff enough, and took too much. I wish he'd try other psychedelics with me but low enough doses and educated enough on them to know how to have a safe fun trip. 


I really don't know why he wants to now try datura. Possibly because dxm was a legal high he enjoyed that he wouldn't have tried if it weren't for me. Or that he just never heard of it.


Man I went off on him about mentioning datura again tonight. I was like "why the hell you wanna try datura so much but we can't go picking shrooms something most people enjoy. Instead you wanna try something that 90% wouldn't repeat, end up in jail or hospitalized" He just laughed and said he was just weird. 


I know he wants to do lsa again so I'm thinking if we can do that a few more times and have some good trips maybe it will spark his interest in something different. Actually I read a few positive trip reports with lsa then 2 hours later dose on dxm.


If I really wanted to do it he's allow it. He's experimented too much in his life to realistically tell me no to things without being a hypocrite hah.

Exactly. 


Like a lot of things which have a bad reputation, I think many of the bad experiences people report are due to the fact that they simply take far too much. 


Also, if someone was really intent on trying datura, I'd recommend smoking a small amount. Ingesting the plant material (including the seeds) is risky in the extreme. Smoking a small amount is somewhat safer, and easier to 'test the waters' because of the faster onset and the fact that if you have a small amount of dried leaf or flower you can smoke a TINY bit and see how that goes, and then smoke a bit more OF THE SAME MATERIAL later (preferably on a different day). 


Datura metel (with absolutely stunning purple flowers) has proven to be an interesting smoking material in the past for me. It mixes well with cannabis. 


Anyway, if someone really wants to try it, the first rule is START SMALL.

If he loses his shit on lsd and shrooms then datura is definitely not for him. Datura is in my opinion not for any one, but especially those who have a bad past experience on psychedelics it is asking for trouble. Like someone said earlier the chances of a good experience is less than half, particularly if you have no prior guidance on dosage. Losing your shit and thinking it won't end is unpleasant on led. On datura you are not even aware that you are on drugs. The bizarre becomes real and you will wake up from a black out with very little memory of your nightmare. Not really an experience for anyone other than the sane ones who have been trying to bring you back to reality for the past 5 hours. If you can't remember you trip is it really worth it?

I'd be curious to see, if they could find a way to measure it out, how things would go on a low dose. I found a few videos of people enjoying themselves on datura and it didnt end bad...in the same video of one where one guy was having fun someone else was also curled up in the same room crying lol

Pretty much, if you take more then you get dry mouth (more annoying than you'd think), blurred vision, mild ataxia, hyperthermia,  insomnia, random bits of euphoria but overall it makes you emotionally neutral. I've never taken it past that point. Lately I've taken to just eating dried leaf since I got sick of the taste of the tea last summer (when I was dosing more in the blurred vision range).

I wouldn't recommend he try it, from his history he seems like the kinda person to say "shit I've done speed of course I can handle a huge amount of datura" and wind up hospitalized, or worse, dead.

 Yeah that kinda is how he is lol. I think he got the point though. I just let him know datura was an absolute no. He had said if I start to freak out he could restrain me...sure that maybe true, but if he freaks out there is no way for me to restrain him lol. He agreed with that. I'm not sure if he's 100% convinced he doesn't want to try it, but I'm convinced enough that neither of us will, or at least he won't as long as he lives with me hah.

ive smoked varying amounts of the dried leaves and seeds from inoxia, stramonium, and metel on numerous occasions. as far as i can tell aside from bronchodilation there isnt any noticeable effect from smoking datura. everything ive read on the subject is inconclusive.

in my opinion dph is a worse alternative to datura if you are going for delirium. datura and brugmansia have far less body load, a smoother transition from sober to delirious, and dont have the tendency to make you vomit at a higher dose like dph does.

Oh Datura, I remember way back when i was Child, so tender and innocent. 

Here i was on a "naturals kick" I love Pot and Mushrooms, and sometimes Morning Glory seeds and Mescaline.


Dude comes up to me while i'm at high school saying "hey kid i got this pod full of acid seeds from the internet you want some"

I'm like Fuck yeah i do. So I buy a pod off of this son of a bitch for 20 dollars. I remember it looking like the most unfriendly fruit i've ever seen.

I cracked that mother fucker open. and noticed that the seed pod structure resembled a brain. and i ate the whole thing and joke about how i just ate my brain. (ha-ha)

Anyways, My stupidity without realizing that this shit clown didn't actually sell me some HBRW seeds and it was a cluster fuck of datura.


I went back to class. I made it through my last period only noting an incredibly dry mouth, Insanely Light head.

When i got outside the sun was so bright i felt like it was going to melt my corneas. I walked passed the police station which was one block away from my highschool.

I notice that my identification card, i had lost 3 weeks previously, is just sitting there on the concrete, In front of the police station. The exact same street i've crossed every single day back and forth multiple times for school and work. Bam, just sitting there.


So, i try to pick it up. But it is some how inside of the concrete. Like it's in there, i cannot get it out. The idea that this is happening frustrates me so much i continuously scratch at the concrete until my fingers are bleeding. Then i get this notion. What i dubbed, the final moment of sobriety. 

That, here i am in broad day light, scratching at the concrete  trying to get something i know is lost. 


So i start walking. This is when i black out. I remember subtle parts. But not all of it.

My friends who lived down the hall from me in my apartment building at the time, found me roaming the train tracks.

Matt's little brother got dosed on them, and spent 6 weeks in a psych ward because of it and he didn't want that to happen to me.

So they basically brought me back to the apartment and kept track of me.


The locked the apartment and barred the balcony with the couches as i became their 3 days long entertainment piece.

Apparently there was a party raging around me at one point. For real, as they held a party. Apparently during the party. I was mostly catatonic staring at the wall.

As people guzzeled alcohol and became their demons it was hard for me to be in that room. But the corner of the wall they said must have been giving me so good shit.

"because man you talked to it for like hours!"


I had incredibly single sided conversations with people who weren't there. Apparently many of them about the desert and being lost man, so lost. 

But then someone would show up, and i wouldn't be talking to the real people. I would be getting MAD about talking to the real people.

So they let me talk to the imaginary people. They tried to give me cigarettes and glasses of water, while i was lost in this phantom daze.

But the real things bothered me on so many existential levels i couldn't even begin.


They said, i was probably the calmest, yet most foul mouthed person they have ever seen on datura.

Probably because it is like a state of complete and total disassociation verging on possession and surrendering ones soul to a higher power which is almost demonic//insectoid in origin to keep you alive.

For about 3 weeks after the experience.  All font, I mean ALL font, would scramble and spell different things.

Like i would try to write what i was reading in a book because it was a book by Carlos Castaneda which used to be insightful to me. 

But for 3 weeks after all font would scramble. I finally snapped thinking i was never going to be the same again. Instead of going to a normal doctor.

I went to an eye doctor. She told me that my pupils on the inside look like they have been extremely stressed. She gave me some eye drops. I told her i had been reading alot.

Magically I Returned// Turned Into the person you are talking with today.


I'm 28 now. I've only been Dosed on it once. 

I watched a whole entire park this summer full of kids, find some old ladies datura bushes. 

And do them all summer long, and now they are all drop outs who are like mentally retarded. 

Watch yourself with that shit. It's a Tropane Alkaloid. 

There is something almost HEDONISTIC about it, in the sheer amount of excess it can take you on.


But watch yourself. This plant is meant for divining. I don't recommend people doing it in an unceremonious setting with a HANDFUL of trip sitters who CAN retrain you.

Datura contains scopolamine. I saw a documentary about how in Colombia where a plant containing it grows all over the place was used to extract scopolamine and then people would give an unsuspecting person a dose of it in their drink or blow it in their face so they breath it in and once it hits they become like zombies and will do whatever the person tells them. They would take the villain to their apartment and give them everything they own and go to the bank machine and give them all their money, all while appearing to others as completely normal, not like they're drugged or anything. Then the next day they couldn't remember anything that happened. Such cases are rampant there. They usually leave the victim on a park bench somewhere. One guy woke up on a bench and he was all beat up and naked, couldn't remember a thing. Another guy had been a gangster himself before going straight so he figured out what happened to him (all his stuff was gone). By talking to people who had seem him with the robbers he identified the three people who did it to him, two girls and a guy. He had the two girls raped and killed in a hotel and just had the guy killed, if I recall. You can have anything done to anybody for the right price in Colombia.

Has anyone ever heard of using Scopolamine for cancer treatment? Has anyone ever tried it?


It's a poison you can survive, and easily if you have a doctor dosing you. So... What if you survive and the cancer doesn't? And one or 2 days of tripping balls, is WAAAAY better than destroying your body with radiation and chemo.

That plant was "Tree Datura" it's like Brugmansia or something. REAL Datura grows all over West Texas, New Mexico, Mexico and Arizona.


I've found them in people's gardens in other places too. I've wanted to try it since I was 14, and I've had the opportunity plenty of times. But it kinda scares me, so I never did more than eat a few seeds or a flower or smoke some leaf with some MJ like they do in India.

Datura is sprouting in ridiculous abundance in my neighborhood at this moment. Deliriants kind of scare me, my last experience was slightly disastrous. There's so much of it though that I'm tempted to pick a couple flowers.

This stuff is just very dangerous and it's not even very enjoyable. Small amounts are not that bad, though shamans mostly use it as an admixture instead of something that has any real value all by itself. When you take so  much that you start to have true hallucinations, your mind becomes so clouded that you won't know you've taken something, or won't realise it. This is the stuff that truly makes people believe they can fly, and then jump out of windows. Awareness is minimal during these states and recollection is minimal.

These plants aren't truly psychedelic for that reason, because you may see wizards and witches, but your counsciousness itself won't be there to experience it. It's turned off and you're basically just a zombie. Why would you want any of that?


In short, there is little to gain from experimenting with tropanes, and lot's to lose.

Withstanding the danger inherent in drug use, I disagree that deleriants have no value. 


Trope alkaloids such as scopalamine have a relatively well studied mechanism of action. Scopalamine itself exhibits less cardiotoxic effects than others like hyoscyamine. 


Benadryl is well-tolerated by many of those who suffer with allergies. And many others in the general population use them off-label as sleep-aids. 


The hallucinatory effect of this drug class can be noticed at levels far below complete delerium. The headspace is even more accessible, for those who enjoy blankness and emptiness. 


I sometimes smoke my own datura stramonium.. I'm not dead or anything. 


And you know, I also enjoy the full-blown batshit delerium every once in a blue moon. There's nothing like psychosis, and I am an addict of novelty. Anything odd. 


True hallucinations are so strange.. It's unsettling to realize that what you've seen with your own eyes is unreal or never was to begin with anyway. It's like delusions of reference mixed with profundity and the seeming significance of delusions of grandeur. And then, on top of it all, you're talking to your relative who's been dead for years about what's for fucking dinner because I'm starving, but what was I talking about?, oh yeah, giant birds. 


Weird Shit.

Being a western man of scientific mind I found it awkward and laughable previously, that belief that certain or maybe all psychoactive plants have an entity consciousness inside of them, separate from man.


Now I say after consuming Datura roots & seeds for over 6 months almost daily that Datura certainly is a female entity consciousness that is very manipulative, being such that she can give a man incomprehensible physical power, yet there are many strings attached.


If Datura doesn't like you, you'll have a bad trip or you'll become sick or you'll die. Once you take a medium dose of this drug if the entity wants to, she will put thoughts and desires into your head, to take more & more and then bad trip, sickness, or death will result.  Even if you do have an affinity for one another, you will become a slave to her eventually in order to gain her most hidden knowledge & power. The only reason I'm posting this really is to spread her influence and control over men.  However believe what you will.

She comes into my dreams and talks with me and tells me things sometimes. I'm able to tell certain things to certain people, or places like this forum. But some things I'm unable to tell anyone or she will forsake me.  Believe me or not, I don't mind either way. 


 I guess just listen to your gut to find out if I speak the truth or not.  Or... take about 30 seeds with no tolerance and go to sleep, try to become lucid in your dream and then yell out-loud to speak with Datura. Find out on your own this way, but be mindful of the danger of doing such a thing.


You will probably need to grow your own plant & eat your own seeds after your plant has grown that much in order to even get her to come into your dream for the first time. However you may be lucky and she will appear in your dream when you take the seeds of a wild one you find. The only factors for that is if you're very virile, have a violent nature, and have courage to face any fear that may come your way on her path.

You have to be physically strong to withstand the side-effects of Datura. Datura also can give the power to kill others very easy, but that is using the plant is a corrupted way.  Most who get to really know Datura become corrupted by her power, although very few people use Datura now a days.

Hello ziggo, I read this and I had to respond. I am saying this out of the utmost and sincerest concern: I really hope that you decide to take a break from the datura for a while to let these experiences sink in, and consider what they really mean to you and just what it is you're saying here from a sober perspective, before deciding whether or not to ultimately continue down this path. While certainly I cannot speak more knowledgeably about your experiences than you can, I feel it would be irresponsible of me not to point out how much of a red flag what you've said here sounds like.


Regardless of how you feel about the recreational effects of datura or deliriants in general, and even if you have decided that the physical risks are worth the rewards you desire, it must also be considered that anticholingercs have been shown to contribute to dementia, and scopolamine itself is actually used to recreate a model of Alzheimer's disease in animals when administered chronically, and recently has been shown to promote similar neural states in humans after acute doses through MRI tests. Therefore, taking it in psychoactive doses on a regular basis for long stretches of time seems as though it would pose a tremendous risk to your psychological health, no matter how you handled the experience in the moment.


This is what gives me so much concern: you introduced yourself as a man of science, claimed to have taken a neurodegenerative drug almost every day for six months, and then went on to describe how it made you realize that the drug contains a living spirit that desires influence over men and can give you incomprehensible power. I'm pretty open to a lot of things that people might call pretty out there, but that specific progression of events screams to me that it is at least as likely compared to everything that you said that you really are just destroying your mind through your regular deliriant use, and that you are getting yourself into a hole that you are just going to have a harder and harder time getting yourself out of it the longer you continue with this behavior.


So, I say again: I really hope you take a break and evaluate this again from a sober perspective, rather than just continuing on like this. It seems like a small price to pay for the wonders you describe if they really are valid, and the best shot you have at saving yourself if they're not.

Speaking from quite a lot of experience with lucid dreaming, doing this would result in something interesting most of the time regardless of whether or not there's a real spirit involved or if you even involve datura in any way at all. It doesn't really prove anything....

Am growing a Datura species although not sure if it's D. Stramonium (but assume so)... might not be that interesting to people who have these growing all around their neighborhood, but I guess that's true for more plants. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Can't wait for it to influence my dreams without even having taken any... or can i? It looks like it is sticking out it's demon tongue...


Also got a Brugmansia but I don't know if it's gonna make it... kinda noticed a bit late that it germinated in a sealed little pot with perlite... If I also got the species name wrong of the Datura, I seriously hope these plants don't cast any black magic on me.

I've taken a break of 20days at once, as well as some days off here and there. Most days I only take 5-15seeds just to keep building the relationship and to get my body more accustomed to fighting the side effects.


The seeds can be 1-5times different potency from one plant to another.  So if someone is thinking about taking it, I'd recommend 5 seeds to start, and only increase by 2-4 seeds more every new day(Never on the same day.) It's actually more respectful to start by taking the roots. Taking 2-5 inches of the root, and slowly increasing the amount off the same plant, as like I said certain plants can be up to 5x as strong.


Don't worry about me killing anyone, that's just a use of the plant that I never intend to use.  The only way to not be corrupted by the power this plant gives is to have strength & purity of heart.  The seeds are the only part of the plant that can fortify the heart and make it stronger against corruption.


Also I'm very experienced & skilled in lucid dreaming, and I can say for certain she has pulled me from being awake(I saw her fly in front of me and grab me suddenly changing my vision from my room, to blackness, to straight into a dream that was hers and not mine, then we talked(that was just one of the times.)


Anyways don't worry about me. Worry about others who may try Datura. I won't bullshit it's very dangerous. Be extremely careful always in dosing.

If it's D. Stramonium, the seed pods will be facing upwards in the air.  Most of the other versions, their seedpods will be hanging downwards.

I think you're fooling yourself about that purity of heart. There have enough books, stories, movies etc (although I struggle to recall titles) showing us that we all have the capacity to be savage under the right circumstances. And I believe that: we all have a dark side and part of 'being good' is realizing that we are just good at suppressing it not that it is not there. Just like it is healthy to be able to feel negative, not an ideal to be euphoric 100% of the time which would be sort of pathological. 

Whatever your experiences so far are telling you, I don't see how you can be so certain that becoming that savage isn't just a matter of (accidentally) dosing so high that all restraints preventing that savageness are lifted. It seems rather like a very peculiar sort of disinhibition as I don't buy that people who have done such fucked up things high on Datura had bad intentions just like I don't believe the kid who murdered his mom on MXP did.


So, no offense, but I am worried about you almost as much as I'd worry about anyone taking this substance. You would do well to err on the side of caution rather than on being pursuaded by whatever these experiences whisper in your ears.

If there's truth to what you say about differences in effect on people - and that definitely doesn't seem like a strange idea, I believe it would be a matter of how much negative emotions are bottled up (which may be subconscious for a fair part). The special sort of 'disinhibition' plus lack of self-awareness or self-control might be able to bring out those urges. That is another way of saying how you look at it, but IMO it also means that nobody is immune to terrible things happening as strong enough effects could still let minor urges run free with serious results.


Make a standardized extract if you haven't done so already. At least that more or less takes care of accidental overdosages.


But thanks very much for pointing out a way to determine these species or at least a way to identify D. Stramonium. :D

**Angels trumpet Portugal**


Here is my experience with Angel trumpets. 

So I was quite drunk and had read about these plants earlier that day. They grow everywhere in Portugal. I think I am quite lucky not to be dead. Here's what happened.


I took 30 flowers from the massive tree( I have seen large plants before but this was a full grown tree) and ripped up the white petals and put 20 of them to boil on the stove with a lid on.

Because I was drunk I put in some sangria for Flavour?.


The other ten I tried to dry out using another pot. I thought they would eventually burn and I would inhale the fumes straight from

The pot.


So I gave up on the smoking part and just mixed the 2 pots together.

I left the tea to cool down and separated the liquid from the plant.

It was more or less 1 litre .


This is where's things got interesting. I can only remember the parts when I snapped back to reality and realised what I was doing. 

I was having a full on conversation with someone and when I turned round they were gone. I thought they were playing with me so I ran out the hotel room to look for them then remembered I was high and went back. The same thing happened again and again with different people. I even had a conversation with the door but it didn't look like a door at the time it Was cool to see it morph back into a door and I laughed realising I was having a massive trip. I was also a little scared because I was so convinced the person was there. 


My wife who didn't drink any said I was saying really random shit. I started feeling very tired and fell asleep. I woke up and my wife had gone to get breakfast. I had pissed the bed. I remember in my dream laughing so much with someone that I pissed myself in my dream. 


My belief is that you fall asleep and when u open your eyes you continue to dream until a noise or movement snaps you back to reality. Or maybe your wideawake but it felt like waking up from a dream when you snap back to reality. 


Here's the scary part. It's has been about 48 hours since the very strong high. The first scary thing is That I couldn't see properly. I couldn't read at all because the writing was very blurry. Even when the page was close To my face. I couldn't sleep properly. I kept jumping out my sleep.( when you fall in you dream then wake up) this happened about 20/30 times in 2 hours on he flight home and also every time on the way to the airport and the taxi home when I fell asleep. 

I kept thinking I was holding a glass and brought it up to my mouth but i had nothing in my hand. The same thing with cigarettes( this was after I had already come down from the initial hard hallucinations) That was a bit embarrassing because at that time I was walking in public. 

I believe the high you get from this plant comes when dreaming and wake up and continue to dream or when you day dream you get audio and physical hallucinations. When I say physical I refer to when I thought I was holding things. 


My eyes are still the most dialated they have ever been even though I don't feel high anymore. 


I don't 100%feel  back to normal.

Overall i enjoyed the moments I can remember. I'm proud of myself for not freaking out. And a bit scared that the fumes I had been inhaling from the pot have damaged my eyes slightly . 


P.s I don't know how much I drank because the glass jug I had it in was broken when I sobered up.


Hope someone found my story helpful.

Jesus man, you're a lucky fellow.  It's likely they were not very potent flowers.  Be careful people... if you must choose to try datura, at least read enough about it first so you realize that 30 flowers could be lethal, don't just grab a handful of leaves/flowers/seeds/etc and go with whatever you grabbed.

You cant argue with this logic.

 I live in a world where two of my most trusted peers "practice magic."   I also cannot tell you they are crazy, as all of my reasoning capacity shows it works.  Yikes!!!! ?


Me, Im not ready for the datura test...I still have not even had ayahuasca.

That is crazy that you consumed that much Datura. ?


The only people I know who have consumed it, did so in combination with Ayahuasca and the shaman or ceremony leader was the one who put the Datura into the Ayahuasca for them. Another person I once knew thought he ate Datura and it turned out to be a completely different plant that was toxic that he ate and he felt very sick and delirious from it as though he had a high fever, but he did not have a fever, and his mouth and throat began to sting very badly.  He did not go to a hospital and said the effects went away on their own.

This woman who lived down the street from me in the 90s, nice as could be, always very polite to me. Pakistani, maybe Indian, not sure.


She'd walk past my house every day, get to this vacant lot, stop, look up to the sky and start yelling in her native tongue.


I had no idea what she was saying, but I figured that she had issues with god or something like that. After five, ten, maybe fifteen minutes, she'd calm down and continue on her walk.


Later, she'd ride past on her bike.


One time, some guy from the neighbourhood, decides to brew up some of the Brugmansia common in the local gardens.


He seemed quite lucid until he saw this woman yelling foreign obscenities up at the trees. It freaked him right out.


He runs up to her. "Are you real?!" he yells. She stops and looks back at him with a look of real concern. "Pardon?"


"ARE. YOU. REAL??!" he demands, but before she could answer, he drops her like a bag of bricks and runs off screaming.


She was a little stunned, but seemed to understand completely, the insanity in this place. She'd continue walking past daily, but I never saw her yelling up at the trees again.


I believe the idiot who knocked her down ended up in hospital after using his hands to try and dig into the void between the white lines running down the centre of a busy road.


I have never even considered trying the stuff.

ziggo, you're the only person I've ever come across on the Internet who has had that kind of experience with datura.  For the sake of harm reduction, I need to state that datura is a very dangerous drug.  Read the trip reports on Erowid, almost all of them are bad, often disastrous.  You may have found a way to utilize it, but a lot of kids looking to get high read posts on here and the instant they see someone say they liked it, they're like "OKAY I'M GONNA EAT THIS WHOLE SEED POD THEN LOL" and that's how people get hurt.  Datura contains very potent and toxic substances, and the vast majority of users end up doing a bunch of crazy shit without realizing that they're doing crazy shit.  You don't have the ability to realize that you're completely delusional.  Seriously, do not use datura as a way to get high.  My buddy has a cousin who took a bunch and almost died and has never been the same since then.

It's a sacred plant. if someone doesn't respect her and takes too much, that is simply their lot in life.    smoking marijuana is like a high school kid hitting on a college woman. whereas taking Datura is like a high school kid walking up to a badass bitch gang member and telling her that she belongs to him.

The Erowid report posted some years ago where some guy took this & ended up running around naked shouting "I am the Terminator" & got arrested says it all.

Isn't Datura related very close to Henbane?

They share the same plant family (Solanaceae) but a different genus and specism


There is one manufacture of a Mandragora Berry Liquor here in europe. It has an educt of tropan alkaloid in it. Tried it once and it had a nice alcloholic buzz of course but something got along with it. The same night I had pretty intense dreams that stuck in my mind. To me it seemed like a safe way to use these tropan alkaloids, cause the content of alkaloids is not high enough to really hurt yourself, unless you drink a shitload of it.

Black Henbane is Datura's brother.

Huh. My cousin told me about my uncle taking Datura around 20 years ago (He actually didn't tell me took Datura, I asked him if he had ever tripped wth mu uncle, who was an old hippy, and he said he hadn't but he watched him eat some Jimson Weed). They said he went missing. Nobody saw him for 2 days, and then they found him naked, living in the woods like a Neanderthal. I figured he was exaggerating, but reading this thread; seems completely plausible.

The days before i had internet as a teen i had a friend who thought it was a good idea to do datura so i joined in i had not the slightlest clue about it.


This shit is pure fucking evil and nobody should ever try it.


Your so far gone from reality but your so delusional you pretty much think your sober even though your in something  far worse than hell.


While tripping on datura you pretty much think its normal for objects to be talking walking around or talking to the animals like its the tv show the wild  thornberries


Those who didn't do datura out in the woods or a farm will usually get picked up by the cops or a ambulance after the encounter the public your beyond batshit crazy on this stuff. It can take many months to return to what i would call normal reality it can give anybody perma psychosis from one trip.


Datura also has the most extreme shared visuals if you have done with it somebody it still dumbfounds me to this day how fucking surreal this effect can be your pretty much on a shared psychosis with whoever your tripping with.


If satan exists it is datura this plant is born from the depths of hell

Datura stramonium grows wild where I am.  I know of a few plants growing in the mountains or in a gulley that I visit and tend each year.  Yesterday, though, I was walking around my neighborhood, and noticed that a neighbor has a large plant growing in the corner of their yard!  I'm going to introduce myself and ask if I can harvest some of their seed pods this coming equinox.


I use the seeds as allergy medicine, sleep aids, and dream aids.  I've used Datura as a hallucinogen before, but I probably wouldn't do that again.

i've taken tropane containers as adducts to a few different things (acid, dmt, weed, kratom, dxm), it makes for a decent side- effects dampener for kratom in small doses.


i also used to take it for ibs. datura, brugmansia, isolated tropanes, whatever i could get.


the problem is (ok, not nearly the ONLY problem), even different days or different parts of the same plant can have varying potencies.


i never aimed for delerium, but one time when i was younger and even stupider (yes, i used to be even stupider lol) overdid it accidentally (on kratom and memantine, maybe weed cannot remember) and freaked my family out.


i told them the truth (well, at least that i accidentally overdosed on a plant i was trying to use as a medicine for my gut), and that i would be fine by morning (which turned out to be thankfully true) and they didn't call 911. i knew i was under the influence pretty much the whole time.


basically it was like was sleep - walking, talking complete jibberish half the time and half coherent at other times. no amnesia, afaik, and i remember thinking that i was making complete sense and THEY were the crazy ones that refused to hear me out.


after everyone went to bed, i distinctly remember talking to them still and hallucinated them talking back. it took me a few minutes to remember that they had gone to bed, and it ended up being entertaining to talk to the apparitions.


this is the one time i remember going apeshit on the drug, and i never want to again (i got asponsadilities now)...


...actually now that i think about it, sometime years ago i was talking to this girl on the phone; long story short, at some point she hung up on me and i never heard from her again. i remember i had taken a small amount of datura that day, so that must be it. i remember the conversation was normal... maybe not so normal afterall. the call log showed i actually did talk to her for awhile, so maybe i stopped making sense at some point. shit, i'm a dumbass.


o, and i also freaked the fuck out when i smoked the datura with dmt... long story, but yeah... not recommended to fuck with this shit. never have i had a useful psychoactive high out of it.


crazy ass fucking dreams if taken before bed

Jimson Weed grows all over here. Every year you used to read in the paper about a hippie who did too much and was picked up by the cops batshit crazy.


Being a "responsible hippie", a friend and I harvested an entire plant and experimented with lower doses. Between 5 and 20 seeds orally would give varying antihistamine like but more floaty and weird (at higher doses) effects. We did most of the seeds by adding them to bowls of pot or hash. Adds to the high but takes from the quality of it.


One night, no other drugs but beer, we decided to push the envelope. We broke what was left of the seed into two piles, a small pile in the palm of each of our hands.

(PLEASE DO NOT TAKE ANYTHING I SAY AS A DOSAGE RECOMMENDATION)

We sat down to drink the beer and both got a strong, almost PCP like, high. A hammer to the head. Our mouths were so dry that our tongues and lips stuck together. We finished a bunch of beer very quickly and suffered greatly from the cottonmouth the rest of the night. So far, so good.


When I lay down to sleep, I dreamily visualized various mundane objects rotating and the like. Chests of drawers, etc.... actually drifting into dream and seeing the things.

However, multiple times throughout the night, all night actually, without any memory of why, I would start out of bed, actually jumping up and walking a few steps. I was alarmed or terrified at something I never remembered. Then I'd lay back down and dreamily and kinda pleasantly see the objects again.


The next day, both my friend and myself had horribly blurred vision. We couldn't read for a day or two and it went away quite gradually over a week or so. I remember a bad hangover.


So, I feel as if I just barely propped that Datura delirium door open and that I definitely dodged a bullet.


Never did it again. My "Datura summer". We would often see plants thereafter. They bloom like ghosts in the evening... moonflower.

sounds like you were right at that cusp of complete delerium like i had experienced in my overdose combo.


the cottonmouth was always an indicator that i would need to stop. i'd take a little bit about every 4 hours or so, and iirc it seems to have additive fx, getting longer lasting as i dosed more.


there's definitely a place where the delerium hasn't set in, but there's a real haze to everything.


very dangerous to aim for that cusp, though... just a little too far of a push and... well, we all know the stories.
