## Interactions

### ⛔ Dangerous
- **lithium**: There are a large number of reports indicating a high seizure and psychosis risk from this combination.

### ⚠️ Unsafe
- **tramadol**: Tramadol is well known to lower seizure threshold and psychedelics also cause occasional seizures.

### ⚡ Caution
- **amphetamines**: Stimulants increase anxiety levels and the risk of thought loops which can lead to negative experiences
- **cannabis**: Cannabis has an unexpectedly strong and somewhat unpredictable synergy with psychedelics.
- **cocaine**: Stimulants increase anxiety levels and the risk of thought loops which can lead to negative experiences
- **diphenhydramine**: At 25-50mg, DPH may assist with side effects of the DMT such as nausea and anxiety. At higher dosages, the combination of a deliriant (DPH) and DMT is cautioned against. DMT is likely to increase the deliriant and negative effects of DPH, in addition to increasing the risk of severe injury and mental trauma.
