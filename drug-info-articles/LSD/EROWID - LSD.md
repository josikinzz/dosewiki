DESCRIPTION #
 
[LSD Images](https://erowid.org/lsd_images.shtml)
 
LSD is one of the most commonly used 'psychedelic' or 'hallucinogenic' substances. It comes in a variety of forms, but is virtually always taken orally. Today, LSD is most commonly found in the form of small squares of paper called 'blotter' (full sheets of paper are decorated with [artwork or designs](https://erowid.org/lsd_images_gallery1.shtml) , perforated, then soaked in liquid LSD solution and dried). Other forms include pills, gelatin sheets or shapes (pyramids, cubes, etc), liquid, liquid sugar cubes, and powder. Blotter is most common because it is easily produced, easily concealable and the format allows for few adulterant chemicals. 
 
[ [Main LSD Vault](https://erowid.org/lsd.shtml) ]
 
[Dose](https://erowid.org/lsd_dose.shtml) #
 
A standard dose of LSD since the mid-1980s has been between 50 - 150 ug (micrograms). A single hit of most blotter paper contains somewhere in this range, though this varies depending on the source and there is no way for the average user to determine the strength of a piece of blotter other than by word of mouth. In the 1960s and 1970s, when LSD came primarily in pill form, the average single dosage unit was somewhat higher than it is with today's blotter, more often in the 200-400 ug range. A drop of liquid can contain a huge amount of LSD but is generally made so that one drop is a single medium dose.
 
Price #
 
Sold by the single hit of blotter, LSD sells for $3 to $10 per hit, though it sometimes ranges as high as $25 depending on where you purchase it. Captive markets such as raves generally produce high prices while friend to friend it is often sold at cheaper prices. Less common forms of LSD sell for somewhat higher prices ($8-10 for a single hit), and as with most substances, the price goes down if you buy in bulk. Sheets of 100 hits (blotter) generally range from $1-$2 per hit. One of the more novel things about the illicit LSD market is that within the LSD using community, it is somewhat common to give single doses away to friends and acquaintances at extremely cheap prices, if not free.
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/lsd_law.shtml) #
 
LSD is illegal in the United States (Schedule I) and in most other countries. It is also listed as Schedule I in the International Convention on Psychotropic Substances, an international drug control treaty.
 
[Chemistry](https://erowid.org/lsd_chemistry.shtml) #
 
d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a synthetic chemical derived from ergot alkaloids which are produced by the [ergot fungus](https://erowid.org/plants/ergot/ergot.shtml) which grows on rye.
 
Pharmacology #
 
Pharmacology Summary Needed.
 
Production #
 
LSD requires an experienced organic chemist to produce. All useful synthesis methods begin with Lysergic Acid which is schudule III. It is produced in crystal form, primarily by a small number of knowledgeable chemists in fully equipped laboratories. The DEA speculates that it is produced mainly in the United States and Canada.
 
[History](https://erowid.org/lsd_timeline.php) #
 
LSD was first synthesized in 1938 and discovered to be psychoactive in 1943. It became popular in the '60's and was made illegal to possess in 1968. It has been widely available on the black market since that time.
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
The Substance:
 
LSD (Lyserg-Saeure-Diethylamid in German); Acid; Cid; L; Blotter (on paper); Tabs (on paper); LAD; Doses; Trips; Microdots (small tablets).
 
The Experience:
 
Tripping; Flying; Frying.
 
[EFFECTS](https://erowid.org/lsd_effects.shtml) #
 
In the beginning stages of onset, LSD is likely to cause a sort of undefineably feeling similar to anticipation or anxiety. There is often a slight feeling of energy in the body, an extra twinkle to lights, or the feeling that things are somehow different than usual. As the effects become stronger, a wide variety of perceptual changes may occur; non-specific mental and physical stimulation, pupil dilation, closed and open eye patterning and visuals, changed thought patterns, feelings of insight, confusion, or paranoia, and quickly changing emotions (happiness, fear, giddiness, anxiety, anger, joy, irritation).
 
Onset #
 
Depending on how much and how recently one has eaten food, LSD generally takes 20 - 60 minutes (though sometimes as long as 2 hrs) to take effect.
 
Duration #
 
LSD's total duration is normally considered to be around 12 hours from time of oral ingestion to end of the primary effects. The strong peak/plateu effects last around 6-10 hours. The complete range of effects last between 8 and 48 hours, depending on dose, with doses under 40 micrograms lasting much shorter than doses over 500 micrograms (very heavy). Most people report the primary effects last until 6-10 hours after taking between 50 and 500ug and most feel unusual, with difficulty sleeping, until 10-18 hours after first ingestion or until they have had a full night's rest and a meal. It is unusual, but well documented in scientific and experiential literature, for a small number of people to trip for 16-24 hours after a single dose of LSD, usually if they have an unusually powerful experience or took a heavy dose.
 
Visual Effects #
 
Visuals Summary Needed.
 
PROBLEMS #
 
LSD can precipitate strong, temporary changes in an individual's experience of life and reality. Even in low doses, it is a powerful psychoactive that can be significantly affected by experiences, set and setting. Recent experiences, especially strong ones, can have a substantial effect on a trip. Physically or psychologically unsettling events in the days before an LSD trip can blossom into more serious distress and trauma while tripping. 
 
 It is important to be prepared for the possibility of encountering difficult or frightening mental states. There are many ways of minimizing possible dangers and trauma: by making sure to have others around for first time or high dose experiences, choosing carefully when and where to use a substance, taking a little time to prepare mentally for an experience with LSD by relaxing, having an intent for the experience, or by incorporating comforting and calming ritual into the preparation (clean the house, adjust the lighting, choose music that will go with the sort of experience you're looking for,etc) Using a 'sitter', a sober friend who's job it is to take responsibility for the surroundings can go a long way toward easing anxiety and ensuring that someone will be able to deal with any situation that might arise. It's amazing how confusing a ringing phone or a cop at the door can be to someone who is on LSD. The [Psychedelic Crisis FAQ](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/faqs/psychedelic_crisis_faq.shtml) provides some information about how to handle difficult situations.
 
Contraindications #
 
- Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. Individuals currently in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval in their everyday lives should be careful about choosing to use strong psychedelics as they can trigger even more difficulty. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because LSD is known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems. LSD can cause uterine contractions and could negatively impact a pregnancy.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
LSD is not physically addicting, and is quite unlikely to lead to psychological addiction in most people. Withdrawal effects following discontinuation have not been reported. As with most substances, a few people have reported becoming mentally habituated to LSD. There is a short period of tolerance after use. Using LSD two days in a row is likely to lead to a diminished experience the second day, though spaced 3 or more days apart, this effect is very small, and after 7 days, tolerance is nearly non-existent.

LSD
 
Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
DOSAGE DESCRIPTION #
 
Caution : Dose information should not be taken as recommendations. [ see below ]
 
**LSD Oral Dosages**
- Threshold: 10-20 ug
- Light: 20 - 75 ug
- Common: 50 - 150 ug
- Strong: 150 - 400 ug
- Heavy: 400 + ug
 
LSD comes in several different forms. The most common is paper blotter. Other forms include gell caps, liquid, and gelatin. Each form will contain different quantities and purities of lysergic acid diethylamide. The chart above shows dosages for pure LSD measured in micrograms (ug). Micrograms are 1/1,000,000 of a gram. 
 
 For information about LSD-related deaths, see [Erowid's LSD Fatalities / Deaths Page](https://erowid.org/lsd_death.shtml) .
 
NOTES #
 
Blotter
 The most common form of LSD is paper blotter divided into about 1/4" squares called tabs. A single tab usually contains between 30 - 100 ug of LSD. Paper blotters are created by taking a sheet of absorbant paper (usually decorated and perforated) and soaking it in a dilution of lysergic acid diethylamide. The dilution can vary greatly from one batch to another, or one chemist to another. Because of the method used to make blotter tabs, there is no practical way to know the exact dosage of a particular tab without either trying it or knowing the chemist. Adjacent tabs on a sheet will usually contain very similar levels of LSD. Because a blotter tab is so small, only extremely potent chemicals such as LSD can fit at active levels. See the [Strychnine myth](https://erowid.org/lsd_myth2.shtml) . 
 
 
[Caution: As of 2013, the potent [NBOMe compounds appear to be supplanting LSD](https://erowid.org/chemicals/nbome/nbome_article1.shtml) on a significant portion of acid-style blotter, sometimes misrepresented as LSD by dealers.
 
 
Liquid
 LSD is soluble in water and other solvents, though liquid LSD is usually dissolved in ethyl (drinking) alcohol or in water. Liquid LSD is used in the creation of blotter tabs. A single drop of potent liquid LSD could be 50 times a normal dose, although it is generally diluted to the point where a single drop is equal to approximately one dose. This varies greatly from batch to batch, and is sometimes a weak dose while othertimes a very strong dose. Liquid LSD is somewhat uncommon. Be extremely careful when dealing with it as there is no way for the average person to gauge its potency. It is frequently stored in small dropper bottles. Caution: when one reaches the end of the bottle, one should not rinse it out and assume that what remains is a small dose. There can still be **many** doses left along the inside surfaces and taking them all at once can lead to some unexpectedly strong and possibly very uncomfortable experiences. 
 
 
Gelatin
 Also known as "window panes". Gelatin LSD is made by mixing liquid LSD with gelatin and forming it into small, thin squares. The benefit of this method is that less of the LSD is exposed to sun and air which break down lysergic acid diethylamide. A single square of gelatin is commonly stronger than a single blotter tab of LSD. (Rough estimate 50 - 150 ug per square).
 
CAUTION & DISCLAIMER #
 
Every individual reacts differently to every chemical. 
 
 Erowid's dosage information is a summary of data gathered from users, research, and other resources. This information is intended to describe the range of dosages people report using. It should not be construed as a recommendation of any sort. Individuals can respond very differently to the same dosage. What is safe for one can be deadly for another.

NOTES #
 
The primary health concerns about LSD use are related to psychological health rather than risk of physical damage to the body or brain. As senior LSD researcher Dr. David Nichols, Distinguished Chair of Pharmacology at Purdue University and head of one of the world's top LSD research labs, stated in his 2004 review article on hallucinogens, "There is no evidence that any of the hallucinogens, even the very powerful semisynthetic LSD, causes damage to any human body organ. [...] Hallucinogens do not cause life-threatening changes in cardiovascular, renal, or hepatic function because they have little or no affinity for the biological receptors and targets that mediate vital vegetative functions." 1 Deaths resulting from the pharmacological effects of LSD are rare to non-existent. 
 
 However, like all psychoactive drugs, LSD can induce cognitive and emotional alterations that can greatly affect behavior. With psychedelics such as LSD, there can be powerful and unexpected changes in thinking and perception. While under the influence of these drugs, an individual can exhibit poor judgement and delusional behavior, leading to accidents or dangerous situations. In those individuals predisposed toward certain psychiatric conditions, hallucinogens may precipitate psychotic responses or depression. In some individuals, long-lasting anxiety and/or depression may result from the unpleasant experiences and frightening visions that occurred during the psychedelic experience. 
 
 Experienced users often caution new users of psychedelics about the dangers of inebriated behavior and a common fear while inebriated that the effects of the drug will be permanent. One bit of popular trip wisdom highlights some risks of LSD use: "Cars are real. Cliffs are real. Cops are real. You cannot fly. It's never a good time to die. And don't forget: you will eventually come down." Sober sitters or psychotherapeutic guides are often suggested as a means of substantially reducing the risk related to adverse mental and physical events that may be associated with LSD use. Individuals have also been encouraged to prepare themselves psychologically for the experience, by being ready to accept whatever emerges out of their psyche ("I love this, too... even the snarling spider about to eat me who looks like my mother."). 
 
 LSD is reported to have some beneficial effects on health, including improvements in mental health; increased connection to spirituality; insights into self and world; the treatment of cluster headaches; use in combating addiction to other drugs and behaviors; and reducing use of pain medications and anxiety levels in people facing terminal illnesses. Although small-scale clinical studies by legitimate scientific laboratories have suggested these claims may be worthy of further investigation, large-scale clinical studies have yet to be conducted to validate this pilot work.
 
DEATHS #
 
Less than a handful of deaths have been directly attributed in the medical literature to the pharmacological effects of LSD, and *none* of these have been unquestionably attributable to LSD's actions. Estimates of what could be a potentially lethal dose of LSD are higher than 10 mg orally, a dose that is more than 100 times the common, moderate dose of LSD (100 ug). The administration of this amount would require the ingestion of more than 200 units of street blotter, which typically contain about 50 ug of LSD (as of late 2010). 
 
 It is important to note that LSD has been associated with deaths as a result of inebriated behavior (falling from a height or fighting with police) or by suicide. There are also occasional deaths misattributed to LSD when another substance was actually taken. 2 
 
 See [LSD Deaths](https://erowid.org/lsd_death.shtml) for a discussion of documented LSD-related fatalities.
 
WARNINGS #
 
- Precipitation of Psychosis. LSD may have the ability to trigger psychotic symptoms in those predisposed to psychosis. This is problematic because psychotic or schizophrenic disorders most frequently manifest in those in their late teens or early twenties, the same age that use of LSD is most common. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because LSD is known to trigger latent psychological problems. "Fortunately, however, these drugs do not appear to produce illness de novo in otherwise emotionally healthy persons, but these problems seem to be precipitated in predisposed individuals." 1 This adverse event is apparently quite rare: as Dr. Nichols of Purdue University observed in 2004: "A search of Medline in early 2003 for case reports of LSD-induced psychosis found only three reports in the previous 20 years." 1
- Precipitation of Depression. Experts dispute whether LSD use has been solidly linked to depression resulting in intentional suicide. See [LSD Death: Suicide](https://erowid.org/lsd_death.shtml#suicide) . LSD use, even in the context of formal psychotherapy, has been reported to trigger short-term or lasting depressions in some people. 14 LSD psychotherapy researchers in the 1950s and 1960s regularly identified depression following an LSD experience in articles discussing its use. Betty Eisner and Sidney Cohen wrote: "We have observed that a transient depression sometimes follows an LSD-25 session. This may be due to several factors: (1) the inability to integrate all of the unacceptable traumatic material uncovered during the session; (2) the feeling that the necessary effort is too great to be undertaken; (3) "coming back to earth" after a transcendent experience. It is therefore important that some sympathetic person be with the patient during the evening following treatment. A more serious type of depression has been observed to occur when insights acquired under the drug are not translated into the life situation." 14 People prone to depression or suicidal thinking may be more likely to suffer this response following exposure to psychedelics.
- Dangerous Interaction: Lithium or tricyclic antidepressants. LSD can cause dangerous reactions when used by someone taking lithium or tricyclic antidepressants. Some people report having experienced seizures after ingesting these combinations. Individuals have typically reported an undesirable intensification of the hallucinogenic response that is not akin to "getting higher for free". Such people have reported being unable to communicate with their friends, becoming uncharacteristically violent or going into fugue states (ending up somewhere else without knowing how they got there). In addition, the interaction of lithium and LSD has been reported by some persons to result in seizures in those who do not have a history of this condition. 3 , 4
- Reduction of Response to LSD when taken with SSRI and possibly MAOI drugs. In persons regularly taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) a reduction or abolishment of response to LSD has been reported. This effect is not reversible by taking a higher dose of LSD or by going off the antidepressant for a day or two. It generally appears to take weeks or a month off of an SSRI or MAOI before the full psychedelic response returns. However, it is not advisable to stop taking an antidepressant that is effective just to have an LSD experience. 20 As opposed to the diminished effect resulting from chronic use, there have been some reports that the accute use of a MAOI in combination with LSD increases the psychoactive effects; this could be viewed as a sort of ayahuasca-like effect.
- HPPD. Hallucinogen Persisting Perceptual Disorder (HPPD) has been reported by individuals who have taken LSD. Although a large portion of LSD users report lasting visual effects, only a small percent of those report these effects as troubling. When lasting visual effects interfere with normal function, these are classified as HPPD, a disorder identified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-R). See the [HPPD Vault](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/health/hppd/) .
 
CAUTIONS #
 
- Dramatic Changes in Thinking. Changes to thought processes, while among the many reasons why people choose to use LSD, can also impair judgement. A sober sitter who assumes responsibility for the welfare of a person under the influence of LSD can reduce the chances of problems caused by impaired judgement. Some LSD-related deaths and injuries have been the result of dangerous behavior such as walking on a freeway, staring at the sun, stepping through a window, or fighting with police. [see [Behavioral Fatalities](https://erowid.org/lsd_death.shtml#behavioral) ]
- Hyperthermia/Overheating. While uncommon, a few cases have been reported in the medical literature of dangerous overheating following ingestion of LSD, including one non-fatal case that brought the patient's body temperature to over 106°F (41°C). 6
- Anxiety/Panic Reactions. LSD may precipitate awareness of and access to surreal, existential, disorienting, or abstract psychological material resulting in experiences that are difficult to process, horrifically frightening, disturbing, or simply unsettling. These experiences and "insights" may result in lasting confusion about the nature of reality and the solidity of the material world. Individuals in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval, due to personal history or stress in their everyday lives, are likely to be more prone to such reactions.
- PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that involves recurring unwanted thinking about trip visions, nightmares, and unease related to the LSD experience.
- Pregnancy. LSD and other closely related chemicals are known to cause uterine contractions, which may be problematic during a pregnancy. In the mid-20th century, there were many erroneous rumors about the possibility of chromosome damage resulting from the use of LSD during pregnancy. Further research has disproven this theory. 10 , 13
- Breastfeeding. LSD is likely to pass into breast milk although little data is available about how much or for how long. Recommendations range from waiting 24 to 120 hours after LSD use before resuming breastfeeding. 7
- No Potential for Physical Dependence (Addiction). LSD does not cause physical dependence (as determined by the development of a withdrawal syndrome upon drug discontinuation following long-term administration). It is also not likely to lead to psychological dependence in most people, although there are a few reports of individuals who have taken it daily for months. As with most substances, a few people have reported developing a bad relationship with LSD, where they continue to use the drug despite adverse consequences in their lives. Tolerance (a reduction in response after taking the same dose of a drug on a subsequent occasion) begins with a single dose of LSD, due to a reduction ("down-regulation") of serotonin 5HT2 receptors. This effect is increased following continued use of LSD the next day, but reverses over time. Thus, using LSD two days in a row is likely to lead to a diminished experience the second day, but this effect is less likely if LSD is taken with at least three days in between experiences.
 
BENEFITS #
 
- Positive Effect on Mood and Life. Most users of LSD report that it has had a positive effect on their life, from simple recreational fun to profound life-changing spiritual experiences. In a survey conducted by Erowid on our website with over 49,000 valid responses, 53.4% of respondents reported that LSD use had affected their lives positively and only 3.4% reported it had a negative effect on their lives. The balance was made up mostly of 21.9% who reported that LSD had "no effect" on their lives over the long term and 17.2% who reported a "mix of positive and negative effects". 15
- Insights into Self, Other, and World. Perhaps the most commonly reported benefits from LSD are changed perspective and substantive insights into one's life. 16
- Treatment of Cluster Headaches. User reports by people with a severe form of migraine-like headaches called cluster headaches include descriptions of nearly complete blocking of the painful experiences with the use of LSD, psilocybin, and related compounds. Research into this issue is ongoing. 8 , 17
- Use in Psychotherapy. 9
- Use in Addiction Treatment. LSD and other psychedelics have been investigated as an adjunct to psychotherapeutic treatment of addiction and alcoholism. Such research stalled in the late 1960s, when prohibition made studies with LSD much more difficult to conduct, and addiction treatment remains an unproven-yet-potential health benefit from LSD. 18 , 21
- Reducing End-of-Life Anxiety. LSD and other psychedelics (such as DPT and psilocybin) have been shown to reduce depression, anxiety, and medication needs in some people facing terminal illness. 19

LSD
 
Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**LSD**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Scheduled
- SCHEDULE: Schedule I
- CLASSIFICATION: Hallucinogen
 
LSD is Schedule I in the United States. This means it is illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, or distribute (sell, trade or give) without a DEA license.
 
INTERNATIONAL LAW #
 
Belgium #
 
LSD is illegal to possess, buy, sell, or produce in Belgium without government clearance. (thanks D) (Last updated Jul 22 2009)
 
Brazil #
 
LSD is listed as a controlled substance, making production, distribution, or possession illegal. (thanks P)
 
Canada #
 
LSD is schedule III in Canada. (Note: Canadian schedules are very different than U.S. schedules)
 
Finland #
 
LSD is in Finland's list of controlled substances, in the hard-drug category. (last updated Oct 8, 2012)
 
Germany #
 
LSD has been illegal since 1971 when it was added to paragraph (Schedule) I of the German Drug Law (BtmG) See [ref](https://erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?ID=6928) . (thanks xDCx)
 
Greece #
 
LSD is a class A drug in Greece. It is illegal to possess or sell without a special license from the government. (unconfirmed) (thanks J)
 
Italy (Italia) #
 
LSD is illegal to buy, sell, or possess in Italy. Penalties for possession of <0.15 mg of active principle (pure LSD) results in an administrative punishment (i.e. you pay a fee for the first time you're caught, then the second time they can suspend your passport), otherwise it's considered illegal sale, and it falls into penal code (D.L. 272/2006 converted with l. n. 49/2006) and it's punished with imprisonment from 6 to 20 years and a fee from 26.000 to 260.000 Euros. See [http://www.altalex.com/index.php?idnot=10216](http://www.altalex.com/index.php?idnot=10216) ." (thanks T). We received a note in March 2014 that the 49/2006 law was declared unconstitional, but the effect on LSD legality is unknown. (thanks fa) (last updated Mar 24 2014)
 
Mexico #
 
LSD is controlled in Mexico, however a law passed in 2009 made personal possession of 15 micrograms of LSD (.015 mg) not a crime. Curiously, this amount of LSD is considered below the threshold necessary for distinct effects. (thanks s) (last updated Dec 18, 2009)
 
Netherlands #

Effective July 2001, personal use of LSD was decriminalized by Law 30/2000 (see [text of law](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/portugal/lei30-2000.pdf) ). Possession of less than 500 ug is not regarded as a criminal offense, though the substance is liable to be seized and the possessor can be referred to mandatory treatment. Sale, or possession of quantities greater than the personal possession limit, are criminal offenses punishable by jail time. (thanks P)
 
Russia #
 
LSD is controlled and illegal to possess without a research license in Russia. Some news in 2005 has suggested that there is a move towards changing the law. See [Pravda's Jul 19 2005 story : "Psychedelic drug, LSD-25, likely to be legalized in Russian medicine"](http://english.pravda.ru/science/19/94/377/15825_LSD.html) .
