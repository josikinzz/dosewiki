## Subjective Experience

Wild dagga is one of the better known natural sedatives, particularly in southern
Africa. It has been used as a remedy for a significant number of ailments, and
recreationally, as an occasional substitute for cannabis. My notes at the time of
testing were as follows:

\`\`\`
Also known as Lion's Tail and Wild Dagga, Erowid classifies this as a
Sedative; Intoxicant, and it was my latest venture into the ethnobotanical
arena. It was quite pricey, but did it work?
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Online reviews are mixed, but this seems to be the most common sentiment:
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
“It is a nice smoking blend but don’t buy it if you are looking to get
high. It does have some calming effects but just slightly. It's nothing
like pot is what I’m saying.” ~ Danlennon3, shroomery.org
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
Last week I tried smoking it. It was a bit rough, and tasted pretty nasty. In
terms of psychoactive effect, there was some, but nothing notable or
particularly pleasing.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Unperturbed I decided to vape, having identified a couple of temperature
recommendations [150°C to 175°C (302°F to 347°F)]. This produced a minor
background effect, but not really what I was hoping for from my £10.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Smoking it in a bong, as opposed to rolling it into a joint, I found the effect to
be a little stronger. It helped that it was more pleasing from an aesthetic
perspective.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Tonight I tried wild dagga tea. I used about 14g over several cups. This was
much better. There was no particular high; just a mellow buzz and a mild
lifting of anxiety. I wouldn’t describe it as being stoned, but the psychoactivity
was definitely there, and was quite pleasant.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
In making these observations I should note that most of the wild dagga I have
seen for sale on the Internet is more colourful than mine. It is possible that it
is more potent.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Overall, I found this to be more pleasing and sedating when taken as a tea,
although nowhere near as active as, for example, kanna or kratom. It did,
however, produce one final surprise: on retiring to bed I felt that there was
some form of oneirogenic reaction, albeit minor.
\`\`\`
At a later date I managed to obtain a fresher batch of this material. This felt cleaner,
and I found smoking to be slightly more rewarding than described above.

This certainly creates a buzz-like sedation, at the lower end of the scale, but it is not a
plant I am particularly drawn to return to.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonotis_leonurus*

Leonotis leonurus, also known as wild dagga and lion's ear, is a plant species in the mint family Lamiaceae. It is a broadleaf evergreen shrub, native to South Africa, where it is very common, with a wide altitudinal range from 5 m up to 1980 m. It is known for its medicinal properties. The main psychoactive component of Leonotis leonurus is hypothesized to be related to the presence of leonurine or labdanes; Leonotis leonurus has been confirmed to contain leonurine according to peer reviewed journal published phytochemical analysis. Like other plants in the mint family, it also contains marrubin. The word "dagga" comes from Afrikaans, and derives in turn from the Khoikhoi "dachab". The word "dagga" has been extended to include cannabis in Afrikaans and South African English, so the use of "wild" serves to distinguish Leonotis leonurus from this.

## Description

The shrub grows 2 to 3 metres (7 to 10 ft) tall (rarely to 4 m (13 ft)), and 1.5 m (5 ft) wide, with softly woody stems. The leaves are medium-dark green, 5–10 centimetres (2–4 in) long, and aromatic when crushed. The plant has hairy tubular 4–5 cm orange flowers, 3–11 together in tiered whorls (verticillasters) typical of the mint family, that encircle the square stems. They rise up to 0.9 m (2 ft 11 in) above the foliage, with flowering in summer (November to January) in some areas, but autumn to winter (April to June) in other areas.

### Variation in flower colour

A white-flowered variety Leonotis leonurus var. albiflora was described by George Bentham, but is not now accepted as distinct at varietal rank; yellow cultivars also exist.

### Ecology

The native habitat of Leonotis leonurus is among rocks and in grasslands of southern Africa, particularly in wetter eastern and southern areas. It attracts nectivorous birds (mainly sunbirds), as well as various insects such as bees and butterflies. The flowers' mainly orange to orange-red colour and tubular shape are indicative of its co-evolution with African sunbirds, which have curved bills suited to feeding from tubular flowers. The butterfly Cacyreus lingeus (Lycenidae) uses the foliage as a larval food plant.

## Cultivation

Leonotis leonurus is cultivated as an ornamental plant for its copious orange blossom spikes, and is used as specimen shrub or a screen in gardens and parks. It is moderately drought tolerant, and a nectar source for birds and butterflies in landscape settings. It was introduced to Europe in the 1600s.
Lion's ear can be found introduced as an ornamental plant in other subtropical and Mediterranean climate regions beyond South Africa, such as California, Hawaii, and Australia where it has naturalised in some areas. In cooler climates it is used as an annual and winter conservatory plant.

## Pharmacology and toxicology

Marrubiin has both antioxidant and cardioprotective properties and has shown to significantly improve myocardial function.
Docosatetraenoylethanolamide (DEA) is a cannabinoid that acts on the cannabinoid (CB1) receptor which has been found in the whole flower extract of the putative variety Leonotis leonurus var. albiflora.
Leonotis leonurus contains several labdane diterpene–based compounds such as Hispanolone, Leonurun, Leonurine and Leoleorins. C-N
Leonurine (also known as SCM-198 in research) is a pseudoalkaloid that has been isolated from Leonotis leonurus, Leonotis nepetifolia, Leonurus japonicus, Leonurus cardiaca (motherwort), Leonurus sibiricus, as well as other plants of family Lamiaceae. Leonurine is easily extracted into water.[1]
One experimental animal study suggests that the aqueous leaf extract of Leonotis leonurus possesses antinociceptive, antiinflammatory, and hypoglycemic properties.
An animal study in rats indicated that in high doses, lion's ear has significant toxicological adverse effects on organs, red blood cells, white blood cells, and other important bodily functions. Acute toxicity tests in animals caused death for those receiving a 3200 mg/kg dose. A 1600 mg/kg extract led to changes in red blood cells, haemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, platelets, and white blood cells.

## Traditional uses

Infusions made from flowers, seeds, leaves, or stems are widely used to treat tuberculosis, jaundice, muscle cramps, high blood pressure, diabetes, viral hepatitis, dysentery, and diarrhoea. The leaves, roots, and bark are used as an emetic for snakebites, and bee and scorpion stings. The fresh stem juice is used as an infusion drink for "blood impurity" in some parts of South Africa.

## Legal status

### Latvia

Leonotis leonurus has been illegal in Latvia since November 2009, and is classified as a Schedule 1 drug. Possession of quantities up to 1 gram are fined up to 280 euros. Possession and distribution of larger quantities can be punished with up to 15 years in prison.

### Poland

Leonotis leonurus was banned in Poland in March 2009. Possession and distribution lead to criminal charges.
