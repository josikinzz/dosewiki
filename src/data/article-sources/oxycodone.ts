## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenanthrenes and derivatives. These are polycyclic compounds containing a phenanthrene moiety, which is a tricyclic aromatic compound with three non-linearly fused benzene.

### Background

Oxycodone is a semisynthetic opioid analgesic derived from thebaine in Germany in 1917.
3
It is currently indicated as an immediate release product for moderate to severe pain and as an extended release product for chronic moderate to severe pain requiring continuous opioid analgesics for an extended period.
Label
The first oxycodone containing product, Percodan, was approved by the FDA on April 12, 1950.
5

### Indication

Oxycodone is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe pain.
Label
There is also an extended release formulation indicated for chronic moderate to severe pain requiring continuous opioid analgesics for an extended period.
Label

### Pharmacodynamics

Oxycodone acts directly on a number of tissues not related to its analgesic effect. These tissues include the respiratory centre in the brain stem, the cough centre in the medulla, muscles of the pupils, gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, endocrine system, and immune system.
Label
Oxycodone's effect on the respiratory centre is dose dependant respiratory depression.
Label
The action on the cough centre is suppression of the cough reflex.
Label
Pupils become miopic or decrease in size, peristalsis of the gastrointestinal tract slows, and muscle tone in the colon may increase causing constipation.
Label
In the cardiovascular system histamine may be released leading to pruritis, red eyes, flushing, sweating, and decreased blood pressure.
Label
Endocrine effects may include increased prolactin, decreased cortisol, and decreased testosterone.
Label
It is not yet known if the effects of opioids on the immune system are clinically significant.
Label

### Mechanism of Action

### Absorption

Oxycodone has an oral bioavailability of 60% to 87% that is unaffected by food.
Label
The area under the curve is 135ng/mL*hr, maximum plasma concentration is 11.5ng/mL, and time to maximum concentration is 5.11hr in patients given a 10mg oral immediate release dose of oxycodone.
Label

### Metabolism

Oxycodone's hepatic metabolism is extensive and completed by 4 main reactions. CYP3A4 and 3A5 perform N-demethylation, CYP2D6 performs O-demethylation, unknown enzymes perform 6-keto-reduction, and unknown enzymes perform conjugation.
1
Oxycodone is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 to noroxycodone and then by CYP2D6 to noroxymorphone.
1
Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the primary circulating metabolites.
Label
Noroxycodone can also be 6-keto-reduced to alpha or beta noroxycodol.
1
Oxycodone can be metabolized by CYP2D6 to oxymorphone and then by CYP3A4 to noroxymorphone.
1
Oxymorphone can also be 6-keto-reduced to alpha or beta oxymorphol.
1
Oxycodone can also be 6-keto-reduced to alpha and beta oxycodol.
1
The active metabolites noroxycodone, oxymorphone, and noroxymorphone can all be conjugated before elimination.

### Half-life

The apparent elimination half life of oxycodone is 3.2 hours for immediate release formulations and 4.5 hours for extended release formulations.
Label
Noroxycodone has a half life of 5.8 hours, oxymorphone has a half life of 8.8 hours, noroxymorphone has a half life of 9 hours.

### Toxicity

Patients experiencing an overdose may present with respiratory depression, sleepiness, stupor, coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold sweat, constricted pupils, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death.
Label
Overdose should be treated by maintaining  airway, ventilation, and oxygenation.
Label
Oxygen and vasopressor treatment may be necessary to treat circulatory shock and pulmonary edema and defibrillation may be required for cardiac arrest of arrhythmia.
Label
Naloxone
,
nalmefene
, or
naltrexone
may be used to counteract the effects of opioids but patients should be monitored in case further doses are required.
Label
The intraperitoneal LD50 in mice is 320mg/kg, the oral LD50 is 426mg/kg.
MSDS
The oral lowest dose causing toxic effects in humans is 0.14mg/kg and subcutaneously in rats it is 1.53mg/kg.
MSDS
Oxycodone is pregnancy category B according to the FDA.
Label
There is a paucity of data regarding oxycodone use in pregnancy, though animal studies show no teratogenic effects.
Label
Rats given oxycodone during lactation showed smaller offspring, though after lactation, they recovered to normal size.
Label
Oxycodone is excreted in breast milk and so patients should not breastfeed while taking oxycodone due to risk of sedation and respiratory depression in infants.
Label
No studies on the carcinogenicity of oxycodone have been performed.
Label
Oxycodone was genotoxic at 50mcg/mL with metabolic activation and at 400mcg/mL without.
Label
It was also clastogenic with metabolic activation at ≥1250mcg/mL.
Label
Oxycodone was not found to be genotoxic in other tests.
Label
Oxycodone does not affect reproduction and fertility in rats at doses of up to 8mg/kg/day.

### Mechanism of action

The full mechanism of oxycodone is not known.
Label
Under conditions of inflammation or hyperalgesia, opioid receptors in the heart, lungs, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and reproductive system are upregulated and transported to nerve terminals.
3
Oxycodone and its active metabolites, noroxycodone, oxymorphone, and noroxymorphone are opioid agonists.
1
These compounds passively diffuse across the blood brain barrier or may be actively transported across by an unknown mechanism.
3
Oxycodone and its active metabolites can selectively bind to the mu opioid receptor, but also the kappa and delta opioid receptors in the central nervous system and periphery, and induce a G protein coupled receptor signalling pathway.
3
Activation of mu opioid receptors inhibits N-type voltage operated calcium channels, inhibiting responses to pain.

*Source: Drug Users Bible by Dominic Milton Trott*

*Section 2.5.8 - CHEMSCAPE: A Chemical Journey*

## Quick Reference
- **Common Nomenclature:** Oxycodone
- **Street & Reference Names:** Oxy; Oxynorm; Oxycotten; Ocycontin;
- **Reference Dosage:** Light 2.5mg+; Common 5mg+; Strong 10mg+
- **Anticipated: Onset / Duration:** 30 Minutes / 6 Hours
- **Maximum Dose Experienced:** 10mg
- **RoA:** Oral
- **Source / Jurisdiction:** Associate / Overseas

## Subjective Experience

Oxycodone is an opioid medication which is prescribed to treat moderate to severe
pain, and is available in both instant and extended release forms. It was first
synthesized in Germany in 1916, and was first used clinically in 1917.

As would be expected, it comes with a variety of potential side effects, and clear risks
with respect to overdose and addiction. Indeed, according to the CDC (the US
Government's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), among drug overdose
deaths that mentioned at least one specific drug it ranked #1 in 2011. The message
here is extremely clear.

This is certainly one which I will be treading carefully with. Also note that it is not a
drug to mix with alcohol, or in fact, other medicines. In addition, grapefruit is
commonly cited as a potentiator, and should be avoided.

As a street drug it is sometimes referred to as hillbilly heroin, due to its abuse in the
Appalachian region of the US and its cultural reputation as a poor man's heroin.

My supply comprises a single 40mg pill, which is actually quite alarming, as even a
cursory check reveals this to be a dangerous dose for non-tolerant users. I note also
that it is marked “prolonged release” and is thus of the extended release variety.

The vendor was helpful enough to explain that I could snort this if I wanted to. All I
had to do was remove the wax coating and crush the contents. Given the significantly
increased dose sensitivity of this drug when insufflated this isn’t a route I will be
taking.

So what should I take? Looking at the generic threshold figures, and taking into
account my own physiology, my non-tolerant status, and my lack of enthusiasm for
opioids generally, I decide to pitch in at no more than 10mg.

For more precision, rather than simply cutting the 40mg pill into four approximate
quarters, I use my scales. I weigh the entire pill (148mg) and then cut it into four. I
then weigh each quarter and select one which is just under the requisite weight
(36mg). Note that, as much as I can, I also make sure that the wax coating is
distributed evenly across the four quarters. Overall I am confident that my dose, if
anything, is a tad under the 10mg maximum.

The left-over debris is a combination of white crusty powder and yellow coating. It
may seem a shame, but I bin it as an obvious safety precaution.

One thought that occurs before starting is that this operation may have neutralized
the extended release mechanism of the pill. Regardless, I am now ready to go.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I spoon approx 10mg of oxycodone (the 36mg quarter) into my mouth
and swill it down with a glass of water [2:10pm]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:30 A mellow-headedness is starting to emerge and I am warmer. I feel
less anxious and slightly more relaxed than I was.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 This hasn’t evolved very far. It remains a gentle bubble of warm
tranquillity, which is pleasant but not euphoric. I’m not complaining: it’s a
nice enough vibe with an undeniable uplift and it isn’t too strong. It also
carries a gentle touch of numbness.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:00 I am still floating along quite nicely with no flip side so far.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:30 The intensity is now lower than it was earlier, although I remain in a
very comfortable zone. Even though I feel that having more would tip me over
into nausea and illness, I do have a worrying sense that I would redose had I
not binned the remainder of my supply.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+6:00 As with some of the other opioids I have experienced, as I tire I still
feel slightly dizzy and a little queasy. This is not particularly heavy on this
occasion, but it comes and goes, and is noticeable.
\`\`\`
I retired to bed at 10pm (T+8:00), exhausted and feeling down about everything in
sight, which was no doubt part of the come-down. The night’s sleep, however, wasn’t
so bad, despite a couple of wake-ups in need of water.

I believe that I just about got away with this one. I have made some bad decisions
with opioids, usually overdoing it, but here I found a dose which delivered a good few
hours of pleasantness with a payback which was apparent but manageable.

Finally, the warnings with respect to oxycodone are particularly stark and I was wise
to heed them. If you do intend to use this, I would urge you to do the same. The
statistics I referred to earlier tell their own tale.

Oxycodone (Percocet, Oxycontin)
 
Basics
 
by Erowid
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
[Oxycodone Images](https://erowid.org/oxycodone_images.shtml)
 
Oxycodone (Percocet, Oxycontin) is a semi-synthetic opioid analgesic (pain killer) similar to morphine. Oxycodone is widely prescribed for the relief of moderate to severe pain, in both regular and time-release forms. It is widely available by prescription and is notoriously addictive, leading many users to have problems controlling their own use. 
 
[ [Main Oxycodone Vault](https://erowid.org/oxycodone.shtml) ]
 
[Dose](https://erowid.org/oxycodone_law.shtml) #
 
Oxycodone typically comes in different strengths, including: 5 mg capsules; 5, 10, 15, and 30 mg oral tablets; and 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg sustained-release tablets. Some people choose to grind and insufflate (snort) oxycodone tablets in order to get a stronger effect, however, the use of higher dose sustained-release tablets in this manner can be very dangerous. 
 
 An average adult dose is typically 5 mg every six hours. Tolerance develops very quickly; those who take it on a daily basis may find they need to increase their dosage in order to get the same effects. Higher doses, especially the 80 mg sustained-release tablets are for opioid-tolerant people only.
 
Price #
 
Prescription prices vary but have increased since the introduction of the gummy anti-injection/anti-snorting versions of Oxycodone tablets. Prices in the U.S. are in the range of \$5-10 per 40 mg tablet in the United States (2013), with street prices around \$1 USD per mg (\$40 per 40mg tablet). Canadian prices are around 1.25-1.75 CDN per mg for OxyNeo and 2-2.5 CDN per millligram of oxycodone. **much** lower.
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/oxycodone_law.shtml) #
 
Oxycodone is available by prescription only in most countries. It is Schedule II in the United States, making it illegal to sell without a license and illegal to purchase or possess without a prescription.
 
[Chemistry](https://erowid.org/oxycodone_chemistry.shtml) #
 
Oxycodone is an opioid analgesic, closely related chemically to opioids such as codeine and morphine.
 
Pharmacology #
 
As with most other opioids, oxycodone's mechanism of analgesic action is unknown. It is presumed to work by affecting opioid receptors found in the brain.
 
Production #
 
Most recreationally consumed oxycodone is diverted from prescription medical uses, rather than produced/manufactured illegally.
 
History #
 
Oxycodone was first synthesized in 1916 in Germany and has been used therapeutically since shortly thereafter. It has been available in the United States since about 1939. It became more popular in the 1950s. It was placed into Schedule II in the U.S. in 1970. The sustained-release form (Oxycontin) has been available in the U.S. since 1995/6 and quickly gained popularity.
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
Brand Names:
 
Percocet, Percodan, Endocodone, M-oxy, Oxycontin, Oxydose, OxyFAST, OxyIR, Percolone, Roxicodone, Roxicet, Supeudol, Tylox.
 
The Substance:
 
Oxy, Oxies, O.C.'s, Oxycottons, Oxy 80's, Hillbilly Heroin, Roxies, Percs.
 
The Experience:
 
Jammed.
 
EFFECTS #
 
Primary effects include analgesia (pain relief), sedation, reduction of anxiety, euphoria, and relaxation.
 
Onset #
 
Effects are generally felt 10-30 minutes after oral ingestion, although it can take up to an hour to feel the full effects.
 
Duration #
 
Oxycodone, when taken orally (and not in sustained-release form) has effects that last last from 3 to 5 hours. Sustained-release tablets last up to 12 hours.
 
Visual Effects #
 
Rarely (less than 1% in clinical trials) oxycodone may result in changes in visual perception, or abnormal vision.
 
PROBLEMS #
 
Side effects range from the common: constipation, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, itching/pruritus, dry mouth, sweating, fatigue, and weakness; to the less common: impaired thinking, confusion, loss of appetite, nervousness, sleeplessness/insomnia, fever, diarrhea, difficulty urinating, clammy skin, light-headedness, and fainting; to the rare and very concerning: abdominal pain, seizures, convulsions, difficulty breathing, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and circulatory depression or shock.
 
Contraindications #
 
Combining oxycodone with alcohol or other CNS depressants can lead to a dangerous slowing of the central nervous system and respiratory system. Other contraindications include: 
- those hypersensitive to opiates history of drug or alcohol abuse those with head injuries, increased intracranial pressure, seizures, asthma, COPD, prostatic hyperplassia, severe hepatic or renal disease, acute abdominal conditions, urethral stricture, hypothyroidism, Addison's disease, or arrhythmias
 
Addiction Potential #
 
Oxycodone is both physically and psychologically addicting. Anyone taking it, whether for recreational or medicinal reasons, may become addicted, especially if it is used on a daily basis. Tolerance is developed over a period of weeks, resulting in higher doses being needed to achieve the same effects. Withdrawal symptoms, including aches and pains, restlessness, nausea, anxiety, diarrhea, fever, headaches, runny nose, tremors, sweating, vomiting, and trouble sleeping, may be experienced by those ceasing use after regular and especially high-dose use.

DESCRIPTION #
 
Oxycodone is a semi-synthetic opioid analgesic used to treat moderate to severe pain. It is most effective treating acute pain rather than chronic pain. The precise mechanism of action of oxycodone and other opiates is not known, although it is believed to relate to the existence of opiate receptors in the central nervous system.

Oxycodone Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
Oxycodone is available in several forms. Percocet contains between 2.5-10 mg oxycodone and 325-650 mg acetaminophen/paracetamol. Percodan most often contains 4.5 mg oxycodone and 325 mg aspirin. Oxycontin is a timed-release form that gradually releases oxycodone (10, 20, 40, 80, or 160 mg) over several hours when taken orally. Other formulations are available.

 The chart above shows oral dosages for individuals with different levels of tolerance to opiates. Because people quickly develop tolerance to the effects of oxycodone, dosages will vary dramatically depending on whether an individual has been using regularly, and for how long. Some new users report an alarming degree of sedation and nausea after taking 15 mg, while some chronic users report taking 200 mg or more a day.

 Some people choose to insufflate (snort) oxycodone in order to deliver a more rapid onset. Note that snorting any substance can result in injury to nasal passags, sinuses, throat, etc and crushed tablets include binders and inert ingredients that do not rapidly dissolve.

**Oxycodone (Oxycontin, Percoset, Roxycodone) Health Concerns** 
 **by Erowid** 
 
 
DEATHS #
 
Respiratory arrest and death stemming from overdose or drug combinations involving oxycodone is the most serious health concern from oxycodone use . Deaths from oxycodone alone or in combination with other CNS depressants [data?] Although the death rate from opioids increased between 1999 and 2011, the rate of increase has slowed since 2006.[1]
 
WARNINGS #
 
- Respiratory Depression. Respiratory depression from taking too much oxycodone or mixing it with other CNS depressants can have life-threatening consequences. 
 
 [grabbed from Alcohol Health] Seek medical attention if : 
 The person is unconscious and cannot be wakened 
 Breathing is irregular and/or shallow 
 You suspect oxycodone has been mixed with other drugs 
 Skin is clammy or pale
- Depressant Combinations. Avoid other depressants (alcohol, benzos, opiates, some dissociatives) in combination with oxycodone, which can increase respiratory depressions risks.
- Oxycodone is Addicting. Oxycodone is an opiate and, as with most opiates, is addicting. Some people find opiates very appealing and with even moderate use, can find themselves using more than they want to. With regular use, the body becomes physically dependent upon the substance, causing withdrawal symptoms if use is ceased.
- Oxycodone Causes Tolerance. Those who use Oxycodone for many days in a row report that they begin to require a higher dose for the same effects. Beware of dosages recommended by an individual who uses Oxycodone regularly as their dose could be dangerous for a non-user due to tolerance.
 
CAUTIONS #
 
- Frequent or increased use. Many people have reported using more oxycodone than they intended. Often this takes the form of continuing to redose repeatedly after they had planned to stop, or taking more oxycodone to achieve the same effects.
- Constipation. Using opiates like oxycodone can cause constipation.
- Hyperalgesia stemming from chronic use. Some people report a heightened sensitivity to pain after prolonged use of opiates.

Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Oxycodone**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Scheduled
- SCHEDULE: Schedule II
- CLASSIFICATION: Opiate
 
Oxycodone is Schedule II in the United States. This means it is illegal to sell without a DEA license and illegal to buy or possess without a license or prescription. 
 
 After high-dose oxycodone tablets as OxyContin were approved in 2005, the FDA revoked its approval of the original sustained-release formulation in 2010 because of the record of unapproved use. A re-engineered OxyContin product was released to try to make it harder to snort or inject and in April 2013, the FDA approved a newer formulation that is even harder to snort or inject. See [http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm348252.htm](http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm348252.htm) .
 
INTERNATIONAL LAW #
 
Australia #
 
Oxycodone is a controlled drug in Australia and prescriptions must be recent (6? 12? months) to authorize current possession. (unconfirmed) (thanks JL)
 
Canada #
 
Oxycodone is schedule I in Canada. (Note: Canadian schedules are very different than U.S. schedules)
 
Germany #
 
Oxycodone is BTM Anlage 3 in Germany making it illegal to possess without a BTM prescription. (unconfirmed) (thanks PM)
 
U.K. #
 
Oxycodone is [Schedule II/Class A](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/uk/uk_law_definitions.shtml) in the U.K., making it illegal to buy or possess without a prescription.

It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Oxycodone** (also known under brand names including **Roxicodone** , **OxyContin** , **Percocet** , **Oxecta** , **OxyIR** , **Endone** , **Oxynorm** , and **OxyNEO** ) is a semi-synthetic [opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) synthesized from poppy-derived thebaine. It is a narcotic analgesic within the [morphinan](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphinan) chemical class and is generally indicated for relief of moderate to severe pain. It was developed in 1916 in Germany as one of several new semi-synthetic opioids in an attempt to improve on the existing opioids.

Oxycodone is available as single-ingredient medication in immediate release and controlled release. Combination products, such as **Percocet** , formulated with non-narcotic ingredients such as NSAIDs and paracetamol (acetaminophen) are also available.

## Chemistry

Oxycodone, or dihydro hydroxy codeinone, is an opioid of the morphinan class. Oxycodone and other molecules of this class contain a polycyclic core of three benzene rings fused in a zig-zag pattern called a phenanthrene. A fourth nitrogen containing ring is fused to the phenanthrene at R 9 and R 13 , with the nitrogen member looking at R 17 of the combined structure. This structure is called morphinan.

Oxycodone, along with other morphinans, contains an ether bridge between two of its rings, connecting R 4 and R 5 through an oxygen group. It contains a carbonyl group bound at R 6 and a methyl group located on the nitrogen atom at R 17 . The carbon-oxygen double bond of the carbonyl saturates the benzene ring it is bonded with. Thus oxycodone lacks the double bond on that ring found in [codeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Codeine) . Oxycodone also shares the 3-methoxy substitution found in codeine; however, it contains an additional hydroxy group at R 14 . Oxycodone is analogous to the other morphinans including [dihydrocodeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dihydrocodeine) , [heroin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heroin) , [ethylmorphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ethylmorphine) , and [codeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Codeine) .

## Pharmacology

Oxycodone produces effects that are typical of μ-opioid agonists, suggesting a pharmacological similarity to more traditional [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , such as [codeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Codeine) and [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) . These compounds exert their effects by binding to and activating the [μ-opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid#Mu_.28.CE.BC.29) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) . This occurs because opioids structurally mimic endogenous endorphins which are naturally found within the body and also work upon the μ-opioid receptor set. The way in which opioids structurally mimic these natural endorphins results in their [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) , [pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) and [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiolytic) effects. This is because endorphins are responsible for reducing pain, causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or general excitement.

In 2006, research by a Japanese group suggested the effect of oxycodone is mediated by different receptors in different situations. Specifically in diabetic mice, the [κ-opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid#Receptor_types) receptor appears to be involved in the direct pain relief caused by oxycodone, while in nondiabetic mice, the μ1-opioid receptor seems to be primarily responsible for these effects.

### Metabolism

Oxycodone has 3 metabolites: noroxycodone (CYP3A4/5), oxymorphone (CYP2D6), and 6α-/6β-oxycodol (6-Ketoreduction). Of these, oxymorphone is the active one. Anywhere from 5-19% of oxycodone is metabolized to oxymorphone, the rest being mostly noroxycodone (45-70%) and 6-oxycodols (~2-14%). Grapefruit juice inhibits CYP3A4 activity, allowing more oxycodone to be metabolized into oxymorphone which potentiates oxycodone.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

- **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - In comparison to other [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , this particular substance can be considered similar in its physical euphoria when compared with that of [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) or [diacetylmorphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diacetylmorphine) (heroin) and more intense when compared to [kratom](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Kratom) and [hydrocodone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hydrocodone) . The sensation itself can be described as extreme feelings of intense physical comfort, warmth, love and bliss.
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)** - At low to moderate doses, this effect results in the sensation that the breath is slowed down mildly to moderately, but does not cause noticeable impairment. At high doses and overdoses, opioid-induced respiratory depression can result in a shortness of breath, abnormal breathing patterns, semi-consciousness, or unconsciousness. Severe overdoses can result in a coma or death without immediate medical attention.
- **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - Oxycodone is considerably less sedating than [codeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Codeine) but more sedating than [kratom](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Kratom) .
- **[Constipation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Constipation)**
- **[Cough suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cough_suppression)**
- **[Decreased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_libido)**
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)**
- **[Itchiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Itchiness)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - This effect is more pronounced at higher doses.
- **[Pupil constriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_constriction)**
- **[Stomach cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stomach_cramps)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Orgasm suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orgasm_suppression)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Skin flushing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Skin_flushing)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - This seems to be caused by both µ-opioid receptor agonism and downstream dopamine reinforcement. In comparison to other [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , this particular substance can be considered similar in its cognitive euphoria when compared with that of [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) or [diacetylmorphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diacetylmorphine) (heroin) and more intense when compared to [kratom](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Kratom) and [hydrocodone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hydrocodone) . The sensation itself can be described as powerful and overwhelming feelings of emotional bliss, contentment, and happiness.
- **[Ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation)**
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)** - While opioids are well known for their ability to improve mood, they can also have the paradoxical effect of increasing the user's sensitivity to irritable stimuli. This can manifest as aloofness and sudden outbursts of anger and aggression (colloquially known as "opiate rage"). It appears to occur more frequently during the comedown of the experience and/or with heavy use.
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)** ### Visual effects
 
- - **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** - One may experience a state of semi-consciousness and hypnagogia during heavy dosage nodding which results in dream-like states and up to level 3 [imagery](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lucid_dreaming#Internally_sourced_sensory_input) and mild [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

Oxycodone has a low toxicity relative to dose. As with all opioids, long-term effects can vary but can include diminished libido, apathy, and memory loss. It is also potentially [lethal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) when mixed with [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) like [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) .

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , the chronic use of oxycodone can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal symptoms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids#Discontinuation) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of oxycodone develops with prolonged and repeated use. The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects, with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly for instance. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Oxycodone presents cross-tolerance with all other [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , meaning that after the consumption of oxycodone all [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) will have a reduced effect.

The risk of fatal opioid overdoses rise sharply after a period of cessation and [relapse](/w/index.php?title=Relapse&action=edit&redlink=1) , largely because of reduced tolerance. To account for this lack of tolerance, it is safer to only dose a fraction of one's usual [dosage](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage) if relapsing. It has also been found that the environment one is in can play a role in opioid tolerance. In one scientific study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the drug in contrast to a familiar environment.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Alcohol** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. Place affected patients in the recovery position to prevent vomit aspiration from excess. Memory blackouts are likely
- **Stimulants** - Stimulants increase respiration rate which allows for a higher dose of opiates than would otherwise be used. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the user and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Benzodiazepines** - Central nervous system and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present. The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position blackouts/memory loss likely.
- **DXM** - Generally considered to be toxic. CNS depression, difficulty breathing, heart issues, and liver toxicity have been observed. Additionally if one takes DXM, their tolerance of opiates goes down slightly, thus causing additional synergistic effects.
- **GHB** / **GBL** - The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position
- **Ketamine** - Both substances bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the user falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
- **MAOIs** - Coadministration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) with certain opioids has been associated with rare reports of severe adverse reactions. There appear to be two types of interaction, an excitatory and a depressive one. Symptoms of the excitatory reaction may include agitation, headache, diaphoresis, hyperpyrexia, flushing, shivering, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor, diarrhea, hypertension, tachycardia, seizures, and coma. Death has occurred in some cases.
- **MXE** - MXE can potentiate the effects of opioids but also increases the risk of respiratory depression and organ toxicity.
- **Nitrous** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position. Memory blackouts are common.
- **PCP** - PCP may reduce opioid tolerance, increasing the risk of overdose.
- **Tramadol** - Increased risk of seizures. Tramadol itself is known to induce seizures and it may have additive effects on seizure threshold with other opioids. Central nervous system- and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present.
- **Grapefruit** - While grapefruit is not psychoactive, it may affect the metabolism of certain opioids. Tramadol, oxycodone, and fentanyl are all primarily metabolized by the enzyme CYP3A4, which is potently inhibited by grapefruit juice . This may cause the drug to take longer to clear from the body. it may increase toxicity with repeated doses. Methadone may also be affected . Codeine and hydrocodone are metabolized by CYP2D6. People who are on medicines that inhibit CYP2D6, or that lack the enzyme due to a genetic mutation will not respond to codeine as it can not be metabolized into its active product: morphine.

## Legal issues

Oxycodone is subject to international conventions on narcotic drugs. In addition, oxycodone is subject to national laws that differ by country. The 1931 Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs of the League of Nations included oxycodone. The 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of the United Nations, which replaced the 1931 convention, categorized oxycodone in Schedule I.

- **Australia:** Oxycodone is in Schedule I (derived from the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs) of the Commonwealth's Narcotic Drugs Act 1967. In addition, it is in Schedule 8 of the Australian Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons ("Poisons Standard"), meaning it is a "controlled drug... which should be available for use but require[s] restriction of manufacture, supply, distribution, possession and use to reduce abuse, misuse and physical or psychological dependence".
- **Austria:** Oxycodone is legal for medical use under the AMG (Arzneimittelgesetz Österreich) and illegal when sold or possessed without a prescription under the SMG (Suchtmittelgesetz Österreich). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Canada:** Oxycodone is a controlled substance under Schedule I of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA).
- **Germany:** The drug is in Appendix III of the Narcotics Act (Betäubungsmittelgesetz or BtMG). The law allows only physicians, dentists, and veterinarians (Ärzte, Zahnärzte und Tierärzte) to prescribe oxycodone and the federal government to regulate the prescriptions (e.g., by requiring reporting).
- **Hong Kong:** Oxycodone is regulated under Part I of Schedule 1 of Hong Kong's Chapter 134 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.
- **Russia:** Oxycodone is a Schedule II controlled substance.
- **Singapore:** Oxycodone is listed as a Class A drug in the Misuse of Drugs Act of Singapore, which means offences in relation to the drug attract the most severe level of punishment. A conviction for unauthorized manufacture of the drug attracts a minimum sentence of 10 years of imprisonment and corporal punishment of five strokes of the cane, and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment or 30 years of imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. The minimum and maximum penalties for unauthorized trafficking in the drug are respectively five years of imprisonment and five strokes of the cane, and 20 years of imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.
- **Switzerland** : Oxycodone is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis A. Medicinal use is permitted.
- **Turkey** : Oxycodone is a 'red prescription' only substance and illegal when sold or possessed without a prescription. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **UK:** Oxycodone is a Class A drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act.
- **USA:** Oxycodone is a Schedule II controlled substance.

## Effects
Oxycodone has analgesic, depressant, antianxiety, cough suppressant and psychotropic properties. More intense dreams may also occur. Due to its relaxing and euphoric properties, it is used as a recreational drug, and is said to be more stimulating and mood-lifting than other opioids.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Very common side effects, as with all opioids, are constipation and constriction of the pupils. Drowsiness, dizziness, headache, itching, muscle twitching, sleep disturbances and mood swings are also to be expected. In women, menstruation may also be absent.
Other opioid-typical side effects such as hallucinations, confusion, vomiting and nausea are less common with oxycodone.
Overdoses with oxycodone are life-threatening, as the substance has a strong respiratory depressant effect even in low doses when abused, which can lead to respiratory arrest and coma. For opioid addicts, the lethal dose can be much higher. An overdose is treated by taking naloxone, an opioid antagonist.

### Long-term Risks
The consumption of oxycodone leads to physical and psychological dependence after a short time, even more quickly than with morphine. Tolerance builds up, which is why higher and higher doses have to be consumed. Strong withdrawal symptoms such as restlessness, irritability, depression, insomnia, sweating, cold shivers, vomiting, diarrhoea and painful cramps may occur.

## Safer Use
- Opioids are highly effective drugs that should only be used for a limited time and at best under medical supervision.
- Start with a low dose and wait for the effect and tolerance before adding more. Do not exceed the maximum daily dose.
- If you inject opioids, dose even more carefully, as the range between desired effect (rush) and dangerous overdose is even more difficult to assess. Avoid injecting fentanyl; the risk of overdose is particularly high. Always use new (clean and sterile) injection material! Never exchange syringes, filters, water, disinfection swabs to avoid transmission of hepatitis and HIV.
- Do not rely on dosage information from colleagues who regularly use opioids. Due to habituation or dependence, their doses are much higher and can be fatal for new users.
- Take longer breaks (at least several days) between consumption.
- After a period of abstinence, take a much lower dose! The usual dose before the abstinence phase can otherwise quickly have life-threatening consequences.
- The simultaneous consumption of depressant substances such as alcohol, ketamine, GHB/GBL, nitrous oxide, benzodiazepines and/or other opioids is dangerous as there is an increased risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. The risk of suffocation is high!
- Refrain from citrus fruits (especially grapefruit) before or during consumption. The combination can lead to an increase in the effect of the opiate and/or to respiratory depression.

  "thedrugclassroom": `# Oxycodone
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/oxycodone/*

Oxycodone is a popular member of the opioid class. It is widely used in medical settings for acute and chronic pain. Outside of those settings, it has long been used recreationally, with its effects compared to [morphine](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/morphine/) and heroin.

The drug is sold either on its own or in combination with acetaminophen (primarily). When acetaminophen is present, the dose must be limited. The general recommendation is to avoid using over 1,000 mg at once or 3,000 mg per day.

An oxycodone overdose can be very dangerous and even deadly, with a notably problematic effect being respiratory depression. It is more risky when combined with other CNS depressants (e.g. [benzodiazepines](http://thedrugclassroom.com/categories/benzodiazepines/) and [alcohol](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/alcohol-ethanol/) .)

  "tripsit-wiki": `# Oxycodone

*Source: https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Oxycodone*

**Oxycodone**, a strong and addictive drug used to treat moderate to severe pain. It is an analgesic medication synthesized from poppy-derived thebaine. Oxycodone can be available in instant release and extended release tablets. It is often also combined with acetaminophen, marketed under the name Percoset.  Oxycodone is a very powerful pain medication and can lead to addiction and dependency.

## History

It was developed in 1916 in Germany, as one of several new semi-synthetic opioids in an attempt to improve on the existing opioids: morphine, diacetylmorphine (heroin), and codeine. Oxycodone is available in the forms of instant release, paired with Acetaminophen, or extended release.

## Dosage

**WE ARE NOT DOCTORS. CONSUME THE DOSAGES BELOW AT YOUR OWN RISK**

**In high doses, overdoses, or in patients not tolerant to opiates, oxycodone can cause shallow breathing, bradycardia, cold-clammy skin, apnea, hypotension, miosis, circulatory collapse, respiratory arrest, and death.**

The following refer to oxycodone in the form of a drug such as Roxicet or Percosets. This does not apply to XR Oxycodone in the form of a drug like OxyContin which has a time release mechanism.  Oxycodone can be taken orally, insufflated, or IVed (which is extremely dangerous.)

| Light | 2.5-10mg |
| --- | --- |
| Common | 10-25mg |
| Strong | 25-40mg |

| Light | 2.5-7.5mg |
| --- | --- |
| Common | 7.5-15mg |
| Strong | 15-25mg |

## Duration

**Half-life** depends on a lot of factors such as weight, BMI, and metabolism.

Half-life = 3-4.5 hours duration depends upon R.O.A., as IVing will last much shorter, but with a more intense high, yet taking your Oxycodone orally will be much more mellow feeling accompanied by a lesser "rush" feeling. but last longer.

| Onset | 20-40 minutes |

## Effects

### Positive

- Euphoria
- Drip
- Pain relief

### Neutral

- Itching

### Negative

- Nausea
- Constipation
- CNS depression
- Drowsiness
- Sweating
- Dizziness
- Vomiting

## Harm Reduction

Do not take any more oxycodone than you are prescribed.  If you are prescribed oxycodone with any other medication such as acetaminophen please conduct a cold water extraction, or CWE.  This gets ride of the acetaminophen. 

- Do not drive or operate machinery while under the influence of oxycodone

- Do not consume alcohol or other CNS [Depressants](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Depressants) while under the influence of Oxycodone

### Warning

Excessive alcohol/grapefruit juice (drinking while taking oxycodone, especially drugs that contain APAP, such as percocet) can cause liver damage, other severe medical conditions, and even death. These potentiators may potentiate Oxycodone dangerously high for someone with a low-tolerance.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

Oxycodone's chemical name is derived from codeine. The chemical structures are very similar, differing only in that

- Oxycodone has a hydroxyl group at carbon-14 (codeine has just a hydrogen in its place)
- Oxycodone has a 7,8-dihydro feature. Codeine has a double bond between those two carbons; and
- Oxycodone has a carbonyl group (as in ketones) in place of the hydroxyl group of codeine.

It is also similar to [hydrocodone](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Hydrocodone), differing only in that it has a hydroxyl group at carbon-14.

### Legal status

**General**

- Oxycodone is subject to international conventions on narcotic drugs. In addition, oxycodone is subject to national laws that differ by country. The 1931 Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs of the League of Nations included oxycodone. The 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of the United Nations, which replaced the 1931 convention, categorized oxycodone in Schedule I.[46] Global restrictions on Schedule I drugs include "limit[ing] exclusively to medical and scientific purposes the production, manufacture, export, import, distribution of, trade in, use and possession of" these drugs; "requir[ing] medical prescriptions for the supply or dispensation of [these] drugs to individuals"; and "prevent[ing] the accumulation" of quantities of these drugs "in excess of those required for the normal conduct of business".

**Australia**

- Oxycodone is in Schedule I (derived from the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs) of the Commonwealth's Narcotic Drugs Act 1967.[47] In addition, it is in Schedule 8 of the Australian Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons ("Poisons Standard"), meaning it is a "controlled drug... which should be available for use but require[s] restriction of manufacture, supply, distribution, possession and use to reduce abuse, misuse and physical or psychological dependence".

**Canada**

- Oxycodone is a controlled substance under Schedule I of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA).

**America**

- Schedule 2, available only by prescription

**Germany**

- The drug is in Appendix III of the Narcotics Act (Betäubungsmittelgesetz or BtMG).[56] The law allows only physicians, dentists, and veterinarians (Ärzte, Zahnärzte und Tierärzte) can prescribe oxycodone, and the federal government can regulate the prescriptions (e.g., by requiring reporting).

**Hong Kong**

- Oxycodone is regulated under Part I of Schedule 1 of Hong Kong's Chapter 134 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

**Singapore**

- Oxycodone is listed as a Class A drug in the Misuse of Drugs Act of Singapore, which means offences in relation to the drug attract the most severe level of punishment. A conviction for unauthorized manufacture of the drug attracts a minimum sentence of 10 years of imprisonment and corporal punishment of five strokes of the cane, and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment or 30 years of imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.[58] The minimum and maximum penalties for unauthorized trafficking in the drug are respectively five years of imprisonment and five strokes of the cane, and 20 years of imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.

**United Kingdom**

- Oxycodone is a Class A drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act. For Class A drugs, which are "considered to be the most likely to cause harm", possession without a prescription is punishable by up to seven years in prison, an unlimited fine, or both. Dealing of the drug illegally is punishable by up to life imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both. In addition, oxycodone is a Schedule 2 drug per the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 which "provide certain exemptions from the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971".

**The Netherlands**

- Oxycodone is listed in list 1 of the Opium Law, meaning it is a hard drug associated with high health risks. However, doctors are still able to prescribe oxycodone under the Medicine Law.

  "wikipedia": `# Oxycodone
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxycodone*

Oxycodone, sold under the brand name Roxicodone and OxyContin (which is the extended-release form) among others, is a semi-synthetic opioid used medically for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. It is highly addictive and is a commonly abused drug. It is usually taken by mouth, and is available in immediate-release and controlled-release formulations. Onset of pain relief typically begins within fifteen minutes and lasts for up to six hours with the immediate-release formulation. In the United Kingdom, it is available by injection. Combination products are also available with paracetamol (acetaminophen), ibuprofen, naloxone, naltrexone, and aspirin.
Common side effects include euphoria, constipation, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, drowsiness, dizziness, itching, dry mouth, and sweating. Side effects may also include addiction and dependence, substance abuse, irritability, depression or mania, delirium, hallucinations, hypoventilation, gastroparesis, bradycardia, and hypotension. Those allergic to codeine may also be allergic to oxycodone. Use of oxycodone in early pregnancy appears relatively safe. Opioid withdrawal may occur if rapidly stopped. Oxycodone acts by activating the μ-opioid receptor. When taken by mouth, it has roughly 1.5 times the effect of the equivalent amount of morphine.
Oxycodone was originally produced from the opium poppy opiate alkaloid thebaine in 1916 in Germany. One year later, it was used medically for the first time in Germany. Oxycodone is a therapeutic alternative on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2023, it was the 49th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 13 million prescriptions. A number of abuse-deterrent formulations are available, such as in combination with naloxone or naltrexone.

## Medical uses

Oxycodone is used for managing moderate to severe acute or chronic pain when other treatments are not sufficient. Oxycodone improves quality of life in certain types of pain. Numerous studies have been completed, and the appropriate use of this compound does improve the quality of life of patients with long term chronic pain syndromes.
Oxycodone can be taken in an immediate-release form (4 times daily for example with the brand name Shortec) or twice daily with extended-release forms (such as with e.g. the brand name "Oxypro") and both forms are  Extended-release forms of oxycodone (OxyContin) and are used for around-the-clock treatment of pain worldwide, are not to be used on an "as needed" basis, while other forms such as the immediate-release forms are indicated as to be used as rescue medications in the treatment of pain (for example for in severe cancer pain or pain after surgery). There are many forms of the drug that are recognized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Health Service (NHS) and NHS Scotland (NHS Scot) to be used for various indications.
Oxycodone is available as a controlled-release tablet. A 2006 review found that controlled-release oxycodone is comparable to immediate-release oxycodone, morphine, and hydromorphone in management of moderate to severe cancer pain, with fewer side effects than morphine. The author concluded that the controlled-release form is a valid alternative to morphine and a first-line treatment for cancer pain. In 2014, the European Association for Palliative Care recommended oxycodone by mouth as a second-line alternative to morphine by mouth for cancer pain.
In children between 11 and 16, the extended-release formulation is FDA-approved for the relief of cancer pain, trauma pain, or pain due to major surgery (for those already treated with opioids, who can tolerate at least 20 mg per day of oxycodone) – this provides an alternative to Duragesic (fentanyl), the only other extended-release opioid analgesic approved for children.
Oxycodone, in its extended-release form or in combination with naloxone, is sometimes used off-label in the treatment of severe and refractory restless legs syndrome.

### Available forms

Oxycodone is available in a variety of formulations for by mouth or under the tongue:

Immediate-release oxycodone (OxyFast, OxyIR, OxyNorm, Roxicodone, Shortec)
Controlled-release oxycodone (OxyContin, Xtampza ER, Oxypro) – 10–12 hour duration
Oxycodone tamper-resistant (OxyContin OTR)
Immediate-release oxycodone with paracetamol (acetaminophen) (Percocet, Endocet, Roxicet, Tylox)
Immediate-release oxycodone with aspirin (Endodan, Oxycodan, Percodan, Roxiprin)
Immediate-release oxycodone with ibuprofen (Combunox)
Controlled-release oxycodone with naloxone (Targin, Targiniq, Targinact) – 10–12 hour duration
Controlled-release oxycodone with naltrexone (Troxyca) – 10–12 hour duration

In the US, oxycodone is only approved for use by mouth, available as tablets and oral solutions. Parenteral formulations of oxycodone (brand name OxyNorm) are also available in other parts of the world, however, and are widely used in the European Union. In Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, oxycodone is approved for intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) use. When first introduced in Germany during World War I, both IV and IM administrations of oxycodone were commonly used for postoperative pain management of Central Powers soldiers.

## Side effects

The most common side effects of oxycodone include delayed gastric emptying, euphoria, anxiolysis (a reduction in anxiety), feelings of relaxation, and respiratory depression. Common side effects of oxycodone include constipation (23%), nausea (23%), vomiting (12%), somnolence (23%), dizziness (13%), itching (13%), dry mouth (6%), and sweating (5%). Less common side effects (experienced by less than 5% of patients) include loss of appetite, nervousness, abdominal pain, diarrhea, urinary retention, dyspnea, and hiccups.
Most side effects generally become less intense over time, although issues related to constipation are likely to continue for the duration of use. Chronic use of this compound and associated constipation issues can become very serious, and have been implicated in life-threatening bowel perforations. A number of specific medications including naloxegol have been developed to address opioid induced constipation.
Oxycodone in combination with naloxone in managed-release tablets has been formulated to both deter abuse and reduce opioid-induced constipation.

### Dependence and withdrawal

The risk of experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms is high if a patient has become physically dependent and discontinues oxycodone abruptly. Medically, when the drug has been taken regularly over an extended period, it is withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. People who regularly use oxycodone recreationally or at higher than prescribed doses are at even higher risk of severe withdrawal symptoms. The symptoms of oxycodone withdrawal, as with other opioids, may include "anxiety, panic attack, nausea, insomnia, muscle pain, muscle weakness, fevers, and other flu-like symptoms".
Withdrawal symptoms have also been reported in newborns whose mothers had been either injecting or orally taking oxycodone during pregnancy.

### Hormone levels

As with other opioids, chronic use of oxycodone (particularly with higher doses) can often cause concurrent hypogonadism (low sex hormone levels).

## Overdose

In high doses, overdoses, or in some persons not tolerant to opioids, oxycodone can cause shallow breathing, slowed heart rate, cold/clammy skin, pauses in breathing, low blood pressure, constricted pupils, circulatory collapse, respiratory arrest, and death.
In 2011, it was the leading cause of drug-related deaths in the U.S. However, from 2012 onwards, heroin and fentanyl have become more common causes of drug-related deaths.

## Interactions

Oxycodone is metabolized by the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Therefore, its clearance can be altered by inhibitors and inducers of these enzymes, increasing and decreasing half-life, respectively. (For lists of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors and inducers, see here and here, respectively.) Natural genetic variation in these enzymes can also influence the clearance of oxycodone, which may be related to the wide inter-individual variability in its half-life and potency.
Ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir greatly increase plasma concentrations of oxycodone in healthy human volunteers due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Rifampicin greatly reduces plasma concentrations of oxycodone due to strong induction of CYP3A4. There is also a case report of fosphenytoin, a CYP3A4 inducer, dramatically reducing the analgesic effects of oxycodone in a chronic pain patient. Dosage or medication adjustments may be necessary in each case.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Oxycodone, a semi-synthetic opioid, is a highly selective full agonist of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR). This is the main biological target of the endogenous opioid neuropeptide β-endorphin. Oxycodone has low affinity for the δ-opioid receptor (DOR) and the κ-opioid receptor (KOR), where it is an agonist similarly. After oxycodone binds to the MOR, a G protein-complex is released, which inhibits the release of neurotransmitters by the cell by decreasing the amount of cAMP produced, closing calcium channels, and opening potassium channels. Opioids like oxycodone are thought to produce their analgesic effects via activation of the MOR in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) and rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). Conversely, they are thought to produce reward and addiction via activation of the MOR in the mesolimbic reward pathway, including in the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, and ventral pallidum. Tolerance to the analgesic and rewarding effects of opioids is complex and occurs due to receptor-level tolerance (e.g., MOR downregulation), cellular-level tolerance (e.g., cAMP upregulation), and system-level tolerance (e.g., neural adaptation due to induction of ΔFosB expression).
Taken orally, 20 mg of immediate-release oxycodone is considered to be equivalent in analgesic effect to 30 mg of morphine, while extended release oxycodone is considered to be twice as potent as oral morphine.
Similarly to most other opioids, oxycodone increases prolactin secretion, but its influence on testosterone levels is unknown. Unlike morphine, oxycodone lacks immunosuppressive activity (measured by natural killer cell activity and interleukin 2 production in vitro); the clinical relevance of this has not been clarified.

#### Active metabolites

A few of the metabolites of oxycodone have also been found to be active as MOR agonists, some of which notably have much higher affinity for (as well as higher efficacy at) the MOR in comparison. Oxymorphone possesses 3- to 5-fold higher affinity for the MOR than does oxycodone, while noroxycodone and noroxymorphone possess one-third of and 3-fold higher affinity for the MOR, respectively, and MOR activation is 5- to 10-fold less with noroxycodone but 2-fold higher with noroxymorphone relative to oxycodone. Noroxycodone, noroxymorphone, and oxymorphone also have longer biological half-lives than oxycodone.

However, despite the greater in vitro activity of some of its metabolites, it has been determined that oxycodone itself is responsible for 83.0% and 94.8% of its analgesic effect following oral and intravenous administration, respectively. Oxymorphone plays only a minor role, being responsible for 15.8% and 4.5% of the analgesic effect of oxycodone after oral and intravenous administration, respectively. Although the CYP2D6 genotype and the route of administration result in differential rates of oxymorphone formation, the unchanged parent compound remains the major contributor to the overall analgesic effect of oxycodone. In contrast to oxycodone and oxymorphone, noroxycodone and noroxymorphone, while also potent MOR agonists, poorly cross the blood–brain barrier into the central nervous system, and for this reason are only minimally analgesic in comparison.

#### κ-opioid receptor

In 1997, a group of Australian researchers proposed (based on a study in rats) that oxycodone acts on KORs, unlike morphine, which acts upon MORs. Further research by this group indicated the drug appears to be a high-affinity κ2b-opioid receptor agonist. However, this conclusion has been disputed, primarily on the basis that oxycodone produces effects that are typical of MOR agonists. In 2006, research by a Japanese group suggested the effect of oxycodone is mediated by different receptors in different situations. Specifically in diabetic mice, the KOR appears to be involved in the antinociceptive effects of oxycodone, while in nondiabetic mice, the μ1-opioid receptor seems to be primarily responsible for these effects.

### Pharmacokinetics

#### Instant-release absorption profiles and Tmax

Oxycodone can be administered orally, intravenously, via intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injection. Along with rectal, sublingual, buccal or intranasal drug delivery. The bioavailability of oral administration of oxycodone averages within a range of 60 to 87%, with rectal administration yielding the same results; Intranasal administration of oxycodone has a bioavailability of ~77%, the same half life as oral oxycodone, along with faster Tmax previously reported as 47% for nasal spray administration due to the solution in the study exceeding the 0.3- to 0.4-mL nasal mucosa limit. Buccal bioavailability ~55%, Tmax ~60 min. Sublingual bioavailability 20% (non alkalized) ~55% (alkalized) Tmax ~60 minutes.
After a dose of conventional (immediate-release) oral oxycodone, the onset of action is 10 to 30 minutes, and peak plasma levels of the drug are attained within roughly 30 to 60 minutes; in contrast, after a dose of OxyContin (an oral controlled-release formulation), peak plasma levels of oxycodone occur in about three hours. Mean serum concentration of controlled-release oxycodone peaks at 78 ng/ml at 1 hour and drops to 20 ng/ml at 8 hours and under 10 ng/ml at 12 hours. The duration of instant-release oxycodone is 3 to 6 hours, although this can be variable depending on the individual.

#### Distribution

Oxycodone has a volume of distribution of 2.6L/kg, in the blood it is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. At equilibrium the unbound concentration in the brain is threefold higher than the unbound concentration in blood. Conventional oral preparations start to reduce pain within 10 to 15 minutes on an empty stomach; in contrast, OxyContin starts to reduce pain within one hour.

#### Metabolism

The metabolism of oxycodone in humans occurs in the liver mainly via the cytochrome P450 system and is extensive (about 95%) and complex, with many minor pathways and resulting metabolites. Around 10% (range 8–14%) of a dose of oxycodone is excreted essentially unchanged (unconjugated or conjugated) in the urine. The major metabolites of oxycodone are noroxycodone (70%), noroxymorphone ("relatively high concentrations"), and oxymorphone (5%). The immediate metabolism of oxycodone in humans is as follows:

N-Demethylation to noroxycodone predominantly via CYP3A4
O-Demethylation to oxymorphone predominantly via CYP2D6
6-Ketoreduction to 6α- and 6β-oxycodol
N-Oxidation to oxycodone-N-oxide
In humans, N-demethylation of oxycodone to noroxycodone by CYP3A4 is the major metabolic pathway, accounting for 45% ± 21% of a dose of oxycodone, while O-demethylation of oxycodone into oxymorphone by CYP2D6 and 6-ketoreduction of oxycodone into 6-oxycodols represent relatively minor metabolic pathways, accounting for 11% ± 6% and 8% ± 6% of a dose of oxycodone, respectively.
Several of the immediate metabolites of oxycodone are subsequently conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted in the urine. 6α-Oxycodol and 6β-oxycodol are further metabolized by N-demethylation to nor-6α-oxycodol and nor-6β-oxycodol, respectively, and by N-oxidation to 6α-oxycodol-N-oxide and 6β-oxycodol-N-oxide (which can subsequently be glucuronidated as well). Oxymorphone is also further metabolized, as follows:

3-Glucuronidation to oxymorphone-3-glucuronide predominantly via UGT2B7
6-Ketoreduction to 6α-oxymorphol and 6β-oxymorphol
N-Demethylation to noroxymorphone
The first pathway of the above three accounts for 40% of the metabolism of oxymorphone, making oxymorphone-3-glucuronide the main metabolite of oxymorphone, while the latter two pathways account for less than 10% of the metabolism of oxymorphone. After N-demethylation of oxymorphone, noroxymorphone is further glucuronidated to noroxymorphone-3-glucuronide.
Because oxycodone is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system in the liver, its pharmacokinetics can be influenced by genetic polymorphisms and drug interactions concerning this system, as well as by liver function. Some people are fast metabolizers of oxycodone, while others are slow metabolizers, resulting in polymorphism-dependent alterations in relative analgesia and toxicity. While higher CYP2D6 activity increases the effects of oxycodone (owing to increased conversion into oxymorphone), higher CYP3A4 activity has the opposite effect and decreases the effects of oxycodone (owing to increased metabolism into noroxycodone and noroxymorphone). The dose of oxycodone must be reduced in patients with reduced liver function.

#### Elimination

The clearance of oxycodone is 0.8 L/min. Oxycodone and its metabolites are mainly excreted in urine. Therefore, oxycodone accumulates in patients with kidney impairment. Oxycodone is eliminated in the urine 10% as unchanged oxycodone, 45% ± 21% as N-demethylated metabolites (noroxycodone, noroxymorphone, noroxycodols), 11 ± 6% as O-demethylated metabolites (oxymorphone, oxymorphols), and 8% ± 6% as 6-keto-reduced metabolites (oxycodols).

#### Duration of action

Oral oxycodone has a half-life of 4.5 hours. The manufacturer of OxyContin (a controlled-release preparation of oxycodone), Purdue Pharma, claimed in its 1992 patent application that the duration of action of OxyContin is 12 hours in "90% of patients". Purdue has never performed any clinical studies in which OxyContin was given at more frequent intervals. In a separate filing, Purdue claimed that controlled-release oxycodone "provides pain relief in said patient for at least 12 hours after administration". However, in 2016, an investigation by the Los Angeles Times found that "the drug wears off hours early in many people", inducing symptoms of opiate withdrawal and intense cravings for OxyContin. One doctor, Lawrence Robbins, told journalists that over 70% of his patients would report that OxyContin would only provide 4–7 hours of relief. Doctors in the 1990s often would switch their patients to a dosing schedule of once every eight hours when patients complained that the duration of action for OxyContin was too short to be taken only twice a day. 
Purdue strongly discouraged the practice: Purdue's medical director Robert Reder wrote to one doctor in 1995 that "OxyContin has been developed for [12-hour] dosing...I request that you not use a [8-hourly] dosing regimen." Purdue repeatedly released memos to its sales representatives ordering them to remind doctors not to deviate from a 12-hour dosing schedule. One such memo read, "There is no Q8 dosing with OxyContin... [8-hour dosing] needs to be nipped in the bud. NOW!!" The journalists who covered the investigation argued that Purdue Pharma has insisted on a 12-hour duration of action for nearly all patients, despite evidence to the contrary, to protect the reputation of OxyContin as a 12-hour drug and the willingness of health insurance and managed care companies to cover OxyContin despite its high cost relative to generic opiates such as morphine.
Purdue sales representatives were instructed to encourage doctors to write prescriptions for larger 12-hour doses instead of more frequent dosing. An August 1996 memo to Purdue sales representatives in Tennessee entitled "\$\$\$\$\$\$\$\$\$\$\$\$\$ It's Bonus Time in the Neighborhood!" reminded the representatives that their commissions would dramatically increase if they were successful in convincing doctors to prescribe larger doses. Los Angeles Times journalists argue using interviews from opioid addiction experts that such high doses of OxyContin spaced 12 hours apart create a combination of agony during opiate withdrawal (lower lows) and a schedule of reinforcement that relieves this agony fostering addiction.
As of 2024, the prescribing information for OxyContin still specifies a controversial 12-hour dosing schedule - which experts say promotes addiction - as the only option; it also still states, "there are no well-controlled clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy with dosing more frequently than every 12 hours."

## Chemistry

Oxycodone's chemical name is derived from codeine. The chemical structures are very similar, differing only in that

Oxycodone has a hydroxy group at carbon-14 (codeine has just a hydrogen in its place)
Oxycodone has a 7,8-dihydro feature. Codeine has a double bond between those two carbons; and
Oxycodone has a carbonyl group (as in ketones) in place of the hydroxyl group of codeine.
It is also similar to hydrocodone, differing only in that it has a hydroxyl group at carbon-14.

### Biosynthesis

In terms of biosynthesis, oxycodone has been found naturally in nectar extracts from the orchid family Epipactis helleborine; together along with another opioid: 3-{2-{3-{3-benzyloxypropyl}-3-indol, 7,8-didehydro- 4,5-epoxy-3,6-d-morphinan.
Thodey et al., 2014 introduce a microbial compound manufacturing system for compounds including oxycodone. The Thodey platform produces both natural and semisynthetic opioids including this one. This system uses Saccharomyces cerevisiae with transgenes from Papaver somniferum (the opium poppy) and Pseudomonas putida to turn a thebaine input into other opiates and opioids.

### Detection in biological fluids

Oxycodone or its major metabolites may be measured in blood or urine to monitor for clearance, non-medical use, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Many commercial opiate screening tests cross-react appreciably with oxycodone and its metabolites, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish oxycodone from other opiates.

## History

Martin Freund and (Jakob) Edmund Speyer of the University of Frankfurt in Germany published the first synthesis of oxycodone from thebaine in 1916. When Freund died, in 1920, Speyer wrote his obituary for the German Chemical Society. Speyer, born to a Jewish family in Frankfurt am Main in 1878, became a victim of the Holocaust. He died on 5 May 1942, the second day of deportations from the Lodz Ghetto; his death was noted in the ghetto's chronicle.
The first clinical use of the drug was documented in 1917, the year after it was first developed. It was first introduced to the U.S. market in May 1939. In early 1928, Merck introduced a combination product containing scopolamine, oxycodone, and ephedrine under the German initials for the ingredients SEE, which was later renamed Scophedal (SCOpolamine, ePHEDrine, and eukodAL) in 1942. It was last manufactured in 1987 but can be compounded. This combination is essentially an oxycodone analogue of the morphine-based "twilight sleep", with ephedrine added to reduce circulatory and respiratory effects. The drug became known as the "Miracle Drug of the 1930s" in Continental Europe and elsewhere and it was the Wehrmacht's choice for a battlefield analgesic for a time. The drug was expressly designed to provide what the patent application and package insert referred to as "very deep analgesia and profound and intense euphoria" as well as tranquillisation and anterograde amnesia useful for surgery and battlefield wounding cases. Oxycodone was allegedly chosen over other common opiates for this product because it had been shown to produce less sedation at equianalgesic doses compared to morphine, hydromorphone (Dilaudid), and hydrocodone (Dicodid).
During Operation Himmler, Skophedal was also reportedly injected in massive overdose into the prisoners dressed in Polish Army uniforms in the staged incident on 1 September 1939 which opened the Second World War.
The personal notes of Adolf Hitler's physician, Theodor Morell, indicate Hitler received repeated injections of "Eukodal" (oxycodone; produced by Merck) and Scophedal, as well as Dolantin (pethidine), codeine, and morphine less frequently; oxycodone could not be obtained after late January 1945.
In the United States, the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) was passed by the United States Congress and signed into law by President Richard Nixon on 27 October 1970. The passing of the CSA resulted in all products containing oxycodone being classified as a Schedule II controlled substance.
In the early 1990s, Purdue Pharma, a privately held company based in Stamford, Connecticut, developed a controlled-release version of oxycodone: the prescription painkiller OxyContin ("contin" being short for "continuous", reflecting a longer duration of pain relief). It was approved by the FDA in 1995 after no long-term studies and no assessment of its addictive capabilities. David Kessler, the FDA commissioner at the time, later said of the approval of OxyContin: "No doubt it was a mistake. It was certainly one of the worst medical mistakes, a major mistake." Upon its release in 1995, OxyContin was hailed as a medical breakthrough, a long-lasting narcotic that could help patients with moderate to severe pain. The drug became a blockbuster and has reportedly generated some US\$35 billion in revenue for Purdue.

## Society and culture

### Opioid epidemic

Oxycodone, like other opioid analgesics, tends to induce feelings of euphoria, relaxation, and reduced anxiety in those who are occasional users. The abuse of Oxycodone, as well as related opioids more broadly, is not unique to the United States and it is a common drug of abuse globally.

#### United States

Oxycodone is the most widely recreationally used opioid in America. In the United States, more than 12 million people use opioid drugs recreationally. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates that about 11 million people in the U.S. consume oxycodone in a non-medical way annually.
Opioids were responsible for 49,000 of the 72,000 drug overdose deaths in the U.S. in 2017. In 2007, about 42,800 emergency room visits occurred due to "episodes" involving oxycodone. In 2008, recreational use of oxycodone and hydrocodone was involved in 14,800 deaths. Some of the cases were due to overdoses of the acetaminophen component, resulting in fatal liver damage.
In September 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released updated labeling guidelines for long-acting and extended-release opioids requiring manufacturers to remove moderate pain as an indication for use, instead stating the drug is for "pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long term opioid treatment". The updated labeling does not restrict physicians from prescribing opioids for moderate pain, as needed.
Reformulated OxyContin is causing some recreational users to change to heroin, which is cheaper and easier to obtain.

##### Lawsuits

In October 2017, The New Yorker published a story on Mortimer Sackler and Purdue Pharma regarding their ties to the production and manipulation of the oxycodone markets. The article links Raymond and Arthur Sackler's business practices with the rise of direct pharmaceutical marketing and eventually to the rise of addiction to oxycodone in the United States. The article implies that the Sackler family bears some responsibility for the opioid epidemic in the United States. In 2019, The New York Times ran a piece confirming that Richard Sackler, the son of Raymond Sackler, told company officials in 2008 to "measure our performance by Rx's by strength, giving higher measures to higher strengths". This was verified with documents tied to a lawsuit – which was filed by the Massachusetts attorney general, Maura Healey – claiming that Purdue Pharma and members of the Sackler family knew that high doses of OxyContin over long periods would increase the risk of serious side effects, including addiction. Despite Purdue Pharma's proposal for a US\$12 billion settlement of the lawsuit, the attorneys general of 23 states, including Massachusetts, rejected the settlement offer in September 2019.

#### Australia

The non-medical use of oxycodone existed since the early 1970s, but by 2015, 91% of a national sample of injecting drug users in Australia had reported using oxycodone, and 27% had injected it in the last six months.

#### Canada

Opioid-related deaths in Ontario had increased by 242% from 1969 to 2014. By 2009 in Ontario there were more deaths from oxycodone overdoses than from cocaine overdoses. Deaths from opioid pain relievers had increased from 13.7 deaths per million residents in 1991 to 27.2 deaths per million residents in 2004. The non-medical use of oxycodone in Canada became a problem. Areas where oxycodone is most problematic are Atlantic Canada and Ontario, where its non-medical use is prevalent in rural towns and in many smaller to medium-sized cities. Oxycodone is also widely available across Western Canada, but methamphetamine and heroin are more serious problems in larger cities, while oxycodone is more common in rural towns. Oxycodone is diverted through doctor shopping, prescription forgery, pharmacy theft, and overprescription.
The recent formulations of oxycodone, particularly Purdue Pharma's crush-, chew-, injection- and dissolve-resistant OxyNEO which replaced the banned OxyContin product in Canada in early 2012, have led to a decline in the recreational use of this opiate but have increased the recreational use of the more potent drug fentanyl. According to a Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse study quoted in Maclean's magazine, there were at least 655 fentanyl-related deaths in Canada in five years.
In Alberta, the Blood Tribe police claimed that from the fall of 2014 through January 2015, oxycodone pills or a lethal fake variation referred to as Oxy 80s containing fentanyl made in illegal labs by members of organized crime were responsible for ten deaths on the Blood Reserve, which is located southwest of Lethbridge, Alberta. Province-wide, approximately 120 Albertans died from fentanyl-related overdoses in 2014.

#### United Kingdom

Prescriptions of Oxycodone rose in Scotland by 430% between 2002 and 2008, prompting fears of usage problems that would mirror those of the United States. The first known death due to overdose in the UK occurred in 2002.

#### Preventive measures

In August 2010, Purdue Pharma reformulated their long-acting oxycodone line, marketed as OxyContin, using a polymer, Intac, to make the pills more difficult to crush or dissolve in water to reduce non-medical use of OxyContin. Inactive ingredients/excipients are butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), hypromellose, polyethylene glycol 400, polyethylene oxide, magnesium stearate, and titanium dioxide. The FDA approved relabeling the reformulated version as abuse-resistant in April 2013.
Pfizer manufactures a preparation of short-acting oxycodone, marketed as Oxecta, which contains inactive ingredients, referred to as tamper-resistant Aversion Technology. Approved by the FDA in the U.S. in June 2011, the new formulation, while not being able to deter oral recreational use, makes crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the opioid impractical because of a change in its chemical properties.

### Legal status

Oxycodone is subject to international conventions on narcotic drugs. In addition, oxycodone is subject to national laws that differ by country. The 1931 Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs of the League of Nations included oxycodone. The 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of the United Nations, which replaced the 1931 convention, categorized oxycodone in Schedule I. Global restrictions on Schedule I drugs include "limit[ing] exclusively to medical and scientific purposes the production, manufacture, export, import, distribution of, trade in, use and possession of" these drugs; "requir[ing] medical prescriptions for the supply or dispensation of [these] drugs to individuals"; and "prevent[ing] the accumulation" of quantities of these drugs "in excess of those required for the normal conduct of business".

#### Australia

Oxycodone is in Schedule I (derived from the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs) of the Commonwealth's Narcotic Drugs Act 1967. In addition, it is in Schedule 8 of the Australian Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons ("Poisons Standard"), meaning it is a "controlled drug... which should be available for use but require[s] restriction of manufacture, supply, distribution, possession and use to reduce abuse, misuse and physical or psychological dependence".

#### Canada

Oxycodone is a controlled substance under Schedule I of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA).

In February 2012, Ontario passed legislation to allow the expansion of an already existing drug-tracking system for publicly funded drugs to include those that are privately insured. This database will function to identify and monitor patient's attempts to seek prescriptions from multiple doctors or retrieve them from multiple pharmacies. Other provinces have proposed similar legislation, while some, such as Nova Scotia, have legislation already in effect for monitoring prescription drug use. These changes have coincided with other changes in Ontario's legislation to target the misuse of painkillers and high addiction rates to drugs such as oxycodone. As of 29 February 2012, Ontario passed legislation delisting oxycodone from the province's public drug benefit program. This was a first for any province to delist a drug based on addictive properties. The new law prohibits prescriptions for OxyNeo except to certain patients under the Exceptional Access Program including palliative care and in other extenuating circumstances. Patients already prescribed oxycodone will receive coverage for an additional year for OxyNeo, and after that, it will be disallowed unless designated under the exceptional access program.
Much of the legislative activity has stemmed from Purdue Pharma's decision in 2011 to begin a modification of OxyContin's composition to make it more difficult to crush for snorting or injecting. The new formulation, OxyNeo, is intended to be preventive in this regard and retain its effectiveness as a painkiller. Since introducing its Narcotics Safety and Awareness Act, Ontario has committed to focusing on drug addiction, particularly in the monitoring and identification of problem opioid prescriptions, as well as the education of patients, doctors, and pharmacists. This Act, introduced in 2010, commits to the establishment of a unified database to fulfil this intention. Both the public and medical community have received the legislation positively, though concerns about the ramifications of legal changes have been expressed. Because laws are largely provincially regulated, many speculate a national strategy is needed to prevent smuggling across provincial borders from jurisdictions with looser restrictions.
In 2015, Purdue Pharma's abuse-resistant OxyNEO and six generic versions of OxyContin had been on the Canada-wide approved list for prescriptions since 2012. In June 2015, then-federal Minister of Health Rona Ambrose announced that within three years, all oxycodone products sold in Canada would need to be tamper-resistant. Some experts warned that the generic product manufacturers may not have the technology to achieve that goal, possibly giving Purdue Pharma a monopoly on this opiate.
Several class-action suits across Canada have been launched against the Purdue group of companies and affiliates. Claimants argue the pharmaceutical manufacturers did not meet a standard of care and were negligent in doing so. These lawsuits reference earlier judgments in the United States, which held that Purdue was liable for wrongful marketing practices and misbranding. Since 2007, the Purdue companies have paid over CAN\$650 million in settling litigation or facing criminal fines.

#### Germany

The drug is in Appendix III of the Narcotics Act (Betäubungsmittelgesetz or BtMG). The law allows only physicians, dentists, and veterinarians to prescribe oxycodone and the federal government to regulate the prescriptions (e.g., by requiring reporting).

#### Hong Kong

Oxycodone is regulated under Part I of Schedule 1 of Hong Kong's Chapter 134 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

#### Japan

Oxycodone is a restricted drug in Japan. Its import and export are strictly restricted to specially designated organizations having a prior permit to import it. In a high-profile case an American who was a top Toyota executive living in Tokyo, who claimed to be unaware of the law, was arrested for importing oxycodone into Japan.

#### Singapore

Oxycodone is listed as a Class A drug in the Misuse of Drugs Act of Singapore, which means offences concerning the drug attract the most severe level of punishment. A conviction for unauthorized manufacture of the drug attracts a minimum sentence of 10 years of imprisonment and corporal punishment of 5 strokes of the cane, and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment or 30 years of imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. The minimum and maximum penalties for unauthorized trafficking in the drug are respectively 5 years of imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane, and 20 years of imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.

#### United Kingdom

Oxycodone is a Class A drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. For Class A drugs, which are "considered to be the most likely to cause harm", possession without a prescription is punishable by up to seven years in prison, an unlimited fine, or both. Dealing of the drug illegally is punishable by up to life imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both. Oxycodone is a Schedule 2 drug under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 which "provide certain exemptions from the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971".

#### United States

Under the Controlled Substances Act, oxycodone is a Schedule II controlled substance whether by itself or part of a multi-ingredient medication. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) lists oxycodone both for sale and for use in manufacturing other opioids as ACSCN 9143 and in 2013 approved the following annual aggregate manufacturing quotas: 131.5 metric tons for sale, down from 153.75 in 2012, and 10.25 metric tons for conversion, unchanged from the previous year. In 2020, oxycodone possession was decriminalized in the U.S. state of Oregon.

### Economics

The International Narcotics Control Board estimated 11.5 short tons (10.4 t) of oxycodone were manufactured worldwide in 1998; by 2007 this figure had grown to 75.2 short tons (68.2 t). United States accounted for 82% of consumption in 2007 at 51.6 short tons (46.8 t). Canada, Germany, Australia, and France combined accounted for 13% of consumption in 2007. In 2010, 1.3 short tons (1.2 t) of oxycodone were illegally manufactured using a fake pill imprint. This accounted for 0.8% of consumption. These illicit tablets were later seized by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, according to the International Narcotics Control Board. The board also reported 122.5 short tons (111.1 t) manufactured in 2010. This number had decreased from a record high of 135.9 short tons (123.3 t) in 2009.

### Names

Expanded expressions for the compound oxycodone in the academic literature include "dihydrohydroxycodeinone", "Eucodal", "Eukodal", "14-hydroxydihydrocodeinone", and "Nucodan". In a UNESCO convention, the translations of "oxycodone" are oxycodon (Dutch), oxycodone (French), oxicodona (Spanish), الأوكسيكودون‎ (Arabic), 羟考酮 (Chinese), and оксикодон (Russian).
The word "oxycodone" should not be confused with "oxandrolone", "oxazepam", "oxybutynin", "oxytocin", or "Roxanol".
Other brand names include Longtec and Shortec.
