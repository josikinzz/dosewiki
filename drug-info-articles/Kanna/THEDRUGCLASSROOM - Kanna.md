Kanna (Sceletium tortuosum) is a plant that’s been used in South Africa for hundreds of years. It contains substances (e.g. Mesembrine and Mesembrenone) which offer depressant and anxiolytic effects. The drug also seems to enhance the effects of cannabis, particularly its euphoria.

Anxiolytic and stress-reducing effects are seen with Kanna. And, it may improve cognitive performance, particularly in those who have anxiety or stress issues.

The effects primarily come from SRI (serotonin reuptake inhibition) and PDE4 inhibition actions.

Common doses have not been connected to any clear negative effects, at least in the short-term. It appears relatively safe when normal amounts are used.
