## SYNTHESIS
A suspension of 4.0 g LAH in 150 mL anhydrous THF under N2 was cooled to 0 Â°C and vigorously stirred. There was added, dropwise, 2.8 mL 100% H2SO4, followed by 5.5 g 3,5-dimethoxy-4-allyloxyphenylacetonitrile in 10 mL anhydrous THF. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0 Â°C for a few min, then brought to a reflux on the steam bath for 30 min. After cooling back to room temperature, there was added sufficient IPA to destroy the excess hydride, followed by sufficient 10% NaOH to form granular solids. These were removed by filtration, and washed with 20 mL IPA. The filtrate and washes were stripped of solvent under vacuum andthe residue added to 100 mL dilute H2SO4. This was washed with 2Ã50 mL CH2Cl2, made basic with aqueous NaOH, and extracted with 2Ã75 mL CH2Cl2. These extracts were pooled, the solvent removed under vacuum, and the residue distilled at 110â120 Â°C at 0.4 mm/Hg to give 4.9 g of a colorless oil. This was dissolved in 15 mL IPA, neutralized with concentrated HCl (55 drops required), and diluted with 50 mL Et2O. The product was removed by filtration, washed with Et2O, and air dried to give 4.9 g of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-allyloxyphenethylamine hydrochloride (AL) as white crystals.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 24 mg) âThe onset was extremely gradual and graceful, with the first alert that one could really sense at about 50 minutes. This was succeeded by a slow gentle climb to the peak at one hour and fifteen minutes. The experience itself left all of the sensory modalities functional; speech was cogent and rather fluid. In fact, there was an unusual ease of free association. All throughout the session, the talk was high in spirits and somehow indicative of an inner excitement. Affect was entirely pleasant, but not exalting nor conducive to insight or to problem solving. There were no requirements for withdrawal into the self. The material seemed wholly social in nature. No visual, auditory or olfactory sharpening was in evidence. The plateau for this material seemed unusually long. I was unable to sleep for several hours, and took 25 mg Librium before sleep arrived. The next day was a lethargic and slow one, with the inner feeling that the effects had not worn off until the middle of the day following ingestion.â

(with 35 mg) âI was a distinct +1 in 35 minutes and a +2 by the end of the hour. My head congestion in no way cleared up, absolving the material from having that particular virtue. The entire experience was somewhat dissociatedâI could not connect with my feelings. Although my mind remained clear, there was a hangover feeling at the end of the experiment.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
As AL is one of the most potent 3,4,5-trisubstituted phenethylamines yet described, and since the corresponding amphetamines are of yet greater potency, it would be a good guess that 4-allyloxy-3,5-dimethoxyamphetamine (3C-AL) would be an interesting compound to explore. It could be made from syringaldehyde in reaction with allyl iodide, followed by the formation of a nitrostyrene with nitroethane, followed by reduction with aluminum hydride. It is, as of the present time, both unsynthesized and unexplored.
