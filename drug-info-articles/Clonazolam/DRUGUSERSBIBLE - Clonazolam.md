## Subjective Experience

I became aware that this was one of the big hitters courtesy of forum reports.
Notably, blackouts were reported here and there, and addiction was cited all too
frequently. Accordingly, its fear-factor was set on high, and my foray was always
going to be ultra-cautious, and a one-off.

I struggle to report more detail largely because it delivered more or less what I was
expecting. This, specifically, was sedation and sleep. The following day wasn’t
particularly foggy, as I recall.

At time of writing I still have a couple of the little yellow capsules sitting in my
drawer of goodies, but as with most benzos, I haven’t been particularly motivated to
dip into them again.

I suggest that this is one to use only in exceptional circumstances.
