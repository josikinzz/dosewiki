## Subjective Experience

This compound is memorable largely because it represents the most glaring mistake
I have ever made with respect to dosing. Given the advice I provide throughout this
book regarding this issue, I cannot possibly account for the error. It was a mental
aberration, and I was fortunate that it occurred with a relatively benign drug.

The dose I was aiming for was 10mg, hoping for a light and relatively short
psychedelic buzz. I went ahead and measured 0.1 on the scales. Yes, this was 100mg;
or 10x my intended dose.

Once it was down the hatch I realized what I had done but it was too late. I made
efforts to vomit, even drinking salty water, but to no avail. The panic which ensued
was far from pleasant, but the onset of the drug itself took the edge away, and I
manoeuvred my way through it, consuming copious amounts of water, and eating
like a pig.

The trip itself was far from remarkable. It comprised largely a light psychedelic
headspace, accompanied by body tingles and perhaps some sedation. There was no
significant come-down or hangover; just a lesson never to repeat the same mistake.

*TiHKAL Entry #56*


## SYNTHESIS
The solids that remained after the above decantation and ether washing were thoroughly ground up under 10 mL methylene chloride and removed by filtration to give 2.73 g of fine white crystals of 5-methoxy-N,N,N-triallyltryptammonium iodide. The infra-red spectrum contained the following major peaks (cm-1): 818, 860, 952, 998, 1085, 1188. To a solution of 1.1 g phenyl mercaptan (10 mM) in 20 mL acetone there was added 0.4 g 50% W/W aqueous NaOH followed by 2.2 g of this quaternary salt, and the mixture was held at reflux on the steam-bath for 18 h. After removal of the volatiles on the rotary evaporator, the residue brown solids were suspended in 75 mL water which was made acidic by the addition of aqueous HCl. This was washed with 3Ã40 mL methylene chloride (the washings were saved), made basic with 5% aqueous NaOH and extracted with 3Ã40 mL methylene chloride. The combined extracts were stripped of solvent on the rotary evaporator yielding .12 g of crude 5-MeO-DALT as a light brown oil that crystallized. The methylene chloride washings (saved above) was extracted with dilute H2SO4 (leaving the diphenyldisulfide reaction product in the organic phase), made basic, extracted with methylene chloride which, on being stripped of solvents on the rotary evaporator, yielded an additional 0.37 g additional crude 5-MeO-DALT. These two lots were combined and distilled at the KugelRohr to give 0.32 g of a fraction boiling at 155â165 Â°C at 20 microns. This was converted to the hydrochloride salt as described above, yielding 0.30 g of 5-MeO-DALT HCl. GCMS analysis showed this the be 95% pure with a 5% contamination with the mono-deallylated base 5-MeO-NALT. The fragmentation pattern of this base (m/z) was: 70 (allylaminomethylene, 50%), 160, 161 (5-methoxyindolemethylene, 40%, 100%), 230 (parent, 10%).


## DOSAGE

## DURATION
(with 16 mg orally) âThe music was fabulous, as was the sex and neither of us had a problem with orgasm. But there was a total lack of imageryâless than I would normally have to the music when unstoned, so there might have been an actual suppression. I was pretty much baseline by the third hour.â

(with 20 mg orally) âItâs coming on strongly in 15 minutes, and at the half hour point I am at a +++ with eyes closedâbut nothing with them open! No hang-over.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
There are a number of modifications of the two double bonds on there on the nitrogen alkyl groups that would be interesting to explore. If they were changed from double bonds to triple bonds, one would have 5-methoxy-N,N-dipropargyltryptamine, or 5-MeO-DPRT. I have made a little bit of it but it was quite impure and difficult to clean up. The complexity of the GCMS patterns suggested that there might be some chemistry going on between the two propargyl groups.

Another direction possible for modifying the structure would be to relocate the oxygen in indole ring over to the 4-position. 4-Methoxytryptamine is commercially available, and it should be directly substitutable for the 5-methoxytryptamine used in this synthetic process giving rise to 4-MeO-DALT. Yet further out, what about starting the 4-benzyloxytryptamine and walking the same path? The product could be easily stripped of the benzyl ether by the usual catalytic hydrogenation, giving rise to the diallyl analogue of psilocin, 4-HO-DALT. I would wager a ten dollar bet that the acetate ester of this material, 4-AcO-DALT would be in the brain within minutes of swallowing the pill.

There are a lot of interesting extensions, but all of them would call for careful chemistry. And, of course, the essential care of tasting new things in very small increasing doses. Some of these could be extremely potent.

**N,N-Diallyl-5-methoxytryptamine** (also known as **5-MeO-DALT** or colloquially as **Foxtrot** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class that produces short-lived psychedelic effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Administered) . It is structurally related to tryptamines like [5-MeO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DiPT) and [DALT](/w/index.php?title=DALT&action=edit&redlink=1) , although it is reported to produce distinct effects.

5-MeO-DALT was first synthesized by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) , who sent the first material regarding the synthesis and effects to a researcher in May 2004. This material was subsequently circulated online and the compound soon appeared on the online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market. In August 2004, the synthesis and effects of 5-MeO-DALT were officially published by Erowid. Reports linked to the detection of 5-MeO-DALT began to surface in 2007.

Anecdotal reports characterize the effects of this substance as being primarily physical in nature, lacking the characteristic visual distortions or perceptual depth of most psychedelics. Its headspace has been described as "shallow," albeit suited for sexual contexts due to its potent stimulating and libidinous effects. It is also reported to produce more uncomfortable cardiovascular effects such as [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) and [heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) relative to other psychedelics. This has raised questions about possible toxicity associated with long-term or heavy uses.

Very limited data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 5-MeO-DALT, and it has a very short history of human use. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

The full name of the chemical is *N* -allyl- *N* -[2-(5-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl] prop-2-en-1- amine. It is related to the compounds 5-MeO-DPT and DALT (N,N-Diallyltryptamine).

5-MeO-DALT is named for its chemical structure 5-MethOxy-DiALlylTryptamine. It contains two allyl groups bound to the amino group and a 5-methoxy group bound to the indole ring of tryptamine. It is a structural analog of [DALT](/w/index.php?title=DALT&action=edit&redlink=1) and [5-MeO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DiPT) . 5-MeO-DALT is an off-white powder at room temperature.

## Pharmacology

5-MeO-DALT binds to 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 1D , 5-HT 1E , 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 2C , 5-HT 6 , α 2A , α 2B , α 2C , H 1 , κ-opioid, σ 1 and σ 2 receptors with K i values lower than 10μM and also acts as a DAT and SERT monoamine reuptake inhibitor.

5-MeO-DALT acts as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_System) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . The [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptors. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience remains the subject of ongoing scientific investigation.

5-MeO-DALT has been used as an intermediate in the preparation of radiolabeled diethyltryptamine.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)**
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of 5-MeO-DALT can be described as a motionless, constant, sharp and all-encompassing tingling sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the come up and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.

#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry that is present throughout the experience can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [AMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/AMT) than that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) . It can be comprehensively described as unstructured in its organization, synthetic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, small in size, slow and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, equally blurred and sharp in its edges and equally rounded and angular in its corners. It possesses a synthetic feel that is less impressive than most of the "classical" psychedelics at any level. It has yet to be confirmed whether this compound results in either [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) or [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) geometry at heavy doses. ### Cognitive effects

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 5-MeO-DALT use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 5-MeO-DALT is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal reports from those who have tried 5-MeO-DALT suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

5-MeO-DALT is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 5-MeO-DALT is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 5-MeO-DALT presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 5-MeO-DALT all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **2C-T-X** - Both classes of compounds can be unpredictable alone.
- **2C-X** - The 5-MeO psychedelics can interact unpredictably to potentiate other psychedelics.
- **Cannabis** - May increase the risk of negative psychological effects such as [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **DOx** - The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions, particularly increasing the risk of unpleasant physical side effects.
- **MDMA** - Some of the 5-MeO tryptamines are a bit unpredictable and should be mixed with MDMA with care.
- **Mescaline** - The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions.
- **NBOMe** - The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions and the NBOMes are known to be unpredictable even alone. This combination is best avoided.
- **Amphetamines** - The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants increase the chance of unpleasant thought loops. The combination is generally unnecessary because of the stimulating effects of psychedelics.
- **Cocaine** - The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants increase the chance of unpleasant thought loops. The combination is generally unnecessary because of the stimulating effects of psychedelics.
- **DXM** - Little information exists about this combination.
- **Tramadol** - Increased risk of [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .
- **aMT** - Increased risk of [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .
- **MAOIs** - Increased risk of [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .
- **PCP** - Little information exists about this combination. May increase risk of psychosis and excessive stimulation.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-MeO-DALT*

5-MeO-DALT, also known as N,N-diallyl-5-methoxytryptamine or as foxtrot, is a psychedelic drug of the tryptamine and 5-methoxytryptamine families. It is taken orally.
5-MeO-DALT was first synthesized and described by Alexander Shulgin, who disclosed the compound in 2004. It has been encountered as a novel designer and recreational drug.

## Use and effects

According to Alexander Shulgin in a follow-up entry to his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved), the dose of 5-MeO-DALT is 12 to 20 mg orally and its duration is 2 to 4 hours. A wider dose range of 12 to 25 mg has also been reported. It is said to onset and peak remarkably quickly via the oral route, with an onset of less than 15 minutes and a time to peak of 30 minutes. The effects of 5-MeO-DALT were reported by Shulgin to include positive emotional changes, lightheadedness, increased appreciation of music and sex, and closed-eye visuals. There was said to be a lack of open-eye visuals and it was said to be relatively light in psychedelic character.

## Overdose

There is little published literature on the toxicity of 5-MeO-DALT. Case reports of overdose have been published, with effects including loss of consciousness, visual hallucinations, acute delirium, and rhabdomyolysis, among others. A death related to behavioral intoxication has been reported.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

The interactions of 5-MeO-DALT with various targets have been reported. It binds to a variety of serotonin receptors, as well as a number of other targets. The drug is a potent full agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors. It is also an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors.
Similarly to other psychedelics, 5-MeO-DALT produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic-like effects, in rodents. The drug fully substitutes for the serotonergic psychedelic DOM in rodent drug discrimination tests. Conversely, 5-MeO-DALT does not substitute for the entactogen MDMA in such tests. 5-MeO-DALT produces dose-dependent hyperlocomotion in rodents, followed by hypolocomotion at the highest assessed dose. This is in contrast to many other psychedelic tryptamines, which tend to produce only hypolocomotion. 5-MeO-DMT and 5-MeO-AMT are locomotor depressants, whereas 5-MeO-DET and 5-MeO-MiPT are mixed locomotor stimulants/depressants similarly to 5-MeO-DALT. It also produces hypothermia.
The head-twitch response induced by 5-MeO-DALT in rodents was found to be positively related to its serotonin 5-HT2A receptor affinity and negatively related to its serotonin 5-HT1A receptor affinity. In relation to this, multiple targets appear to contribute to the effects of 5-MeO-DALT.

### Pharmacokinetics

## History

The first material regarding the synthesis and effects of 5-MeO-DALT was sent from Alexander Shulgin to a research associate named Murple in May 2004, after which it was circulated online. In June 2004 5-MeO-DALT became available from internet research chemical vendors after being synthesized by commercial laboratories in China. In August 2004 the synthesis and effects of 5-MeO-DALT were published by Erowid. Shulgin has stated that 5-MeO-DALT had not previously existed in the scientific literature. 5-MeO-DALT was not included in the original published version of TiHKAL, but an entry for the compound was subsequently written and released in 2004.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### China

As of October 2015 5-MeO-DALT is a controlled substance in China.

#### Japan

5-MeO-DALT became a controlled substance in Japan from April 2007, by amendment to the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law.

#### Singapore

5-MeO-DALT is listed in the Fifth Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) and therefore illegal in Singapore as of May 2015.

#### Sweden

Sveriges riksdag added 5-MeO-DALT to schedule I ("substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use") as narcotics in Sweden as of May 1, 2012, published by Medical Products Agency in their regulation LVFS 2012:6 listed as 5-MeO-DALT N-allyl-N-[2-(5-metoxi-1H-indol-3-yl)etyl]-prop-2-en-1-amin.

#### United Kingdom

5-MeO-DALT became a Class A drug in the UK on January 7, 2015 after an update to the tryptamine blanket ban.

#### United States

5-MeO-DALT is not scheduled at the federal level in the United States, but it is likely that it could be considered an analog of 5-Meo-DiPT, which is a controlled substance in USA, or an analog of another tryptamine, in which case purchase, sale, or possession could be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act.

##### Florida

5-MeO-DALT is a Schedule I controlled substance in the state of Florida making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess in Florida.

##### Louisiana

5-MeO-DALT is a Schedule I controlled substance in the state of Louisiana making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess in Louisiana.

## Research

### Cluster headache

Anecdotal reports and a small-scale trial indicate the potential of 5-MeO-DALT for the treatment of cluster headache, one of the most excruciating conditions known to medicine. These observations are consistent with evidence of efficacy of other chemically-related indoleamines in the treatment of cluster headache.
