# Eszopiclone
*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00402*

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cyclopyrrolones. These are compounds belonging to a family of pyridin-2-ylpyrrole based chemicals. The pyrrole is usually fused to a benzene, pyrimidine, or dithiin.

### Background

Eszopiclone, marketed by Sepracor under the brand-name Lunesta, is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drug used to treat insomnia. It is the active stereoisomer of zopiclone, belonging to the class of drugs known as
cyclopyrrolones
.
1
,
12
Cyclopyrrolone drugs demonstrate high efficacy and low toxicity
9
, offering a safer alternative to other drugs used for insomnia.
One major benefit of eszopiclone is that it is approved by the FDA for the long-term treatment of insomnia. This sets it apart from many other hypnotic sedatives, which are generally approved only for the relief of short-term (6-8 weeks) insomnia. Eszopiclone was initially approved by the FDA in 2004.
10

### Indication

Eszopiclone is indicated for the treatment of insomnia.
10

### Pharmacodynamics

Eszopiclone rapidly induces sleep and decreases sleep latency. It also aids in the maintenance of sleep, preventing frequent awakenings.
3
,
4
,
10
This drug has shown anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant properties in animals but is used in humans for its sedating effects.
9
Eszopiclone is a central nervous system depressant with various effects. These include changes in alertness and motor coordination and the risk of next morning impairment, increasing with the amount of eszopiclone administered.  Exercise caution and advise against driving a motor vehicle or activities that require full mental alertness the next morning.
10
Complex sleep behaviors may result from eszopiclone use. Eszopiclone should be discontinued in these cases.
15
Avoid the use of alcohol and other CNS depressants when eszopiclone is administered. Advise patients to skip the eszopiclone dose if alcohol has been consumed before bed or during the evening. Use the smallest dose of eszopiclone as possible, especially in elderly patients, who may experience exaggerated drug effects. Though the potential for dependence and abuse with eszopiclone is lower than for other hypnotic drugs, this drug has been abused and is known to cause dependence.
14

### Mechanism of Action

Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-1
Modulator
GABA(A) Receptor
Positive allosteric modulator

### Absorption

Eszopiclone is rapidly absorbed and the peak concentration is reached within about 1 hour after oral administration.
3
,
10
The mean AUC after a 3 mg dose of eszopiclone was 278 ng/mL × h.
1
The consumption of a high-fat has been shown to slow absorption.  Steady-state concentrations of eszopiclone are reached within 24-48 hours.
4

### Metabolism

Following oral administration, eszopiclone is extensively biotransformed and the major metabolites are S-desmethylzopiclone and zopiclone-N-oxide, which are largely inactive.
2
. The enzymes involved in the metabolism of eszopiclone are CYP3A (the primary metabolizing enzyme), CYP2C8, and CYP2E1.
2
The N-oxide derivative shows weak pharmacological activity in animals. The N-desmethyl metabolite is pharmacologically active.

### Half-life

The half-life is 6.1 hours in healthy patients but is prolonged in various patients, including those with hepatic impairment, elderly patients, in addition to those taking CYP3A enzyme inhibiting drugs.
1
,
10

### Toxicity

The oral LD50 of eszopiclone in rats is 980 mg/kg and 3200 mg/kg in rabbits.
13
Symptoms of overdose may include mental status changes and somnolence, demonstrating general exaggeration of the drug's pharmacological effects. Perform gastric lavage and offer supportive treatment if an overdose is suspected, including intravenous fluids as required. Flumazenil may be used. Vital signs should be closely monitored in addition to patient symptoms. Appropriate medical interventions should be employed. The possibility of an overdose with multiple drugs should be considered. Ensure to contact the local poison control center for the most updated management of hypnotic drug overdose.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when 1,2-Benzodiazepine is combined with Eszopiclone.
Abacavir
Eszopiclone may decrease the excretion rate of Abacavir which could result in a higher serum level.
Abametapir
The serum concentration of Eszopiclone can be increased when it is combined with Abametapir.
Abatacept
The metabolism of Eszopiclone can be increased when combined with Abatacept.
Abiraterone
The metabolism of Eszopiclone can be decreased when combined with Abiraterone.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol.
Do not take with or immediately after a high-fat meal. This decreases the absorption of eszopiclone.

### Mechanism of action

The exact mechanism of action of eszopiclone is unknown at this time but is thought to occur via binding with the GABA receptor complexes at binding sites located near benzodiazepine receptors, possibly explaining its hypnotic and sedative effects.
3
,
10
It has particular affinity for GABA-A (or GABAA) receptor subunits 1, 3 and 5.
5
,
6
,
7
Eszopiclone increases GABA-A channel currents significantly.
5
GABA-A channels are major inhibitory channels that cause CNS depression when their receptors are activated.

### Volume of distribution

The volume of distribution of eszopiclone is estimated at 89.9L
11

### Protein binding

This drug is 52-59% bound to plasma proteins.
10

### Route of elimination

Only about 10% of an eszopiclone dose is found excreted in the urine as the parent drug.
3
,
10
As much as 75% of an orally administered dose of racemic zopiclone as is found to be excreted in the urine in the form of metabolites.  Eszopiclone, the S-isomer of racemic zopiclone, would likely show the same excretion pattern.
10

### Clearance

The mean clearance of eszopiclone in young, healthy volunteers was 184 mL/min in one pharmacokinetic study.

### General Function

A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of various endogenous substrates, including fatty acids, steroid hormones and vitamins (PubMed:11093772, PubMed:14559847, PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:7574697). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:11093772, PubMed:14559847, PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:7574697). Primarily catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) with a preference for the last double bond (PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:7574697). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Metabolizes all trans-retinoic acid toward its 4-hydroxylated form (PubMed:11093772). Displays 16-alpha hydroxylase activity toward estrogen steroid hormones, 17beta-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) (PubMed:14559847). Plays a role in the oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics. It is the principal enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel (taxol) (PubMed:26427316)
