4-Acetoxy-DiPT Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
 
4-Acetoxy-DiPT is a tryptamine that's effects have been compared to both 2C-B and mushrooms. It is found as a slightly off-white powder and is usually taken orally. 4-Acetoxy-DiPT can be found in both HCl salt form and as a freebase. Both of these forms are orally active with the freebase being about 10% lighter and therefore 10% more potent than the HCl form (ie 20 mg HCl = ~18 mg freebase). 4-Hydroxy-DiPT (4-OH-DiPT) is a very similar chemical which has [slighly lower dosages](https://erowid.org/../4_ho_dipt/4_ho_dipt_dose.shtml) .

Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**4-Acetoxy-DiPT**
- REGULATED: No
- STATUS: Not Approved ForHuman Consumption
- SCHEDULE: Un-Scheduled
 
4-Acetoxy-DiPT and 4-HO-DiPT are both uncontrolled substances in the U.S. as well as in most if not all other countries. It could conceivably be covered under the [U.S. Analogue Act](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/law_fed_analog_act) depending on how it's sold, but there have been no cases brought to trial that we are aware of. (1/Nov/2004) 
 
 There are pending cases (beginning July 2004) in which vendors selling 4-Acetoxy-DIPT and other psychoactive chemicals to the general public are being prosecuted. Please see [Research Chemical Arrests and Investigations](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/research_chems/research_chems_info1.shtml) . It is important to note, however, that there have been no convictions in these cases and so there is no further clarification of the legal status of 4-Acetoxy-DIPT at this time.
 
INTERNATIONAL LAW #
 
Finland #
 
4-Acetoxy-DIPT was banned in Finland in December 2014. A new government regulation was enacted in Finland that banned over 100 psychoactive chemicals. See [Finland's Prohibited Psychoactive Substances: December 19, 2014](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/finland/finland_law1_2014.pdf) . (last updated Dec 26, 2014)
 
Japan #
