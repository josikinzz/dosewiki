## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Common: 500 - 1500 µg

**Duration:**
- Total: 4 - 10 hours

**Lysergic acid ethylamide** (also known as **LAE-32** , **LAE** , and **d-ethyllysergamide** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) class. It is one of the least known and least researched psychedelic substances.

The pharmacology of LAE-32 is complex [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] , but it acts primarily by binding to [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) in the brain, much like LSD and other serotonergic psychedelics. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## History and culture

### The CIA and Project MKULTRA Findings

LAE-32 was experimented with by the CIA as part of Project MKULTRA. It was reported to create a condition similar to that of schizophrenia in mentally healthy individuals, characterized by indifference and depersonalization. While it was reported that, when used on schizophrenics, it created a condition that allowed the patients to become indifferent to their hallucinations and cease hallucinatory excitation.

## Chemistry

LAE-32, or d-lysergic acid ethylamide, is a semisynthetic substance of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) family.

Its chemical structure consists of a bicyclic hexahydroindole ring fused to a bicyclic quinoline group (lysergic acid). At carbon 8 of the quinoline an N, generally N-ethyl carboxamide is bound, LAE-32 is additionally substituted at carbon 6 with a methyl group.

## Pharmacology

LAE-32 most likely acts by binding to serotonin receptors in the brain. It may, like [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , bind to dopamine receptors as well.

## Subjective effects

The subjective effects of LAE-32 are reportedly mainly sedating and depersonalizing, creating a state of indifference in users.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - This effect is mild compared to traditional [sedatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedatives) such as [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) and [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) . ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)** - LAE-32 is unique among psychedelics for its ability to suppress willpower.
- **[Personality regression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personality_regression)**
### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Cannabis** - Cannabis has an unexpectedly strong and somewhat unpredictable synergy with psychedelics. Extreme caution is advised when using this combination as it can significantly increase the chances of a negative psychological reaction like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their usual cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid over intake.
- **Amphetamines** & **Cocaine** - Stimulants increase [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) levels and the risk of [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) which can lead to negative experiences.
- **Tramadol** - Tramadol is well known to lower seizure threshold and psychedelics also cause occasional seizures.

## Legal status

LAE-32 is not explicitly illegal in any nation, but it is possibly illegal to possess in the United States for purposes of consumption due to the Federal Analog Act.

Lysergic acid ethylamide (LAE-32 or LAE) is a psychedelic drug of the lysergamide family related to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). It is reported to have some LSD-like effects but is weaker and shorter lasting, with an active dose reported to be between 0.5 and 1.4 mg.
It was studied by the CIA as part of Project MKULTRA. Documents published by the CIA under the Freedom of Information Act suggest it causes "a schizophrenia-like condition" but it allows people with schizophrenia to remain indifferent to their disorder. The drug has also been studied in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy.
LAE-32 was first described in the scientific literature by Albert Hofmann and colleagues by 1955.
