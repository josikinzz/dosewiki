## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as amphetamines and derivatives. These are organic compounds containing or derived from 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.

### Background

Amphetamine, a compound discovered over 100 years ago, is one of the more restricted controlled drugs. It was previously used for a large variety of conditions and this changed until this point where its use is highly restricted. Amphetamine, with the chemical formula alpha-methylphenethylamine, was discovered in 1910 and first synthesized by 1927. After being proven to reduce drug-induced anesthesia and produce arousal and insomnia, amphetamine racemic mix was registered by Smith, Kline and French in 1935. Amphetamine structure presents one chiral center and it exists in the form of dextro- and levo-isomers.
1
The first product of Smith, Kline and French was approved by the FDA on 1976.
15
During World War II, amphetamine was used to promote wakefulness in the soldiers. This use derived into a large overproduction of amphetamine and all the surplus after the war finalized ended up in the black market, producing the initiation of the illicit abuse.
1

### Indication

Amphetamine is indicated for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) as well as for the treatment of central nervous system disorders such as narcolepsy.
1
In Canada, it has been approved for the treatment of ADHD in children 6 - 12 years of age and adults (18 years of age and older).
21
ADHD is a complex disorder associated with the substantial heterogeneity in etiology, clinical presentation, and treatment outcome. ADHD comes from a complex interplay between interdependent genetic and non-genetic factors which cause complex mental disorders in children and teenagers.
8
On the other hand, narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder typically resenting during adolescence and characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness.
9
Amphetamine is also being used nowadays off-label for the treatment of obesity, depression and chronic pain.

### Pharmacodynamics

From its mechanism of action, it has been demonstrated that amphetamine augments the concentration of noradrenaline in the prefrontal cortex and dopamine in the striatum on a dose and time-dependent manner. The indistinct release of neurotransmitters which include adrenaline is known to produce cardiovascular side effects.
5
There are old reports of a cognitive enhancement related to the administration of amphetamine in which improvements in intelligence test scores were reported.
2
In ADHD, amphetamine has been largely showed to produce remarkable improvements in school performance, behavior, and demeanor.
1
The effect was shown to be produced through both racemic forms and to this date, the use of racemic forms 3:1 (D:L) is very common.
3
The therapeutic effect of amphetamine on serotonin does not seem to have a significant clinical effect on ADHD as observed on comparative studies with amphetamine and fenfluramine, a powerful serotonin releasing factor. However, the indirect effect on serotonin might have an effect on the depression and anxiety profile of ADHD.
6
Studies regarding the illicit use of amphetamine in which heavy consumers were studied proved the generation of a paranoid state which flagged this drug as a psychiatric danger compound.
16
This observation was supported by the continuous reports of misuse in patients under depression.

+ 2 more targets

### Absorption

Amphetamine is well absorbed in the gut and as it is a weak base hence the more basic the environment the more of the drug is found in a lipid-soluble form and the absorption through lipid-rich cell membranes is highly favored.
11
The peak response of amphetamine occurs 1-3 hours after oral administration and approximately 15 minutes after injection and it presents a bioavailability of over 75%.
17
Complete amphetamine absorption is usually done after 4-6 hours.
18

### Metabolism

Amphetamine is known to be metabolized by the liver under the action of the CYP2D6. The metabolic pathway of amphetamine is mainly defined by aromatic hydroxylation, aliphatic hydroxylation, and n-dealkylation.
19
The formed metabolites in this pathway are 4-hydroxyamphetamine, 4-hydroxynorephedrine, hippuric acid, benzoic acid, benzyl methyl ketone, and p-hydroxyamphetamine which is known to be a potent hallucinogen.

### Half-life

The half-life of amphetamine highly depends on the isomer. For d-amphetamine, the reported half-life is of approximately 9-11 hours while for l-amphetamine the half-life is reported to be of 11-14 hours. The urine pH can modify this pharmacokinetic parameter which can vary from 7 hours in acid urine to 34 hours for alkaline urine.
11

### Toxicity

The mean lethal serum concentration is reported to be of 6.4 mg/l. Acute amphetamine overdose can lead to hyperthermia, respiratory depression, seizures, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, hepatic injury, and coma. Some of the neurologic effects have been shown to be agitation, aggressive behavior, irritability, headache, and hallucinations. In the cardiovascular site, there have been reports of arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke. Lastly, in the GI tract, there are reports if abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, cramps, anorexia and GI hemorrhage. A dose of 1-2 g of amphetamine is known to cause severe intoxication but some chronic abusers can report usage of even 5-15 g per day.
19
In animal studies, there is no evidence of carcinogenic potential, not clastogenic or to affect fertility or early embryonic development.

### Mechanism of action

Amphetamine's structure closely resembles catecholamine neurotransmitters, characterized primarily by a long planar conformation, an aromatic ring, and nitrogen in the aryl side chain. Like endogenous catecholamines, amphetamine is actively transported into presynaptic nerve terminals via monoamine reuptake transporters, which require association with two sodium ions and one chloride ion. Because amphetamine acts as a competitive substrate, increased concentrations lead to greater internalization of amphetamine.
1
Once in the presynaptic terminal, amphetamine competes for storage in VMAT2 (Vesicular Monoamine Transporter 2), displacing other monoamines. This action induces the release of neurotransmitters into the synapse through a process known as reverse transport.
4
The d-isomer is approximately fourfold more potent than the \$l\$-isomer in promoting dopamine release via this mechanism.
5
The mechanism of action is further complemented by the inhibition of both monoamine reuptake and monoamine oxidase (MAO), which act synergistically to significantly elevate monoamine concentrations.
1
Amphetamine does not act as a direct inhibitor but rather as a competitive substrate, classifying it as a weak dopamine reuptake inhibitor, a moderate noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, and a very weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Consequently, the l-isomer exhibits significantly lower potency in this specific action.
5
Amphetamine acts as a weak inhibitor of the mitochondrial-bound enzyme MAO, the catalytic enzyme responsible for degrading excess neurotransmitters. Although this mechanism is often considered minor due to its weak inhibitory nature, it remains a component of amphetamine's overall action.
1
Amphetamine is a modulator of glutamatergic neurotransmission, primarily via its action on the dopamine system.
12
The mass release of dopamine caused by amphetamine subsequently signals to the glutamatergic system, leading to long-lasting changes in synaptic plasticity.
12
,
13
Amphetamine's entry into dopamine neurons triggers the endocytosis of the excitatory amino acid transporter EAAT3, reducing glutamate clearance and potentiating excitatory synaptic responses mediated by ionotropic receptors.
13
Chronic exposure also alters receptor composition, such as the downregulation of the NMDA receptor NR2B subunit in the striatum, which is a key molecular change underlying behavioral sensitization to the drug.

### Volume of distribution

Amphetamine is reported to have a high volume of distribution of 4 L/kg.
11

### Protein binding

The reported protein binding of amphetamine is relatively low and register to be of 20%.
11

### Route of elimination

The elimination of amphetamine is mainly via the urine from which about 40% of the excreted dose is found as unchanged amphetamine. About 90% of the administered amphetamine is eliminated 3 days after oral administration.
11
The rate of elimination of amphetamine highly depends on the urine pH in which acidic pH will produce a higher excretion of amphetamine and basic pH produces a lower excretion.
17

### Clearance

The reported normal clearance rate is of 0.7 L.h/kg. This clearance has been shown to get significantly reduced in patients with renal impairment reaching a value of 0.4 L.h/kg.

### General Function

Sodium-ion dependent, high affinity carnitine transporter. Involved in the active cellular uptake of carnitine. Transports one sodium ion with one molecule of carnitine (PubMed:10454528, PubMed:10525100, PubMed:10966938, PubMed:17509700, PubMed:20722056, PubMed:33124720). Also transports organic cations such as tetraethylammonium (TEA) without the involvement of sodium. Relative uptake activity ratio of carnitine to TEA is 11.3 (PubMed:10454528, PubMed:10525100, PubMed:10966938). In intestinal epithelia, transports the quorum-sensing pentapeptide CSF (competence and sporulation factor) from B.subtilis which induces cytoprotective heat shock proteins contributing to intestinal homeostasis (PubMed:18005709). May also contribute to regulate the transport of organic compounds in testis across the blood-testis-barrier (Probable)

## Subjective Experience

Adderall is a mix of dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine, in the ratio 75% to
25%, and is prescribed to treat the symptoms of ADHD (attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder) and narcolepsy (a sleep disorder). The brand was first
introduced in 1996, with a generic version being approved in 2002.

Its recreational use is now well established and unsurprisingly, given its composition,
addiction potential and increased tolerance build quickly.

My 60mg supply came in the form of two orange pills. Identity checking their
imprints online, drugs.com states that these are: “b 974 3 0 (Amphetamine and
Dextroamphetamine 30 mg)” and that they were originally supplied by Teva
Pharmaceuticals USA.

Coincidentally, Erowid currently uses the exact same type of pill for its illustrative
photograph for amphetamine, with adderall listed as a brand name.

Adderall comes in both instant and extended release forms. Here I am covering the
IR (instant) version. Also note that some people insufflate, but I am researching this
via the oral route. A word in passing on this though: as usual, if you are insufflating,
significantly lower doses are required.

With respect to dosage, drugs-forum.com states that:

\`\`\`
“Adderall is intended to be taken orally, at doses from 5-30mg (measured in
instant release). Recreational users do use more, however it is not advisable
for inexperienced users to exceed 30mg, if not tolerant to the drug”
\`\`\`
As this is my first experiment with adderall, I obviously wouldn’t call myself an
experienced user of it, but might do so with respect to stimulants generally, including
street amphetamine. Combined with the TripSit and other relevant material I
therefore decide to start with 30mg. To help facilitate a faster onset I crush the pills
prior to swallowing.

In terms of expectation I am anticipating a slightly watered down version of the
effects I experienced with amphetamine (of which I took a much higher dose ).

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I swallow 30mg of my supply with a glass of water [11:50am]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:30 I can feel the usual stim tingles emerging, along with a light head
buzz. Already it is quite pleasant, and already I am contemplating another
half-pill (maybe 15mg) to top up.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 I swill down another 10mg of the crushed orange debris, taking the
total to around 40mg. The buzz is currently sustained on a nice level, which I
can functionally skate above if necessary.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
Unsurprisingly, the major hallmarks of amphetamine are in play now, albeit
not very strongly. These include a positive uplift, and indeed horn, if required.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:00 I remain on the same plateau, which is quite nice, but the compulsion
to redose is undeniably present. Given that my overall dose is limited to the
60mg I originally acquired I am seeking to control this and spin out the
exercise as best I can, which isn’t a trivial matter. Despite this intention, I still
swallow half the remaining supply, taking the running total to around 50mg.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:00 I now greedily gobble the remainder, hitting the ceiling of my 60mg.
Unfortunately this doesn’t seem to produce the mild rush of previous re-
doses, at least to the same extent, so I hypothesise that I could be hitting some
sort of barrier of diminishing returns.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+4:00 As suspected an hour ago, I have passed the peak, and the buzz and
general elevation is slowly fading. I am still in a zone of course, but it is far less
intense than it was earlier.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I have little doubt that had I a larger stock available I would continue a little
longer, so once again a pre-planned constraint has intervened to save me from
myself.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
From here I expect a gradual comedown over the next few hours, hopefully a
soft and gentle one. I remain warm with a mild head-stim, so this isn’t so bad
at the present time.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+5:00 Stim-binge averted, I can now turn some attention to recovery. I am
targeting a decent meal in an hour or two, at which point I hope to have at
least something of an appetite.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I still feel somewhat fuzzy in a positive sense, if a little unfulfilled. I remain
physically warm and generally well.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+7:00 The ride has basically fizzled out to a flatness. I feel slightly distant
and increasingly weary, although not particularly sleepy.
\`\`\`
The night’s sheep was in fact a decent one, aided and abetted (reluctantly) by 0.5mg
of etizolam. The next morning I awoke reasonably fresh, if a little drained.

My expectation was not far off the mark. This was like a weakish re-run with
amphetamine; no doubt on account of the dose I was restricted to in comparison.
This is not to say that it wasn’t decent: it was. It is just that it peaked early, not
particularly highly, and then faded slowly over the course of the day, leaving me at a
bit of a loose end. In different circumstances I would undoubtedly have enjoyed a
better return.

Finally, and it is worth stating the obvious: the warnings I provide for amphetamine
also apply to this, so do take care, particularly with dose and frequency of use.

DESCRIPTION #
 
[Amphetamine Images](https://erowid.org/amphetamines_images.shtml)
 
Amphetamines include both the specific chemical 'amphetamine' and the general class of chemicals which share structural similaries. Amphetamines generally cause strong physical and mental stimulation, keeping users awake and alert for many hours, and some amphetamines cause mood lift / euphoria. Because they increase wakefulness, various amphetamines have been used by the military, by pilots, truck drivers, and other workers to keep functioning past their normal limits. 
 
 Amphetamines are also used to treat Attention Deficit Disorder and can have the seemingly paradoxical effect of quieting and calming users. Common amphetamines include Dexedrine (d-amphetamine), methamphetamine, and adderall (dl-amphetamine). Substantial amounts of pharmaceutical amphetamines are diverted from medical use to recreational and work-related uses and methamphetamine is produced in huge quantities in underground labs around the world.

[History](https://erowid.org/amphetamines_timeline.php) #
 
Amphetamine was first synthesized by German chemist L. Edeleano in 1887 (originally named phenylisopropylamine). In the 1930's amphetamines were first marketed as 'benzedrine' in an over-the-counter inhaler to treat congestion and in the late 30's, amphetamine was prescribed for the treatment of narcolepsy and ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). Amphetamine use grew rapidly when amphetamines were distributed to soldiers during World War II. In 1971, amphetamines were scheduled in the United States and prescriptions became required for possession.

DESCRIPTION #
 
Amphetamines are stimulants that affect the central nervous system. Medically they are used to treat depression, obesity, and other conditions. 
 
 In addition to the physical effects of amphetamines, users report feeling restless, anxious and moody. Increased doses intensify the effects, and users may become excited or talkative and experience a false sense of self-confidence or superiority. They may behave in a bizarre manner; some become aggressive and hostile. 
 
 Prolonged use of amphetamines can lead to malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies, skin disorders, ulcers, lack of sleep, weight loss and depression. Frequent use of large amounts of amphetamines can cause brain damage that results in speech and thought disturbances. 
 
 Note: "Speed" is used to refer to amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylphenidate (Ritalin), and other strong stimulants that feel something like amphetamine. 
 
 
Addiction and Withdrawal #
 Users of large amounts of amphetamines over a long period of time can develop an amphetamine psychosis, which is a mental disorder similar to paranoid schizophrenia. The psychosis is manifested by hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. Bizarre, sometime violent, behavior is exhibited by those with amphetamine psychosis. Symptoms usually disappear within a few weeks after drug use stops. 
 
 
Withdrawal Symptoms
 Amphetamines have the potential to produce tolerance, which means that increased amounts of the drug are needed to achieve the desired effects. Withdrawal symptoms can occur when use of amphetamines is stopped abruptly. Users may experience fatigue; long, disturbed periods of sleep; irritability; intense hunger, and moderate to severe depression. The length and severity of the depression is related to how much and how often amphetamines were used. 
 
 
- craving exhaustion depression mental confusion restlessness and insomnia deep or disturbed sleep lasting up to 48 hours extreme hunger psychotic reaction anxiety reactions
 
Treatment (from [FADAA](http://www.fadaa.org/resource/justfact/amphetamines.html) )
 Medical treatments include the use of antidepressant agents such as imipramine, desipramine, amitriptyline, dosepin, trazodone, or fluoxetine (Prozac). These affect serotonin, the neurotransmitter in the brain that deals with both depression and drug craving. 
 
 Sedatives such as Dalmane, chloral hydrate, Librium, phenobarbital, or even Valium are used, very carefully, on a short-term basis to treat anxiety or sleep disturbance problems. Antipsychotic medications such as Haldol, [Thorazine](https://erowid.org/pharms/chlorpromazine/chlorpromazine.shtml) , and others are also used to buffer the effects of unbalanced dopamine, the neurotransmitter that moderates paranoia and pleasurable sensation. 
 
 In addition to treating the physical and psychological aspects of craving, treatment providers should stress group counseling and peer pressure for compulsive amphetamine users, as these forms of therapy work well for this population. 
 
 
Effects of use During Pregnancy #
 It is possible for babies of mothers who use amphetamines to be born with: 
 
 
- cardiac defects cleft palate birth defects addiction and withdrawal
 
Overdose #
 (from PDR 1998's amphetamine prescription information) 
 Individual patient response to amphetamines varies widely. While toxic symptoms occasionally occur as an idiosyncracy at dosages as low as 2 mg, they are rare with doses of less than 15 mg; 30 mg can produce severe reactions, yet doses of 400 to 500 mg are not necessarily fatal. In rats, the oral LD50 of dextroamphetamine sulfate is 96.8 mg/kg. 
 
 
Symptoms
 Manifestations of acute overdosage with amphetamines include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, panic states, hyperpyrexia, and rhabdomyolysis. 
 
 Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. 
 
 Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmias, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. 
 
 Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. Fatal poisoning is usually preceded by convulsions and coma. 
 
 
Treatment
 Consult with a Certified Poison Control Center for up-to-date guidance and advice. Management of acute amphetamine intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes gastric lavage, administration of activated charcoal, administration of a cathartic and sedation. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendation in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases amphetamine excretion, but is believed to increase risk of acute renal failure if myoglobinuria is present. If acute, severe hypertension complicates amphetamine overdosage, administration of intravenous phentolamine (Regitine (r) CIBA) has been suggested. However a gradual drop in blood pressure will usually result when sufficient sedation has been achieved. Chlorpromazine antagonizes the central stimulation effects of amphetamines and can be used to treat amphetamine intoxication.
 
CAUTION & DISCLAIMER #
 
Erowid's effects information is a summary of data gathered from users, research, and other resources. This information is intended to describe the range of effects people report experiencing. Effects may vary dramatically from one person to another or one experience to another based on a variety of factors such as body chemistry, age, gender, physical health, dose, form of material, etc.

Amphetamine (& Methamphetamine)
 
Health Issues
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
 The health concerns for most amphetamine-like substances, including methamphetamine, are largely the same. Each has its own risk and toxicity profile. Street methamphetamine provides the additional risks of black market, unregulated medications; potential contaminants or adulteration; the potential of neurotoxicity and a higher risk of compulsive use associated with snorting, smoking, or injecting. 
 
 Frequency: unknown, rare, uncommon, common, very common, typical. 
 Certainty: unknown, little direct evidence, some evidence, case reports only, medium / link established, high / clear causation. 
 
 
 
Health risks and problems associated with amphetamine use:
 
- Agitation, Inability to Concentrate : In some users, increasing with dose, amphetamine causes agitation, restlessness, and inability to concentrate or focus. 
 
Frequency: uncommon, increasing with dose.
 
Certainty: clear causation.
- Cardiovascular Stress : Increased heart rate and blood pressure. Tachycardia (fast heart) and palpitations are common at high doses. 
 
Frequency: very common.
 
Certainty: clear causation.
- Heart Attack & Hypertensive Crisis : With higher doses and for vulnerable individuals, Cardiovascular Stress can precipitate severe hypertensive crises and Heart Attacks. 
 
Frequency: uncommon.
 
Certainty: clear causation.
- Stroke : Increases risk of stroke as dose increases. 
 
Frequency: unknown.
 
Certainty: medium. [ Kaku 1990 , Lambrecht 1993 ]
- Overheating : High doses can cause overheating (hyperthermia) which can be dangerous in certain environments or for vulnerable people. 
 
Frequency: common.
 
Certainty: clear causation.
- Poor Sleep Quality : Mild sleep disruptions are very common and include difficulty falling asleep and poor sleep quality. 
 
Frequency: typical.
 
Certainty: clear causation.
- Sleep Deprivation : Repeated dosing can lead to lack of sleep for days on end, resulting in cognitive impairment, poor judgement, confusion, hallucinations, and paranoia. 
 
Frequency: typical with repeated dosing.
 
Certainty: clear causation.
- Bad Driving : Lack of sleep can lead to impaired judgement and poor driving. 
 
Frequency: common with sleep deprivation.
 
Certainty: link established.
- Poor Diet : Reduced appetite and reduced enjoyment of eating can lead to poor diet which, over time, can lead to poor general health, oral health and skin tone, and increased physical and mental stress. 
 
Frequency: common with chronic use.
 
Certainty: clear causation.
- Stress & Oxidative Damage : Methamphetamine causes stress to the body and mind and causes an increase in oxidative stress in blood and tissues. At very high doses and frequencies of use, organ damage and premature aging may occur. 
 
Frequency: common.
 
Certainty: some evidence.
- Damage to Teeth and Gums # : Jaw tension can lead to teeth grinding (bruxia/bruxism) and permanent wear and cracking. Long-term use of amphetamines can result in tooth rot ( [dental caries](http://www.db.od.mah.se/car/data/cariesser.html) ) and loss of teeth. [ Shaner 2002 ] Regular amphetamine use can lead to gingivitis (inflammation of the gums). This may be the result of prolonged dry mouth which can cause the gums to become inflamed, worsening oral health. [ Hasan 2004 ]. 
 
Frequency: common.
 
Certainty: link established.
- Paranoia : Using recreational (higher) doses of amphetamines more than once per day or for several days in a row can cause mild to moderate paranoid ideation in some users. The paranoid thinking can cause lasting problems and the paranoia can sometimes last for days or weeks after use ceases. Regular amphetamine use (and lack of sleep) can cause paranoid, delusional thinking and sometimes auditory and visual hallucinations (usually barely audible or on the periphery of vision). Chronic, high dose use may lead to long term mental health problems. [ Nurse's PDR 2005 ] 
 
Frequency: uncommon.
 
Certainty: some evidence [self reports].
- Risky Sex : Euphoria, altered mental state, and altered sense of control at recreational doses can lead to risky sexual behavior. [ Self Reports ] 
 
Frequency: unknown.
 
Certainty: some evidence [self reports].
- Dry Mucus Membranes : Dried mucus membranes can lead to bloody noses, painful sinus dryness, and increased likelihood of sinus infections. 
 
Frequency: common.
 
Certainty: link established.
- Dry Skin, Picking at the Skin : Regular amphetamine use is associated with a drying of the skin and increased itchyness. Obsessively picking or pulling at the skin (sometimes until it bleeds) is reported in many people after higher dose, frequent use of methamphetamine. 
 
Frequency: unknown.
 
Certainty: some evidence [self reports].
- Neurotoxicity (Methamphetamine): At high doses, methamphetamine causes damage to dopamine and serotonin neurons in the brain [ Seiden 1976 , Thompson 2004 ]. Long term use may lead to noticeable neurological and behavioral problems. This effect is well documented with methamphetamine in mice and now largely confirmed in humans; behavioral/clinical effects of this damage is not well documented in humans [ Hanson 2004 ]. 
 
Frequency: unknown.
 
Certainty: link established in rodents, exact nature unclear in humans.
- Neurotoxicity (D/L-Amphetamine): Neurotoxicity with D/L amphetamine (most of what is prescribed as medications) is not as well documented, but at very high doses and frequencies, neurotoxicity does occur in mice and rats. [ Jonsson 1982 ] 
 
Frequency: unknown.
 
Certainty: unknown.
- Rhabdomyolysis and Kidney Damage : Breakdown of muscle fibers usually caused by overheating and overstimulation. High-dose use can result in rhabdomyolysis, causing large amounts of proteins to be released into the blood. Urine becomes dark as the rhabdomyolysis increases and the kidneys can suffer mild to severe damage. [ Chan 1994 , Lan 1998 ]. 
 
Frequency: rare.
 
Certainty: some direct evidence.
- Dangerous to combine with other stimulants : Amphetamines used with MDMA appear to cause damage to the dopamine neurons in the brain [ Reneman 2002 ]. Amphetamines combined with other stimulants can substantially increase the risk of dangerous hyperthermia (overheating), rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of muscles), and other related health problems. 
 
Frequency: uncommon.
 
Certainty: clear causation.
- Death : Usually resuling from cardiac arrest, stroke, or hyperthermia. Acute renal failure associated with rhabdomyolysis, acidosis, and ischemic renal failure also is associated with methamphetamine fatalities. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation also reported. [ Lan 1998 ]. 
 
Frequency: rare.
 
Certainty: clear causation.
 
 
Health benefits associated with amphetamine use:
 
- Reduced Appetite : Although still prescribed to aid in weight loss, the recognized cardiovascular risks of using amphetamines now make their prescription for weight loss far less common than in the past. The prevalence of "weight loss only" non-prescription use of amphetamines is impossible to gauge. 
 
Frequency: typical.
 
Certainty: clear causation.
- Attention Deficit Disorder : Amphetamines are widely prescribed for use in treating moderate to severe cases of Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) in both children and adults. Attention-improving doses tend to be low doses (3-20 mg of amphetamine or methamphetamine oral), although dosages are higher for tolerated individuals. 
 
Frequency: effective for some.
 
Certainty: link established.
- Attention / Wakefulness : In low doses and used infrequently, amphetamine increases wakefulness and attentiveness in users. It is used by truckers, the military, and others who need to stay awake for long periods of time. Wakefulness can be important for safety when operating machinery. 
 
Frequency: typical.
 
Certainty: link established.
- Dry Mucus Membranes : Dried mucus membranes can reduce allergy and cold symptoms. 
 
Frequency: common. Certainty: link established.
 
 
Warnings:
 
- Do not take amphetamines if you are using, or have used an [MAO Inhibitor](https://erowid.org/../maois/maois.shtml) within the last 2 weeks.
- Regular or frequent amphetamine use can lead to dependence.
- Regular amphetamine users experience tolerance and require increased dosages to achieve the same level of effects.

Amphetamine
 
Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Amphetamine**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Scheduled
- SCHEDULE: Schedule II
- CLASSIFICATION: Stimulant
 
Amphetamine is Schedule II in the United States. This means it is illegal to sell without a DEA license and illegal to buy or possess without a license or prescription.
 
INTERNATIONAL LAW #
 
Brazil #
 
Amphetamines are schedule A3, requiring a prescription for purchase and a license to sell. We have been told that they can sometimes be purchased without a prescription, though this is illegal. See [http://www.anvisa.gov.br/divulga/informes/2009/Resolu%E7%E3o%20RDC%2040_nova.pdf?id=35907&word](http://www.anvisa.gov.br/divulga/informes/2009/Resolu%E7%E3o%20RDC%2040_nova.pdf?id=35907&word) and [http://www.anvisa.gov.br/medicamentos/controlados/conceito.htm](http://www.anvisa.gov.br/medicamentos/controlados/conceito.htm) . (thanks RM, P) (last updated July 3 2011)
 
Canada #
 
In Aug 2005, Canada reinstated sales of Adderall XR after banning their sales in Feb 2005. See [Health Canada News Release Allowing Adderall XR back on market](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/nr-cp/2005/2005_92_e.html) and [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4253159.stm) . Immediate release Adderall is not approved for sale in Canada. Amphetamine is Schedule I in Canada (was Schedule III until 2012). (Note: Canadian schedules are very different than U.S. schedules). (last updated Oct 1 2012)
 
China #
 
Amphetamine is disallowed as a prescription drug in China, with a limited exception for tourists carrying prescriptions in from other countries. Chinese pharmacies do not carry amphetamine-based medicines. It is possible for longer term visitors to have prescriptions imported by mail, but this requires complex paperwork and administrative approval. Taiwan is reportedly more lenient, but amphetamine prescription drugs are still unavailable. (unconfirmed) (thanks J) (last updated May 12, 2013)
 
Germany #
 
Amphetamine is BTM Anlage 3 in Germany making it illegal to possess without a BTM prescription. (unconfirmed) (thanks PM)
 
Israel #
 
Israel banned four "families" of substances and their derivatives in July 2010. The families are cathinones, methcathinones, amphetamines, and methamphetamines. The new rules are designed to preemptively ban new drugs before they are sold in Israel. See [http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=181254](http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=181254) . (Thanks A) (last updated May 12 2011)
 
New Zealand #

(thanks M)
 
Norway #
 
Amphetamine is Schedule II in Norway and illegal to buy or possess without a prescription. [See Norway Law](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/countries.shtml#norway) . (thanks Y)
 
Poland #
 
Amphetamine is included in the Appendix II-P group of Poland's Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Law, making it illegal to buy, sell, possess, or use. (thanks T)
 
Portugal #
 
Effective July 2001, personal use of amphetamine without a prescription was decriminalized by Law 30/2000 (see [text of law](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/portugal/lei30-2000.pdf) ). Possession of less than 1 g is not regarded as a criminal offense, though the substance is liable to be seized and the possessor can be referred to mandatory treatment. Sale, or possession of quantities greater than the personal possession limit, are criminal offenses punishable by jail time. (thanks P)
 
U.K. #
 
Amphetamine is [Schedule 2/Class B](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/uk/uk_law_definitions.shtml) in the U.K. making it illegal to possess without a prescription.

**Amphetamine** (also known as ***alpha* -methylphenethylamine** , **amfetamine** , **speed** , or by brand names including **Adderall,** **Dexedrine and Tentin** ) is a classical [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) class. It is the parent compound of the [substituted amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamines) , a diverse group that includes [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cathinone) , and [bupropion](/w/index.php?title=Bupropion&action=edit&redlink=1) . The mechanism of action involves promoting release of the [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) .

It was first synthesized in 1887, but its psychostimulant effects were not discovered until 1929. In the 1930s, it was sold over-the-counter under the name "Benzedrine" as a decongestant. It became widely used to treat a range of ailments such as alcohol hangover, narcolepsy, depression, and obesity. Due to issues with addiction and abuse, it was eventually listed as a controlled substance under the United Nations 1971 "Convention on Psychotropic Substances".

Amphetamine is now primarily a prescription drug used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy, and obesity. Treatment with Amphetamine, among other stimulants, may be associated with neuroprotection for ADHD patients by reducing neurotransmitter deficiencies commonly linked to neurological deficits within untreated subjects with ADHD. Additionally, it sees widespread illicit use as a performance enhancing agent and recreational substance.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement) , [motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement) , [increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido) , [appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . It is usually taken orally, but can also be [insufflated, injected, or administered rectally](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . Lower doses tend to increase focus and productivity while higher doses tend to increase sociability, sexual desire, and euphoria.

Amphetamine has high abuse potential. Chronic use (i.e. high dose, repeat administration) is associated with [compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) , escalating tolerance, and psychological dependence. Additionally, abuse has been linked to a number of health conditions, especially cardiovascular issues such as [high blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/High_blood_pressure) and increased risk of stroke.

It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## History and culture

Amphetamine was first synthesized in Germany in 1887 by the Romanian chemist Lazăr Edeleanu, who named it *phenylisopropylamine* . However, its stimulant effects remained unknown until 1927, when it was independently re-synthesized by Gordon Alles and discovered to have sympathomimetic properties.

In late 1933, Smith, Kline and French began selling amphetamine in the form of a decongestant inhaler under the name Benzedrine. Benzedrine sulfate was introduced 3 years later and was used to treat a wide variety of medical conditions, including narcolepsy, obesity, low blood pressure, low libido, and chronic pain.

During World War II, amphetamine and methamphetamine were used extensively by both the Allied and Axis forces for their stimulant and performance-enhancing effects. As its addictive properties became known, governments began to place strict controls on its sale.

Amphetamine is still illegally synthesized and sold on the black market, primarily in European countries. Among European Union (EU) member states, 1.2 million young adults used illicit amphetamine or methamphetamine in 2013. During 2012, approximately 5.9 metric tons of illicit amphetamine were seized within EU member states; the "street price" of illicit amphetamine within the EU ranged from €6–38 per gram during the same period.

Outside Europe, the illicit market for amphetamine is much smaller than the market for methamphetamine and MDMA.

## Chemistry

Amphetamine, also known as *alpha* -methylphenethylamine, is a synthetic substance of the phenethylamine family. The chemical structure of amphetamine consists of [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) , a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain, with an additional methyl substitution at R α . The name 'amphetamine' is a contraction from **α** lpha **m** ethyl **ph** en **et** hyl **amine**

It is the parent compound of the [substituted amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamines) , a highly diverse group that includes such substances as [bupropion](/w/index.php?title=Bupropion&action=edit&redlink=1) , [phenmetrazine](/w/index.php?title=Phenmetrazine&action=edit&redlink=1) , [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , and the [DOx](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOx) series.

At room temperature, the pure freebase is a mobile, colorless, and volatile liquid with a characteristically strong amine odor, and acrid, burning taste.

### Enantiomers

Amphetamine is a chiral compound. [Racemic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racemic) amphetamine ( dl -amphetamine) contains two optical [isomers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Isomers) , or [enantiomers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Enantiomers) :

- [levoamphetamine](/w/index.php?title=Levoamphetamine&action=edit&redlink=1) is the 'left-handed' enantiomer form of amphetamine.
- [dextroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine) is the 'right-handed' enantiomer form of amphetamine.

Adderall and many other formulations of mixed amphetamine salts contain the [enantiomers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Enantiomers) in a 3:1 ratio of d to l. This is achieved by mixing one part [racemic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racemic) amphetamine and one part [dextroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine) .

## Pharmacology

Amphetamine exerts its behavioural effects by increasing the signaling activity of [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) and [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) in the reward and executive function pathways of the brain. The reinforcing and motivational effects of amphetamine are mostly due to enhanced dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway.

The euphoric and locomotor-stimulating effects of amphetamine are dependent upon the magnitude and speed by which it increases synaptic [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) concentrations in the striatum.

It is a potent [full agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and interacts with vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). Combined action on TAAR1 and VMAT2 results in increased concentrations of dopamine and norepinephrine in the synapses, which stimulates neuronal activity.

[Dextroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine) is a more potent agonist of TAAR1 than [levoamphetamine](/w/index.php?title=Levoamphetamine&action=edit&redlink=1) . Consequently, dextroamphetamine produces greater CNS stimulation than levoamphetamine, roughly three to four times more, but levoamphetamine has slightly stronger cardiovascular and peripheral effects.

The exact bioavailability of amphetamine is not known, but it is believed to be over 75% by mouth, and higher by injection or intranasal administration . Its absorption and excretion may be pH dependent. The basic form is more readily absorbed in the intestine and less readily removed by the kidneys, potentially increasing its half life . It is removed by the kidneys via excretion and a small amount is removed by hepatic enzymes.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - Amphetamine is reported to be very energetic and stimulating. It can encourage physical activities such as dancing, socializing, running, or cleaning. The particular style of stimulation that amphetamine produces can be described as forced. This means that at higher dosages, it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still. Jaw clenching, involuntary bodily shakes, and vibrations become present, resulting in extreme shaking of the entire body, unsteadiness of the hands, and a general loss of fine motor control. This is replaced with mild fatigue and general exhaustion during the offset of the experience.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of amphetamine can be described as a moderate euphoric tingling sensation that encompasses the entire body. This sensation maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)**
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** - By about 30mmHg systolic and 20mmHg diastolic, from naive users taking 40mg d-AMP.
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Bronchodilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bronchodilation)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Dry mouth](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dry_mouth)**
- **[Frequent urination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frequent_urination)**
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)**
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania)** - Amphetamine can produce mania in genetically predisposed individuals, such as those on the spectrum of [bipolar disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bipolar_disorder) or [schizophrenia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schizophrenia) . Higher doses and sleep deprivation appears to increase the risk.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - This can be mitigated by eating before dosing and throughout the experience.
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)** - This effect is experienced only at common to high dosages as well as in low lighting and is more prominent on the comedown.
- **[Reflex syncope](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reflex_syncope)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - This may be experienced due to an [Effect:Abnormal heartbeat](/w/index.php?title=Effect:Abnormal_heartbeat&action=edit&redlink=1) causing a sudden loss in blood pressure.
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - Teeth grinding may be present at higher doses. However, it is less intense than that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .
- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** - Amphetamine use causes blood vessels to constrict resulting in not enough blood reaching some parts of the body. This can cause feelings of tingling or pain, a cold feeling, numbness, paleness, or skin color changes especially in the fingers and toes. ### Visual effects
 
- The visual effects of amphetamine are inconsistent and occur only mildly noticeable at higher doses. They are somewhat comparable to [deliriant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriant) visuals and occur more readily in darker areas. 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** - This effect is usually subtle and barely noticeable and only occurs at higher dosages or when combined with [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) . Commonly this consists of level 1-2 drifting.
- **[Brightness alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brightness_alteration)** - Amphetamine can make spaces seem brighter as a result of its pupil dilating effects.
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)** - This effect is imperceptible with low dosages. It's most pronounced with bigger dosages and especially when someone becomes sleep deprived, what on the other hand can be easily provoked by other effects of this substantion.
 
It can get up to around 2.5-3 points on the psychonaut wiki scale. (click Traces above to read more)
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)** - This effect occurs very rarely, and typically only when the user has taken high doses, is coming down, or has been awake for unusually long periods. They are usually very mild when they do occur.
- **[Geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry)** - This effect is reported by some users of amphetamine and related substances, typically at heavier doses when one is attempting to sleep. It can be described in its variations as simplistic, algorithmic, synthetic, dimly lit, multicolored, glossy, sharp edges, zoomed out, smooth, angular, immersive, and progressive. It typically occurs at level 3 however may progress to 4 and 5 when combined with substances like [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) or [DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM) ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of amphetamine are oftentimes subjectively perceived as being more clearheaded and “functional” compared to other strong [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) such as [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) . In low to moderate doses the amphetamine headspace can, in many ways “mimic sobriety”; thus leading users or even onlookers to mistake the effects for more natural or mundane states of stimulation and focus. Individuals diagnosed with ADHD/ADD ( [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) deficiencies in certain brain regions) may however react starkly differently to amphetamine in low or moderate dosages. 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is considered to be more consistent and prevalent when compared to other common [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) .
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)** - This behavioral effect is generally less pronounced than it is with [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or when amphetamine is insufflated as opposed to taken orally.
- **[Ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation)**
- **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)** - This effect is typically most intense at light and common doses or with frequent usage, and is more commonly reported from medical usage rather than recreational.
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This effect is most effective at low to moderate doses, as anything higher will usually impair concentration or cause the user to be too physically active or restless to focus.
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** - While amphetamine use can cause feelings of enhanced sexual desire, the constricting of blood vessels may make it difficult to achieve or maintain an erection.
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)** - This is more likely to occur at higher doses and/or during the comedown.
- **[Memory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)** - Anecdotally, this component can be seemingly more prevalent when the [levoamphetamine](/w/index.php?title=Levoamphetamine&action=edit&redlink=1) [enantiomer](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Enantiomer) is present in this substance, such as with [racemic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racemic) amphetamine or mixtures of amphetamine salts such as Adderall.
- **[Psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis)** - This effect only occurs in either predisposed individuals, or after chronic, high frequency use, or due to sleep deprivation. Repeated administration of threshold/very low dosages (such as 2.5mg) however may also be associated with this effect possibly due to the “dopamine hypersensitivity” hypothesis. However this topic is somewhat controversial and speculative.
- **[Suggestibility suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Suggestibility_suppression)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought organization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_organization)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - This can be described as the experience of time speeding up and passing much quicker than it usually would when sober due to increased levels of [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) .
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** - This component is generally considered to be less intense when compared to [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) but more intense than with cocaine. ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" or “crash” and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) (specifically catecholamine) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** - Anxiety can reach severe levels during the comedown in some users.
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** - While blood concentration of amphetamine and most subjective effects are highest about 3 hours after administration, heart rate peaks much later at 10 hours after administration.
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Restless legs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Restless_legs)**
- **[Sleep paralysis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis)** - Some users note sleep paralysis after consuming amphetamine.
- **[Dream suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** - The insomnia following a repeated series of amphetamine doses can last for longer than a day in some users.
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)** - Experiences can range from mild demotivation to extreme states of disinterest. This effect is more prominent at common and heavy doses.

## Toxicity and harm potential

As of March 2014, there is no evidence that amphetamine is directly neurotoxic in humans. However, high-dose amphetamine can cause indirect neurotoxicity as a result of increased oxidative stress from reactive oxygen species and autoxidation of dopamine.

In rodents and primates, sufficiently high doses of amphetamine causes damage to dopamine neurons, characterized as reduced transporter and receptor function. Animal models of neurotoxicity from high-dose amphetamine exposure indicate that the occurrence of hyperpyrexia (i.e., core body temperature ≥ 40 °C) is necessary for the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity.

[Melatonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Melatonin) has been shown to prevent (if used 30min+ before dosing) and reverse amphetamine induced [neurotoxicity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity) of TH-pSer40 and calpastatin levels in the Substantia Nigra of rats.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Lethal dosage

The [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) (the dosage required to kill 50% of the test subjects) of amphetamine in rats has been found to be between roughly 15 mg and 180 mg per kilogram, depending on the study. No formal studies in humans have been carried out and the exact toxic dosage is unknown.

### Dependence and abuse potential

Amphetamine has high abuse potential and can cause psychological dependence with chronic use.

When dependence has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if use is suddenly discontinued. Withdrawal symptoms include [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression) , [dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation) , [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [itching](/w/index.php?title=Itching&action=edit&redlink=1) , [mood swings](/w/index.php?title=Mood_swings&action=edit&redlink=1) , [irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability) , fatigue, [insomnia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness) , an intense craving for more amphetamine or other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) .

Addiction is a serious risk with chronic or heavy recreational amphetamine use, but is unlikely to arise from typical medical use.

Tolerance to many of the effects of amphetamine develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in the user having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. Upon single administration, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption).

Amphetamine exhibits cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of amphetamine most [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) will have a reduced effect.

### Psychosis

Severe amphetamine overdose can result in a stimulant psychosis that may present with a variety of symptoms (e.g., [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) ). A review on treatment for amphetamine abuse-induced psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. The same review asserts that [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis. Psychosis very rarely arises from therapeutic use.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Alcohol** - Drinking alcohol on stimulants is considered risky because it reduces the sedative effects of the alcohol that the body uses to gauge drunkenness. This often leads to excessive drinking with greatly reduced inhibitions, increasing the risk of liver damage and increased dehydration. The effects of stimulants will also allow one to drink past a point where they might normally pass out, increasing the risk. If you do decide to do this then you should set a limit of how much you will drink each hour and stick to it, bearing in mind that you will feel the alcohol and the stimulant less.
- **GHB** / **GBL** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of sedatives. If the stimulant wears off first then the depressant effects of the GHB/GBL may overcome the user and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Opioids** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of opiates. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the patient and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Cocaine** - The rewarding effects of cocaine are mediated by DAT inhibition, and an increase of exocytosis of dopamine through the cell membrane. Amphetamine reverses the direction of DAT and the direction vesicular transports within the cell by a pH mediated mechanism of displacement, thus excludes the regular mechanism of dopamine release through means of exocytosis because the effects Na+/K+ ATPase are inhibited. You will find cardiac effects with the combination of cocaine and amphetamine due to a SERT mediated mechanism from the subsequent activation of 5-HT2B, which is an effect of serotonin-related valvulopathy. Amphetamines generally cause hypertension in models of abuse, and this combination can increase the chances of syncope due to turbulent blood flow during valve operation. The rewarding mechanisms of cocaine are reversed by administration of amphetamine.
- **Cannabis** - Stimulants increase [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) levels and the risk of [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) and [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) which can lead to negative experiences.
- **Caffeine** - This combination of stimulants is generally considered unnecessary and may increase strain on the heart, as well as potentially causing anxiety and physical discomfort.
- **Tramadol** - Tramadol and stimulants both increase the risk of seizures.
- **DXM** - Both substances raise heart rate, in extreme cases, panic attacks caused by these substances have led to more serious heart issues.
- **Ketamine** - Combining amphetamine and ketamine may result in psychoses that resemble schizophrenia, but not worse than the psychoses produced by either substance alone, but this is debatable. This is due to amphetamines ability to attenuated the disruption of working memory caused by ketamine. Amphetamine alone may result in grandiosity, paranoia, or somatic delusions with little to no effect on negative symptoms. Ketamine, however, will result in thought disorders, disruption of executive functioning, and delusions due to a modification of conception. These mechanisms are due to an increase of dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway caused by amphetamine due to its pharmacology effecting dopamine, and due to a disruption of dopaminergic functioning in the mesocortical pathways via NMDA antagonism effects of ketamine. Combining the two, you may expect mainly thought disorder along with positive symptoms.
- **PCP** - Increases risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states.
- **Methoxetamine** - Increases risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states.
- **Psychedelics** (e.g. ***[LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin)*** ) - Increases risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . 
- **25x-NBOMe** - Amphetamines and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation that when combined they can result in tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction and, in extreme cases, heart failure. The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants are also not good in combination with psychedelics as they can lead to unpleasant thought loops. NBOMes are known to cause seizures and stimulants can increase this risk.
- **2C-T-x** - Suspected of mild MAOI properties. May increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
- **5-MeO-xxT** - Suspected of mild MAOI properties. May increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
- **DOx**
- **aMT** - aMT has MAOI properties which may interact unfavorably with amphetamines.
- **MAOIs** - MAO-B inhibitors can increase the potency and duration of phenethylamines unpredictably. MAO-A inhibitors with amphetamine can lead to hypertensive crises.

## Effects
The release of the endogenous neurotransmitters noradrenalin and dopamine produced by the use of amphetamine can cause a feeling of increased performance, an increase in self-esteem, an increase in body temperature, the suppression of tiredness, hunger and thirst, an increased willingness to take risks and a suppressed feeling of pain, and can lead to euphoria as well as an increased urge to talk (babble flash).

## Dosage
Because of the varying purity (the amphetamine content varies from almost 0 % to almost 100 %!), dosing is difficult and the risk of overdose is high. Doses of more than 25 mg of pure amphetamine increase the negative effects. A dose of 50 mg/night should be the maximum, whether snorted or swallowed.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Tremors, restlessness, nausea, palpitations and cardiac arrhythmias, sleep disturbances, headaches, nervousness, irritability, loss of appetite, aggressive behaviour and, in combination with alcohol, danger of alcohol poisoning. At high doses: hallucinations, circulatory failure, strokes as well as kidney, liver and heart failure and states of deep unconsciousness. An often underestimated danger is the rise in body temperature, which can lead to dehydration of the body. In high doses, acute amphetamine psychosis can occur. Signs of this are hallucinations in the form of colour spots and with features of schizophrenia. The risk of such an acute mental disorder increases with consumption over several days and/or if high doses are taken and food intake and sleep are neglected over a longer period of time. Such an experience usually normalises after sufficient sleep. During and after coming down: extreme need for sleep, exhaustion, strong feeling of hunger,depressive mood, irritability, etc.

### Long-term Risks
There is a risk of addiction with psychological symptoms, especially if the use takes on a (performance-enhancing) function in everyday life (e.g. at work) or physical/psychological exhaustion is combated with amphetamine. Frequent use of amphetamine not infrequently leads to physical deficiency symptoms (e.g. calcium deficiency, which can lead to bone and tooth problems) and to psychological problems such as dejection or listlessness. Regular and high-dose use can lead to constant restlessness (but also persistent fatigue), sleep and circulatory disorders as well as anxiety disorders up to persistent amphetamine psychosis with paranoid delusions. In addition, high blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmias, weight loss, skin inflammations ("speed pimples"), stomach problems as well as liver and kidney damage and cramps are possible. Snorting damages the nasal mucous membranes and the nasal septum, swallowing damages the stomach mucous membranes. Chronic consumption also favours brain haemorrhages and strokes with sudden paralysis.

## Safer Use
- Dose low. Think about how long you want to be awake before you take it! Do not suppress your need for sleep.
- The lowest-risk form of amphetamine use is to swallow it.
- Eat enough after consumption to prevent weight loss.
- Drink enough (non-alcoholic drinks).
- Take extra vitamin C and D and minerals (iron, calcium and magnesium) with frequent use.
- Follow the safer-sniffing rules when sniffing.
- Refrain from mixed consumption! Make sure to take breaks from consumption.
- Mentally ill persons, persons with high blood pressure, liver and kidney diseases, diabetics and pregnant women should refrain from using amphetamines.
- It is better not to wear headgear (danger of overheating!).
- Amphetamine pastes should always be well dried before consumption.

## Adulterants & Extenders

In both powders and pastes, the amphetamine is chemically present as sulphate. Pastes were not sufficiently dried after production or were subsequently brought into paste form with a liquid extender. These liquid extenders are solvents (e.g. isopropyl alcohol or phenylacetone) which are toxic. Therefore, amphetamine pastes should always be well dried before consumption!

### Common Adulterants

**Synthesis Byproducts**
In addition to DPIA (bis-amphetamine or di(beta-phenylisopropyl)amines), these were 4-methyl-5-phenylpyrimidine and numerous other synthesis by-products.

**Dimethylterephthalate**
Dimethyl terephthalate is a basic material for the technical production of polyesters, for example polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or polybutylene terephthalate (PBT). It is also used in the production of polyester resins for films, lacquers and adhesives and of 1,4-dimethylolcyclohexane. The abbreviation for dimethyl terephthalate is DMT, it is possible that there is confusion here with Dimethyltryptamine whose abbreviation is also DMT.

**Amitriptyline**
Amitriptyline is approved for the treatment of depression and is used for all forms of depressive disorders. Amitriptyline is also approved for the long-term treatment of pain.

**Phenylacetone**
Phenylacetone (1-phenyl-2-probanone) is a colourless to pale yellow liquid with a strong, characteristic odour. Phenylacetone is used in the chemical industry for synthesis purposes; it can be used to produce amphetamine by means of reductive amination. Phenylacetone is highly flammable and toxic. It is both a synthesis by-product and a potential extender; the powdered amphetamine sulphate can be reliquefied and the product sold as amphetamine paste.

**4-MeA**
4-MeA is a stimulant that causes a release of the monoamine neurotransmitters. Similar to MDMA, these are dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin.

**Caffeine**
Alkaloid found in coffee beans, tea and mate leaves, kola nuts and guarana seeds.

**4-FA**
4-FA (1-(4-fluorophenyl)propan-2-amine) belongs to the phentylamine family (related to methamphetamine, cathinone and methcathinone).

  "thedrugclassroom": `# Adderall
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/adderall/*

Adderall is a combination of dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine that is commonly prescribed for ADHD. It effectively combats ADHD in many people, and in healthy users, it can provide an acute cognitive boost. Because of its cognition enhancing and stimulant properties, adderall is commonly used by students and workers.

In normal medical settings with a common medical dose, adderall doesn’t appear to be notably harmful and it appears useful (at least on a time scale of 1-2 years) in those with ADHD.

The drug can provide wakefulness and improve attentiveness, motivation, cognitive performance, and physical performance. Outside of medical settings, tolerance will usually kick in quickly and remove many of the beneficial effects.

  "tripsit-wiki": `# Amphetamine

*Source: https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Amphetamine*

Amphetamine is a CNS stimulant, producing mild euphoria and an abundance of energy. Amphetamines include both the specific chemical 'amphetamine' and the general class of chemicals which share structural similaries. Amphetamines generally cause strong physical and mental stimulation, keeping users awake and alert for many hours, and some amphetamines cause mood lift / euphoria. Because they increase wakefulness, various amphetamines have been used by the military, by pilots, truck drivers, and other workers to keep functioning past their normal limits.

Amphetamine was discovered in 1887 and exists as two enantiomers: levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Amphetamine properly refers to the racemic free base, or equal parts of the enantiomers levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine in their pure amine forms. Nonetheless, the term is frequently used informally to refer to any combination of the enantiomers, or to either of them alone.

## Dosage

Depending on purity, amphetamine doses **will** vary. Branded amphetamine, like [Adderall](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Adderall), knows similar yet better documented and thus more predictable doses.

  "wikipedia": `# Amphetamine
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine*

Amphetamine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant that is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy, and obesity; it is also used to treat binge eating disorder in the form of its inactive prodrug lisdexamfetamine. Amphetamine was discovered as a chemical in 1887 by Lazăr Edeleanu, and then as a drug in the late 1920s. It exists as two enantiomers: levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Amphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical, the racemic free base, which is equal parts of the two enantiomers in their pure amine forms. The term is frequently used informally to refer to any combination of the enantiomers, or to either of them alone. Historically, it has been used to treat nasal congestion and depression. Amphetamine is also used as an athletic performance enhancer and cognitive enhancer, and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant. It is a prescription drug in many countries, and unauthorized possession and distribution of amphetamine are often tightly controlled due to the significant health risks associated with recreational use.
The first amphetamine pharmaceutical was Benzedrine, a brand which was used to treat a variety of conditions. Pharmaceutical amphetamine is prescribed as racemic amphetamine, Adderall, dextroamphetamine, or the inactive prodrug lisdexamfetamine. Amphetamine increases monoamine and excitatory neurotransmission in the brain, with its most pronounced effects targeting the norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitter systems.
At therapeutic doses, amphetamine causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. It induces physical effects such as improved reaction time, fatigue resistance, decreased appetite, elevated heart rate, and increased muscle strength. Larger doses of amphetamine may impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. Addiction is a serious risk with heavy recreational amphetamine use, but is unlikely to occur from long-term medical use at therapeutic doses. Very high doses can result in psychosis (e.g., hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia) which rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use. Recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses and carry a far greater risk of serious side effects.
Amphetamine belongs to the phenethylamine class. It is also the parent compound of its own structural class, the substituted amphetamines, which includes prominent substances such as bupropion, cathinone, MDMA, and methamphetamine. As a member of the phenethylamine class, amphetamine is also chemically related to the naturally occurring trace amine neuromodulators, specifically phenethylamine and N-methylphenethylamine, both of which are produced within the human body. Phenethylamine is the parent compound of amphetamine, while N-methylphenethylamine is a positional isomer of amphetamine that differs only in the placement of the methyl group.

## Uses

### Medical

Amphetamine is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy, obesity, and, in the form of lisdexamfetamine, binge eating disorder. It is sometimes prescribed off-label for its past medical indications, particularly for depression and chronic pain.

#### ADHD

Long-term amphetamine exposure at sufficiently high doses in some animal species is known to produce abnormal dopamine system development or nerve damage, but, in humans with ADHD, long-term use of pharmaceutical amphetamines at therapeutic doses appears to improve brain development and nerve growth. Reviews of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies suggest that long-term treatment with amphetamine decreases abnormalities in brain structure and function found in subjects with ADHD, and improves function in several parts of the brain, such as the right caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia.
Reviews of clinical stimulant research have established the safety and effectiveness of long-term continuous amphetamine use for the treatment of ADHD. Randomized controlled trials of continuous stimulant therapy for the treatment of ADHD spanning 2 years have demonstrated treatment effectiveness and safety. Two reviews have indicated that long-term continuous stimulant therapy for ADHD is effective for reducing the core symptoms of ADHD (i.e., hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity), enhancing quality of life and academic achievement, and producing improvements in a large number of functional outcomes across 9 categories of outcomes related to academics, antisocial behavior, driving, non-medicinal drug use, obesity, occupation, self-esteem, service use (i.e., academic, occupational, health, financial, and legal services), and social function. Additionally, a 2024 meta-analytic systematic review reported moderate improvements in quality of life when amphetamine treatment is used for ADHD. One review highlighted a nine-month randomized controlled trial of amphetamine treatment for ADHD in children that found an average increase of 4.5 IQ points, continued increases in attention, and continued decreases in disruptive behaviors and hyperactivity. Another review indicated that, based upon the longest follow-up studies conducted to date, lifetime stimulant therapy that begins during childhood is continuously effective for controlling ADHD symptoms and reduces the risk of developing a substance use disorder as an adult. 
Models of ADHD suggest that it is associated with functional impairments in some of the brain's neurotransmitter systems; these functional impairments involve impaired dopamine neurotransmission in the mesocorticolimbic projection and norepinephrine neurotransmission in the noradrenergic projections from the locus coeruleus to the prefrontal cortex. Stimulants like methylphenidate and amphetamine are effective in treating ADHD because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these systems. Approximately 80% of those who use these stimulants see improvements in ADHD symptoms. Children with ADHD who use stimulant medications generally have better relationships with peers and family members, perform better in school, are less distractible and impulsive, and have longer attention spans. The Cochrane reviews on the treatment of ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults with pharmaceutical amphetamines stated that short-term studies have demonstrated that these drugs decrease the severity of symptoms, but they have higher discontinuation rates than non-stimulant medications due to their adverse side effects. However, a 2025 meta-analytic systematic review of 113 randomized controlled trials found that stimulant medications were the only intervention with robust short-term efficacy, and were associated with lower all-cause treatment discontinuation rates than non-stimulant medications (e.g., atomoxetine). A Cochrane review on the treatment of ADHD in children with tic disorders such as Tourette syndrome indicated that stimulants in general do not make tics worse, but high doses of dextroamphetamine could exacerbate tics in some individuals.

#### Binge eating disorder

Binge eating disorder (BED) is characterized by recurrent and persistent episodes of compulsive binge eating. These episodes are often accompanied by marked distress and a feeling of loss of control over eating. The pathophysiology of BED is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve dysfunctional dopaminergic reward circuitry along the cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical loop. As of July 2024, lisdexamfetamine is the only USFDA- and TGA-approved pharmacotherapy for BED. Evidence suggests that lisdexamfetamine's treatment efficacy in BED is underpinned at least in part by a psychopathological overlap between BED and ADHD, with the latter conceptualized as a cognitive control disorder that also benefits from treatment with lisdexamfetamine.

Lisdexamfetamine's therapeutic effects for BED primarily involve direct action in the central nervous system after conversion to its pharmacologically active metabolite, dextroamphetamine. Centrally, dextroamphetamine increases neurotransmitter activity of dopamine and norepinephrine in prefrontal cortical regions that regulate cognitive control of behavior. Similar to its therapeutic effect in ADHD, dextroamphetamine enhances cognitive control and may reduce impulsivity in patients with BED by enhancing the cognitive processes responsible for overriding prepotent feeding responses that precede binge eating episodes. Dextroamphetamine is also a full agonist of trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a G-protein coupled receptor that regulates monoaminergic systems in the brain; Activation of TAAR1 may restore impaired dopaminergic signaling in the prefrontal cortex and thereby correct deficits in inhibitory control associated with binge eating behaviors.  Beyond central nervous system mechanisms, peripheral actions of dextroamphetamine may also contribute to its treatment efficacy in BED. Through noradrenergic signaling pathways, dextroamphetamine triggers lipolysis in adipose fat cells, thereby prompting the release of triglycerides into blood plasma to be utilized as a fuel substrate. Moreover, dextroamphetamine induces synthesis of the cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), a peptide neurotransmitter that regulates food intake. Within the hypothalamus, CART interacts with leptin signaling pathways to promote appetite suppression. Dextroamphetamine also activates TAAR1 in peripheral organs along the gastrointestinal tract that are involved in the regulation of food intake and body weight. Together, these actions confer an anorexigenic effect that promotes satiety in response to feeding and may decrease binge eating as a secondary effect. While lisdexamfetamine's anorexigenic effects contribute to its efficacy in BED, evidence indicates that the enhancement of cognitive control is necessary and sufficient for addressing the disorder's underlying psychopathology. This view is supported by the failure of anti-obesity medications and other appetite suppressants to significantly reduce BED symptom severity, despite their capacity to induce weight loss.
Medical reviews of randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that lisdexamfetamine, at doses between 50–70 mg, is safe and effective for the treatment of moderate-to-severe BED in adults. These reviews suggest that lisdexamfetamine is persistently effective at treating BED and is associated with significant reductions in the number of binge eating days and binge eating episodes per week. Furthermore, a meta-analytic systematic review highlighted an open-label, 12-month extension safety and tolerability study that reported lisdexamfetamine remained effective at reducing the number of binge eating days for the duration of the study. In addition, both a review and a meta-analytic systematic review found lisdexamfetamine to be superior to placebo in several secondary outcome measures, including persistent binge eating cessation, reduction of obsessive-compulsive related binge eating symptoms, reduction of body-weight, and reduction of triglycerides. Lisdexamfetamine, like all pharmaceutical amphetamines, has direct appetite suppressant effects that may be therapeutically useful in both BED and its comorbidities. Based on reviews of neuroimaging studies involving BED-diagnosed participants, therapeutic neuroplasticity in dopaminergic and noradrenergic pathways from long-term use of lisdexamfetamine may be implicated in lasting improvements in the regulation of eating behaviors that are observed.

#### Narcolepsy

Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep-wake disorder that is associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and sleep paralysis. Patients with narcolepsy are diagnosed as either type 1 or type 2, with only the former presenting cataplexy symptoms. Type 1 narcolepsy results from the loss of approximately 70,000 orexin-releasing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, leading to significantly reduced cerebrospinal orexin levels; this reduction is a diagnostic biomarker for type 1 narcolepsy. Lateral hypothalamic orexin neurons innervate every component of the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS), which includes noradrenergic, dopaminergic, histaminergic, and serotonergic nuclei that promote wakefulness.
Amphetamine's therapeutic mode of action in narcolepsy primarily involves increasing monoamine neurotransmitter activity in the ARAS. This includes noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus, dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, histaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus, and serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Dextroamphetamine, the more dopaminergic enantiomer of amphetamine, is particularly effective at promoting wakefulness because dopamine release has the greatest influence on cortical activation and cognitive arousal, relative to other monoamines. In contrast, levoamphetamine may have a greater effect on cataplexy, a symptom more sensitive to the effects of norepinephrine and serotonin. Noradrenergic and serotonergic nuclei in the ARAS are involved in the regulation of the REM sleep cycle and function as "REM-off" cells, with amphetamine's effect on norepinephrine and serotonin contributing to the suppression of REM sleep and a possible reduction of cataplexy at high doses.
The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) 2021 clinical practice guideline conditionally recommends dextroamphetamine for the treatment of both type 1 and type 2 narcolepsy. Treatment with pharmaceutical amphetamines is generally less preferred relative to other stimulants (e.g., modafinil) and is considered a third-line treatment option. Medical reviews indicate that amphetamine is safe and effective for the treatment of narcolepsy. Amphetamine appears to be most effective at improving symptoms associated with hypersomnolence, with three reviews finding clinically significant reductions in daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy. Additionally, these reviews suggest that amphetamine may dose-dependently improve cataplexy symptoms. However, the quality of evidence for these findings is low and is consequently reflected in the AASM's conditional recommendation for dextroamphetamine as a treatment option for narcolepsy.

### Enhancing performance

#### Cognitive performance

In 2015, a systematic review and a meta-analysis of high quality clinical trials found that, when used at low (therapeutic) doses, amphetamine produces modest yet unambiguous improvements in cognition, including working memory, long-term episodic memory, inhibitory control, and some aspects of attention, in normal healthy adults; these cognition-enhancing effects of amphetamine are known to be partially mediated through the indirect activation of both dopamine D1 receptor and α2-adrenergic receptor in the prefrontal cortex. A systematic review from 2014 found that low doses of amphetamine also improve memory consolidation, in turn leading to improved recall of information. Therapeutic doses of amphetamine also enhance cortical network efficiency, an effect which mediates improvements in working memory in all individuals. Amphetamine and other ADHD stimulants also improve task saliency (motivation to perform a task) and increase arousal (wakefulness), in turn promoting goal-directed behavior. Stimulants such as amphetamine can improve performance on difficult and boring tasks and are used by some students as a study and test-taking aid. Based upon studies of self-reported illicit stimulant use, 5–35% of college students use diverted ADHD stimulants, which are primarily used for enhancement of academic performance rather than as recreational drugs. However, high amphetamine doses that are above the therapeutic range can interfere with working memory and other aspects of cognitive control.

#### Physical performance

Amphetamine is used by some athletes for its psychological and athletic performance-enhancing effects, such as increased endurance and alertness; however, non-medical amphetamine use is prohibited at sporting events that are regulated by collegiate, national, and international anti-doping agencies. In healthy people at oral therapeutic doses, amphetamine has been shown to increase muscle strength, acceleration, athletic performance in anaerobic conditions, and endurance (i.e., it delays the onset of fatigue), while improving reaction time. Amphetamine improves endurance and reaction time primarily through reuptake inhibition and release of dopamine in the central nervous system. Amphetamine and other dopaminergic drugs also increase power output at fixed levels of perceived exertion by overriding a "safety switch", allowing the core temperature limit to increase in order to access a reserve capacity that is normally off-limits. At therapeutic doses, the adverse effects of amphetamine do not impede athletic performance; however, at much higher doses, amphetamine can induce effects that severely impair performance, such as rapid muscle breakdown and elevated body temperature.

### Recreational

Amphetamine, specifically the more dopaminergic dextrorotatory enantiomer (dextroamphetamine), is also used recreationally as a euphoriant and aphrodisiac, and like other amphetamines; is used as a club drug for its energetic and euphoric high. Dextroamphetamine (d-amphetamine) is considered to have a high potential for misuse in a recreational manner since individuals typically report feeling euphoric, more alert, and more energetic after taking the drug. A notable part of the 1960s mod subculture in the UK was recreational amphetamine use, which was used to fuel all-night dances at clubs like Manchester's Twisted Wheel. Newspaper reports described dancers emerging from clubs at 5 a.m. with dilated pupils. Mods used the drug for stimulation and alertness, which they viewed as different from the intoxication caused by alcohol and other drugs. Dr. Andrew Wilson argues that for a significant minority, "amphetamines symbolised the smart, on-the-ball, cool image" and that they sought "stimulation not intoxication [...] greater awareness, not escape" and "confidence and articulacy" rather than the "drunken rowdiness of previous generations." Dextroamphetamine's dopaminergic (rewarding) properties affect the mesocorticolimbic circuit; a group of neural structures responsible for incentive salience (i.e., "wanting"; desire or craving for a reward and motivation), positive reinforcement and positively-valenced emotions, particularly ones involving pleasure. Large recreational doses of dextroamphetamine may produce symptoms of dextroamphetamine overdose. Recreational users sometimes open dexedrine capsules and crush the contents in order to insufflate (snort) it or subsequently dissolve it in water and inject it. Immediate-release formulations have higher potential for abuse via insufflation (snorting) or intravenous injection due to a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile and easy crushability (especially tablets). Injection into the bloodstream can be dangerous because insoluble fillers within the tablets can block small blood vessels. Chronic overuse of dextroamphetamine can lead to severe drug dependence, resulting in withdrawal symptoms when drug use stops.

## Contraindications

According to the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), amphetamine is contraindicated in people with a history of drug abuse, cardiovascular disease, severe agitation, or severe anxiety. It is also contraindicated in individuals with advanced arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), glaucoma (increased eye pressure), hyperthyroidism (excessive production of thyroid hormone), or moderate to severe hypertension. These agencies indicate that people who have experienced allergic reactions to other stimulants or who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) should not take amphetamine, although safe concurrent use of amphetamine and monoamine oxidase inhibitors has been documented. These agencies also state that anyone with anorexia nervosa, bipolar disorder, depression, hypertension, liver or kidney problems, mania, psychosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, seizures, thyroid problems, tics, or Tourette syndrome should monitor their symptoms while taking amphetamine. Evidence from human studies indicates that therapeutic amphetamine use does not cause developmental abnormalities in the fetus or newborns (i.e., it is not a human teratogen), but amphetamine abuse does pose risks to the fetus. Amphetamine has also been shown to pass into breast milk, so the IPCS and the FDA advise mothers to avoid breastfeeding when using it. Due to the potential for reversible growth impairments, the FDA advises monitoring the height and weight of children and adolescents prescribed an amphetamine pharmaceutical.

## Adverse effects

The adverse side effects of amphetamine are many and varied, and the amount of amphetamine used is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity of adverse effects. Amphetamine products such as Adderall, Dexedrine, and their generic equivalents are currently approved by the U.S. FDA for long-term therapeutic use. Recreational use of amphetamine generally involves much larger doses, which have a greater risk of serious adverse drug effects than dosages used for therapeutic purposes.

### Physical

Cardiovascular side effects can include hypertension or hypotension from a vasovagal response, Raynaud's phenomenon (reduced blood flow to the hands and feet), and tachycardia (increased heart rate). Sexual side effects in males may include erectile dysfunction, frequent erections, or prolonged erections. Gastrointestinal side effects may include abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and nausea. Other potential physical side effects include appetite loss, blurred vision, dry mouth, excessive grinding of the teeth, nosebleed, profuse sweating, rhinitis medicamentosa (drug-induced nasal congestion), reduced seizure threshold, tics (a type of movement disorder), and weight loss. Dangerous physical side effects are rare at typical pharmaceutical doses.
Amphetamine stimulates the medullary respiratory centers, producing faster and deeper breaths. In a normal person at therapeutic doses, this effect is usually not noticeable, but when respiration is already compromised, it may be evident. Amphetamine also induces contraction in the urinary bladder sphincter, the muscle which controls urination, which can result in difficulty urinating. This effect can be useful in treating bed wetting and loss of bladder control. The effects of amphetamine on the gastrointestinal tract are unpredictable. If intestinal activity is high, amphetamine may reduce gastrointestinal motility (the rate at which content moves through the digestive system); however, amphetamine may increase motility when the smooth muscle of the tract is relaxed. Amphetamine also has a slight analgesic effect and can enhance the pain relieving effects of opioids.
FDA-commissioned studies from 2011 indicate that in children, young adults, and adults there is no association between serious adverse cardiovascular events (sudden death, heart attack, and stroke) and the medical use of amphetamine or other ADHD stimulants. These findings were subsequently corroborated by a 2022 meta-analysis that sampled nearly four million participants, which found no association between therapeutic use of amphetamine and the development of cardiovascular disease in any age group. However, amphetamine pharmaceuticals are contraindicated in individuals with preexisting cardiovascular disease.

### Psychological

At normal therapeutic doses, the most common psychological side effects of amphetamine include increased alertness, apprehension, concentration, initiative, self-confidence and sociability, mood swings (elated mood followed by mildly depressed mood), insomnia or wakefulness, and decreased sense of fatigue. Less common side effects include anxiety, change in libido, grandiosity, irritability, repetitive or obsessive behaviors, and restlessness; these effects depend on the user's personality and current mental state. Amphetamine psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia) can occur in heavy users. Although very rare, this psychosis can also occur at therapeutic doses during long-term therapy. According to the FDA, "there is no systematic evidence" that stimulants produce aggressive behavior or hostility.
Amphetamine has also been shown to produce a conditioned place preference in humans taking therapeutic doses, meaning that individuals acquire a preference for spending time in places where they have previously used amphetamine.

### Reinforcement disorders

#### Addiction

Addiction is a serious risk with heavy recreational amphetamine use, but is unlikely to occur from long-term medical use at therapeutic doses; in fact, lifetime stimulant therapy for ADHD that begins during childhood reduces the risk of developing substance use disorders as an adult.  Pathological overactivation of the mesolimbic pathway, a dopamine pathway that connects the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens, plays a central role in amphetamine addiction. Individuals who frequently self-administer high doses of amphetamine have a high risk of developing an amphetamine addiction, since chronic use at high doses gradually increases the level of accumbal ΔFosB, a "molecular switch" and "master control protein" for addiction. Once nucleus accumbens ΔFosB is sufficiently overexpressed, it begins to increase the severity of addictive behavior (i.e., compulsive drug-seeking) with further increases in its expression. While there are currently no effective drugs for treating amphetamine addiction, regularly engaging in sustained aerobic exercise appears to reduce the risk of developing such an addiction. Exercise therapy improves clinical treatment outcomes and may be used as an adjunct therapy with behavioral therapies for addiction.

#### Biomolecular mechanisms

Chronic use of amphetamine at excessive doses causes alterations in gene expression in the mesocorticolimbic projection, which arise through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms. The most important transcription factors that produce these alterations are Delta FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (ΔFosB), cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). ΔFosB is the most significant biomolecular mechanism in addiction because ΔFosB overexpression (i.e., an abnormally high level of gene expression which produces a pronounced gene-related phenotype) in the D1-type medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens is necessary and sufficient for many of the neural adaptations and regulates multiple behavioral effects (e.g., reward sensitization and escalating drug self-administration) involved in addiction. Once ΔFosB is sufficiently overexpressed, it induces an addictive state that becomes increasingly more severe with further increases in ΔFosB expression. It has been implicated in addictions to alcohol, cannabinoids, cocaine, methylphenidate, nicotine, opioids, phencyclidine, propofol, and substituted amphetamines, among others.
ΔJunD, a transcription factor, and G9a, a histone methyltransferase enzyme, both oppose the function of ΔFosB and inhibit increases in its expression. Sufficiently overexpressing ΔJunD in the nucleus accumbens with viral vectors can completely block many of the neural and behavioral alterations seen in chronic drug abuse (i.e., the alterations mediated by ΔFosB). Similarly, accumbal G9a hyperexpression results in markedly increased histone 3 lysine residue 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) and blocks the induction of ΔFosB-mediated neural and behavioral plasticity by chronic drug use, which occurs via H3K9me2-mediated repression of transcription factors for ΔFosB and H3K9me2-mediated repression of various ΔFosB transcriptional targets (e.g., CDK5). ΔFosB also plays an important role in regulating behavioral responses to natural rewards, such as palatable food, sex, and exercise. Since both natural rewards and addictive drugs induce the expression of ΔFosB (i.e., they cause the brain to produce more of it), chronic acquisition of these rewards can result in a similar pathological state of addiction. Consequently, ΔFosB is the most significant factor involved in both amphetamine addiction and amphetamine-induced sexual addictions, which are compulsive sexual behaviors that result from excessive sexual activity and amphetamine use. These sexual addictions are associated with a dopamine dysregulation syndrome which occurs in some patients taking dopaminergic drugs.
The effects of amphetamine on gene regulation are both dose- and route-dependent. Most of the research on gene regulation and addiction is based upon animal studies with intravenous amphetamine administration at very high doses. The few studies that have used equivalent (weight-adjusted) human therapeutic doses and oral administration show that these changes, if they occur, are relatively minor. This suggests that medical use of amphetamine does not significantly affect gene regulation.

##### Pharmacological treatments

As of December 2019, there is no effective pharmacotherapy for amphetamine addiction. Reviews from 2015 and 2016 indicated that TAAR1-selective agonists have significant therapeutic potential as a treatment for psychostimulant addictions; however, as of February 2016, the only compounds which are known to function as TAAR1-selective agonists are experimental drugs. Amphetamine addiction is largely mediated through increased activation of dopamine receptors and co-localized NMDA receptors in the nucleus accumbens; magnesium ions inhibit NMDA receptors by blocking the receptor calcium channel. One review suggested that, based upon animal testing, pathological (addiction-inducing) psychostimulant use significantly reduces the level of intracellular magnesium throughout the brain. Supplemental magnesium treatment has been shown to reduce amphetamine self-administration (i.e., doses given to oneself) in humans, but it is not an effective monotherapy for amphetamine addiction.
A systematic review and meta-analysis from 2019 assessed the efficacy of 17 different pharmacotherapies used in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for amphetamine and methamphetamine addiction; it found only low-strength evidence that methylphenidate might reduce amphetamine or methamphetamine self-administration. There was low- to moderate-strength evidence of no benefit for most of the other medications used in RCTs, which included antidepressants (bupropion, mirtazapine, sertraline), antipsychotics (aripiprazole), anticonvulsants (topiramate, baclofen, gabapentin), naltrexone, varenicline, citicoline, ondansetron, prometa, riluzole, atomoxetine, dextroamphetamine, and modafinil.

##### Behavioral treatments

A 2018 systematic review and network meta-analysis of 50 trials involving 12 different psychosocial interventions for amphetamine, methamphetamine, or cocaine addiction found that combination therapy with both contingency management and community reinforcement approach had the highest efficacy (i.e., abstinence rate) and acceptability (i.e., lowest dropout rate). Other treatment modalities examined in the analysis included monotherapy with contingency management or community reinforcement approach, cognitive behavioral therapy, 12-step programs, non-contingent reward-based therapies, psychodynamic therapy, and other combination therapies involving these.
Additionally, research on the neurobiological effects of physical exercise suggests that daily aerobic exercise, especially endurance exercise (e.g., marathon running), prevents the development of drug addiction and is an effective adjunct therapy (i.e., a supplemental treatment) for amphetamine addiction. Exercise leads to better treatment outcomes when used as an adjunct treatment, particularly for psychostimulant addictions. In particular, aerobic exercise decreases psychostimulant self-administration, reduces the reinstatement (i.e., relapse) of drug-seeking, and induces increased dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) density in the striatum. This is the opposite of pathological stimulant use, which induces decreased striatal DRD2 density. One review noted that exercise may also prevent the development of a drug addiction by altering ΔFosB or c-Fos immunoreactivity in the striatum or other parts of the reward system.

#### Dependence and withdrawal

Drug tolerance develops rapidly in amphetamine abuse (i.e., recreational amphetamine use), so periods of extended abuse require increasingly larger doses of the drug in order to achieve the same effect.
According to a Cochrane review on withdrawal in individuals who compulsively use amphetamine and methamphetamine, "when chronic heavy users abruptly discontinue amphetamine use, many report a time-limited withdrawal syndrome that occurs within 24 hours of their last dose." This review noted that withdrawal symptoms in chronic, high-dose users are frequent, occurring in roughly 88% of cases, and persist for 3–4 weeks with a marked "crash" phase occurring during the first week. Amphetamine withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, drug craving, depressed mood, fatigue, increased appetite, increased movement or decreased movement, lack of motivation, sleeplessness or sleepiness, and lucid dreams. The review indicated that the severity of withdrawal symptoms is positively correlated with the age of the individual and the extent of their dependence.
According to a 2025 review, the discontinuation of amphetamine at therapeutic doses does not typically result in withdrawal symptoms. Discontinuation may unmask or cause a rebound of ADHD symptoms due to the cessation of treatment-related drug effects. In cases where mild withdrawal symptoms do occur, they can be avoided by tapering the dose. Unlike amphetamine abuse, where drug tolerance necessitates escalating doses to achieve the same effect, tolerance to clinically relevant doses of amphetamine plateaus after the initial titration period, and "drug holidays" (i.e., temporary treatment discontinuation) are not required to prevent the development of tolerance.

## Overdose

An amphetamine overdose can lead to many different symptoms, but is rarely fatal with appropriate care. The severity of overdose symptoms increases with dosage and decreases with drug tolerance to amphetamine. Tolerant individuals have been known to take as much as 5 grams of amphetamine in a day, which is roughly 100 times the maximum daily therapeutic dose. Symptoms of a moderate and extremely large overdose are listed below; fatal amphetamine poisoning usually also involves convulsions and coma. In 2013, overdose on amphetamine, methamphetamine, and other compounds implicated in an "amphetamine use disorder" resulted in an estimated 3,788 deaths worldwide (3,425–4,145 deaths, 95% confidence).

### Toxicity

In rodents and primates, sufficiently high doses of amphetamine cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity, or damage to dopamine neurons, which is characterized by dopamine terminal degeneration and reduced transporter and receptor function. There is no evidence that amphetamine is directly neurotoxic in humans. However, large doses of amphetamine may indirectly cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity as a result of hyperpyrexia, the excessive formation of reactive oxygen species, and increased autoxidation of dopamine. Animal models of neurotoxicity from high-dose amphetamine exposure indicate that the occurrence of hyperpyrexia (i.e., core body temperature ≥ 40 °C) is necessary for the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. Prolonged elevations of brain temperature above 40 °C likely promote the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity in laboratory animals by facilitating the production of reactive oxygen species, disrupting cellular protein function, and transiently increasing blood–brain barrier permeability.

### Psychosis

An amphetamine overdose can result in a stimulant psychosis that may involve a variety of symptoms, such as delusions and paranoia. A Cochrane review on treatment for amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, and methamphetamine psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. According to the same review, there is at least one trial that shows antipsychotic medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis. Psychosis rarely arises from therapeutic use.

## Drug interactions

Many types of substances are known to interact with amphetamine, resulting in altered drug action or metabolism of amphetamine, the interacting substance, or both. Inhibitors of enzymes that metabolize amphetamine (e.g., CYP2D6 and FMO3) will prolong its elimination half-life, meaning that its effects will last longer. Amphetamine also interacts with MAOIs, particularly monoamine oxidase A inhibitors, since both MAOIs and amphetamine increase plasma catecholamines (i.e., norepinephrine and dopamine); therefore, concurrent use of both is dangerous. Amphetamine modulates the activity of most psychoactive drugs. In particular, amphetamine may decrease the effects of sedatives and depressants and increase the effects of stimulants and antidepressants. Amphetamine may also decrease the effects of antihypertensives and antipsychotics due to its effects on blood pressure and dopamine respectively. Zinc supplementation may reduce the minimum effective dose of amphetamine when it is used for the treatment of ADHD. Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) like atomoxetine prevent norepinephrine release induced by amphetamines and have been found to reduce the stimulant, euphoriant, and sympathomimetic effects of dextroamphetamine in humans.
In general, there is no significant interaction when consuming amphetamine with food, but the pH of gastrointestinal content and urine affects the absorption and excretion of amphetamine, respectively. Acidic substances reduce the absorption of amphetamine and increase urinary excretion, and alkaline substances do the opposite. Due to the effect pH has on absorption, amphetamine also interacts with gastric acid reducers such as proton pump inhibitors and H2 antihistamines, which increase gastrointestinal pH (i.e., make it less acidic).

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Amphetamine exerts its behavioral effects by altering the use of monoamines as neuronal signals in the brain, primarily in catecholamine neurons in the reward and executive function pathways of the brain. The concentrations of the main neurotransmitters involved in reward circuitry and executive functioning, dopamine and norepinephrine, increase dramatically in a dose-dependent manner by amphetamine because of its effects on monoamine transporters. The reinforcing and motivational salience-promoting effects of amphetamine are due mostly to enhanced dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway. The euphoric and locomotor-stimulating effects of amphetamine are dependent upon the magnitude and speed by which it increases synaptic dopamine and norepinephrine concentrations in the striatum.
Amphetamine potentiates monoaminergic neurotransmission primarily by entering axon terminals either through active transport by monoamine transporters (DAT, NET, and SERT) or by passive diffusion across neuronal membranes. The uptake of amphetamine through these transporters competitively inhibits the reuptake of monoamine neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft, thereby elevating their synaptic concentrations. Once inside the neuronal cytosol, amphetamine initiates intracellular signaling cascades involving protein kinases, including protein kinase C (PKC) and Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKIIα), leading to the phosphorylation of specific monoamine transporters and modification of their activity. PKC-mediated phosphorylation can either reverse transporter function to facilitate neurotransmitter efflux into the synaptic cleft or induce transporter internalization, resulting in non-competitive inhibition of neurotransmitter reuptake. In contrast, CaMKIIα-mediated transporter phosphorylation selectively reverses DAT and NET to confer dopamine and norepinephrine efflux respectively, but unlike PKC does not terminate transporter function through internalization.
Amphetamine has been identified as a full agonist of trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a Gs-coupled and G13-coupled G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) discovered in 2001, which is important for regulation of brain monoamines. Several reviews have linked amphetamine's agonism at TAAR1 to modulation of monoamine transporter function and subsequent neurotransmitter efflux and reuptake inhibition at monoaminergic synapses. Activation of TAAR1 increases cAMPTooltip cyclic adenosine monophosphate production via adenylyl cyclase activation, which triggers protein kinase A (PKA)- and PKC-mediated transporter phosphorylation. Monoamine autoreceptors (e.g., D2 short, presynaptic α2, and presynaptic 5-HT1A) have the opposite effect of TAAR1, and together these receptors provide a regulatory system for monoamines. Notably, amphetamine and trace amines possess high binding affinities for TAAR1, but not for monoamine autoreceptors. Although TAAR1 is implicated in amphetamine-induced transporter phosphorylation, the magnitude of TAAR1-mediated monoamine release in humans remains unclear. Beyond its Gs-coupled receptor-mediated effects on monoamine transporter function, TAAR1 also opens G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels through a Gs-independent pathway, an action that reduces neuronal firing.
Amphetamine is also a substrate for the vesicular monoamine transporters VMAT1 and VMAT2. Under normal conditions, VMAT2 transports cytosolic monoamines into synaptic vesicles for storage and later exocytotic release. When amphetamine accumulates in the presynaptic terminal, it collapses the vesicular pH gradient and releases vesicular monoamines into the neuronal cytosol. These displaced monoamines expand the cytosolic pool available for reverse transport, thereby increasing the capacity for monoamine efflux beyond that achieved by amphetamine-mediated transporter phosphorylation alone. Although VMAT2 is recognized as a major target in amphetamine-induced monoamine release at higher doses, some reviews have challenged its relevance at therapeutic doses.
In addition to membrane and vesicular monoamine transporters, amphetamine also inhibits SLC1A1, SLC22A3, and SLC22A5. SLC1A1 is excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAAT3), a glutamate transporter located in neurons, SLC22A3 is an extraneuronal monoamine transporter that is present in astrocytes, and SLC22A5 is a high-affinity carnitine transporter. Amphetamine is known to strongly induce cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) gene expression, a neuropeptide involved in feeding behavior, stress, and reward, which induces observable increases in neuronal development and survival in vitro. The CART receptor has yet to be identified, but there is significant evidence that CART binds to a unique Gi/Go-coupled GPCR. Amphetamine also inhibits monoamine oxidases at very high doses, resulting in less monoamine and trace amine metabolism and consequently higher concentrations of synaptic monoamines. In humans, the only post-synaptic receptor at which amphetamine is known to bind is the 5-HT1A receptor, where it acts as an agonist with low micromolar affinity.
The full profile of amphetamine's short-term drug effects in humans is mostly derived through increased cellular communication or neurotransmission of dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, histamine, CART peptides, endogenous opioids, adrenocorticotropic hormone, corticosteroids, and glutamate, which it affects through interactions with CART, 5-HT1A, EAAT3, TAAR1, VMAT1, VMAT2, and possibly other biological targets. Amphetamine also activates seven human carbonic anhydrase enzymes, several of which are expressed in the human brain.
Dextroamphetamine displays higher binding affinity for DAT than levoamphetamine, whereas both enantiomers share comparable affinity at NET; Consequently, dextroamphetamine produces greater CNS stimulation than levoamphetamine, roughly three to four times more, but levoamphetamine has slightly stronger cardiovascular and peripheral effects. Dextroamphetamine is also a more potent agonist of TAAR1 than levoamphetamine.

#### Dopamine

In certain brain regions, amphetamine increases the concentration of dopamine in the synaptic cleft by modulating DAT through several overlapping processes. Amphetamine can enter the presynaptic neuron either through DAT or, to a lesser extent, by diffusing across the neuronal membrane directly. As a consequence of DAT uptake, amphetamine produces competitive reuptake inhibition at the transporter. Upon entering the presynaptic neuron, amphetamine provokes the release of Ca²⁺ from endoplasmic reticulum stores, an effect that raises intracellular calcium to levels sufficient for downstream kinase-dependent signalling. In parallel, amphetamine also increases intracellular cAMPTooltip cyclic adenosine monophosphate, which activates protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC), whilst elevated intracellular Ca²⁺ activates PKC alone. Phosphorylation of DAT by either kinase induces transporter internalization (non-competitive reuptake inhibition), but PKC-mediated phosphorylation alone induces the reversal of dopamine transport through DAT (i.e., dopamine efflux).
TAAR1 has been identified as a biomolecular target of amphetamine that initiates some of amphetamine's kinase-dependent signaling cascades. When TAAR1 signals via Gs-coupled receptors, intracellular cAMP increases through adenylyl cyclase activation and activates PKA and PKC, in turn phosphorylating DAT. TAAR1 also couples G-protein alpha subunit G13; when triggered by amphetamine, this pathway activates Ras homolog A (RhoA) and its downstream effector, Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK), an effect that internalizes both DAT and the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAT3. Transporter internalization via TAAR1's G13-coupled pathway is transient because Gs-cAMP-PKA signaling functionally inhibits RhoA's downstream activity; once intracellular cAMP sufficiently accumulates, PKA is activated and phosphorylates RhoA, thereby terminating ROCK-mediated transporter internalization. In addition to presynaptic actions that regulate DAT, TAAR1 activation exerts a somatodendritic inhibitory influence on dopamine output by reducing the firing rate of midbrain dopamine neurons via G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channels, an effect that can attenuate amphetamine's psychostimulant response. 
Amphetamine's effect on intracellular calcium is associated with DAT phosphorylation through Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CAMKIIα), in turn producing dopamine efflux. Because conventional PKC isoforms can be activated by Ca²⁺ and diacylglycerol, elevated intracellular calcium can promote PKC-dependent DAT phosphorylation independent of TAAR1.

Amphetamine is also a substrate for the presynaptic vesicular monoamine transporter, VMAT2. Following amphetamine uptake at VMAT2, amphetamine induces the collapse of the vesicular pH gradient, which results in a dose-dependent release of dopamine molecules from synaptic vesicles into the cytosol via dopamine efflux through VMAT2. Subsequently, the cytosolic dopamine molecules are released from the presynaptic neuron into the synaptic cleft via reverse transport at DAT.

#### Norepinephrine

Similar to dopamine, amphetamine dose-dependently increases the level of synaptic norepinephrine, the direct precursor of epinephrine. Amphetamine is believed to affect norepinephrine analogously to dopamine. In other words, amphetamine induces competitive NET reuptake inhibition, non-competitive reuptake inhibition and efflux at phosphorylated NET via PKC activation, CAMKIIα-mediated NET efflux without internalization, and norepinephrine release from VMAT2.

#### Serotonin

Amphetamine exerts analogous, yet less pronounced, effects on serotonin as on dopamine and norepinephrine. Amphetamine affects serotonin via VMAT2 and is thought to phosphorylate SERT via a PKC-dependent signaling cascade. Like dopamine, amphetamine has low, micromolar affinity at the human 5-HT1A receptor.

#### Other neurotransmitters, peptides, hormones, and enzymes

Acute amphetamine administration in humans increases endogenous opioid release in several brain structures in the reward system. Extracellular levels of glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, have been shown to increase in the striatum following exposure to amphetamine. This increase in extracellular glutamate presumably occurs via the amphetamine-induced internalization of EAAT3, a glutamate reuptake transporter, in dopamine neurons. This internalization is mediated by RhoA activation and its downstream effector ROCK. Amphetamine also induces the selective release of histamine from mast cells and efflux from histaminergic neurons through VMAT2. Acute amphetamine administration can also increase adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosteroid levels in blood plasma by stimulating the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis.
In December 2017, the first study assessing the interaction between amphetamine and human carbonic anhydrase enzymes was published; of the eleven carbonic anhydrase enzymes it examined, it found that amphetamine potently activates seven, four of which are highly expressed in the human brain, with low nanomolar through low micromolar activating effects. Based upon preclinical research, cerebral carbonic anhydrase activation has cognition-enhancing effects; but, based upon the clinical use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, carbonic anhydrase activation in other tissues may be associated with adverse effects, such as ocular activation exacerbating glaucoma.

#### Sex-dependent differences

Clinical research indicates that the pharmacological effects of amphetamine may vary depending on sex and menstrual cycle phase, possibly due to fluctuations in female sex hormones. In menstruating individuals, subjective and behavioral responses to amphetamine are heightened during the follicular phase (i.e., when estrogen levels are higher), and reduced during the luteal phase (i.e., when progesterone is elevated). Reviews of human studies have also noted that men typically report stronger positive subjective responses to amphetamine compared to women tested during the luteal phase, whereas these sex differences are absent when women are tested during the follicular phase; subjective responses to amphetamine appear to correlate positively with plasma or salivary estrogen concentrations. Moreover, neuroimaging studies have reported significant sex differences in the neural response to amphetamine in humans, including differences in dopamine release within the striatum and other brain regions.
Preclinical studies have also produced findings of sex-dependent differences in drug response to amphetamine. In contrast to human studies, adult female rats exhibit markedly greater dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and more pronounced behavioral effects from amphetamine administration relative to males, effects that may be modulated by fluctuating estradiol levels across the estrous cycle or more broadly by adult gonadal hormones.
Some evidence suggests that amphetamine interacts more strongly with female sex hormones than other psychostimulants such as methylphenidate, which may result in relatively greater variability in drug response across the menstrual cycle. Although preliminary observational evidence suggests potential benefit from adjusting amphetamine doses according to menstrual cycle phases, randomized controlled trials have not evaluated this practice.

### Pharmacokinetics

The oral bioavailability of amphetamine varies with gastrointestinal pH; it is well absorbed from the gut, and bioavailability is typically 90%. Amphetamine is a weak base with a pKa of 9.9; consequently, when the pH is basic, more of the drug is in its lipid soluble free base form, and more is absorbed through the lipid-rich cell membranes of the gut epithelium. Conversely, an acidic pH means the drug is predominantly in a water-soluble cationic (salt) form, and less is absorbed. Approximately 20% of amphetamine circulating in the bloodstream is bound to plasma proteins. Following absorption, amphetamine readily distributes into most tissues in the body, with high concentrations occurring in cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue.
The half-lives of amphetamine enantiomers differ and vary with urine pH. At normal urine pH, the half-lives of dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine are 9–11 hours and 11–14 hours, respectively. Highly acidic urine will reduce the enantiomer half-lives to 7 hours; highly alkaline urine will increase the half-lives up to 34 hours. The immediate-release and extended release variants of salts of both isomers reach peak plasma concentrations at 3 hours and 7 hours post-dose respectively. Amphetamine is eliminated via the kidneys, with 30–40% of the drug being excreted unchanged at normal urinary pH. When the urinary pH is basic, amphetamine is in its free base form, so less is excreted. When urine pH is abnormal, the urinary recovery of amphetamine may range from a low of 1% to a high of 75%, depending mostly upon whether urine is too basic or acidic, respectively. Following oral administration, amphetamine appears in urine within 3 hours. Roughly 90% of ingested amphetamine is eliminated 3 days after the last oral dose. 
Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine. It is not as sensitive to pH as amphetamine when being absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Following absorption into the blood stream, lisdexamfetamine is completely converted by red blood cells to dextroamphetamine and the amino acid L-lysine by hydrolysis via undetermined aminopeptidase enzymes. This is the rate-limiting step in the bioactivation of lisdexamfetamine. The elimination half-life of lisdexamfetamine is generally less than 1 hour. Due to the necessary conversion of lisdexamfetamine into dextroamphetamine, levels of dextroamphetamine with lisdexamfetamine peak about one hour later than with an equivalent dose of immediate-release dextroamphetamine. Presumably due to its rate-limited activation by red blood cells, intravenous administration of lisdexamfetamine shows greatly delayed time to peak and reduced peak levels compared to intravenous administration of an equivalent dose of dextroamphetamine. The pharmacokinetics of lisdexamfetamine are similar regardless of whether it is administered orally, intranasally, or intravenously. Hence, in contrast to dextroamphetamine, parenteral use does not enhance the subjective effects of lisdexamfetamine. Because of its behavior as a prodrug and its pharmacokinetic differences, lisdexamfetamine has a longer duration of therapeutic effect than immediate-release dextroamphetamine and shows reduced misuse potential.
CYP2D6, dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH), flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), butyrate-CoA ligase (XM-ligase), and glycine N-acyltransferase (GLYAT) are the enzymes known to metabolize amphetamine or its metabolites in humans. Amphetamine has a variety of excreted metabolic products, including 4-hydroxyamphetamine, 4-hydroxynorephedrine, 4-hydroxyphenylacetone, benzoic acid, hippuric acid, norephedrine, and phenylacetone. Among these metabolites, the active sympathomimetics are 4-hydroxyamphetamine, 4-hydroxynorephedrine, and norephedrine. The main metabolic pathways involve aromatic para-hydroxylation, aliphatic alpha- and beta-hydroxylation, N-oxidation, N-dealkylation, and deamination. The known metabolic pathways, detectable metabolites, and metabolizing enzymes in humans include the following:

### Pharmacomicrobiomics

The human metagenome (i.e., the genetic composition of an individual and all microorganisms that reside on or within the individual's body) varies considerably between individuals. Since the total number of microbial and viral cells in the human body (over 100 trillion) greatly outnumbers human cells (tens of trillions), there is considerable potential for interactions between drugs and an individual's microbiome, including: drugs altering the composition of the human microbiome, drug metabolism by microbial enzymes modifying the drug's pharmacokinetic profile, and microbial drug metabolism affecting a drug's clinical efficacy and toxicity profile. The field that studies these interactions is known as pharmacomicrobiomics.
Similar to most biomolecules and other orally administered xenobiotics (i.e., drugs), amphetamine is predicted to undergo promiscuous metabolism by human gastrointestinal microbiota (primarily bacteria) prior to absorption into the blood stream. The first amphetamine-metabolizing microbial enzyme, tyramine oxidase from a strain of E. coli commonly found in the human gut, was identified in 2019. This enzyme was found to metabolize amphetamine, tyramine, and phenethylamine with roughly the same binding affinity for all three compounds.

### Related endogenous compounds

Amphetamine has a very similar structure and function to the endogenous trace amines, which are naturally occurring neuromodulator molecules produced in the human body and brain. Among this group, the most closely related compounds are phenethylamine, the parent compound of amphetamine, and N-methylphenethylamine, a structural isomer of amphetamine (i.e., it has an identical molecular formula). In humans, phenethylamine is produced directly from L-phenylalanine by the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme, which converts L-DOPA into dopamine as well. In turn, N-methylphenethylamine is metabolized from phenethylamine by phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, the same enzyme that metabolizes norepinephrine into epinephrine. Like amphetamine, both phenethylamine and N-methylphenethylamine regulate monoamine neurotransmission via TAAR1; unlike amphetamine, both of these substances are broken down by monoamine oxidase B, and therefore have a shorter half-life than amphetamine.

## Chemistry

Amphetamine is a methyl homolog of the mammalian neurotransmitter phenethylamine with the chemical formula C9H13N. The carbon atom adjacent to the primary amine is a stereogenic center, and amphetamine is composed of a racemic 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers. This racemic mixture can be separated into its optical isomers: levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine. At room temperature, the pure free base of amphetamine is a mobile, colorless, and volatile liquid with a characteristically strong amine odor, and acrid, burning taste. Frequently prepared solid salts of amphetamine include amphetamine adipate, aspartate, hydrochloride, phosphate, saccharate, sulfate, and tannate. Dextroamphetamine sulfate is the most common enantiopure salt. Amphetamine is also the parent compound of its own structural class, which includes a number of psychoactive derivatives. In organic chemistry, amphetamine is an excellent chiral ligand for the stereoselective synthesis of 1,1'-bi-2-naphthol.

### Substituted derivatives

The substituted derivatives of amphetamine, or "substituted amphetamines", are a broad range of chemicals that contain amphetamine as a "backbone"; specifically, this chemical class includes derivative compounds that are formed by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms in the amphetamine core structure with substituents. The class includes amphetamine itself, stimulants like methamphetamine, serotonergic empathogens like MDMA, and decongestants like ephedrine, among other subgroups.

### Synthesis

Since the first preparation was reported in 1887, numerous synthetic routes to amphetamine have been developed. The most common route of both legal and illicit amphetamine synthesis employs a non-metal reduction known as the Leuckart reaction (method 1). In the first step, a reaction between phenylacetone and formamide, either using additional formic acid or formamide itself as a reducing agent, yields N-formylamphetamine. This intermediate is then hydrolyzed using hydrochloric acid, and subsequently basified, extracted with organic solvent, concentrated, and distilled to yield the free base. The free base is then dissolved in an organic solvent, sulfuric acid added, and amphetamine precipitates out as the sulfate salt.
A number of chiral resolutions have been developed to separate the two enantiomers of amphetamine. For example, racemic amphetamine can be treated with d-tartaric acid to form a diastereoisomeric salt which is fractionally crystallized to yield dextroamphetamine. Chiral resolution remains the most economical method for obtaining optically pure amphetamine on a large scale. In addition, several enantioselective syntheses of amphetamine have been developed. In one example, optically pure (R)-1-phenyl-ethanamine is condensed with phenylacetone to yield a chiral Schiff base. In the key step, this intermediate is reduced by catalytic hydrogenation with a transfer of chirality to the carbon atom alpha to the amino group. Cleavage of the benzylic amine bond by hydrogenation yields optically pure dextroamphetamine.
A large number of alternative synthetic routes to amphetamine have been developed based on classic organic reactions. One example is the Friedel–Crafts alkylation of benzene by allyl chloride to yield beta chloropropylbenzene which is then reacted with ammonia to produce racemic amphetamine (method 2). Another example employs the Ritter reaction (method 3). In this route, allylbenzene is reacted acetonitrile in sulfuric acid to yield an organosulfate which in turn is treated with sodium hydroxide to give amphetamine via an acetamide intermediate. A third route starts with ethyl 3-oxobutanoate which through a double alkylation with methyl iodide followed by benzyl chloride can be converted into 2-methyl-3-phenyl-propanoic acid. This synthetic intermediate can be transformed into amphetamine using either a Hofmann or Curtius rearrangement (method 4).
A significant number of amphetamine syntheses feature a reduction of a nitro, imine, oxime, or other nitrogen-containing functional groups. In one such example, a Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehyde with nitroethane yields phenyl-2-nitropropene. The double bond and nitro group of this intermediate is reduced using either catalytic hydrogenation or by treatment with lithium aluminium hydride (method 5). Another method is the reaction of phenylacetone with ammonia, producing an imine intermediate that is reduced to the primary amine using hydrogen over a palladium catalyst or lithium aluminum hydride (method 6).

### Detection in body fluids

Amphetamine is frequently measured in urine or blood as part of a drug test for sports, employment, poisoning diagnostics, and forensics. Techniques such as immunoassay, which is the most common form of amphetamine test, may cross-react with a number of sympathomimetic drugs. Chromatographic methods specific for amphetamine are employed to prevent false positive results. Chiral separation techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether prescription amphetamine, prescription amphetamine prodrugs, (e.g., selegiline), over-the-counter drug products that contain levomethamphetamine, or illicitly obtained substituted amphetamines. Several prescription drugs produce amphetamine as a metabolite, including benzphetamine, clobenzorex, famprofazone, fenproporex, lisdexamfetamine, mesocarb, methamphetamine, prenylamine, and selegiline, among others. These compounds may produce positive results for amphetamine on drug tests. Amphetamine is generally only detectable by a standard drug test for approximately 24 hours, although a high dose may be detectable for 2–4 days.
For the assays, a study noted that an enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT) assay for amphetamine and methamphetamine may produce more false positives than liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) of amphetamine and methamphetamine with the derivatizing agent (S)-(−)-trifluoroacetylprolyl chloride allows for the detection of methamphetamine in urine. GC–MS of amphetamine and methamphetamine with the chiral derivatizing agent Mosher's acid chloride allows for the detection of both dextroamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine in urine. Hence, the latter method may be used on samples that test positive using other methods to help distinguish between the various sources of the drug.

## History, society, and culture

Amphetamine was first synthesized in 1887 in Germany by Romanian chemist Lazăr Edeleanu who named it phenylisopropylamine; its stimulant effects remained unknown until 1927, when it was independently resynthesized by Gordon Alles and reported to have sympathomimetic properties. Amphetamine had no medical use until late 1933, when Smith, Kline and French began selling it as an inhaler under the brand name Benzedrine as a decongestant. Benzedrine sulfate was introduced 3 years later and was used to treat a wide variety of medical conditions, including narcolepsy, obesity, low blood pressure, low libido, and chronic pain, among others. During World War II, amphetamine and methamphetamine were used extensively by both the Allied and Axis forces for their stimulant and performance-enhancing effects. As the addictive properties of the drug became known, governments began to place strict controls on the sale of amphetamine. For example, during the early 1970s in the United States, amphetamine became a schedule II controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act. In spite of strict government controls, amphetamine has been used legally or illicitly by people from a variety of backgrounds, including authors, musicians, mathematicians, and athletes.
Amphetamine is illegally synthesized in clandestine labs and sold on the black market, primarily in European countries. Among European Union (EU) member states in 2018, 11.9 million adults of ages 15–64 have used amphetamine or methamphetamine at least once in their lives and 1.7 million have used either in the last year. During 2012, approximately 5.9 metric tons of illicit amphetamine were seized within EU member states; the "street price" of illicit amphetamine within the EU ranged from €6–38 per gram during the same period. Outside Europe, the illicit market for amphetamine is much smaller than the market for methamphetamine and MDMA.

### Legal status

As a result of the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, amphetamine became a schedule II controlled substance, as defined in the treaty, in all 183 state parties. Consequently, it is heavily regulated in most countries. Some countries, such as South Korea and Japan, have banned substituted amphetamines even for medical use. In other nations, such as Brazil (class A3), Canada (schedule I drug), the Netherlands (List I drug), the United States (schedule II drug), Australia (schedule 8), Thailand (category 1 narcotic), and United Kingdom (class B drug), amphetamine is in a restrictive national drug schedule that allows for its use as a medical treatment.

### Pharmaceutical products

Several currently marketed amphetamine formulations contain both enantiomers, including those marketed under the brand names Adderall, Adderall XR, Mydayis, Adzenys ER, Adzenys XR-ODT, Dyanavel XR, Evekeo, and Evekeo ODT. Of those, Evekeo (including Evekeo ODT) is the only product containing only racemic amphetamine (as amphetamine sulfate), and is therefore the only one whose active moiety can be accurately referred to simply as "amphetamine". Dextroamphetamine, marketed under the brand names Dexedrine and Zenzedi, is the only enantiopure amphetamine product currently available. A prodrug form of dextroamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine, is also available and is marketed under the brand name Vyvanse. As it is a prodrug, lisdexamfetamine is structurally different from dextroamphetamine, and is inactive until it metabolizes into dextroamphetamine. The free base of racemic amphetamine was previously available as Benzedrine, Psychedrine, and Sympatedrine. Levoamphetamine was previously available as Cydril. Many current amphetamine pharmaceuticals are salts due to the comparatively high volatility of the free base. However, oral suspension and orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) dosage forms composed of the free base were introduced in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Some of the current brands and their generic equivalents are listed below.
