I just ate ~3mg and snorted ~1mg to make sure my new batch is up to par... tastes like lab chemicals!


2C-I + high dose nitrous oxide has a better body high than gascid... discuss!

Never combined 2C-I with nitrous oxide but I can imagine it's spectacular. I've done it with 2C-E and... holy fuck. 


Looking back almost all my memories of 2C-I involve hysterical laughter, it's such a comical mindset for me. I love me some 2C-I.

**Final 2C-I Question (Dosing it in water)**


The first time I did 2C-**B** it was thrown into water by my guy, stirred up, and I drank it. It was 20 MG to be exact. The trip was absolutely amazing and to this day stands as one of my favorite trips.


Now, I'm about to have 20 mg of 2C-**I** and I wanted to know if I can just take it and throw it into a shot glass of water, stir it up with a toothpick (or anything, really) and drink it. Then refill the glass about 3 more times to make sure I get everything.


Would this work perfectly fine **WITHOUT** ruining the potency of the 2C-I?


Also, please note that I don't have any alcohol (Vodka) to put it in and I'm not going to injest it.


Thank you in advance, Bluelighters. You guys help so much.

That should be just fine. Many people prefer to place the compound in a small paper (rolling paper) and form a small pill that can be swallowed easily.

What I do for sublingual administration is crush up an Altoid, mix with 2C-I, and place under tongue and hold until it's completely dissolved.  Altoids cover up the 2C-I pretty well (not completely) and dose is stronger / comes on faster.


Or a capsule that you have supplements in could simply be emptied and the 2C-I put in there and swallowed.

100 mg 5-HTP capsules are be big enough to hold typical doses of the 2C compounds.


Whenever you want to take some just open the cap and pour the contents into a drink.


Later, when you want to take 2C-*, you can use the empty cap.


This works pretty well if you can't find caps or don't want to buy them for some reason.

I do exactly what you suggest.  I measure it in distilled water after weighing it, stir it in a shot glass and dose.  I've considered refilling it to make sure I get everything but I haven't attempted this yet.  My batch of 2c-i needed a lot more stirring than the 2c-e I got from a different vendor though.. I had to stir pretty seriously and it took maybe 10-15 mins to fully dissolve.

Hell, I just dump the 25-30mg of  straight powder on the back of my tongue and down with a little sweet drink of some kind.


For sublingual use (lets me use a little less... 15mg, 20 for a stronger trip), I first swish with a Listerine-style mouthwash, brand name or store generic, containing both alcohol AND MENTHOL, both of which increase absorption thru mouth tissues, for a minute, and dump the raw powder directly under my tongue... doesnt really taste too bad or burn more than a little.. adding a crushed small mint does sound like a good idea... actually I think mint might help it absorb as well.  After about 20minutes I will take a drink, swish and swallow to be sure it all get into my system in a timely manner just in case.  It seems to come up quicker under the tongue, but also not last quite as long, but still great.


Note these amounts lean toward the "strong" end of dosing.

yeah dude, you'll be fine


although you should empty out the niacin first (probably a DUH but you never know) cause the niacin will pump up your heart rate and make your skin flush, which you want to avoid with a compound that already is rather stimulating


and dont bump your own threads

Sure, that'll be just fine.  DON'T take within 3 hours of a meal... this can greatly reduce strength and increase time to come on ALOT... a little something like a quickly absorbed protein drink is OK... add 2-3 grams of Vitamin C (use non-acidic Ester-C form) as well as other antioxidants you can afford... CO-Q10 and Alpha-Lipoic Acid are both good to prevent neural stress from free-radicals, they also protect the heart muscle and enhance body's oxygen and energy utilization.


DO NOT take with or within 30 minutes of anything very acidic like Orange or Grapefruit juice... some disagree but I find and pharmacological research all say that phenethylamine absorption is significantly slowed/blocked by added acids in the stomach like these, as well as first-pass elimination via kidneys is increased.  [notice that on a script bottle for ANY amphetamine, they now add a little sticker to this effect... if you dont believe me google for presescribing/dosing info from official med sites, or wikipedia]

Hello, i was wondering whats a good way to store 2ci for a while?

I read about mixing with liquid but am not exactly sure could someone shed some light into this?

And also how to measure out liquid mixtures of it for blotter use? Much thanks!

The 2C-I can be stored as a powder in most conditions for longer than your lifetime, so no need to take any special precautions.

^ and as far as dosing, the most precise method will be liquid measurement.


If you have a milligram (0.001g) scale, then you will be able to dose 20mg (0.020g) accurately for a single dose.


If you have a centigram (0.01g) scale, then you CANNOT accurately dose a single 20mg (0.02g) dose. The scale is NOT PRECISE at this level and you MUST use liquid measurement.


See the big and dandy liquid measurement thread for more info, and don't hesitate to ask if you're confused about your scale or any calculations! we want to make sure you get a safe dose!


EDIT: i just saw your mention of blotter dosing. 20mg of 2C-I will not fit on a blotter. Drugs that will 'fit' on blotter must be active in the 1-2mg range, because any more than that will be visible as a white powder that will fall right off the paper instead of staying trapped in the fibers.

my experience has been, it lasts for years. I once got paranoid years ago and buried my stash, and 2ci was the only thing that survived months underground (although mainly due to the well-sealed bag). Last dose was taken a few months back, which made it... 4 years after purchase date, and the trip wasn't any different dosage wise than when first received.


I'd suspect storing it as powder would be better.


GuatamaToro, let us know how it goes/went and how it compares to your memories of the Brominated form. I personally think difference would only be in dosage, but I'm sure its been discussed and people have come up with all kinds of little special subjective differences. In my experience, the experiences weren't close enough to remember exactly, but it seemed the same (CI vs CB).

alright thanks for the help, so if i was to measure out a 100mg dose, dissolve would it able to be dropped onto blotter.

**visuals**


/\ If you read his post or had a basic concept of dosage, you'd know that answer. /\                      

    Maybe you shouldn't be playing with chemicals, no offense?


Alright next topic...


2C-I visuals! vs 2C-E, 4-tryptamines and LSD.


I remember the first time I did 2C-I, one morning. 16mg. What lovely, "digital" visuals I had! This was my first PEA experience, but had done 4 different tryptamines. CI had more soft, bright and glowy ones... eh its hard to put into words. 


2C-E seemed to have darker visuals, or a dark impression to them anyway, mentally and emotionally. However, CE at a laser show was amazing, and both an old friend and I mistaspliff (he still here? don't know) both felt like we wanted to "melt into" the visuals shown on the planetarium. It was more intense, and I ended up having to drive :/ never again. A "yield up ahead" sign will NEVER look the same, and i still get kind of creeped out/giggly when I see one thanks to CE.


So far, 4-aco-dmt has been visually inferior to CI at roughly equal dosages, however, mentally the imagination is exponentially more enhanced on 4-dmt.

I'm really sad to say that i didn't get enough experience with 2c-e to comment on its visuals. it was my first 2c-x and i was completely enamored with low dose (2mg rectal, or 4mg oral) ability to completely change the flavor of a day. slight color enhancement, incredible increase in the appreciation of music, and don't even get me started on the tactile sensations! but i gave away most of it so i never got a chance to try any dose higher than 16mg oral.


2c-i i've taken orally up to 24mg and it does have a very malleable visual quality at that level. Points of light (stars, headlights, lighters, etc) would sparkle like those fireworks that shimmer and crackle. Subtle fields on the other hand (clouds, grass, etc) would fuzz over with a 'smoky' appearance that continuously shifted brightness and shade.


as for closed-eye visuals, i was HEAVILY reminded of my own mushroom OEV/CEV experiences by the 24mg 2C-I closed-eye visuals. Heavily biased toward orange, yellow, with contrasting purple and green. All continuously warping and swirling. 2C-E on the other hand felt like a laser show in my eyes-- bright lines and patterns of thin color against a black background, with more of a 'strobe' effect and less swirly motion.


i hope that i will find 2c-e again in teh future, because i think i liked the body high of 2c-e better than that of 2c-i. it's kind of hard to tell without a direct comparison though.

2C-I is quite mild visually, for me. But it has had its moments... like when no trypts have been ingested for a long time. It shines more in positive mental effects.


My problem with 2C-I is concern for aftereffects. I used to get depression afterwards that was not as intense but similar to MDMA comedown. Of course, most amps do that. But I remember doing it frequently for a while, and not feeling right for some time. This is quite inspecific and subjective I know, but its true for me.


I admit to wanting to try it again though, its been a long time.


[I have my first trip on erowid](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=19017) ... i think under RetroGrade. i know it was like 8 years ago. I thought I had posted it here but turns out I don't think I had an account yet.


After reading my trip report, I realized this is the only time I actually vomited from 2C-I, but nausea was present nearly all the time on comeups (I've probably done this stuff 35+ times), but usually subsided near peak, but sometimes reignited at comedown. 


How is the nausea for you guys, and what is the timing for it like? Ever vomited?

I once got paranoid years ago and buried my stash, and 2ci was the only thing that survived months underground (although mainly due to the well-sealed bag).

Will do. I'll create a comparison / contrast list of 20 MG of I to B. I'm very excited. I'm tripping with this girl I dated for a month. We'll be going to this park and it should be incredible considering that it is autumn.

**The key to consuming 2c**


2c-i and 2c-e are insanely water soluble. Therefore mixing with water is better than just eating it like a pill.


but the best way to consume any 2c-i, 2c-e, 2c-b...


SNORT IT its WAYYYYYYYYY more intense

I always end up regretting eating it. Snorting it makes it hit you quicker and harder. the peak is way more intense than eating it. Stop being a bunch of POOOOOOOOOONS and just snort it!%)


as for visuals. 2c-i has more in your face hallucinations (things moving around and looking geometrical) as apposed to 2c-e

2c-e brightens and darkens things. more colors.


all the 2c visuals look like things are being brought in and out of focus


and as for my dosage. i normally snort 30mg+ of 2c-i or 2c-e anything less just wont cut it

and as for the nausea, SMOKE WEED the entire time and you will feel better/hallucinate more

after all weed is a psychedelic =P


acid owns 2c though. lsd is my favorite psychedelic because its not as crazy as 2c. you feel like you have more control over things. 


2c does whatever the hell it wants! lol


side note: on 2c-i i get this insane urge to make fun of/mess with things, people or ideas

in a very brutal way

I honestly dont think itl make too much of a difference, the extent of my knowledge tell me that the cold is best.... Since popping a capsule with dry 2ci works fine. Hiwver the warm wAter might dissolve the 2ci quicker, but like i said i dont know f that helps. 


Im curious as to if putting 2ci in a solvent liquid gives you a stronger experience than just orally taking a dry capsule. The only way i could see this being the case was if the solvent protected the 2ci frpm degredation in thee stomach. Hope someone understands what i wrote haha....

I read once, somewhere, of people dissolving it in vodka. The alcohol is absorbed through the stomach quickly, but I don't know if it takes the 2C-I along for the ride or not.

Yes, alcohol would be a better medium for it to cross into bloodstream. 


Next time I dose i'm going to do this, because it always seems to take way too long to comeup when taken in capsule or dry. the experience may last 6-8 hours plus 2 hours extra needed to sleep, but since it takes almost 2 hours to come on, you have to remember to have 12 hours + sleep time. low medium / lower doses its more like 9 or 10.

I'll be dosing some 2C-I in the morning, I've got it dissolved in some vodka in a hermetic jar, 500mg in 250mL vodka.


I'm a little anxious about it because I didn't have any way to be certain it was 500mg (or even that it's 2C-I) I'm just taking the RC suppliers word for it.  They seem legit, but how would I know?  Probably shouldn't have been reading the horror stories where people get sent the wrong RC, on the night before I intended to dose an RC for the first time :S. 


I intend to start off with what should be a 15mg dose if that little packet of white powder is in fact 500mg of 2C-I and adjust from there.  I'm sure I'm just being overly paranoid, but better that than the opposite I guess.

You ought to feel modestly stimmy from 15mg 2C-I, only some visuals a little over threashold, but nothing too impressive.  For some people it ends up being more than that, but IME this is the most common reaction to such a dose... you'll at least find it enjoyable and not a waste I bet.


25mg should have you seeing thick flickering trails behind anything that moves, and an extremely nearly cosmic Zen-like state where stopping all internal verbalizing and all other thought processes is second nature and you feel like your're blurring into the background.

I realise that 15mg *shouldn't* be too intense, it's more of a calibrating dose than anything else.  Seeing where I stand and making sure my assumptions about what I have are correct.    


I've the whole day to myself tomorrow so if I find it lacking I can always take a little more.

Heh, I never got anything spectacular out of 2C-I. Ever. Well... when I took 48mg that was a trip... but really, it was just an extremely boring barely-considered-psychedelic substance for me... it was more of a stimulant than anything. I remember I took 28mg of 2C-I one time and got so stimmed I went for a 10 mile walk... literally just paced around the 2 mile block around my grandmother's 5 times... But that's really all I got from it unless I was looking at the LCD on my computer - then text moved and sometimes I'd get some patterns...


But ironically, the HPPD from it was MORE visual than the trips I had ON it.

N3wt, why not just eat a few mgs or better yet 1mg (better yet a fraction of an mg) just to make sure it isn’t some other weird stuff?  You have 500mgs so that should give you plenty of room to play around and find a good dose right?  You say you are being paranoid but yours is a damn good situation in which to be paranoid.  The best advice is to start ridiculously small, at least for that first initial trial, and slowly work your way up.  I mean, look at some of these vendors these days and some of the drugs they are playing around with.  


My first 10mg dose of 2ci was a definite +++ experience, and now I’m pretty sure 10mg could never give me a +++. I’d need at least 15-16mg for that now.  The first time you take 15mgs will probably be the hardest you ever trip on that dose, which is another good reason to start low and work up.  You’ll keep some of the magic in the experience longer that way.  Good luck with your adventures.

I started at 15 mg, it wasn't bad at all.  I actually noticed the visuals before the body load or any body high at all.  Took about an hour to kick in.  I was pretty stimmed but only speaking, it wasn't like I needed to pace around, I was fine just sitting at the comp during some of it.  And yes, text is definitely interesting.   It was a very euphoric experience with a lot of laughs.


My next experiment was going to be 20mg but my scale was iffy so I just erred on the side of caution and went for 18mg.  I'll probably go for 22mg next time.  My 18mg experience was a diff come up though, I noticed the body load about 30 mins in this time.  Was a bit more edgy, we had also come inside from a bright day into a dim house so I was getting flashing shades of red in my entire vision, which made my trip to the bathroom very intense, lots of morphing with the patterns on my tile floor.  I got this contrast on 2c-e too but it was more like a general film/layer of static light or darkness.

My gf and I spent a lot of time just looking for visual catalysts this trip, we'd turn the lamps on and check out the shadows on the wall morph around, we even noticed a lot of similar shades of color like our bedroom had a whole RBG spectrum.   Then we'd lay on the floor and stare at the shadows from the ceiling light, we have a very interesting fixture.


Still no trails or crazy patterns though.  Even though the visuals were about on par with my research of 2c-e(10, 15 and 18 mg), the 2c-e showed a bit more patterns morphing around, especially staring at my skin.  Both are pretty good for vivid visuals though, skin in general is very interesting, I was very entertained by my girlfriends freckles.

I'm still looking for some crazy colorful kaleidoscopic patterns like I got with amt, ordered some of that recently and hoping to appreciate it like I did years ago.  It seems the 2c-x substances I tried are mostly just visual when it comes to morphing and shadows/light but I still need to research them further.  And don't get me wrong, I'm not just looking for visuals here.. I'm under playing how intense these experiences were emotionally and mentally but that's a bit harder to discuss all the meaning I was able to find in everything.  As far as an emotional comparison, I'll say I cried a lot more from my 2c-e trips.  I did get very emotional the day after my last 2c-i trip though... damn Toy Story 3 and Bill Hicks documentary.

I get some definite visuals from 12mgs, tons of visuals from 15mgs, and even tons more visuals from 18mgs which is the highest I’ve gone because the physical stimulation of 2ci while tripping can wreak havoc on my headspace, especially when combining with cannabis which is a must for me every time.  However, after reading so many reports I realize I’m relatively sensitive to the effects. 


I don’t think 2ci is nearly as psychedelic on the mind as 2ce or lsd, but I do get tons of open and closed eye visuals from it. Nevertheless, I do find 2ci to be fairly psychedelic on the mind, especially mixed with cannabis, just not as much as other things.

I ended up trying out 10mg to start.  I didn't get any nausea or body load to speak of at that dose, felt mildly stimulated, like I'd had some coffee.  Visuals at that level were actually more than I expected, though very user friendly.  I only got a bit of a startle when my Jim Morrison poster which I'd been watching slowly morph suddenly morphed very quickly.


I tried taking another 8mg to up the experience, but I was around 4 hours in by that time so all it really did was prolong the experience.  Between around t+6 and t+6:30 it did amp up a bit though, the most intense visual being watching my ceiling spinning opposite to my fan in muted purples and yellows as pixels sort of rained down.  I only got this if I really let my eyes relax though.


All in all a fairly successful experiment.  I'm not feeling any after effects at all really, other than being a bit tired.

So I thought I'd update this with my further experiments.


I've gone as high as 24mg in the time since, and I've had some interesting experiences.  As the dosage increases visuals get more intense, and music euphoria goes through the roof...the only problem is the stims really start to get in the way of having a good time.  I'm not a big fan of stimulants period, so the massive amount of stimulation that comes from a 20mg+ dose is really uncomfortable to me.  I find myself constantly having to stop myself from grinding my teeth, and constantly moving around, very restless.


I guess I always find myself reaching for more psychedelic effects and less stimulation.  That said, it is an interesting substance.

The really amazingly thick intense trails didn't manifest for me till I got up to 25mg.  Not at 20, nor at 22.  Some sort of pharmacological/brain threshold it seems, at least for me.


May be a little strongly stimmy, but even if you don't care for that effect, those ultra-trails, more impressive than even those I've seen on LSD and Shrooms, are worth it IMO... ***quite*** a show!

Oh yeah, 2C-I + DXM + nitrous really does have astounding synergy to those with the will, interest, and stomach to try it.


Fuck, portals and grids every where that beautiful entities would just pour out of! (300mg of hbr, a case of nos, and 35mg of 2C-I lead to such an experience, I was shocked by the synergy in all three having tried every possible combo of each previously.)


25mg of 2C-I with a 5oz delsym on a later date proved to be ridiculous, but I did prefer the first.

I'd like to report success with dissolving 2C-I in alcohol.


I dissolved my usual dose, about 30 mg - (it seems high, but for some reason I always need more than everyone else to get the same effects) - in some alcohol. I then drank it on a mostly empty stomach (4-5 hours after lunch).


The visual effects this time were at least twice as strong, and music euphoria was fantastic. Huge trails, and everything seemed kind of shiny and glittery. When I laid down on the bed and closed my eyes, I saw what I guess could be described as LSD-type visuals (alas, I can not compare from direct experience). I was giddy and happy the entire time - much better than anything I can get from methylone.


I think the alcohol improved absorption - significantly. I've had 40 mg before in plain water and still never got anywhere close to 30 mg dissolved in alcohol. I don't believe the alcohol affected the trip - it was not even one drink's worth.


I should also add that I supplemented with 5-HTP, but I don't think it affected the trip in a huge way, as I've supplemented before.


Just ordered some more 2C-I - definitely my favourite now.

I know this is a pretty basic question, and I am doing my research on my own but it takes time, I didn't know about these chemicals (and this one which I've been reading about) until recently and trying to learn is a bit overwhelming...


So would someone compare 2C-I with mushrooms briefly? Or LSD, but also mescaline (mushrooms and LSD feel closely related to me, but mescaline is different and it would be greatly appreciated to compare it to both types)

^If you're thinking about insufflation, start with 2c-i.  Its like holding a lit lighter under your nostril and snorting the flame.  I've not experienced 2c-e in my nose but i have witnessed it being done and the experience is supposedly twice as painful as 2c-i.


I would imagine ocular being one of the most painful things around.

Psychedelics and dissociatives blend in quite inspiring ways when done right, the way psychedelia accumulates even with different stacked mediums is one of the most interesting aspects of hallucinogens to me.

I consider 2C-I to be barely psychedelic.  For me, it was like the buzz of MDA with far more visuals, stronger (and longer) stimulation, and almost none of the emotional or mental effects.  It did make me laugh a lot at times... and like someone else said, it gives a wicked rush combined with nitrous... and yeah for a few minutes while I chased 3 carts with 3 more carts and then 3 more carts, I realized how my energy was just a tiny drop of water in a huge ocean or something...  but that's about it for depth on this one!  Speaking of gasses, it also made me feel like I had intestinal gas or something at higher doses, but I don't think I ever actually did.  All in all, it's great for sex.  Otherwise...  I never seemed to get much from it.  I would get bored, take it, and then ask myself "oh God, why did I take this shit again."  Oh yeah, brutal hangovers... though maybe not as bad as MDA!  I don't think anything leaves me feeling as fried as MDA....  but I love it anyway.

How does 2C-I compare to DOI? Except for the long duration of DOI, can they be considered somewhat similar in effects?

I personally like 2ci a lot. I've been experimenting with it. Things I've noticed. 

Rental admin come on in 25 min. Less body load

 I have it in vodka 5mg/ml facilitates absorption. 

Oral one hour to 1.5 hr for full effects. 

I can easily talk eat and function on it. No one aware I'm on anything. 

Mdma mixed with 2ci is great. 

Nitrous is great but not nearly as intense as with lsd. 

Overall very fun but LSD for the win.


Lsd wins in everyway fun dancing music sex psychedelic experience. 

 just adjust lsd dose for desired effect. 


I was thinking of trying my 5mg/ml route intranasally. Has anyone tried insulation with 2ci in liquid form.

I loveee mixing molly with izzy (MDMA with 2ci).  About 150 mg of molly and 16 mg of 2ci makes for an intenseeeeee experience, but I would only recommend those doses for users with extensive experience with both chemicals.

I also wanted to point out, that those who are considering snorting 2c-i, that you should be cautious beyond just the painful burn it creates. 


Snorting 2c substances increases the potency of the dose substantially and creates possibilities for potential health issues given the strong dose that hits all at once. Many times people will reduce their oral dose by half or 1/3 before snorting it.


Just saying, Be Careful...

Wanted to follow up on this. Recently I traveled and wanted to bring a single dose of 2C-I.


I took one 5-HTP capsule and removed half the contents, added a dose of 2C-I, and then added back as much 5-HTP as I could before closing up the capsule. I then put the capsule back into the full bottle of 5-HTP pills.


It's a good combination since I like to pre-load with 5-HTP anyway - and I don't have to arbitrarily waste an entire 5-HTP pill just to hold the small bit of 2C-I.

Hi y'all - trying a new combo tonight, looking for a little guideline, ok or no?

15mg 2ci hour or two later, 100mg mdma, with another 100mg for later if needed...and finally, right at the end, maybe 10mg MXE.

I've done lots of mdma over the many many years with various combos...favourite used to be candyflipping (acid+MDMA). Haven't done it for about 10 years though. What I would like to know is is 2ci + MDMA likely to produce a similar trip to good ol' candyflipping?

I'm not a binger and prefer to enjoy my experiences, rather than wtf'ing. I'm partying for 9 hours so any guidance on this one would be much appreciated  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Only tried 2ci once before and felt at the time that it was more acid than acid (of which I've done lots, although again, low doses). It did, however last longer than I have available to play with normally - hence saving for tonight ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Happy New Year y'all

Hahaha the title of this thread reminded me of my ridiculous friend who took ~43mg at a renegade last summer, with no prior psychedelic experience (except rolling). 


He bought two caps off me (I weighed out a bunch between 20-23mg a piece) and took one at sunset. I swear I told him to only take one, that two would be a super intense experience probably unfit for our environment, and that it takes a fair while to come on. Well this kid got impatient and decided to take the second one 2 hours in because he wasn't feeling it enough. He spent a good chunk of the night standing away from the group staring at the moon, mouth agape.


Apparently he had a good time! Said he wouldn't be doing that kind of dose for a while though..


Anyway, another thumbs up here for 2c-i. One of my first, and still one of my favorite rc's.

Can soundly vouch for and recommend pedestrian dose combo of 2c-i and mdma for a jolly enjoyable NYE rave!! - the twisted pixie sense of humour on it is brilliant ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

(15mg 2c-i, +2hours 100mg MDMA, +2 hours 100mg MDMA...)

...and droppping 20mg of MXE just before going to bed makes for a lovely interesting and restful sleep experience 


Happy New Year one and all xxxx

Im thinking of doing 2ci soon but i have some questions first. Ive done several psychedelics before, the only research chems, were a small dose of 2c-e and then 2c-c and d mixed a few times.


Anyways, whats the 2c-i high like? Anything like 2c-e,c or d? Is there anyway to prepare?


The last time i did research chems was at my house in the summer, which made me feel different for almost a  week and a half after.

2c-i will probably be similar in effects to your experiences with 2c-e.


as far as preparation, just clear your mind and stay hydrated :

i would guess that your 2c-c+2c-d experiences would be closer to 2c-i than your 2c-e experiences would be.  i can't say from first hand experience though (i've tried 2c-i and 2c-e but neither -c nor -d), just from comparing the reports of others.

2C-I will be a lot like your 2C-E experience, although each of the 2Cs have their own "feel" or "personality", depending on who you ask.

2C-I was one of the first RC's I fell for.  This was years ago, but I would space my doses by the work-week and always have a great Friday night.  I waited for my roommate/girlfriend to go to sleep and I'd eat some of it and the stimulation would keep me up until sunrise.  I'd watch it from my balcony as it came up between the mountains.  Sometimes there would be a lingering visual overlay which made everything look like it was a puzzle that had been put together without missing pieces.


Anyway, just reminiscing.  2C-I is one of my favorites even though I haven't taken it in quite a while.  I've got a little on the way, so it will be nice having that around for a special night when I'm not looking to trip out as hard as I might on some other chemicals.


Really looking forward to taking some of this stuff with methoxetamine.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I've heard some whispers, but anyone know anything substantial about mixing 4-ac0-DMT and 2c-i ?

They're both "fun" psychedelics, (less deep than others but still deep) and i think they would synergize nicely. Think about it:

~4-aco is a relatively strong tryptamine that is rather sedating

~2c-i is a relatively strong phenlyethlamine that is rather stimulating

~both have relatively the same dosage (so maybe take 2/3 or 1/2 of both?)


The perfect sedated/stimulated inverse trip combo?

Any thoughts or experiences???

On NYE I had some experience with a 4-AcO-DMT/LSD combo (~20 mg + ~100 mics) and this can definitely fuck up your plans...

Since I have a lot of experience with 2C-I, I'll try to extrapolate.


Definitely tone your 4-AcO-DMT dose down a notch extra compared with your 2C-I.

I suggest you take 80% of your normal 2C-I dose and somewhere round 50% of a typical 4-AcO-DMT dose.

Perhaps better to drop the 2C-I sometime before the 4-AcO-DMT, so you can zone in easily and don't end up in some super-enhanced sick bodyload nightmare.


For myself, I would prolly start with 32 mg of 2C-C, since I find this ultimately relaxing.

After about 90 mins, I would drop a capsule containing 14 mg 2C-I and some 14-16 mg of 4-AcO-DMT.

Perhaps drop the 4-AcO-DMT a tad later, I usually decide such things *on the spot*. ;-P

I just did this combo last week actually, 16mg 2C-I and 18mg 4-aco-dmt.  They didn't seem to get on top of each other too much, it was more like they were working side by side.  By that I mean it wasn't terribly intense, it was just the effects of being on a middling dose of each at the same time.  


It was alright, but I wouldn't say there is really any magic to be had by combining the two.


I dosed the 4aco about an hour and a half after the 2C-I, seemed to work out pretty good.

i did a bunch of 4-aco-dmt whilst coming down from 2c-i.  i haven't ever done 4-aco-dmt on its own.  the resulting 4-aco trip was pretty insane... and by insane i mean approaching psychosis.  granted, i dosed the 4-aco at like midnight or 1am, and late night tripping often gets me close to psychosis.


physically it felt fine though.  watch your dosages.  i took like 50mg of 4-aco thinking that there would be cross-tolerance between it and the 2c-i i had taken about 4 or 5 hours beforehand.  looking back i am not sure if that was sound logic.

Thanks for the replies, ...is there a considerable phenethylamine / tryptamine cross tolerance?      I'm pretty sure tryptamines mainly work with your seratonin, and phens mainly work with your dopamine receptors so... Has anyone experienced cross tolerances?

Unless you mean amphetamines - which are also phenethylamines - phenethylamines exert most of their effects through the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors (which are serotonin receptors).

Beside that, tryptamines don't work with serotonin, they mimic serotonin and bind to serotonin receptors.

If this is what you meant I apologize for nitpicking, but you shouldn't think in terms of serotonin depletion when using tryptamines. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I find there to be a very noticeable cross tolerance between phenethylamines (2c-i and 2c-e, my experiences) and tryptamines, though I will say that there isn't as much of a cross tolerance as I've seen with LSD and tryptamines.  


I say as a rule of thumb majority of your traditional psychedelics will have some cross tolerance with each other due to agonism of the same serotonin receptors, like the 5ht-2a.

Deos anyone notice the visuals from 2c-i are different than almost any other hallucinogen?

I get no visuals from it, it seems, and then i focus on a certain area; i.e. wooden floorboards and end up getting some of the most intense visual displays of my life. For me you have to concentrate for them to appear, and if you decide you're not gonna have any visuals anymore, then they disperse. I noticed i was receiving mescaline-ish visuals over 12 hours after i took a 25mg dose.


Also, after reading/researching around, i figured this chem was going to be more on the "light" side of things compared to lsd/psilocin.


Boy was i wrong. Probably 10x the introspection that lsd has for me, with 50x the visuals.

There appears to be no ego-loss but more so.... ego expansion?  


I also experienced Synesthesia like nobody's business.

Although 25 mg is quite high dose, you seem to be sensitive to 2C-I. How much trips did you have in total? 

Personally I tried only 2Cs: 2C-I, 2C-E, 2C-T-2, 2C-P. The visuals are similar for all these drugs(but still different, of course).

It is also considered weaker than other 2Cs. Is 2C-I the only 2C you tried? If yes, I recommend you to try others, especially 2C-E and 2C-T-2.

It seems to be similar for me. If I "relax" and let the trip flow, I see more visuals. I always wondered if people perceive visuals in the same way. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

^exactly!  when i was out and about, getting driven around by a sober friend, i had almost no visuals because i was just sort of stressed to be in an automobile. The second i sat down in a chair and relaxed though... paintings changing size and shape right in front of me... floorboard mazes creating intricate patterns purely for my amusement, the whole works.


yup 2c-i is my first phenethlyamine besides San pedro mescaline.


I ended my trip by laying down and listening to pink floyd...with a cat sleeping literally on my head. it was absolutely fantastic

^  GREAT story Psyke!  Thanks!  I really liked "purely for my amusement" and the cat sleeping literally on your head, LOL.  Glad you enjoyed it.  Yea if you don't get excess uncomfortable stimmyness (just breathe deep and consciously try to relax... it goes away in an hour or so) it feels so crystalline.  I find that there is a significant increase in visual effects at the 25mg level, but thats about as high as I would go.

Yes.


2C-I (and 2C-T-7, which also has beautiful visuals) can make itself very known if you simply "relax your eyes" and stare into something... i have had clouds that morph into fluffy kittens, pissed off snakes, hungry bears, and more...


on 2C-T-7 i communicated with my cat, and all she had to say was, "yeah, u know my fur is awesome. why dont u stare into it some more so i can control your MIND?!"

I've had 2C-I the longest out of anything in my collection, and I've still never done it by itself.  Combines nicely with LSD though, I must say.  Adds a desirable visual element without taking away from the LSD mindscape.  One of these days, I want to dive in and see what 2C-I is all about.  I'm actually really looking forward to a highly visual trip with a small degree of mental investment.


Fuck, why can't it just be 2C-B though, for serious.....

2c-b makes my body feel all ooky and the visuals are distractingly flat, fake and annoying.  highly over rated due to historically being one of the earliest circulated rcs imo.  2c-i is much better imo.  and i'm certain it would be a superior combo with lsd due to its "clarity"


looking fwd to trying lsd + 2c-i now, thanks.


what dose of 2ci did you use, in what timing/sequence relative to lsd?

I have tried the 2C-I/LSD combination for at least ten times.

Most of the time at big festivals, so my dosage might have been a bit on the safe side.

My suggestion is you take about 20% off of your normal 2C-I dosage (that would translate 15-16 mg in my case).

Dose LSD just as you would normally do, though I wouldn't pass the 200 mics mark on the first try.


I generally chose between two dosing regimens:

- Drop 2C-I and LSD together in a capsule, with my blotter cut into very small pieces

- Eat LSD first and drop a capsule with 2C-I about 2 hours later

Both options were nice, with higher dosages of LSD I guess the second one is preferable.

I want to get some more of this. I've only had it once, back in 2003, and I didn't feel much of an effect. I felt a slight rise in stimulation. I am certain now that this is due to either a bunk product or a low dose, since I tried it once and threw it out. I was also only new to psychedelics at that time, and hadn't the 'aqcuired taste' I have more recently to feel out the subtleties in a psychedelic.


It sounds actually quite wonderful to me, by description.

Interesting you say that about 2C-B and 2C-I Dwayne. Anyways, whenever I have done the 2C-I/LSD combo, I have used a normal dose of acid, followed by 10-12 mgs of 2C-I an hour or two into the LSD.

Thanks 3rdEyeBlind & Wiz!!  I shall try that, sounds like a blast.


And yea, I figure 2c-b is just gonna add body load, discomfort, and too much of its own odd character, while 2c-i is just gonna add some stimulation (which always does LSD good IMO so long as its done in careful moderation) and basically act as a straight amplifier of the LSD effects without coloring them at all. 2c-i seems... "crystalline" to me somehow.  Love it.  And LSD of course, haha!

guys could someone tell me if 2C-I stored in a powerade bottle in a vodka solution in the fridge would be OK after a few months? it may have not been air tight for some time, and the fridge is quite cold. i am concerned about the fact it was not air tight - will this cause any degradation? thanks

I stored my 2C-I as 10mg/1ml solution in tap water at room temperature(but in dark) for more than a year, and it don't seem that it lost it any potency. 

Don't worry, 2Cs(in particular 2C-I) are stable compounds when stored in solution. Some alcohol(AFAIR ~17% or more)will prevent bacteria growth, so it is good idea to add it.

Also, personally I wouldn't advise using powerade bottle, because it is made from plastic. I am no chemist and I don't know if alcohol can absorb plastic. But common sense tells me that if there are no high-alcohol drinks sold in plastic bottles, then there may be certain reasons for it.

Chemicals in solution usually don't degrade because of exposure to air.

Even if, your container was probably *almost* airtight, and your fridge would be like minus 20 degrees?

Temperature is the real bitch when it comes to degrading, so I think your 2C-I will be just fine! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Alcohol can't absorb most plastics BTW.

Only some of the more high-end plastics used in laboratories etc. can dissolve in alcohol.

However, it *can* absorb certain nasty compounds to make the plastic malleable, like bisphenol A.

But plastic bottles that contain drinks usually don't have much of these substances.


BTW, alcoholic beverages are definitely sold in plastic bottles.

Also, in our laboratory we use 'absolute' alcohol (which is 99.9% anhydrous alcohol); this comes in plastic bottles.

And this kind of alcohol has to be absolutely pure, because it can really fuck up your experiment if not (plus they charge like € 170 per 1L bottle...insanity!).

^this is from an erowid health risks experience report.

What do you guys think?  2C-I and DOI really are the only drugs that employ iodine, besides certian thyroid medications.


Is this good evidence that it indeed does cause thyriod problems?

It'd be quite a shame if it did. Full report: [http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=39567](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=39567)

Yes, you're right![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I drink alcohol very rare, and tried vodka only once or twice.

But even the cheapest vodka sold in glass bottles in Russia(that's where I live).


As for the iodine, I remembered that I read very anecdotal report on imageboard. The guy who used 2C-I once got some ache in the place where thyroid should be. It's very anecdotal thing, don't quote me, but maybe there are more similar reports?

Just tried 2C-I for the first time this past weekend so I thought I would share a bit of my experience here in the big and dandy thread.  My dosage was 18mg (after a test of 4mg a few nights prior which did have an effect, although slight). I did take 25mg of diphenhydramine in order to reduce body load.  


My previous psychedelic experiences include mushrooms (up to 3.5g cubensis) so its really all I can compare it to.  Within 60mins I began to get some visual alerts, patterning of the floor and walls.  This is somewhat like the patterning I get from mushrooms but just a bit different.  

The visuals progressed to halos around every reflection of light that would cast a rainbow type prism look throughout my home.  The visualizer on the TV looked like it was extending past the television.  I found myself staring at a painting on my wall of a long road lined with trees that have shed their leaves.  They were waving back and forth and morphing all over the place.  A shower with candles and hot steam made for some interesting visuals as well.  I took my 18mg orally at 2:30PM and was able to fall asleep by 10:30pm.


Outside of this, I didn't find myself really gaining much from the experience.  As some previously stated in this thread, at many points I would be stuck not really thinking of anything, just staring off and wondering "why am I doing this?"  Very neutral experience for me.  I would feel an urge to do something, then I wouldn't want to do it like 5 seconds later.  My wife and I went for a walk in a park next to where we live and it just wasn't as profound as I was hoping.  I felt zero euphoria during this trip.  Mostly neutral outside of a few chuckles here and there.


I did break out some nitrous and enjoyed smoking some cannabis and taking nitrous while getting lost in my visualizer with music.  Every light in the room would sparkle and give off a prism type look, almost like the varying colors you see when light shines on oil or soap atop of water.  


Mushrooms are deeper mentally for me, without a doubt.  And although I find myself working through my mind on shrooms, it is almost always followed by immense euphoria as I come to certain conclusions about myself and life in general.  


I am a big guy, did I dose too little? I didn't want to push it for my first time.  Another interesting bit of information is that I am still experiencing the floating patterning you see when you let your eyes relax.  It is dissapating as the days go on but it is somewhat bothersome since I've never had this happen to me following a mushroom experience.  When I smoke cannabis, the patterning is ramped up even more.  I wouldn't call it HPPD because its only been two days and it certainly is not affecting my daily life.  Not sure if I'm going to try this one again?

Your intense visual experience is unusual for only 18mg (for a big guy at that).   When I added diphenhydramine to 2C-E to lower bodyload my impression was that it also increased visuals.  This is the first know report of using it with 2C-I so, interesting... it would be nice to have people very familiar with 2C-I to try this combo and report (OK, I volunteer... when I get more... all out now).


FYI, I am pretty big (6'1". 200#), and find a notable increase in euphoria and visuals at 25mg.  Even at 20, effects are there but mostly in the body.  But when I hit 25 it just seems to blossom... brilliant colors, huge long tracers, buddha-like bliss.  But yes, it is quite emotionally neutral, and very clearheaded... NO headfuck, so if all sorts of intense bizzaro hallucinations is what you are looking for, 2C-I is the wrong drug.

Is jumping from 18mg to 25mg an okay titration?  I'm 6'4'' 270#.  


Yea, I read about the diphenhydramine in the 2C-E thread I believe, so I thought I'd give it a try since the compounds are so closely related.  


DwayneHoover, how long do you recommend waiting until I give it another try?

From (my subjective) experience, the threshold dose of 2ce is going to feel very similar to the other 2c compounds, so I wouldn't put too much stock into that... but, I dunno, 2ce seems similar to what you've described as positive from a mushroom experience. For a lot of people, very mental, very introspective, and a sense of satisfaction from working through those issues. And, very visual, of course. 


But sure, it's not a bad idea to take a threshold dose just to make sure you don't have any weird individual negative reaction.

Oh yea, the DPH was really unnecessary with the 2C-I and I would suggest when you do it again to skip the DPH.  Perhaps that is what made it feel so "flat" for you.  2C-I really has no body-load except for stimulation, but that is part of what makes it work.  


2C-E is ALOT different.  It can cause intense nausea, and widespread very weird overall body aches and pains that can be REALLY uncomfortable for most people.  2C-I does *NONE* of this.  Anyway these are why to do DPH with 2C-E.  It's unnecessary with 2C-I and might alter the trip more than you want.


I would say wait ONE week, then try 25mg on an EMPTY stomach (no fruit juice or other acidic beverages like soft drinks [look for citric acid on the label], ingested acids lower the potency of all phenethylamines) with no DPH.  THATs how to tell what 2C-I is really all about.  If you ever smoke weed... have some of that available to accentuate the trip and perhaps smooth over any temporarily excess stimmyness.  But if you DO feel "stimmy", don't sweat it... its how you know the drug us working.  Ever done MDMA?  There is a period of stimmyness the first hour or so... (with 2C-I about 1.5 hours)... which then melts away to reveal the drug's psychedelic effects like the drawing of a curtain.  A beer with its hops and alcohol is also fine and would also be good for the stimmyness.


Unless you are like me and find a mental way to ENJOY the stimulation, like an exciting carnival ride... just try to relax and breathe deep and enjoy the "liftoff" like you are in the "Booster" phase of taking off in a space rocket.  Dont psyche-out and start to panic.... it will melt away soon enough, just ride it out and you will be rewarded.  If you panic and start to freak like some people, well then all bets are off.  A good way to take your mind off it is to watch some exciting or trippy movie that you can let yourself be absorbed into, smoke a joint, etc... you'll be fine based on your report above.  Good luck!!


Heres a graphic they used to play at peak intense psychedelic moments of Grateful Dead shows, spelling out NAMASTE in Sanskrit... try to stare at it for a whilefull-screen in a dark room when peaking, haha!

I have done MDMA, so I know the stimulation you speak of quite intimately ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I don't mind it actually... I end up using the energy to dance, glove light, or talk.  I've had intense nausea from mushrooms but I noticed it was extremely psychosomatic, the more I would let myself go, the nausea would subside.  In fact, the reason I chose 2C-I first was because of how many people related the euphoria to MDMA.  


Well, I'm convinced to try this again.  Without DPH ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I think I was drinking soda on the come-up this weekend but I hadn't eaten in 2 or 3 hours.  I'll stick to water during the come up.  Is it okay to drink some juice mid-trip?  I always love fruit juice and fresh fruit while tripping.

Sure, juice after its absorbed its not an issue and very good for you for the nutrients and the extra energy from the sugars etc. 


But I don't think Ive seen many reports that relate 2C-I to the euphoria of MDMA.  MDMA is very very... PERSONAL.   It makes you feel totally romantically in love with every single individual molecule.  Whereas 2C-I is very NOT this.  It kind of makes me feel like The Buddha of the Universe... somewhat remote and aloof, but still feeling a certain god-like euphoria at being able to feel the amazingness of it all, but on a much more mental, far far less emotional way than MDMA.

I have seen someone get extreme nausea off of a (+-5) 26mg dose, as well as vomiting and bodyaches, just like you described for 2c-e. (and now that i think about, he got mindfucked as well)


for me though it was just as you described (same dose as friend), clearheaded, beautiful, and slightly stimmy, with almost no nausea

that experience report has been discussed here before.  the person in question was taking medication for pre-existing hyperthyroidism.  i'm fairly sure that their unique reaction was due to the combination of the medication and the 2c-i.


enough people have used 2c-i without problems that i feel that it must be reasonably safe to use.


however, i do notice that 2c-i feels more difficult to renally excrete than other 2cs.  perhaps that is psychosomatic though.


someone else mentioned DOI--keep in mind that DOI is active at one tenth of the mass that 2C-I is active at.  this means that DOI is theoretically 10x safer for our thyroid glands than 2C-I is.

It might be a mistake (I firmly agree with you here) but it's a fact that 2c-i is often described as "Mdma + light acid," which is TOTALLY offbase. But I mean even look at 2c-i's wiki article and it uses that description.

yeah, I've always wondered about this too - I found the empathogen side of 2c-i to be more amphetamine like, kind of like the talkativeness of d-amphetamine.


If I had to describe 2c-i, I'd say it was a more synthetic feeling, dumbed down version of mescaline.

that's exactly how it feels like to me, too. mescaline is euphoric for a psychedelic, but 2c-i is very dumbed down from it - the visuals feel less organic, as well.


however, when you dose high and with more intense ROAs (i've IM'd and insufflated before), it does get more of its own character - more bizarre of a headspace, things can honestly get a little dark - but interesting. my first time taking it (~25mg snorted) was actually more intense than my 2ce experience (although I have a feeling this could change if I dose higher on the 2ce), the visuals were insane, and I actually had an out of body experience where I heard myself talking on the phone from an observer's point of view. I was inebriated to the point where a family guy spoof of star wars was the most engrossing storyline I've witnessed. haha


people CAN make 2ci a powerful substance, but it requires high doses, intense ROAs, and *significantly* heightens the nausea and bodyload. and it certainly isn't like LSD or MDMA - very mescaline like visuals with a dark tinge.

Yea, I need 25 mg oral for perfect effects... less is not enough and while I can stand 30mg, I cant imagine doing more than that, way too intense stimilation.  What the hell were you thinking to snort or, my lord, inject 25 mg???!!!  Didnt you read any dosing advise?  Are you still suffering from IITS ("Indestructable Immortal Teenager Syndrome")?

well, I don't regret the insufflation experience at all. the bodyload was tough at first, but it proved to be one of the more insightful and incredible experience i've ever had. 


anyway, oral 2ci just doesn't do much for me - but i had bought a gram of it and i didn't want to waste $100 +. doesn't seem so unreasonable to me - I know people have IV'd it in excess of 100mg.

I've only gotten visuals with insufflation.  Heretofore I'd considered this related to tolerance but I think it's ROA.  I will experiment and report back.

LOL. I forgot to mention that manipulating the caplet (opening it, touching it a lot, etc.) dulls the appearance compared to the other caplets in the bottle. When I wanted to take the 2C-I dose, I poured out the bottle of 5-HTP and looked for the pill that wasn't as shiny as the other ones. I was able to definitively select the altered caplet.

It's a good combination actually, I always preload 2C-I with some 5-HTP now (one 100 mg cap). Just make sure to drink a cup or two of water when taking the 5-HTP - nausea hits if you take it on an empty stomach. One time I tried to take additional 5-HTP to extend the trip and it just ruined the rest of the trip due to nausea. Better to just let the trip run it's natural course.


Compared to trips without 5-HTP I would say that it adds more to the entactogen qualities.

What is the longest 2C-I has lasted for you guys? There are some reports on some other forums of 16 mg lasting 16 hours and I was curious as to whether you thought that could have been plausible.

i would consider that an idiosyncratic response.


Typical timeline for 2C-I for me is (iirc)

0:00 oral dosing, 16-22mg

1:30 come-up

3:00 peaking

5:00 plateauing

8:00 coming down

the rest is just residual stimulation

greetings shishigami, i know you saw my report on that other forum but just for the record,


A close friend 'apparently" tripped for ~36 hours, and didn't sleep for 50,

but i play that off as him being naive, large dose, and also being quite the dramatic fellow.


However, From personal experience I have had 14-16 hour trips off this stuff for sure. 

(30mg, so its a pretty high dose.)


EDIT; I would say the peak for me was around 9 hours in with gradually building intensity before that. Guess i'm alone on that

Hey so this is probably the worst idea ever but im going to ask anyways, if i did a super low dose of 2c-i could i get away with it being around ppl who dont approve of drug use? would a 5-10mg dose even be worth doing? im going to a concert and figure it will be pretty boring if im not on something ( i dont like the band). I can probably get away with telling them that i just took some xanax or something and thats why im acting weird they probably wouldnt question that. i have done a lot of other stuff and can keep my cool pretty well around people who dont know im tripping i just havent tried 2c-i before

In my opinion, anything below 12 mg you can easily get away with without being noticed. When tripping, it isn't uncommon for me to get some groceries on as much as 18-20 mg, and even then I walk around the store quite comfortably. So if you take about 10 mgs there won't be any problem with those 'unapproving people'.


However, you could question yourself why bother going to a concert that is boring, resorting to drug use to entertain yourself. It's not something you should make a habit of IMO, catch my drift? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Well, the mentality that "hey I'm bored imma just grab my stash" can quickly lead to you very frequently doing drugs with the excuse that you were just bored and looking to liven up an evening. 


Anyway, I think 5-10 mg of 2C-I would be mildly stimulating but not particularly trippy.

^^ Who knows, there are people who don't feel 10 mg at all, and there are people who get threshold experiences on as low as 2-3mg(like me). 10-12 mg is a trippy dose for me, and I think it would be entertaining(and with visuals). Do you have expirience with other 2Cs? 


Also, don't bother about other people, especially if they don't know you at all. People always had to make assumptions about others, and people don't really pay attention when they don't have to. It is similar to blind spot in your visual field. (Not really sure if I explained my thoughts clear).

I think he meant that if concert is fun, why do take drugs? It makes sense, but why not add more fun? 


BTW, how much experience with psychedelics do you have? If you tripped just a few times, I wouldn't advise taking 2C-I at concert, because it is not really comfortable and good setting. 2C-I has side-effects(nausea & body-load), which are quite pronounced during come-up, and you won't be able to lie down if you wish, and vomiting won't be very comfortable too. Besides that, 2C-I is a psychedelic, it can cause difficult experiences, having such kind of trip can be indeed worthwhile, but not when you're in public setting.

You would feel nothing at 5, possibly a little something at 10, but not much, IMO.

If you tripped just a few times, I wouldn't advise taking 2C-I at concert, because it is not really comfortable and good setting. 2C-I has side-effects(nausea & body-load), which are quite pronounced during come-up, and you won't be able to lie down if you wish, and vomiting won't be very comfortable too. Besides that, 2C-I is a psychedelic, it can cause difficult experiences, having such kind of trip can be indeed worthwhile, but not when you're in public setting.

You are right it is always better to be careful when considering psychedelics. However, in my extensive experience, I can't really consider 10 mg (or less) a true psychedelic, it is rather a stimulant with some soft psychedelic properties. Of course, every individual might react different. But if the OP has any experience with a true psychedelic whatsoever, I can't really imagine 10 mg 2C-I giving discomfort.


Bodyload and nausea are also - generally - dose-related, so although you definitely have a valid point, I was not really paying attention to the possibility of bodyload. Moreso because we hardly experience any bodyload on 2C-I, not even on ~20 mgs so I can't hardly expect (for myself) any problems on 10 mgs or less.

This is more or less exactly what I meant. There's no problem with making something that is fun 'more fun' by taking some 2C-I of whatever else. But I don't really see the point in going to a boring concert, so you have to resort to drug use to at least have a bit of fun. That said, I'm sure most people have done this at least once in their lifetime. I just think drugs should be used to add extra joy to joyful activitities, not to 'ease the pain' of boredom.

> Click to expand...
Unless you have a quite low susceptibility to 2C-I's effects, I can't imagine you won't feel anything at 10 mg. So it would definitely be worth doing, especially since it is also a mild social stimulant, meaning you are more likely to enjoy your company and lighten up the spirit with some nice jokes or whatever. Best advice would be to test how you feel under 10 mg at a more appropriate setting first, but being optimistic as I am I just can't foresee real problems with 10 mg 2C-I at a concert. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

lots of people find 10-12mg adequate for their tastes.  Plenty of folks do enjoy taking significantly more, but "tripping" seems to start at around 8-10mg for most people.  Much below ten and you'll probably just have a threshold type experience, or maybe a ++.  As always though, YMMV

10mg is just too low to actually get any psychedelic effects.  At that level it is just like some sort of upper.  Might as well just drink a couple stiff cups of Starbucks and same the 2C-I for actual tripping.  But to each his own I suppose.

but yeah, these things are quite variable from person to person.  I know a number of people that get decent visual & physical effects from 10-14mg, and at least one person that didn't notice much til 20mg. YMMV

Well, there are many people who don't get many psychedelic effects from 10-12 mg, but there are many people can trip on such dose. I underestimated the power of 2C-I untill I tried it. My first(and my girlfriend's first) PD was 2C-I. We both took 12 mg, and the experience was truly psychedeli(but difficult). I got some great(one of the most brilliant) visuals, I felt dissociated and emptied during the experience and I didn't had full control over the trip(though I didn't freakout). What is more important, I got certain "insights". Believe me, it was really impressive, but I am not a good writer to express it. As for my girlfriend, she didn't get any visuals, but she got strong mental effects, which not every psychonaut get from higher doses of more powerful psychedelics: extreme time dilation, (complete) loss of propriception, distortion of "body size"(she felt herself really small - like my finger). Again, I am not a good writer, but our experience was intense and profound, especially for just 12 mg of 2C-I.

Of course, first trips are always more magical, and I can handle 12 mg of 2C-I now fairly easily, and now I can't get such effects from this dose, but it is trippy for me.


Never underestimate the importance of set&setting and never underestimate the power of chemical. This sentence is not really for you, but for people who don't have much experience with PD.

It is indeed dose-related, and that's why I advise not to do doses higher than 12 mg. 2C-I is the most nauseating psychedelic I tried. Vomiting doesn't really correlate with comeup nausea, so I never puke on 2C-I, but it can be really uncomfortable.

This definetely makes sense. 


Instead of taking 2C-I in uncomfortable setting(at concert), why not just stay at home and take the same dose?

This advice is definitely good, especially is skazz don't have much psychedelic experience. 

I advice the same thing, but with paying attention to tolerance(in its usual sense).

IMO, it is better if someone takes 8-12 mg of 2C-I and get underwhelming results rather than if someone takes 20 mg of 2C-I and freak out, ruining not only his fun but also fun for other people.


Also, I think your recent comments in this thread can be interpreted like if they are about general tendencies, because you didn't state clearly that they are based on your experience. So I think any_major_dude left his response because he interpreted your comments in this way.

I think it is a general tendency if you read alot of trip reports that MOST people will find 10mg mainly stimulating and only very mildly psychedelic, if at all.   That will be the average response to that dose IN MY OPINION *of course*.  Duh.  Nice that you got major psychedelia from only 10 but that's not really typical in my experience AND in reading peoples' reports.   My "name" is on this.  I am saying it.  *OBVIOUSLY* it is only my opinion.  Again, duh!

So whats up with the nausea? It sounds like 10 mg can make some people really nauseous and some people wont even feel nausea at 20 mg? Does eating a lot or fasting before hand have an effect on this?

the side effects of each 2C-X will depend on body chemistry as well as stomach contents. check out the other thread right now about staggering doses, it contains more info on the nausea side of things.

How does an empty stomach help? If staggering the dose helps wouldnt having some food in your stomach slow the absorption and ease the nausea?

staggering dose just makes it not work as well... activity depends more on peak concentration not total amount.  why it helps, I dunno, I guess maybe because then it gets thru stomach into intestines and absorbed faster, so its sitting in there causing irritation (= nausea) for a much shorter period of time?

^^ I wouldn't say that full stomach considerably slows absorbtion of 2Cs. I am almost 100% sure that psychedelic nausea related to activation of (5-HT) receptors in the brain; it is not normal nausea/stomach irritation, it is a "hallucination"(however, if you vomit - you vomit in reality![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)) 


I you have little experience with 2Cs, I would suggest having very light meal before the trip, so your stomach won't be full, but won't be absolutely empty.

It is quite likely that the majority of nausea experienced with psychedelics is related to 5-HT receptor activation. But this does not mean the nausea is a hallucination. Probably the highest density of 5-HT receptors can be found in the intestines, where they control motility. Activation of these receptors by a psychedelic would cause spasms in your intestines, leading to a nauseous feeling. Beside that, the chemoreceptor trigger zone (the area of your brain that controls vomiting) also contains 5-HT receptors. Since this area is more easily accessed than deeper parts of the brain (it's function is to puke out harmful shit, so makes sense it is relatively easy accessible), it is quite common for the nausea to come up before the experience is at it's peak.


Empty stomach means it is more likely for psychedelics to end up in your intestines, which can cause major discomfort. Therefore, an empty stomach is not advisable. A light meal about an hour before intake is usually perfect. You can also try and talk yourself through the nausea; realize it is only caused by activation of receptors and not because you are actually sick or ate something nasty. Once your trip reaches full intensity, the nausea usually fades out. Oh yeah, and puking won't really help in most cases, since the chemoreceptor trigger zone is still activated by the psychedelic in your blood i.e. brain.

Well, the feeling of nausea is real in the same sens in which seeing visuals is real, however visuals are considered hallucinations, so why nausea isn't? 

Anyhow, I wasn't sure if it is possible to call nausea "hallucination", that's why I quoted it. It is very different from usual stomach discomfort, stomach ache, and usual nausea. Of course, YMMV.


EDIT:

I agree, but sometimes it provides great relief, and at least vomiting is ... well, "entartaining", so you don't have to tolerate this feeling in your stomach.

Well, first of all, technically speaking, visuals are not hallucinations but pseudohallucinations. But that's more about semantics than anything else, so fuck it... But in light of this debate/discussion/whateveryawannacallit, it does make sense to come up with this argument. Visuals are a pseudohallucination, in that the user can easily distinguish them from what is real; you can't interact with visuals in a serious way. However, the nausea is (in the majority of cases) directly caused by activation of receptors in the gut or in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ). Therefore, it is indistinguishable from 'real' nausea, since that is also caused inside the gut or the CTZ. So the nausea could be regarded as a true hallucination, since it is indistinguishable from 'real' nausea. But since it is not a product of the mind, I think the term 'hallucination' is out of place here...


Vomiting might provide relief yes, but it is generally not a healthy thing to do. Also, you can easily trick yourself in some placebo-effect of having to vomit every time instead of just blocking out the nausea until it takes off on it's own. This is especially well-known (at least where I'm from) in the case of MDMA, where some users are absolutely convinced they have to puke almost every time to start up their roll. In my experience, people that know how the nausea originates are usually a lot less likely to experience it, and that fighting the nausea mentally (i.e. waiting it out and just think of something else) creates a sort of natural resistance to developing nausea in your next trip. That's why I prefer to elucidate the mechanism and telling people to just wait until the dope hits the mind, instead of going puking. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

found 2c-i to be unpleasantly stimulating, almost more stimulating then psychedelic


gained lots of insights and was quite giggly, honest and humourous; mild empathy effects, but wasn't able to up the dose into any sort of visual effects due to the excess stimulation effects


perhaps it was the batch or my biochemistry (probably this) or the setting, but there was a good middle of the trip after i dosed a little more and it became rather uncomfortable, but drew calm in thinking through topics of spirituality. later it became quite euphoric and more trip like


perhaps with the 2c-b i will be trying soon i will stagger it with smaller doses at a time


worthwhile, but a bit uncomfortable

it made my spidey senses tingle

HUH?  Were you high during basic biology class in grade school?   Stomach primarily DIGESTS substances (but some minor absorption occurs here, though not much); intestines ABSORB nutrients/chems into the bloodstream.


So, any drug has really got to make it past stomach into the intestine to work... except for LSD which is active in such minute amounts that it IS absorbed across mucus membranes enough to start working immediately.


But a drug like 2C-I that needs 15-25mg to work, has pretty much got to make it to the intestine to be absorbed and function... therefore slowing down this process by having it mix with food in the stomach is counterproductive.  You want the normally fairly rapid absorption of taking it with liquid on an empty or mostly empty stomach... a small snack is probably not going to affect it much, and may promote enzymes that make it absorb a little better possibly and if you are prone to nausea could help.


Personally I am not and have never once gotten nausea from 2C chems... friends who did it empty got off as expected within the hour...  those who did it after a meal complained that they were not getting off, or only felt "a little something" 2-3 HOURS after consuming.

A couple weeks ago I took 18mgs of 2c-I, after a heavy lunch and heavy dinner. I waited almost 3 hours to take it, then I swallowed it in capsule form. I still felt very full, and there was still food digesting in my stomach. I didn't feel anything until 3hours later. It was like somebody hit a switch, and I was tripping hard. There was absolutely, no stomach discomfort. It was the most intense 2c-I trip i've had in the range of 15-25mgs. It may delay the effect, but it didn't effect the intensity for me.


Edit: Just for the record, I normally take 2c-x, 2-3 hours after a light meal, and it usually takes 45mins-1hour to kick in.

Any else experience 2c-i's tendency to not truly end until you sleep? I recognize that most compounds have a degree of this quality, but if I don't sleep I will continue to exist in that space where I am inundated with sensory data and patterns and light up to 24 hours later.

sleep does seem an integral part of getting back to baseline for many people, myself included.  Though I do know some people that come fully down, especially from the shorter lived things, and feel normal before going to sleep.  Also, sleep deprivation has many psychedelic-esque effects on its own.

Ever heard of pharmacology and ADME? I might have been high during basic biology class, but at least I'm not using my elementary school knowledge in a discussion on this level... Uptake of any chemical is only dependent on physicochemical properties of the chemical and the part of the body where it is present, and thus can happen almost anywhere in the body. Since 2C-I is a primary amine, I suspect (know) it has a basic pKa and thus will primarily be taken up in the first part of the intestines.


However, theory is not always what will happen 'in practice'. I was just referring to personal experience with different 2C-chemicals, where me and my friends have observed that the abdominal nausea is much less when taken about 1 hour after a **light** meal. I believe a (partial) explanation is that activation of serotonergic receptors in the intestines creates excessive motility, leading to discomfort (and possible diarrhea). But this is probably a bit above your level, judging by the reasoning in your previous post. So perhaps you should do some reading on the matter first this time, before commenting on my mental clarity during kindergarten...

Lol.


Tried 2C-I for the first time a few days ago. I've had a lot of experience with 2C-E(25mg tops), so I figured I would take 30mg for my first time.


And boy was it great! It was everything I thought it was going to be. Didn't get nauseous or feel any body load really, but the body load could have been alleviated by the temazepam I took way earlier in the day.

I agree with 3rd I Blind that it is best taken after a light meal.  Every time I've seen someone take some on an empty stomach, they always end up puking.  I've never dosed after a huge meal but I can't imagine it being pleasant.  


Also, does anyone know what makes this substance so dose dependent?  For me, a 16 mg dose leaves me quite functional where a 20 mg dose has me tripping hard.  It feels like I've taken twice as much when I've only increased the dose by 25%.  Compared to other stuff I've tried, the dosage curve seems much less linear.

Technically, a dose-response curve is never linear both always sigmoidal in shape. The perceived difference in potency between two doses of the same substance is determined by the steepness of the curve and the percentage of 'response' that is physiologically (or psychologically, in this case) signifcant. As you might understand, a substance that is only noticable effective at 30% response will have a (perceived) linear dose-response relationship, since most substances are on the linear part of the curve between 30%-70% response. If your substance is already active at the 5% response level, doubling your dose can give a larger boost in response, since you are on the exponential part of the curve.


However, since we are talking psychedelics here, the dose is not the only thing that determines the intensity of the effects. There is also set, setting, your own body chemistry and some random factors. When also taking into account factors that influence pharmaceutical and biological availability (stomach contents, pH of stomach and intestines, blablabla), it becomes clear it's very hard to make any statements on the dose-response curve of a substance based on a few experiences. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Like 2C-I, the iodine is attached to an aromatic ring without any accompanying groups to make it reactive (eg 2,4-dinitro), so it isn't going to be detached in a month of sundays by the body's metabolic processes...

With various 2C's i've heard of people reporting different amount of pain from different ROA's.  


I've heard some say 2C-D is not painful rectally, however I can say for certain that it IS painful if you squird it up yer butt..Same goes for 2C-T-7.


And the one time I did snort 5 mgs of 2C-D, it felt **quite** caustic, and I immediately regretted it.  That was after I read on Bluelight that "snorting 2C-D isn't that bad".

Your mouth's mucous membranes are probably a lot tougher than the recesses of your sinus cavity too, so there is always that...


Remember, snorting any 2C-X drug is suppose to be quite painful, so there is at least some reason to beleive that holding a pure 2C-X drug under your tongue might give you some problems.  Trust me it's not THAT fun tripping with a lingering chemical burn that won't go away *glares at DPT*.....

This is a great post chemical wizard. I remember my first time with DPT. I thought that snorting it would be the way to go so I didn't have to use so much. Wrong decision to say the least. The burn and after burn I experienced made snorting 2c-i look painless. The intense trip was clouded by the burn for at least half an hour. Hurts me to even think about it now.

Yeah I had an awesome DPT trip, but the three of us who underwent the experience all swore we would not snort DPT again.  It's just tooooo disgusting and painful.  Even 12 hours later I could still feel a chemical burn at the back of my throat.


I've snorted small bits of 2C-s before, and they all feel like snorting red hot glass shards or something, even at 5 mgs or less.

I have stopped taking 2c's as of late, but after all is said and done I still enjoy a low dose 2c-i trip. I know it is "shallow" and doesn't really show you too much, but I feel if the user is already experienced and open that it can take you to that special place just easy as 2c-e. 

2c-i has an energetic pulse to it that helps ease you into the trip. I have never taken 2c-b but from what I've read I would probably enjoy it.

I've actually never embarked on a just 2C-I trip.  I've only mixed it with acid.  I really want to have a solid 2C-I trip soon.


For a while, the only 2C's that I had access to where -E, -I, -T-2, and -T-7, and any time I tripped, I would do 2C-E 90% of the time, and 2C-T-7 the other 10% of the time....maybe those figure are off, but close enough.


Then 2C-D entered the picture and everything else took a break pretty much.  Sooooo many drugs, so little time.  For serious though.


But now I want to try another 2C-I adventure.  I think it sounds like exactly what I'm lookin for - a good amount of psychedelia with a very small chance of mind-raping-brain-fuck, but still lasts all day long.  


I pretty much haven't done any 2C's since.....months and months and months i guess, I can't even really remember....Mostly I want to explore the tryptamines more as of late.  They're soooooo much mentally crazier though, I find myself shying away from such intense experiences.


That's probablyl just cause it's winter though, and I don't like feeling like I'm stuck inside while I'm tripping during poopy weather.  


Wow what a run on post.  I'm sorry everyone.

I think the 2Cs must somehow activate the vanniloid receptor as they're fairly similar in structure (the vanilloid receptor is the one that makes chillies burn like buggery) to the aromatic part.


One thought is you could always try eating a little something with chillies in first before snorting it in the hope that the receptors will already be occupied with capsacin (then again that's hardly an improvement for most people!)


Oh and one way to avoid unpleasantness (well relatively) with DPT is, as Sherlock Holmes proclaims at the end of Hound of the Baskervilles,"Watson, the needle" (aLTHOUGH HE WAS A COKE FIEND). aLSO MUCH MORE ECONOMICAL WITH THE DRUG AND MUCH LESS UNPLESANT IF STERILE PROCEEDURE IS FOLLOWED


Fuck capslock horror!!

if mr. bulbous' theory is correct, then 2C compounds could cause a temporary downregulation of vanilloid receptors.  i'm going to test this out at some point to see if i notice the same effect as your friend, Yerg.

since we're on the subject of snorting 2c's...


anyone consider 2c-i extremely unique in its insufflation pain as compared to the other 2c's? 


snorting the other 2c's produced a big punch in the face that lasted for about half a minute... pretty much the same as snorting any other painful chem. 


but 2c-i was way more... "sinister." snorting it produced no immediate pain for a couple of minutes... and then suddenly an intense stinging manifested itself in my nose that lasted about 5 minutes, the drip about 30. my friend and I got this effect consistently while snorting it (about 6 times each for us) and it was far worse than any other insufflation experience we've ever experienced. *shudders at the memories*

Tried 20 mg of this last night, which was my first experience with PEA hallucinogens (not counting MDMA/M1). The powder didn't want to dissolve in room temperature vodka, but warming it up and stirring for a couple minutes did the trick.


Main effects were enjoyable without being overwhelming; I felt pretty much in control. I could easily get lost in my own thoughts if I let it happen, but there were none of the pushy racing thoughts I've felt with mushrooms. Tactile sensations were enhanced in a way that's hard to describe, and even imaginary touches felt quite vivid. (I was unable to persuade my gf to make sexy time, but maybe someday...)


Side effects were mild. Some body tension and aches but no nausea or anorexia. Often felt warm and sweaty, especially for the first couple hours. Tylenol seemed to help.


Pot greatly intensified the trip, especially the visuals. My gf noticed the same thing with K2 Blue, which reportedly led to her first "real" experience of a psychedelic thought process - she's taken 4-AcO-DIPT several times, but I think her SSRI detracts from the effects.

As a rule, I've found that the phenethylamine psychedelics are much more subject to control as to how 'deep' things get ie it's much easier to return to concensus reality if needs be. Tryptamines are subject top less control and more of a case of just having to let go and go with the drug, rather than try and control thought processes. Then there's LSD, which for me has always been a case of 'hang on and hope for the best' as it's so in your face that any attempts to control the initial phases of intoxication (generally the first 3-4 hours) generally lead to rather unpleasant experiences. Another differfence I've found is that PEAs are much more outgoing and benefit from the input of others whereas tryptamines are much more of an internal experience, where it's a lot more common to close eyes and not really interact with people (DMT/DPT being the ultimate example where the best part of the experience is spent eyes closed, lost in an internal world even if others are present).


2C-I was, I found, one of the psychedelics that were the easiest to exert control over, the only one that comes to mind that was even moreso was 2C-T-21.


Of course al of the above observations are sependant upon the dose used - if you do things like shove 50mg of 2C-E up your backside, all aspects of being able to control the depth of intoxication are just swept aside because it's so intense an experience (and therefore not really recommended for most people). I once accidentally IMed 25mg of 2C-I (thinking it was ketamine in the vial) and then discovered that even a drug that normally wasn't too hard to deal with when used orally, can become a real white knuckle ride

When I take 2C-I, I always feel like my whole body wants to fart badly. I love this substance though. Each trip on it is like the song 'Echoes' from Pink Floyd. Very beautiful in the beginning then extremely dark and uncomfortable in the middle and peaceful in the end. It can suck you deep in a vortex of psychedelic thoughts, for example, the last time I took 2C-I, I looked myself in the mirror (about 5-6 hours into the trip) and I saw my reflection in my eye and it felt like I was seeing myself in a different reality/dimension, like a parallel univers or something. It was so psychedelic and intense that I kept thinking about it for at least a day or so. Incredible.

I've consumed a total of about 200mg of 2C-E earlier this year (TOTAL, not all at once). Finally got a hold of some 2C-I and tried 14mg the other day. All I can say is WOW, this stuff is mild by comparison. 14mg did leave me wanting for more but I plan on a 20mg trip today.


I actually LIKE how it's not as visual as 2C-E. 2C-E's visuals are usually so vibrating and intense that it can induce nausea for me. Nice to have a compound with more relaxed, flowing visuals though I'll have to wait until this 20mg trial finishes before I comment further ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I see this thread is a bit stagnant, so I hope I can get my questions answered!


I'm a rather experienced tripper, I've done LSD in various doses over 25 times, shrooms about 15 times, 2C-B (not sure of dosage), DXM, and Salvia. I'm looking into picking up some 2C-I for an upcoming festival for me an my friends and was looking on some information on it, or some validation to my information.


-How long does 2C-I last on average when taken orally?

-What's the time frame range like, time for come-up, plateau/peak, and coming down?

-What's a good dosage on average?

-How does it feel in comparison to other psychedelics?


Here's what I've come to understand, please correct any misinformation. I've heard it takes up to two hours when taken orally for it to kick in. I've heard that it will plateau for roughly 2-6 hours, dependent on dose and then start to slowly taper off for another 2-4 hours, totaling about 6-10 hours total, with the later half being very mild. Erowid reports 10-25mg as a common dose, which seems a wide window. From reading around here many users say they've enjoyed 20mg, for someone who's experienced in tripping would this be a nice "easy"/fun trip? I've heard that overall 2C-I is mild and a great beginners psychedelic.


Any more feedback on this?

Your information is basically correct.


Remember that with any drug, higher doses seem to kick in faster. I'd bet 100mg oral 2C-I will be a rocket ride to Neptune within the first hour. But yes, in general there is a full two hours of absolutely nothing before the trip actually takes shape.


As you have a bit of trip experience, I'd say you're fairly safe with anywhere in the 20-25mg range for a moderate +++ ride (Shulgin scale, not shroomery). Many people highly enjoy this compound in the 8-12mg range for a nice ++ time. I've even heard good things from people who only eat 3mg and get just a little mood lift.


As always with any new substance in your possession, use <1mg as an allergy test before eating half the bag. And use a scale please! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I will also repeat the benefits of "gradual" or "stepped" dosing, which can alleviate certain come-up tensions that are common to the 2C-family. Personally I have found 4mg oral at T+0h, followed by 18mg oral at T+1h, produces a much smoother trip than a single 22mg dose would. The same can be said for simply dissolving your full dose in a drink and sipping over the course of an hour. Seems the body has a better time adapting to the transition.


Some people call 2C-I a "toy" or "candy psychedelic", but it can be every bit as powerful as mushrooms or LSD in the hands of someone who wants to take it deeper. A friend of mine faced his inner demons and resolved to change his life on a 22mg 2C-I trip in the mountains. I was with him at the time on a similar dose, and I was just rolling on the ground laughing at the clouds while he was wrestling a bear in his mind o.o

If one wanted to call any psychedelic "a candy" or "a toy", it shouldn't be 2C-I definitely IMO. From 2C series there are lighter drugs like 2C-C. If you aren't a type of a person who can fully control the experience, 2C-I is much less "forgiving" than 2C-C.

I always found 2c-i to feel like toy/eye candy, but I only have it to compare to 2c-e, 2c-x RC wise, which is many times more intense that 2c-i. Very similar visually, but lacks nearly all mindfuck. Changes perception of reality somewhat, but not to the extent where I'm confused/can't function normally, even on high doses.

I will be getting a sample of 2c-i soon, so I have a question. How does 2c-i compare visually to 2c-e, snorted? The other night I snorted a bit more then 10mg of 2c-e and it completely kicked my ass lol, there were 'living patterns' on literally everything, my own hands were fractalizing, CEV's were also intense. Would snorting 2c-i produce similar visual effects?

I find the style of visuals are very similar (like the 'Kaleidoscope on crack' patterning effect) but much less intense on 2C-I. I also find that the visuals on 2C-E can be a bit dizzying and uncomfortable. Not on 2C-I, though. Everything flows quite smoothly. I get more colour enhancement and sparkles from 2C-I as well.

**2C-I Phosphate**


Dr. Jekyl had a couple grams of 2C-I laying around so he converted it to the monobasic phosphate yesterday. Let it dry out overnight. Today Jekyl took 20 mg orally mixed with water. He commented that the taste was much less objectionable than that of the HCL. With the HCL you can never get the taste out of your head, with the phosphate it's not even a problem, Jekyl said. Very little body load. Very slight muscle tremors for a short time, not even unpleasant, Jekyl reported. He said nausea was virtually non-existent, though appetite was reduced. He did eat some though and it sat well in Jekyl's belly. 20 mg was a nice recreational dose, very controllable but with pleasant light visuals. When Jekyl smoked some hash it brought out the visuals nicely. Dr. Jekyl's conclusion was that 2C-I phosphate is vastly preferable to the HCL and at 20 mg a quite nice experience overall. Never will Jekyl use the HCL form again, he maintained. No human being should ever have to taste that s*** again, especially him, he pointed out emphatically.

Seriously though? I figured you had posted in PD enough to know that SWIMing and all variants aren't allowed here lol

Fine, whatever, just trying to be a little creative there. I just like to refer to myself as Dr. Jekyl now and then, and write in the third person, that's all. What's wrong with that? Anyway, I tried upping the dosage to 25 mg today, with 50 mg diphenhydramine. The diphenhydramine did nothing because I still felt nausea. It appears that making the phosphate salt instead of the HCL only makes it taste less bad. There's apparently no way to make 2C-I non-objectionable.

Thanks, right you are. The phosphate salt also burns your nose if you snort it, so no real advantage at all. I just tried it because the patent for amphetamine phosphate claims that it reduced the side effects compared to the sulfate. The body load may be reduced some but the nausea is still ever present for the first few hours. I'm not going to use the compound again. Any nausea at all is enough to make it not worthwhile. Why purposely do something that you know will make you feel unwell? I'm out.

If you simply want to feel good, maybe opiates, benzodiazepines or stimulants are more up your alley. Nausea and bodyload are certainly not unique to 2ci and are symptoms exerted by most psychedelics to some degree or another. I suppose there's basically the nbomes, 2cc, LSD and a few others for ya..

^ definitely. tried 2c-i-nbome and it had a better body high and less body load than any other psychedelic I've ever done, including LSD and DMT. Only side effect was vasoconstriction on the comedown. You don't even lose your appetite! That is awesome you have to admit, chowing down on a huge meal while tripping balls lol


kinda blows though, the big & dandy thread for 25i-nbome isn't really active, i guess not many people do it. that needs to change though! this stuff is better than LSD guys.

**2ci & comedowns..**


Im not sure if its the right thread to be writing on about 2ci,  i took it

people told me it was the same as 2cb but it was alot more intence and diffrent. 

i took about 10micrograms, wich isent alot as others i know have consumed, but still got a really intense 

come up. at first i didnt really know what was happening to me, i was upstairs in my room chilling out, when istarted feeling weird, like i couldnt catch up with my breathing!  i wasnt tripping out at this point. i came down stairs, thought id switch on the pc and try and figure out more about this drug.  all i saw was  ' lasts up to about 8 hours'  blablabla.. i was like woah reading this would probley deff me out more! :') so i switched that off, and put some music on, wich made me feel even more weird.  (obviously my body wasnt agreeing much to this comeup).   after 2 hours of feeling like dying. i felt ok but still having the odd feeling of probley becoming a cripple or something. i just chilled myself out and tryed to enjoy it as much as i could in the end i did end up enjoying it more. it was pretty crazy actually.  but i probley wouldnt take 2ci again. 


Comedown? 

i took the 2ci 2 days ago.

but today i am feeling some kinda weird. 

feeling in my body, i cant explain it much but it keeps feeling weird to breathe, really really light rushes, and tingles, and warm fuzzy feelings.. and my mind feeling too relaxed at random times..

would this be classed as a comedown? 

because some of these feelings is how i felt when i had 2ci. but it was MORE intense on 2ci. alot more.

or could it be anxiety? i dont usely get anxiety like this if it is. 

ive tryed googling' 2ci comedowns, and not found alot onit. 

but im also a everyday weed smoker 

and i havent had that for 2 days either!

so im compleatly confused. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


help would be nice ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) xx

cannabis is intensified for a day or two after a strong trip especially with the 2c's. So you get high and sort of slip into that 2c-i headspace. Don't worry it goes away quickly. It could be many things but there's a possibility for you.


i'm also assuming you meant milligrams, even at 10mg 2c-i is very weak, so I'm not sure. Was the dose measured properly with an accurate scale? it sounds like you had a pretty heavy come up, i don't get those with 2c-i until at least 30mg, maybe you took a higher dose than you think?

With no tolerance, 10mg of 2C-I can be very intense. The purity varies. 12mg of the best product I've run across had my wife hallucinating and full-blown tripping, borderline to overwhelming. I got it last summer from a good source and I've never felt the need to go beyond 18mg.


Your symptoms 2 days later however are likely just coincidental. I've never had a residual effect from 2C-I.

The next two days after 2c-i, if I rubbed my legs or feet against my bed or sheets, there would be this tingly euphoric sensation. A little hollow in feeling, but I remember doing it for a couple minutes at a time - because it was an interesting after-effect. I didn't really get anything like that while I was on 2c-i.


One other thing, I don't know how many other people experienced this. But I get a tingling sensations/very minor pains  in my teeth (usually front my front rows) that starts on the comedown. It's generally gone the same day - by the time It's fully dropped out of my system.

This'll likely be merged with the Big & Dandy 2C-I Thread, but since you're new you have a chance to reply first - and this might be left here a little longer first since this is quite a specific question that might get skipped over there.


What you're experiencing actually sounds like some left over vasoconstriction to me, some stimulants and stimulant psychedelics like the 2Cs cause this for certain people - I had it a bit with 2C-E.


It could also be psychosomatic, you often have slightly heightened senses for a few days to a week after taking psychedelics, so you might just be noticing things that were already there that little bit more ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

10 mg nasally of good 2c-i is fine for someone with no stimulant tolerance


sadly i find myself unable to enjoy high doses of 2c-anything without being over stimulated yet again i do 10mg of adderal and 2 hours later i wanna come down

which really disappoints me i like the 2c's and doc a lot more than i ever liked lsd i didnt get such a mental head fuck off 2c-i or doc like i did from L i found with 2c's and dox compounds your able to talk sense in yourself easier because of the stimulant effects 2c's and dox compounds always make me feel like a mild candy flip in low-average does and they can cause a lot of people to wig out and get over dehydrated and the long duration seems to be a factor in that with stimulation


trippin for 12+ hours is murder on your body and brain(atleast til you sleep,eat,drink ,etc)


also what was your ROA? nasal? oral? boof?


capsule?(ive seen weird cases where a capsule can not fully dissolve and leaves ya a present for later when you dont want it haha)


EDIT: extended 2c-i use is known for its hppd(Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder ) i felt an after glow for about 2 months after killing a gram of killer 2c-i in about 4-5 days

Holy shit man THAT IS RIDICULOUS!!! And VERY VERY dangerous!   A very strong dose of 2C-I is 25mg.  A gram is 1000mg.  This is obviously a fib because there is NO WAY a person would be able to consume an entire GRAM over the course of 4/5 days and not end up in the hospital or dead.

I don't know about that Dwayne. With the tolerance you build, it's easy to escalate doses pretty quickly. At a festival this summer, I took my first dose of psychedelics on the Friday morning, and after dtripping for all of Friday and Saturday, on Sunday morning a 50mg dose of 2C-C did absolutely nothing, nor did a drop of acid. I can definitely believe that someone could polish of a gram of 2C-I in a few days if they set their mind to it.

**High dose 2C-I**


Tonight I've been reading a bunch of the trip reports for 2C-I on Erowid. Nearly all of them had dosages of 25mg or less, while there were a few about accidental overdoses of 100mg or more. I haven't been able to find anything in, say, the 30-60mg range. Are there any of you out there who have (intentionally ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)) done 30mg or more of 2C-I? I did 36mg once several years ago, and I'd like to visit that space again someday, but the body load was pretty tough (waaaay too much muscle tension).

Of course, I only think of searching the forum AFTER posting this...![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) Here's a few reports I found so far:


[http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/484274-2ci-30mg-range](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/484274-2ci-30mg-range)

I still think it's interesting that hardly anyone ever tries to go above 20-25mg. I guess that's the point for most people where the physical problems start to dominate everything else.

man i know that 25-30 mg 2c-b would be mind blowing as i experienced it last weekend- however 2c-i lasts longer and has a worse body load so i wouldnt think going above that would be smart never the less let me know if/whenu do how it goes!

Merged this since discussion that goes against HR needn't be emphasized by having its own thread, let's keep it low profile in the B&Ds.

You're throwing on an extra 20mg of a 2c like its nothing? This seems incredibly irresponsible given their dose-effects curve. I urge you to act with caution, but I guess the fact that you took 80mg of this substance makes me think my words are wasted. Have you no concern for your health? You're in untested waters here, and this kind of rash behavior may very well lead you to great harm someday.

Yeah, I was really hoping for reports in the 30-50mg range or so, not a bunch of bragging about surviving massive overdoses. Thought I made that clear, but I guess not...


I usually do 2C-I in the range of 15-20mg, and it's interesting enough but it feels a little superficial sometimes. A few times I've gone up to 25mg, and gotten a glimmer of a deeper headspace there, but the body load was verging on the uncomfortable. The one time I went higher than 25mg was when I tried it at 36mg, and in the middle of the trip I had a very profound experience of entity contact where there were these aliens standing around me in a semicircle communicating with me telepathically. What's really weird is that several years later, I was flipping through the book "Advanced Magical Arts" by R. J. Stewart, and in the middle of the book I came across a drawing (figure 11 in chapter 5, "Experience of the Underworld") which looked very much like the aliens I saw during that trip. I coulda plotzed. :D


Anyways, I think 2C-I has the potential to be a deeper psychedelic than most people give it credit for, and I was just trying to see if there was anyone else out there who has explored it at higher levels, and what they found there. The body load does get to be a problem at higher doses...36mg had me writhing around on my bed with my teeth chattering like crazy and my eyeballs wiggling so much that I couldn't see anything. Haven't had a lot of time for experiments lately, but maybe somewhere between 25 and 36 will turn out to be my sweet spot...

I started out with 20 and worked my way up. I've probably taken 2C-I at least 25 times.

Hello all,


I ate some 2cI the other day. Dose was about 15-16mg. I figured I would write up a pseudo-report and post it here rather than TR.


Backstory: I had stayed up very late the night before. When I lay down to fall asleep I was extremely drained, but was also hungry. I had no food though, and didn't feel like trying to go out and get some food. So I lay there. And I wanted to smoke some weed, but I was too drained to get up and load the bowl. I never actually slept though. I just lay there tossing and turning all night long. And then it was day time, and the girl got me up and we were on doing things around the house, cleaning and throwing things out. We had to move some things in the truck today, go to the dump and whatever else. I bought a bagel from d&d, but it sucked and I didn't really eat it. After some errands we went out to eat. I didn't eat though. I just drank booze and beer. We stayed there for more than 3 hours... so much for errands. We completed the errands, delivering some furniture to my place. When we got there and set everything up I was buzzing hard from the booze and mentioned, lets eat some 2cI. The girls had things to do, but they said sure. Within minutes I had the doses weighed up and we consumed them.... Probably not the best idea... but it was done and said.


The trip: Now, I hadn't really eaten anything today. My stomach was empty except for coffee milk and booze. ugh... Now the 2cI was beginning to take hold 30-40 minutes later. My stomach was not feeling it though. Neither was my girl. Our other friend (it was her first time with a 2c) had no body discomfort although felt weird during the come-up. I didn't expect much of a trip from the dose... I think mostly cause I was drunk, ad haven't had a strong psychedelic experience in a while... they've all been very light trips. For some reason the 2cI took complete hold 1.5 hours after dosing. I was tripping good. It was very acid like. 

The visuals surprised me very much. Our friend was working on some artwork, and so I tried my best to help. I was playing with her supplies and paper. I looked at a blank sheet of white paper, and my mind was blown away by the patterns in the paper. Our friend was having trouble drawing because the lines on the paper were wiggling too much. We were all tripping strongly. It was good, but somewhat unexpected. 

We talked a lot about the ups and downs of life. We had a funny moment where we each exclaimed that we had been feeling like shit the past couple days. And we all agreed, but then we tried to set a date to when we started feeling like shit.... and we said shit, maybe its been our whole life. We laughed at how absurd this was. All our conversations were changing scope... being inside the box to outside the box, so to speak - talking about the now to talking about the whole. I felt extremely detached from the world, not in a ketamine way, but in a psychedelic way. 

I was blasted, and was in +3 territory. We all loved it. Me and my girl, for some reason, had a lot of stomach discomfort... It wasn't terrible, but we had to keep puking out of our butts. I think this was on account of our diets that day and the previous day.. and the booze. I walked to the store at one point, and being in the store felt so odd. Walking through the park felt odd... but all in a good way... I was seeing life unfold. I was more aware of everything outside my purpose (my purpose being to get food). Normally I would walk and see nothing, but now I looked at the outlines of the trees, and the space between all these things. Memories flooded me of all my prior walks. 


Come down: The actual trip lasted 4-6 hours... I wasn't really keeping track of time. We all came down to a certain level and were left with some stimulation. I didn't sleep for another few hours. I waited until sunrise to go get some sandwiches and milk, so that I could eat and get my diet back to healthy, considering the past couple days I was pretty bad to my diet. 


Conclusion: 2cI is really awesome. It is very acid-like in my opinion. I liked where my mind went. The visuals were impressive. I feel like they work better when you keep the dose smaller, for some reason. I think I hit too much of a mind-fuck to see the visuals when I get to higher doses. This has been the same with 2ce. With 2ce I'll eat 12mg, and get loads of visuals, but if I eat 25mg I'm given a complete mind-fuck, and I don't really realize the visuals. I have eaten 2cI at higher doses also... 25-30mg or so... and was not as aware of the visuals as I was in this trip. I think it could have also been due to the strangeness of the situation... It's hard to determine. 


My advice. 15-18mg of 2cI is awesome. 


P.S. this hasn't been proofread, and it took me only 5 or so minutes to write up. Sorry if my writing sucks, and if it is hard to follow. I think that my main conclusion has something to do with being surprised at how 16mg of powder put me out of this world for a little while. It was pretty euphoric. 


P.P.S I have not eaten 2cI in close to a year.

I haven't been able to find anything in, say, the 30-60mg range. Are there any of you out there who have (intentionally ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)) done 30mg or more of 2C-I? I did 36mg once several years ago, and I'd like to visit that space again someday, but the body load was pretty tough (waaaay too much muscle tension).

As well as quite a lot of 10-25mg doses, I've taken 30mg, 35mg, 40mg and 60-65mg. I've also had roughly 70mg of 2C-E, unintentionally.


Experiences are interesting. I had more problems with the body load around the 30mg range than with higher doses - I was a bit too scattered to focus on any physical discomfort. Coordination goes out the window - on 40mg it took me 15 minutes to get up two flights of carpeted stairs (they were flowing downwards like water, most disconcerting) and on 60-65mg I'm pretty sure I spent the peak lying naked on my bed rubbing myself up and down with my hands. At 40mg it also took me about 5 minutes to figure out that the discomfort I was feeling was thirst, and another 5 minutes to figure out that I could fix it by filling my glass with water... which is why I started to try to climb the stairs! Visuals remain completely grounded in reality at 40mg and apart from a couple of hours at the peak, the same at the highest doses I've taken... what I mean is, you can tell what everything around you is, including recognising people. Headspace is generally positive, but gets increasingly disjointed and unfocused as dosage rises - I've never had any particularly profound or mystical experiences with the stuff, nor any intense epiphanies or realisations, but on the flip side I've never had any bad experiences and have only ever had two bouts of unhappiness or paranoia that were easily dealt with. I find it a fun, light-hearted, comparatively social psychedelic at lower doses and an interesting but ultimately unfulfilling one at higher doses - the experiences are all fun, but they don't make it beyond that and you lose a lot of coherence, attentiveness and memory of the experience.


50mg is probably the highest I'd recommend (inferring from the two doses around it) if you're interested in high-dose 2C-I, experienced with the stuff and build up to that level over a few well-spaced trips. I can't imagine it being remotely unsafe and I had no side-effects that were even slightly worrying. Duration seems to increase at higher doses - detectable effects after about 12 hours at the highest two doses, about 10 hours at 40mg, etc. Factor that in to your preparations if you do try it. 


My favourite dose is 15mg or so. Low enough to avoid much physical discomfort, and high enough to experience all of what I'd consider its primary positives. I wouldn't take a large dose again and I think there are better substances to experiment with at these intensities. 


(That said, the 40mg trip was great fun. It was an accidentally high dose and I was thoroughly miserable for the first 30 minutes of proper effects, then it occurred to me that people take the drug for *fun* and the idea was so ridiculous that I creased up laughing for god knows how long. After I finally stopped laughing I was in a great mood for the rest of the trip. I went to play snooker that morning with residual visuals and was better than usual).

Do you consistently experience this length of trip with 2C-I? And are you sure it's 2C-I? That seems a very long time for a 2C-I trip to last.

Hey,


Can anyone give me some information of low doses of 2cI? Links to trip reports a welcome to. I'm particularly interested in doses of about 8mg oral.


I usually dose 15-25mg oral or 6-10mg snorted with this material. However lately, I have been think about taking 8mg for a while now, and possibly screwing around with the 8-12mg range. Last time I ate 15mg and it was a really wonderful experience. 


I have experimented with low doses of 2ce (as well as high doses). My low doses were great between 8 - 12mg. A couple times I ate between 5-6mg. Those experiences were not as great, and were overpowered by the weed I was smoking. Between 8 and 12 was awesome though. I've also snorted between 3-6mg on a few occasions, and those were always nice experiences. 


Is the dosing comparative between the 2 chems? I am curious to see if I will achieve similar results / activity as I did experimenting with low doses of 2ce. I gotta experiment with this soon. I'm still a bit busy screwing around with some other stuff at the moment though.


Please share some links and subjective experiences of 2ci around the 8mg range. Thanks!

**Piracetam+2c-I combo**


Well, its been a while since I had this particular experience, I wanted to share this this info with all of you as I found this combo much more enjoyable that 2c-i alone.


I had been taking the pira for two weeks, 2400mg a day, three doses of 800mg each time. The day I was to drop the 2c-i, I took an attack dose of 2400mg and then, three hours later, took 800mg followed by my 18mg dose of 2c-i.


The trip came on slow, comeup began after about an hour and a half. A few friends and I decided to venture out of the campgrounds and into the music festival we were attending. As we got inside, I began to feel an extreme euphoric energy come over me. I felt like some kind of neon- electric child. (If that make any sense lolz) The visuals I had walking around the festival where some of the most intense and intricate visuals I've ever seen on 2c-i (even at doses up to 23mg), I was seeing the clouds shift and melt at great speeds. The grass took on the form of a living persian carpet, patterns swaying and dancing to the music. I remember looking into a crowd of people and seeing them take turns leaning over and vomiting streams of color, took me like 5 minutes of staring at them to realize they were just hoola-hooping, the vomit i thought I was seeing was the hoola-hoop. I saw a cloud take on the shape of the centipede from the animated movie James and the Giant Peach, he was looking down at the festival, smiling with his tongue out, holding a triton, was weird shit. We walked around and danced for a while before making it to the dance tent for Shpongletron, the stage was a soup of light and color, the music sounding more crisp and clear than on MDMA.


In conclusion, I found that piracetam greatly enhanced the effects of 2c-I. I was shocked as to how visual it was as opposed to it w/o the pira. Also noticed it smoothed out the comedown, I normally feel stimulated well after the effects are over, this post-stimulation was non-existent. I have repeated the experiment with 15mg of 2c-i with similar results.


Hope this is useful information. I personally won't be dosing the iodo again with out some piracetam.

Much love

I plan on doing 2ci and 2ce 10mg each soon. Do you think that will give a similar effect as doing 20mg of either, or will it be like just doing 10?

They will potentiate each other, so it'll be as intense as doing around 30-40 mg of one of them. I'd suggest combining only 6-7 mg of each.

So I dosed before I got your reply post. Did 10 and 10. It was great.

Swim is With you on the dosage and method of ingestion. Last time swim did 2c-i swim blew 45 mgs and had one of the most significant psychadelic experiences swim's life. Swim finds that of the 2c's that seim has done 2c-i is also the most painful to snort

IMO low doses of 2C-I are just not worth it. A lot of people consider the fact that the negative effects of the 2C-I will worsen with higher doses, but that has not been the case IME. I started out doing 25mg every trip, simply because this is the amount that I receive in the capsules I purchase.


25mg is good, and it provides a lucid trip. I've never found 25mg to be intense in the slightest.


However, after I started doubling that dosage and began using 50mg each time, I'm convinced that higher doses of 2C-I are the way to go. When I'm on 50mg of 2C-I compared to 25mg, I'm not thinking about the buzz in my head, my clenching jaw, or the muscle tension. During the peak of the experience, I'm simply CAPTIVATED in visuals. One of the hardest trips I ever had was from 2C-I at 50mg. The watermarking and overlaying of Persian rug patterns, sweeping across the surface of objects, was incredible. I've never had more incredible visuals.


25mg of 2C-I, for me, will cause the walls to look as though an invisible entity is trying to piece together a puzzle of patterns, but is struggling and cannot manage to get a strong structure around these patterns. However, on 50mg of 2C-I, the wall is REDUCED moving patterns that are literally FLOWING with life.


2C-I is not a big CEV'er for me, but at 50mg, the CEV's are breathtaking.


I'd definitely recommend to anyone who feels comfortable with this drug to go for the higher doses. I've only noticed a flip-flop in positive and negative effects and find it to be a much more rewarding experience.

Section, only with 2C-T-7, I believe. Dimitri, come off it mate, if you're not comfortable talking about your drug use in the first person then don't talk about it at all, using SWIM isn't going to stand up in court and just lulls you into a false sense of security.

I really find 2C-I to be the perfect balance of an involved trip without being overwhelming as 2C-E can be. 


Im not a massive fan of LSD, its about the only substance I find long and overwhelming. I also find 2C-E trips far more meaningful than LSD and made some very important life decisions on 2C-E! 


Earlier this summer I also tried 2C-B, 2C-I and 2C-E (small doses of each) over a 36 hour period at a Phytance festival and is was incredible, but wouldn't do it again (I couldn't really talk to anyone for 12+ hours).  


Anyone else having a play with these?

I just wanted to comment and say how surprised I was by 2C-I. I took a 5mg allergy test and actually noticed a head/body change as well as very mild visuals. The following day I took a dose of 16mg and had a +++ experience. It was a pretty strong experience with great visuals but I didn't seem to have any body high; I actually felt a bit sore throughout the experience but then again I was out and about all day and never really had a chance to rest and chill out. In my experience 2C-D actually felt more euphoric than this compound... I'll probably write up a trip report at some point when I'm not feeling lazy. Cheers

theres the 2ci big and dandy aswel. 


2ci is a rewarding chem for me was my first rc, lasts around 6-8 hours for me. has a stimulating edge to it which i find pleasurable. i usually come up fully at around 1 hour marker, this is on a emty stomach. now i have had some batches that took a couple hours to kick in, those batches were also a little weaker than others intensity wise but had a little longer duration, weird. the headspace is also very clear i can function pretty well on 2ci iv had multiple convos with older people while on 2ci and they would have never guessed i was catching visuals at the time lol. it does stimulate thinking to a nice degree as well but nothing overwhelming/pushy for me. visuals are also really nice imo, lots of sparkling, color enhacement, things look eally detailed and sharp/clear imo. i also always see colored splotches all over the walls kinda like graffitti. 


sorry if im no help, good luck with your 2ci have fun and safe tripping.

they are repetitive like with most PEAs i have tried, points and edges on objects get real crisp and clear, for me it made my vision very clear like crystal clear, alot of times id feel like im in a fish bowl or under water. lots of fractals and pixels and pastel like art like paintings, for me visuals will get going pretty nicely there will be patterns all throughout my visual field, some it doesnt effect that way some claim its barely visual to them but for me its pretty visual everyones different. visuals are smooth for me, things flow together nicely. 


this 1 experience(40mg hcl) i got settled into a state that was very euphoric and my eyes were rolling and for like 5 min i was in the labrinth style landscape, i couldnt tell up from down they looked the same, everything looked like mirrors. this was with lots of cannabis aswel. i could also feel myself slipping into this state and i was playing around at first to see if i could pull out if i got scared and i kept poppin in and poppin out then i finally jjust stepped through and thats when i slipped into that state fully. was really nice wasnt pushy at all. i was iffy about it at first because it was when i was first messing with 2cx compounds but it turned out to be very rewarding.

I've always been aware of a South American theme to my visuals on 2C-I - lots of patterns and hieroglyphs that could be from the Aztecs or Mayans.


I also tend to see an awful lot of eyes (wood is particularly amazing - the grain in a door revealed a multitude of inquesitive eyes)


I would agree that overall there seems to be a real sense of clarity in general, less obvious colour hues than some psychedelics - but still fairly beautiful CEVs.

The diazepam will bring you down from the 2c-i, I think. Unless you take the diazepam first, I'm not sure though.

Would suggest not doing the diazepam unless things go sour while tripping, benzos tend to dull down the trip and can leave you just confused . If you need it, drop the pill under your tongue and it will kick in very quickly. Other than that, benzos and PEAs seem to be safe to combine.

Diazepam should bring you down some. I wouldn't take it first for fear of ruining the experience. Might be good to have on hand, in case the intensity gets too much. 2c-i tends to cause me a lot paranoia. Set and setting are key. 


As far as visuals go, 2c-i has been some of the prettiest. It's like being in a psychedelic river. Everything it flows over bends, shifts, and changes color.

On that low dose, you'll probably just get a very pleasant(for me) stimulating body high, and a general mood lift, once you overcome any comeup anxiety. Things will just be more colorful, wavy, and pretty looking. Can be kinda nauseating as the high comes in waves, with one minute you may be feeling kinda sober, and the next you may be tripping. Was the first phenethylamine other than amphetamine I ever tried, and i prefer it because I'm experienced with it and it's a very easygoing trip for the most part. Using benzo's for the comedown is safe.

16mg 2C-I was dissolved in a small amount of warm 80 proof liquor which was mixed into a fruit smoothie.  Comeup was slow and gentle.  I did experience some elevated pulse and a noticeable increase in body temperature, but I'm fit and healthy so no worries.  Starting at about +4:30 I had some GI discomfort but I would rate it as minor.  At about +5:00 I had a slight urge to clench my jaw, but again, minor.  Noticeable central nervous system stimulation.  On three different points during the trip I got up and started vacuuming, just because I decided the floor needed it.  I can assure you that spontaneous vacuuming is not a behavior I have history of.


It was a very good trip.  My mental state was positive the entire time.  Anxiety and worries took the day off.  There is no doubt I got to +++.  If I focused on a object in the room such as a piece of furniture it would start coming towards me.  Patterns covered the walls when I cared to look.  90 degree angles became obtuse.  Mindfuck is such a pejorative term, lets call it "altered concept".  There was almost none.  No confusion.  Best part is my fingers were unimpaired enough to play a musical instrument, which I did for hours fueled by central nervous system stimulation.  Got out a fancy echo machine and played with sound on sound long delays a la Brian May or the Edge.  Fun for hours, it never got old.  


At about +6:00 I smoke a eyeballed amount of 5-MEO-DMT.  It was probably about 10mg as I did not achieve break though and did not leave this mortal coil during the experience.   5-MEO-DMT experiences are impossible to put into words, but I'll try.  After releasing the smoke I heard a sort of tinnitus-like sound and a powerful feeling of positive energy and joy came flowing up through my body starting at the base of my spine - is that the kundalini?  The feeling was ecstasy.  It was joy and love and eternal blessings (odd choice of words from an atheist).  


Sleep came easily at about +9:00.  


The next day I woke up with a new optimism about life.  Sure, I have stuff to worry about and past failings to be feel sorry about.  But it's time to stand up straight and get to work and make the best of what I have.  Instead of complaining, how about seeing how good you can be?  Not lucky in love?  Then get your ass down to the gym and then get some.  I think I've discovered the purpose of life.  It's to work and to love until the day we die.


That was a good trip.

I just would like to add that this substance is beautiful. I have had the opportunity to research it several times in the past few months, and am very please with it. Unfortunately it's illegal in the states now :/ 15-17 mg was great. My good friend described it as similar to candy flipping (I've never candyflipped before). 20-21mg was even better, I never went past that dosage. I have never taken a psychedelic that makes me laugh as much as 2C-I does. I was laughing "geekin" for upwards to 6 hours, whereas on other drugs there's usually a much shorter period of time where I get the giggles. It has such a positive mindset and beautiful visuals. 20mg was similar to a lower dose of acid for me but there was also increased tactile sensations! Overall I would say that 2C-I was therapeutically for me in several ways...I came out of it with a very positive attitude for life (more so than usual) and feel more connected to those few friends that also tripped with me.

my first real attempt with this substance I was missold 2c-i as 2c-b (I was fairly aware though as the 0.5g bag had a big 'i' on it.


took one capsule of 28mg orally, later tailed by around 15mg intranasally.


The experience was a hell of a ride, especially being out at a rave.


At peak the visuals were too strong, I couldn't see a metre in front of me and kept losing my friends faces in my own vision


My feelings and subconscious would be projected into my OEVs 


There was a little bit of paranoia, i.e. thought the cab journey home wasn't actually a real cab but in fact a simulation designed to let people wind down after the rave.


However, I think the experience is fairly malleable despite the strength as I didn't really have any negative thoughts and the setting I was in could have easily induced fear.


How many of you do 2c-i on your own? I have a fear of getting very bored?

thats a really big dose for your first time.  what if you had been allergic to it?


i've done 2c-i by myself.  there are other psychedelics better suited for solo trips.  2c-i makes me want to be social.

Note that I said "my first real attempt" - I had sampled this substance before but at unknown dosages and at a stage of "psychedelic immaturity"


I'm fairly comfortable tripping and was kind of hoping that it would have been 2c-b but it still turned out ok, ridiculous visuals though, at the peak the tracers were so strong that moving my head would result in me losing my friends faces in my vision. 


I also had a continual theme throughout the trip of my subconscious being reflected in my visuals, like my visuals would talk to me and it would be my thoughts / subconscious.

Has anyone else ever experienced a 2c-i trip going on past the 6-8 hour mark? The last time I took it I didn't come down for about 16 hours, the majority of which was experiencing the full of what I'd taken. Thankfully we'd dosed normal/threshold dose (My friend dosed us and I didn't know enough about it at the time to remember exactly how much, even though I did ask and he told me.) and I was in a good place so I didn't mind too much. We'd been planning to trip and then go to a friend's birthday when we came down, but while I was perfectly capable of going outside and interacting with people, I didn't really want to. Just to give a time frame, in the entire duration of my trip my friend tripped with me, came down, went to the party, dosed a few other people and himself again and they were coming down again not long after I was able to get to sleep. I stayed at home and just chilled out, enjoyed the visuals, made myself a little nest in the corner of my room with my duvet and just zoned out listening to music until I was finally capable of sleep.


I'd taken 2c-i twice before that, over about a year, and the duration of both trips was about 6 hours and then residual stimulation or whatever, but I'd been prescribed and started taking Lamictal for epilepsy before the most recent trip. My poor friend, I scared the crap out of him because he thought I was having a seizure and I wasn't in quite the right mind to explain how I knew I wasn't because of the differences in what I was feeling ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) Words, man.


I've done some cursory searches, but I haven't been able to find too much about Lamictal's interactions with any psychs at all, let alone the 2c family, so I'm wondering if it was just a fluke, or if my medication is maybe affecting the dose/response curve or my ability to metabolise it. I haven't come across any more 2c-i since the last time to do any more 'experimenting', but I got some 2c-b lately and I really want to try it, but I'm understandably a bit hesitant, especially since the people I would be tripping with are pretty inexperienced.


So, anyone got any experiences or anything they can share?

Hey eithne, I have been experimenting with 2ci for the past three months now, and have taken only oral doses ranging between 25 - 44 milligrams. I have probably tripped on 2ci between 12 -15 times now, and must say it is an amazing substance. I experience no nausea or body load while on this substance, or intense headaches/depression afterwards like other users of this substance have reported. It takes me between an hour and an hour and forty five minutes to peak on 2ci, and the peak always tends to last me 6-7 hours with doses between 25-35 milligrams. The past few times I tripped, when taking 38, 41, and  just a few days ago 44 milligrams, the peak tends to last 8-10 hours. The most intense of effects, (CEV and OEV's) seem to slowly disappear around the 8 or 9 hour mark, but I definitely notice strong effects for about 12 hours when taking a dose higher than 38 milligrams. I also would like to note that unlike most other people, I do not seem to suffer from any lasting visual effects (HPPD) after taking 2ci. I'm sorry but I am not aware of the interactions of Lamictal and 2ci, I just figured I would add my two cents here as this seems to be my favorite psychedelic. I have done 2ce about 10 times, and I notice that 2ci is much more visual for me ironically. I do not really enjoy the introspective qualities of 2ce as much as I enjoy the effects of 2ci. I can't help but smile the majority of the trip on 2ci, and find myself doing a variety of things from hiking with friends, climbing things, and skateboarding. The most intense visuals I have experienced with it to date were on my most recent trip in my room with the blacklights on, where I didn't just experience the walls/carpet morphing and crawling, but actual shapes and fluorescent colored lines appearing right in front of me. I hope this information is of some use to somebody, I just can't stress all the positive experiences I've had with this chemical.

Lamictal is an anti-seizure medication, while psychedelics can make seizures more likely to occur in people who are susceptible to them. Generally it's not a good idea to mix the two classes of drugs.

Months after the fact, I return having recently taken 2c-b, and I do think lamictal affects the 2c family. I tripped fairly strongly - but not uncomfortably so, just right I'd say, on the precipice - off 15mg, and stronger and for longer than my friends, who had taken 25mg. I'm pretty much considering it a free bonus at this point, and just another thing to take in account when planning to take psychedelics, but I know that sentiment will hardly be universal. It would be great if there was anyone else on lamictal/lamotrigine who could corroborate my experiences.


Yup, I'm also aware of the risks of taking drugs on my medication/having epilepsy. I started experimenting with drugs before I was diagnosed, so if I hadn't been I probably wouldn't have started, but I enjoy it too much, tbh. I'm very cautious though; I'm aware of my seizure threshold and I can tell how far I can push my health and never have any problem stopping dead if I think it's time. But my main triggers are stress and sleep deprivation. I have yet to have a seizure which was attributable solely to drugs/drinking, it's exclusively been when I was an idiot and pushed myself to stay awake for too long.


For anyone interested, I'm currently prescribed 150mg in the morning and 175mg.


I know it's probably ridiculously stupid, but I feel safe enough to use myself as a bit of a guinea pig for others who may be epileptic/prescribed lamictal and would like to experiment. It's going to happen anyway and there's barely any information out there regarding it. If anyone has any questions, feel free.

Recently I was given a sample of 2C-I (I'd say between 12-18mg), I dissolved it in water and drank it on down. I started feeling the come-up around +1:30 with the general head buzz and very mild CEV's. Around +2 I was at a +++, and this was beginnging to feel very much like a mushroom trip. OEV's were present, things were waving and wiggling and distorting (as I usually experience on shrooms), and my brain was beginning to open up and form thoughts that it doesn't normally formulate under normal circumstances. A friend and I made the trip to a small, crowded bar to check out an awesome band, and normally where I'd be a bit perturbed at being canned into a small area like a sardine, this was mostly Phamily and the love I felt coming from everyone was INTENSE. I normally like to think of myself as being somewhat an empath, but tonight it was extra strong. I would see a woman dancing with her boyfriend, and could literally feel the love between the two. I could stare at the scantily clad, seductive temptress in the corner dancing and grinding against the wall, and could feel the sexuality she was putting off. 

To sum everything up, 2C-I was almost identical to a mushroom trip for me, the only part missing was the connection with the Oneness I can usually experience with mushrooms. It had the heavy-headed feeling I get on most 2C's, but it wasn't debilitatingly heavy like 2C-D or 2C-E. All in all, it was an awesome experience and I would definitely have some more experiences with this wonderful substance

Awesome time it sounds like.  Any residue/excess stimulation?  Those properties are what helped me decide to move on from 2C-I but I seem to be in a minority of people.

I had a major headache when I woke up the next day, but I attribute that to minimal hydration and listening to a loud ass band play for 3+ hours, not the 2C-I

I tried my first sample of 2C-I a few days ago and felt like sharing a bit of my experience. I weighed out around 10mg, choosing to start at a relatively safe dose for the first time. I am very familiar with 2c-e, 4-ho-mipt, and to a lesser degree dipt. Perhaps it was because I took it on a completely empty stomach, or possibly because it was a new substance that I was unfamiliar with, but I had a fairly strong and all together very worthwhile experience. Within 15 minutes of ingestion I was already at a +++ struggling to deal with the speed it hit me. It should be noted here that 2C-I does not seem to dissolve in water very well especially when it's clumped together. Despite violent swirling the powder refused to separate and dissolve. The taste when it hit my tongue was terrible.


Overall the trip seemed to lack the sort of inner struggle that I am so used to on other psychedelics, even at low doses. I found it easy to let go, driven partially by an emotional core and less of the sort of enigmatic intensity of other psychedelics. There wasn't exactly any sort of deep insight but it felt as if I had no need to try to understand any of it because it all just made sense anyways. On 2c-e I get into deep thought loops and linearity is all distorted while on 2c-i I felt none of that. Deep? Yes. Enigmatic? No. This is not to say I did not get strong hallucinogenic effects because I reached a novel moment where I felt my body disconnect as if my arms and legs and head were no longer attached to the rest of my body. I felt my head rise up and away from my body, detached and floating. Music did not seem to have the striking focus of 2ce instead taking on warped and chaotic forms which lacked strong synaesthetic clarity.  But it was a very helpful trip and not at all like the easy stimulating experience I was expecting. It was as if 2C-I was deceptively easy despite the obvious insanity of the experience, which was exactly what I needed. Definitely a strong and worthwhile phenethylamine, to be treated with respect like any other psychedelic.

My buddy I wish I could get him to post at BL, loves 2C-I and had always had a really strong reaction to it at 10mg-12mg.  Then again, the guy thinks 1/2 hit of acid was intense...some people are just very sensitive and they are a lucky bunch.

Oh I know I definitely am. I feel I could probably go up to 15 mg or more of 2C-I though. I just had a stronger reaction than I expected at 10mg. Full blown +++ in 15 minutes really took me by surprise.

Full blown +++ in 15 minutes at 10 mg? Doesn't sound like 2C-I at all. Normally it has a come up of close to 2 hours, and 10 mg would be way underdosed for most people. you might be overly sensitive though.

I was just as surprised as the rest of you. I am open to the idea that it was not 2C-I, but I am fairly certain it was. All I did was swirl it in some water and drank up, no capsule or anything. And yes, I am a lightweight guy and generally dose lower than most people for most drugs so I am pretty sensitive. I'll probably give 2C-I another trial run some time in the future at a higher dose.

45mg insufflated 2C-I made walking outside in blizzard one of the most beautiful experiences of my life. Every snow flake was a shining star, glistening with majestic beauty to ever be rivaled.


Lol walking on the ice and studying was incredibly euphoric. The ice looked like liquid mercury-quicksilver if you will. It would flow and move and radiated an inner light that is impossible to describe with language.

I'm hyper Sensitive to 2c-i and 2c-c. 10-13mg maximum

yet 2c-e 2c-t-7 2c-d  10-20mg is usually when i max out with those.


LSD i can really only handle 1200 mics, if i have started out on an Inital 200ug wait for the beginning of the rise.

Then i consume the other 1000ug. If i don't do it that way, LSD gives me tremendous body stimulation.

it also explains the hyper sensitivity to DOC. I get more physical abnormalities from it, than i do positives, and i went into that one under the impression that it was going to be one of the rarer compounds that would be more like a surface version of LSD.

But it's not. 2c-c and me, do not mesh. We cannot find harmony, i have more in common with most of the difficult experience reports of 2c-c and 2c-i from Low doses. Not like psychosis or overdoses, just a weird Body jangling i very much so dislike. The report on erowid "Relaxation my Hairy ass" sums that up for me quite well. I cannot find Zen or a space of solitude within myself on 2c-c 2c-i doc or doi. Everything feels too loud and too close. 


I can honestly say that 2c-e produces a ++++ experience almost every time, for at least a 6 hour period Followed by another 6 hours where you feel as if you have just conquered the universe and know all things.

Had some AMAZING visuals on this drug.. though my doses were massive and stupid. Very intricate and defined architecture like you'd find in a library or just full on psychedelia... my opinion on it is very much changed, can't wait to give it another go in saner settings ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yeah high dose 2c-i (~50mg doses) provides very structured, crisp, warm colored cathedral like visuals for me as well, very beautiful and unique to other visuals I get on other phens. If only it wasn't so stimulating and had more depth I would really enjoy this compound. I find I can only take it in club/party settings. It also has this neat twisting effect on my vision that really distorts the size and depth of objects. If I found a vendor that stocked this I would probably give it another shot, too bad I can find litterally every other 2c but this and the t-x series.

I really like 2C-I as well.  I generally don't find it very deep but I have had really surprising moments on it.  The visual effects are very interesting.  Everything appears very fuzzy and warm.  Size distorts.  I seem to have people experience contact highs quite often (which is also mentioned in PiHKAL).  The strangest effect I have had from it reminded me of a trip report on Erowid I have read since.  I noticed once I hit the peak that around the corners of my vision, I could see energy forms all over my apartment, moving around, approaching or moving away from me, or even staying up.  But every time I moved my gaze, two distinct shapes like hands, but as invisible energy fields (I saw them as shimmering outlines like heat shimmers), crossed down from above and covered my vision, like hands were covering my eyes and blocking this new sight.  But I started looking at things out of my peripheral because the hands weren't blocking that, and I noticed an energy field that looked like a 7 year old little bot, who was shyly approaching me, and I told him it was okay and then he moved close to me to hang out, I suppose.  Then in the doorway I saw a stern, middle-aged man, just watching over us.


The next morning I was hanging out with my girlfriend at the time, and she casually asked me if I had ever seen spirits in our apartment.  I asked if she had, and she proceeded to tell me about a 7 year old little boy and a stern-faced middle aged man who seems to just be watching over us and the little boy.  Then a bit later, we told the little boy that he could come hang out with us, and then the cats started watching a spot in the middle of the air and the spot they were looking at got closer and closer, and once it reached the room we were in, we heard thumps on the floor like footsteps and then a *wham* we could actually feel on the floor next to us.  


That experience has stuck with me, it was pretty crazy and I don't know how else to explain it than 2C-I was making me see something real.

^ On my 3rd or 4th time on 2C-I, on a relatively high dose (36mg), I had a momentary vision of being surrounded by a group of people(?) wearing hooded cloaks, one of whom said "We have always been here with you". But it was a purely mental experience, I didn't hear any actual noises or anything in my apartment.

I noticed quite a few entities but I redosed many times and did not sleep that night at all so I contributed it to the shadow people and DXM also consumed lol..


Seems like a great drug all around though, although the headspace could surely be deeper but that seems to be a pattern with 2C-x drugs

Whoah xorkoth that sounds both freaky and beautiful at the same time! I feel left out, everyones meeting the 2c-i beings but me ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)... Maybe my house has to be filled with spirits before I'm allowed access to that dimension, I can tell you it's not... I tend to spend my trips alone in a pitch black room and every once in a while I will get a feeling like I'm not alone and when this happens I say "manifest yourself!" and sadly it has never been more than a sense or feeling of another prescence.  I've always been into ghosts and the spirit world and while most would approach them with fear as long as the prescence felt benevolent I would approach them the same way you have, spirits need tove too ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Hey bluelighters, I have a question!

I have just been put on penicillin for an infection in my toe. I've been planning to drop a capsule of ~25mg of 2c-i this weekend though. I take 660mg phenoxymethylpenicillin 3 times a day. Would there be any adverse reactions between my penicillin and the 2c-i?

^ there likely wouldn't be a direct interaction between the penicillin and the 2C-I, but be cautioned that 2C-I does cause lessened blood flow to your extremities (vasoconstriction) which could cause complications with the infection.

^ 2c-d at high doses caught me off guard with it's depth. I took 60mgs in a horrible environment (DnB party with a bunch of drunk folk) with the mentality that it was "tofu", phew that was a very difficult trip, LOT's of introspection... good stuff, just requires alot of material and ther for costs quite a bit. Also t-2 is pretty deep as well. I would agree though that 2c-e is without a doubt the most psychedelic of all phens I've tried, quite visual as well but it doesn't come without a price (heavy bodyload).

i've had some pretty deep trips with 2C-I... but for true introspection i had to take 30mg+


30mg+ is pretty rough on the body, though, only do it if you're sure you're physically up for it

I've taken 2c-i in doses of up to 50mgs (30-50mgs was the range I stuck to) and have never had a single trippy thought, for me the substance was purely recreational. It's visuals are very attractive and "twisted"... I loved 2c-i but it just got too stimulating at worthwhile doses. I wish I had access to this stuff, I kinda miss it now that this thread was revived. It caused me some serious lasting visuals though when I used it two days in a row, this has been reported by a few other people as well.

I would dose every week to every other week until I burned through 250mgs (besides the one time where I dosed 2 days in a row, which like I said caused some issues therefor wasn't repeated), tolerance wasn't an issue however it should be said that I'm a real phen hardhead. 50mgs of 2c-i with no tolerance is a low/med +++, still fully functional. I felt like I would be able to push the dose higher if it wasn't for the stimulation, it was just too much at high doses.

Wow, 50mg without tolerance?  You *are* a hardhead!  For me, 22mg is the upper limit, even at 22mg the stimulation is a bit intense.  How much 2C-E do you require out of curiosity?

2c-e is a whole 'nother game, I don't push this one as far as I would other 2c's... 25mgs is a solid +++ though I've taken 30mgs twice however that dose was a bit too high IMO. The first time I took 2c-i was 20mgs oral with a 5mg nasal booster (ouch!!!) and that trip was super underwhelming, like a plus 1 1/2. 2c-c is another chem that I really need.to push to get worthwhile effects, 40mgs was threshold however 80mgs was a solid +++, very reminiscent of DOC (especially the cool colored visuals) though many disagree... When it comes to tryptamines though I'm "average", 25mgs of metocin or psilacetin is plenty enough, as is something like 10mgs of oral moxy.

Sorry, I'm too lazy to read through this whole thread.  Just read the last page here.  =)  (Plus it's hard to sift through so many posts looking for specific info.) Sounds like you guys have a Lot of experience.  What's a good starting dose for 2C-I?  I'm only getting a small amount of this so I want to be efficient with it (two 100 mg sacks).  Is there a steep dose response curve?  Good for social settings?  And I'm wondering if this can be combined with 4 ho trypts?  Sorry for the noob questions.


Many thanks.

2C-I is good starting at maybe 16mg.  The dose-response curve is steep above that.  18mg is a solid trip, and 20mg is strong.  People take it higher than that too, I found 22mg a bit much.  People respond differently but I'd say that's a good guide.  If you try 16 or 18mg and it's not strong enough, go up by 2mg the next time.  


It will mix with 4-HO-trypts I think, I haven't tried that specifically though.  I know 2C-B combines wonderfully with them.  I could imagine 2C-I working too.  I'd try to experience a solid 2C-I trip on its own first though, before you try combining a second psychedelic.


2C-I is a pretty good social drug.  It makes you feel pretty good and happy usually, but it also has a definite psychedelic edge.  I've had uncomfortable moments socially with it but also a lot of really good times.

Captain Kratom, have you tried more than one batch of 2C-I? Or was the product lab analyzed?

Ah, thanks again Xorkoth!  You just gave me more precious info for some good times.  I'll definitely be doing just that.  =)


Though I do plan to start at 16mg, I'm just wondering how much higher I should take it after that.  I've been reading about overstimulation on this one, but I actually like that and perceive it as an extreme body high (much like I perceive crashes/comedowns as being a little high but at least not sober, which was the plan all along).  But did you yourself find any body load on that 22mg trial?  Or was it something else?  Sorry I'm using you as a guide, lol.  I'm really grateful though, thank you sir!

You're welcome. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I found some bodyload at 22mg, for sure, but not terrible.  The main thing was that my brain felt overstimulated... like it was hard to focus on things, hard to be fully comfortable.

Ah okay, I'll keep that in mind.  I probably won't go up that high for awhile, as I plan to mix this with a trypt after the first trial.  I think I read of both, around threshold, is best.  But if 22mg hits you hard, I probably won't be able to handle it.  Cool, and take care.  =)

2 batches, several years apart... neither have been analyzed. Certain phens just don't do much for me, though it's entirely possible there were purity issues (seems *kinda* unlikely being that both batches required generally the same amount, despite being completely different batches from different sources and aquired many years apart, like 5 or so years). My doses shouldn't be used as any sort of barometer for any readers, something I probably should've made clear in prior posts.

I did 36mg once (had a bunch of 18mg pills, one day decided to take two just to see what would happen, this was years ago when I was inexperienced with everything)

Had a lot of muscle spasms and extreme nystagmus. Also a bizarre vision of being underground in some sort of magickal ceremony, surrounded by entities wearing cloaks over their heads.

Years later I was stunned when I came across a drawing very similar to my vision in a book ([The Underworld Initiation](https://www.amazon.com/The-Underworld-Initiation-journey-transformation/dp/1892137038) by R. J. Stewart).


Anyways, since then I've never gone over 24mg. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I took this one last night @ 16 mgs.  It was different compared to anything I've done, as the visuals and body high were unexpectedly stimulating and trippy at the same time.  Similar to a candyflip in that way, but different in all other aspects.  The trip seemed very well-rounded since it lasted a good 9 hours or so, wasn't really mind-fucky but the visuals were there, and the comedown was smooth.  The only other 2C I've taken was 2C-P, but it wasn't like that one either.  Xorkoth gave me really good info, since I did feel like my brain was on overdrive from the head high, visuals, mental stimulation and lights had an aura/glow to it.  My visual field seemed uncharacteristically hazy but sharp, especially anywhere too dark or too bright, there were auras there.  It seems like it would be very psychedelic at higher doses.  My mind seemed to race a lot but I never felt uncomfortable.


This 2C-I is a nice chem.  I don't think I'll be combining this with a trypt because it will probably get too trippy.  Taking it on its own feels like a combination of drugs already.

Has anyone tried or chime in with Poppy Seed Tea and 2C-C? Dose would probably be around 300g's on the PST and I'm thinking 15-20mg orally for the 2C-C, any input would be appreciated.

Any idea how long this stuff can keep at room temperature?


I stupidly and unknowingly had my stash of 2c-i sitting at room temperature for about 2 years; in an air-tight container, mind you. I have all my long-term-storage stuff in the freezer and I somehow accidentally hadn't included this one. Sucks because I loved 2c-i.

I think it should be absolutely fine, I wouldn't worry about it at all, phenethylamine compounds are said to be extremely stable. Maybe 2C-I is the exception to this rule, but I've never heard that before.

I believe it's quite stable even at room temperature.  Phenethylamine salts generally are predicted to outlive a human.  I'd be very surprised if it degraded at all unless it was hot or something, or wet.

Awesome. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I've had some pretty significant trips on 2c-i. Can't wait till I have a chance to try it again, but it'll likely be quite a while.

Heard this on the radio yesterday


Edit - about stability, Sasha said in PiHKAL that if they had some mescaline sealed up in the Great Pyramid of Giza it'd be just as potent today as it was 4500 years ago. Same should be true of many other PEAs!

Sorry to resurrect such an old thread but I want to share my experience ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) 


I finally got around to trying 2C-I a couple of days ago after having some in my stash for I don't even no how long. I took ~25mg on an empty stomach (I meant to eat beforehand but forgot to - I then tried to down as much of an instant ramen as I could) around 12:30PM and felt it come on around 1PM. I was expecting it to take longer to feel anything, must have been due to my empty stomach. In reading through people's experiences with 2C-I I saw several statements that the bodyload is light and nausea is uncommon. Well I couldn't even eat my whole cup of instant ramen before getting super nauseous and throwing up not once, but twice. This is a bit unusual for me because I do often get nauseous on psychedelics others than LSD, but it usually passes without me vomiting. I also noticed a feeling of electricity or slight tremors in my body. I read on here that a lot of other people experienced that during the comeup so I was not worried at all, nor was it completely unpleasant. 


Anyways, after the second upchuck I finally felt better stomach-wise and the trip really started to unfold. I had strong visuals but not in the patterning or melty variety, more like lots of colors and tracers. I drew a little bit and it was fun to play with colored pencils (usually when I do draw I stick to pen) and let the tracers guide my art. I put some clips of Tipper sets on my tv and they sounded amazing. I mean, I already love Tipper but at some points I was literally snapchatting my friends bits of the sets as if I was actually at a show. The visuals he has for his sets were perfect in the moment as well. 


My mind was relatively clear; I wasn't bogged down with memories that make my feel guilty (like 4-AcO-DMT) or stuck in my thoughts (like 2C-E). One of the things I enjoyed the most throughout the trip was talking to my friends via my phone. A bunch of my friends and I are in a group chat on Snapchat, and two of my friends also decided to trip on the same day in their respective phones. So we were all sending each other ridiculous pictures/videos/etc and I loved the absurdity as well as the sense of connection. Even browsing Facebook was fun, although I only did it for a bit before getting distracted, and I'm not usually one to use my phone much while tripping. 


I spent a good part of the trip watching Dr. Strange for the first time, which was the perfect movie to put on while under the influence of psychedelics. Seriously, if you guys haven't seen it yet, take your trippy drug of choice and watch ASAP. It's basically DMT: The Movie. To the point where it made me deeply consider smoking some deems, but I didn't get around to that. 


I also spent some time playing with my hoop and fire fans, and it felt really good to flow. I felt like I was close to unlocking some new moves but unsurprisingly would get distracted before long and end up doing something else. Food was also delicious once I remembered that it existed. Some psychedelics make me the opposite of hungry for the entire trip, but on 2C-I I could eat after only a couple hours into the trip. I made a very simple tofu meal but it was still super satisfying. 


The trip last around 5 hours, a little shorter than I was expecting. I still felt off from baseline for a few hours after but the visuals and magic were definitely gone. The comedown itself was neutral to unnoticeable and I just felt content from having a very nice day hanging out with myself and my cat. Solo trips are so important and I don't give myself enough opportunities for them. This one was timed just right as I am beginning my second semester of graduate school next week so it was like a way to cleanse my mind before jumping back into that. Overall this was a very pleasant chemical other than the nausea on the comeup. I would take this at a festival but maybe start the trip at the campsite or in an open space in case I need to run to a trashcan/porta potty.

Interesting that it was only 5 hours for you, do you tend to metabolize drugs quickly?  It usually lasts 6-8 hours for me.  Anyway, yeah sounds like 2C-I.  I find it to be a fun chemical, pretty euphoric, and pretty clearheaded and sociable.  The exception is that when I take it high enough, my thoughts become very chaotic, not in a profound way, but in a way where I feel somewhat insane.  Difficulty holding a train of thought, lots of weird tangents, nonsense thoughts, etc.

2C-I was my favorite 2C out of all the ones I've tried (and I've tried nearly all of them).. It lasted pretty much 6ish hours for me @20mg doses.. Very euphoric and clear headed.. My roommates and I would take it when going to parties and no one would really notice we'd be off our faces.


Wish is was still as accessible as it use to be.. definitely fun stuff

Yeah for some reason, although 2C-B, 2C-C, 2C-D, 2C-E, 2C-P and even 2C-iP are readily available if you know where to look, I don't know of any place that offers 2C-I anymore.  Or any of the 2C-Ts (T-2 is a gem, T-21 is really nice, and I hear T-4 is also great stuff, and of course T-7 although since that one's illegal it makes sense - then again, so is 2C-B).

There was a brief window right before the canadian 2c-x ban when 2ci could be had wholesale for a song...


I don't have much experience with either, but is it just me or is there some similarity in psychedelic flavour between 2C-I and 5-MeO-MiPT?

To me, they're both euphoric and stimulating, but 5-MeO-MiPT is much cleaner-feeling and more psychedelic (and less visual), and it feels like a tryptamine, whereas 2C-I certainly feels like a phenethylamine.

Hadn't had this chem since 2016 I saw it on the dweb relatively cheap and I must get my hands on it as I personally loved this chem. I trust the markets more than the cheap Chinese vendors although I wish I could find a trustworthy one to get a good wholesaler. Gonna get a gram in the next couple months nonetheless.

2CI was the first RC I tried back in the begining of the 0'ies. It was all the rage in the rave scene in the town I'm from. First I bought a gram with a friend, and when that was gone, I bought one gram just for myself. Dosage wise, 15 mg was a mild trip. 20 mg a strong trip, and over 20 mg I wouldn't take without a tolerance. I did have a freind who spazed out and vomited and lost control on 35 mg. Going over 20 mg it has a steep dose/response curve for sure.


Even before I new what a phenethylamine was, I figured out that it was related to mescaline, even though I hadn't even tried mescaline at that time, just going by the CEV's. Man, they are beautiful. Extremely stylized and mesoamerican indian-like in style. Actually still my favorite CEV's of all psychedelics. 


Now I haven't taken it for ages, even though I still think I have some in the freezer. The downside of 2CI for me, is that it clearly has some heavy noradrenaline/serotonine releasing/inhibition whatever effect. It's much more stimulating than any other phenethylamine I've tried. Leading to teeth clenching aswell as feeling a little down and emotionally worn out the day after. No other 2C's does this for me.

It was my first rc too! The visuals and headspace are the reason I like it so much. I've done doses as high as 60mg a few times with amazing results. I have to agree it has noradrenaline effects and causes some anxiety and speediness on the comeup. It's definitely a gem I preferred it to 2c-b although 2c-b is amazing too.

It's funny I always found the visuals to be very much in the mesoamerican style.  2C-I is interesting, I never got much headspace from it but I found it very euphoric and trippy.  It felt superficial, but really fun.  It also gave me some interesting illusions of perspective.  One thing I remember is that at full doses, I would feel like I had a copy of myself, and we shared heads, but my copy extended upwards in t he same position I was in, connected at the head.  As if there was a mirror balancing on top of my head, and everything continued above that mirror.  I could feel the other body as if I existed in both places at once.  It was a really interesting sensation and quite unique.  


Also my first RC. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Well, my first RC I seeked out... my neighbor was selling "foxy" back in 2002, he sold 20mg doses for $20 (we were told 20mg was the dose).  I didn't know anything about it, I only kenw it as some new drug called "foxy".  I enjoyed it quite a bit actually.  But I acquired 2C-I after a lot of research, and it was my first in that sense.

Man, there's a lot of love here. It always sounded low quality to me. Shallow and with a dirty stimulation. Plenty visual, sure, but supposedly with a higher incidence of HPPD. HPPD disappeared, and I began to think it might have just been a mass hysteria, but then it reappeared with the NBOxs. It's the only 2C-x that I've never been interested in, although I had some in my possession pre-WebTryp.

10mg plugged was a ++. Comparable to 15-20mg of 2C-B for me (as reference), maybe it didn't absorb all, not sure. Count on 4-5 hours, and then some residual effects that last for a while.


Came up fully in 30 minutes, peak was around two hours. Some visual activity but not like I expected. Some janglyness, but no overstimulation (like a lot of people describe) at all.

It felt really pleasant, the headspace was warm and kind of dreamy at this dose, it's more psychedelic than 2C-B but still similar in that respect. I had a really good time on it, if you can get it, I'd go for it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I remember when the Canadian 2C ban came in, one vendor was clearing out pressed 10mg 2C-I shields for insane bargain prices. I sort of regret not bagging some. But then again, I'm not a huge fan of 2C-B, and my limited trials with 2C-I didn't make it seem like a must-have, so not sure what I would have done with it all anyways.


I'd like to try 2C-I again some time anyways. I didn't realize it was so much more potent that 2C-B, good to note.

Oh sorry, I should've said it was about the same as 15-20mg of 2C-B orally, but it is supposed to be more potent I think, especially once you go above 30mg.


Do note that my tolerance for 2C-x seems to be higher than most people.

2C-I is quite a bit more potent than 2C-B, probably about double, roughly.

Yeah but when going through the B&Ds people often said they didn't get much below 20mg, and 25mg often was a sweet spot. From what I understood it has a much steeper dosage/response curve than 2C-B, I doubt 25mg equals 50mg of 2C-B, although it's possible, I didn't go there  ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

2C-I is cool, I pretty consistently have gotten a somewhat dissociative effect from a full dose.  My most memorable sensation (it happened multiple times) is of there being a mirror of myself attached at the top of our heads, extending up, as if the surface of my head was a mirror, but I could feel my "other self".  It also has really unique visuals and is quite euphoric.  The strongest I've tripped on it was when I preloaded with MXE and ate 12, or maybe 14mg orally.  I descended into crazy visuals and a euphoric and manic head space... I felt sort of psychotic, but in a fun way.  MXE greatly potentiates psychedelics if you use it as a launching pad, normally I would take a good bit more than 12/14mg, more like 20.

I always had quite pronounced effects below the 25 mg, think the biggest dose I took was 22 mg, then 18 and had a couple lower ones at 12mg and even one at 2mg which I definitely felt. Ever since that 2mg dose I wanted to try 2c-d because of it purported nootropic effects, I think 2c-i is much more reliable in that aspect, more of push to it, lot more enjoyable too. Very light bodyload, even though I had weird vasoconstrictive issues, or hypersensitivity to it anyways at the higher dosages, bit of a tingle.

Despite being late to the clear net party, thankfully Canada didn’t ban  2cxs (mind 2cb) until like 201something ... and I got to try all these before they disappeared from my radar. 


2ci never did it for me tho. Higher doses brought out too much physical stimulation without a justifiable  increase in psychedelia (visual or mental) when compared to the bodyload... while lower doses just didn’t provoke the experiences I’d read others enjoyed... still glad to try it and ill def revisit it one day but I’m in no rush

I've not heard many echo my sentiment that 2c-I is superior to 2c-b when used for aphrodisiac purposes, though I never like to exceed 15mg.


At that dose I find noticable but manageable stimulation, enhanced tactile sensitivity, increased libido, minor visuals, and a certain edge/focus that 2c-b lacks.


In fact, i find 2c-b has a dissociative quality, especially at higher doses. For example, at 24mg i had a full on OBE while in bed with a girlfriend, which was embarrassing quite frankly.


The highest ive taken 2ci was 22mg, and that was a different experience from 15mg. Very psychedelic (particularly CEVs), overstimulating, skin crawly, anxiety.


I still prefer 2cb in general, but not in the bedroom. Granted I've never really explored its use low dose, but I think I prefer a full experience with b for the euphoria and visuals

I don’t find 2ci visual, at least in comparison to other psychedelics. And even less so than the other 2cs I’ve tried (b, e, t7 and even t2).


And the stimulant wasn’t pleasant ime like typical stimulants its more of a physical jitteriness, often resulting in a lasting headache the next day (I also get this with 2ct7 and to a lesser extent t2 and 4 aco met)

Hmm. I had a roommate in college who went to a festival and he said some guy was walking around selling 2C-I there and he took some, said it was the most visual trip he had had yet. This was back when all we had done was acid and shrooms though.

I find 2C-I to be highly visual, and in a totally unique way too that doesn't really resemble other 2C-Xs or any other psychedelic I have tried.  Not as visual as, say, 2C-E, or even 2C-B, but very visual if a large enough dose is taken.  As far as the stimulation, I have had 2C-I trips that felt jittery and weird and some that have felt incredible, euphoric and entactogenic and comfortable.

I’ve taken 2ci, from 2 different batches, years apart, up to 35 mg and while there were visuals, I still wouldn’t describe the entirety of the experience as visual. Jittery and shallow sure lol... hedonistic, perhaps -though I didn’t find it overly pleasurable and haven’t repeated in some years, despite the opportunity. 


Wait, I did try dosing at 17 mg at a hallowe’en party a number of years (5?) ago... and tho it reduced the stimulation to reasonable levels it also reduces the degree of psychedelia - and IMO it still didn’t warrant the tension headache the next day


Even preloading and dosing throughout with magnesium, though helpful, wasn’t enough. 


Mind I seem rather insensitive to 2cs. Perhaps due to expectations, or more likely metabolic factors but either way I don’t seem to get as much from

Them as you folks, others at festivals I talk with and some (not all) of my friends ... I wish lol

The 2Cs are quite variable. I, for instance, need 45mg or more of 2C-C to get a good trip going, others only need 30mg to trip ballz to the wall. I also had a weird headache reaction to 2C-D last time I tried it. Perhaps I would hate 2C-I, perhaps it would be my favorite.

Yeah there is a wide range of response to all psychedelics, the 2C-s in particular.  For example 2C-E, some people report it being super euphoric and need like 30mg to get anywhere, and some people find it very neutral and intense and even really low doses will cause a strong trip.

So i'll be getting aprox 10mg of 2C-I and was debating on plugging it. What intensity scale would 10mg 2C-I plugged give? i'm hoping for a solid trip.

With only 10mg, plugging is the way to go (or snorting but good god snorting 2C-Xs is horrible, worst substances ever to snort).  10mg oral would be pretty mild, but 10mg plugged is equivalent to around 20mg oral, which is a strong, full dose.

I once plugged about 10mg I think and it was a ++ at most, disappointing in strength

Every time I have snorted 2C-Xs (including 2C-I), it felt like I had been kicked in the face, while someone was drilling out my nasal cavity with a power drill.  The pain started pretty quick and grew in intensity and peaked at around 10-15 minutes in.  By then my entire existence was pain, throbbing pain, just absolutely terrible, pacing around, tripping balls, wishing I hadn't snorted it.  After 20 minutes or so it would chill out but it's no way to start a trip.  I have heard other people say it's not so bad but so many people experience something like what I felt.  However it does peak harder and stronger than even plugging.


You could make a nasal spray, as that should greatly reduce the pain, but with only 10mg, it might be hard to actually dose it all.


You can also snort 1-2mg at a time, and alternate nostrils.  That helps.

You definitely hear a lot of people talk about extreme pain from snorting 2C-x - enough that I'll probably never bother trying. I'd kind of be curious about IM, but doubt I'll ever try that either.

My experiences with insufflated 2C-B were not as bad as people describe, but it hurts a lot and has caused sores abs bloody noses. I heard that diluting it in saline helped, so I tried that. Dear god was that painful. I had a friend that had insufflated it 6-7 times prior, but after that will never insufflate it in any form again. It was just plain miserable. 


More to the point, you found 2C-I? I haven't bought any since the pre-WebTryp days. My friend still has it in storage for me somewhere, but I haven't bothered to try to reclaim it. I just remember a lot of people saying that they had developed HPPD after using it in high doses, a claim that disappeared with it until the NBOMEs appeared

I have a capsule with 13/14mg. Oral knowing my tolerance that'll probably be way to low. I think i'll dissolve the capsule in the plunger and try that. I really hope it's intens enough.

Snorting pure 2C-B powder is a hell imo. Not worth doing it. But I recently made a nasal spray off 2mg/s and that doesn't even sting. After some minutes you get some mild irritation but nothing bad. Really a live safer.


And yes I aquired it. A friend of mine had it laying around, asked for quite a while and now finally we managed to trade some things. 25i-NBOMe nasally is great, so i'm sure i'll like the 2C-I.

2C-I is very nice.  Do you have experience plugging?  You just need to make sure your bowels are cleared out well.  I'd dissolve the amount you have in 2mL of water and go with that.  Don't dilute it too much, but if you don't dilute it enough it will burn and it seems to me that the more irritation to the rectum, the more whatever it left in your bowels will try to rush out of you.

I noticed 2C-I "on the street" at a ravey festival in 2019. Was kind of surprised to see it circulating, I thought it would have disappeared with the end of that being a greymarket RC. 


I know 2C-I was available for quite some time after WebTryp in Canada before the rules changed around 2016. Right before it was banned, a vendor was selling 10mg pressed shields cheap as chips by the 100. I sort of wish I stocked up, but at the same time I never got the sense that it was a must-have for me personally.

I recall that. I tried to order 100, they were like, "Nah you live in the U.S., no way no how."


Shame. I'll never get to try 2C-I, but that can be said about many things in life. 2C-I always appealed to me though. If it's visual like 2C-C but speedier, kinda sounds right up my alley.

2C-I is speeder, and more euphoric, and the visuals are very unique, not like any other psychedelic.  There is an almost dissociative aspect to the vody high, too.  It is more purely recreational, I never got anything really useful from the mind state but it's fun and unique.  Quite dissimilar from the other 2C-Xs, or anything else.

2c-i was quite visual for me. The 2c-i closed-eye visuals were hilariously like 70s rock-and-roll band logos complete with fancy script and lots of color, heavy on the bright pinks. Sort of like [https://www.wallpaperflare.com/brow...ke-with-skull-logo-band-music-wallpaper-szlfz](https://www.wallpaperflare.com/brown-and-purple-motley-crue-snake-with-skull-logo-band-music-wallpaper-szlfz)


As for it being recreational: I'm sure it's true but, for what it's worth, there was a lot of learning for me on my 2c-i trips. 2c-i taught me how to meditate. This probably has more to do with the particular time in my life and the context. Fond memories.

Nice, well we're all different for sure.  I I have some old reports of my early explorations, 2C-I was the second or third RC I tried and I did find t pretty healing at the time.  Later on I found it to be purely recreational.  But it's definitely pretty strong stuff.  And like you said, very visual.  It has this effect pretty consistently for me, where letters start to look like heiroglyphics, but I can still read them.

I'm glad to hear it! Helps kill my retroactive FOMO knowing you got some.. that was a ridiculous deal. They had 10mg 2c-e in the same format and price as well, luckily I didn't miss that. 


I'd like to think that whoever that vendor was that they are reading this thread knowingly with a little satisfaction about that time.

I too wish I had a little more of the 2C's.  All my samples and trials were from pre 2004.  17 mg of 2C-I was very visual and very speedy.  Not the meditatve type of trip.  I was pacing.  Got a little nervous at how stimulating it was but yeah the visuals were literally persian carpet patterns.


Ah well glad to have sampled it years ago.  Someday I bet we will see the 2C's around somehow and someway.

I do have some experience but the absorption seems to be very hit or miss. The powder is in a capsule so snorting is not a possibility. I'll need to throw the capsule in a syringe and then fill it with 1-2ml water in which it will dissolve.

It had been 20 or so years since I did 2C-I and I was able to find a source for a very small amount recently that had been properly taken care of. I weighed out about 18 mgs and did not know what to expect.


I love this chemical. It has a little different effects than I remember but this is more due to being a different person than I was and different experiences shaping the journey as it still had an aura that was the same as the one I remembered in 2003.  One thing I got to say- music is absolutely visceral.  Like sometimes so intense that I had to stop and take a deep breath- every note had a tactile response and was paired with a color in my minds eye.  Deep rich blues and purples and neon greens-I always had this experience when phenethylamines have more blues and purples than tryptamines but I don't know if thats for everyone.


I listened to an album by Zakir Hussein and Shivkumar Sharma called The Flow Of Time. Sharma plays a lesser known instrument called a santoor which sonically is somewhere in between a sitar and a xylophone.  Its staccato like a xylophone or piano but it has the effect when played fast that sounds like a metallic ball rolling. I got these visuals of tubes of folding metal stretching off into eternity-contracting like wires to the edge of space. It was  was so real and tactile that I felt I was touching the metal.  There's a lot I sadly didn't remember to write down which will be my focus next trip.


I am looking forward to diving back in after a week or so. All I can say is I wish this was more plentiful as it is a gem.

Recommend against. I used to like insufflating a bit of 2c-i for an insta-trip, but to say that it burns is an understatement. Feels not unlike a bad punch in the nose; but to each their own.

Only 5-10mg 2C-B nasally was pure hell. I've recently made a 2C-B nasal spray with tap water at 2mg/spray and that does not even sting. Some minor irritation for a couple mins, nasal spray decreases the pain by like 90%.


I only have one capsule of 14mg 2C-I so I will be dissolving that into water and then pluggin since getting all the powder out of the capsule for pluggin is not doable.

I can't imagine why this would be contraindicated.

Just be careful as 2ci has a bit more bodyload than 2c-b so likely will need alot lower doses of both when combined

2c-i was one of the few 2c drugs that I tried snorting that didn't make me instantly begin to projectile vomit, sweat, increased heart rate, etc. (Haven't tried 2cb yet).


The other one was 2c-d. I actually don't remember if I puked from 2c-c or not but don't remember doing so it's possible I didn't. I only got to try that one once or twice and it was over a decade ago.


2c-e was the worst bodyload for me. I don't enjoy sweating and repeatedly projectile vomiting. I still managed to work my way through a gram of it though.

2C-B appears to be unusually abundant right now which certainly wasn't the case a few months ago (on the EU side of things at least, can't speak for NA). Get stocked up before the next drought hits and enjoy, 2C-B is a very special psyche and paired with the right amount of cannabis I've found it can be a fair bit deeper than the masses would have you believe.

I tried this combo once or twice years ago and I liked it. It had slightly more depth than either on it's own but still had a very familiar 2C feel to it. I had no negative reaction to it and would try it again if I still had any 2C-I left.

I would say snort all 2Cs and especially 2C-I at your own risk and not with any regularity if you like your nose. A decade ago I knew someone who was selling 2C-I as a regular street drug convinced that it would be the next LSD, and he would give me massive discounts just because he had no car and would ask me for rides just to do regular daily shit. One time he showed me his supply; he had nearly an ounce of powder. For a brief time period, he and his friends would snort 40-50 mg repeatedly throughout the day, every day, while also going through cases of nitrous oxide. After a couple months of this they stopped when the guy started getting nosebleeds and stuck his finger up his nostril only to feel a massive hole back there. There was also some story about having taken such a high dosage that no more 2C-I would ever be necessary anyway to go along with the decision. These crazy assholes, at one point he told me they gave someone like ~200 mg to snort and told him to take it all at once just to see how he reacted and supposedly he was fine, but refused to say anything about the trip. They were also the kind of friend group to give someone a bowl of 100X salvia and tell them it's a form of hash.


In any case, I really wish I had some more 2C-I. Back then it was the only non-classic psychedelic I had used besides 4-AcO-DMT and in comparison to a newbie's exploration of high dosages of mushrooms, LSD, and DMT, I was relatively unimpressed with the 2C-I, but honestly, a decade and dozens of research chemical psychedelics later, it actually does really stand out. All of the halogenated 2Cs are actually kind of amazing and near perfect drugs even though people tend to think of them as being on the lighter side, and they do go beyond their reputation. 2C-I has still actually given me some of the strongest visionary imagery of things like swimming or tessellated reptiles and the kind of imagery that presumably inspired Native American architecture when it occured on mescaline compared to all the other psychedelics I've taken so far, and tends to do so in a relatively gentle way, and that's not the only good part about it, but it's something I really like.


Should have made more of an effort to make a lasting supply back then. Ah well.

Yeah the visuals of 2C-I are very unique, I would reliably get this effect where letters (on screen, my keyboard, in a book, etc) would appear like hieroglyphs, but I could still read them.   I would get very mesoamerican stylistic visuals, very strong visuals, it also had a dissociative element to it where my body would feel displaced.  I would frequently get a feeling/sensation where a mirror image copy of myself was attached to the top of my head by the top of its head, and the copy would extend above me, upside down like my head was pressed against a mirror, and I could feel both bodies.  I also had a really crazy experience one time of seeing spirits in my peripheral visual, I had some interactions with two of them and the next morning I mentioned to my girlfriend at the time that I had encountered some spirits last night, and she was like oh is it the little boy and the older man?  I've seen them too.  And she described them exactly like I had experienced them.  Then the cats started reacting as if something was coming towards us and we said hey, if you're the little boy, you can come sit with us (because he seemed shy).  And then right after that there was a thump that we heard and felt that sounded like someone sitting down in front of us (I was no longer tripping and she never tripped once in her life).

There really isn't anything quite like it, and I looked. I get the dissociated aspect too, and it often made me feel like I was on some kind of alien spaceship made with ancient technology but modern technicolor. The color combinations had some resemblance to 2C-B and 2C-C but not as much as they do to each other, and there was a lot going on with 2C-I that still hasn't been present in those for me. The flowery geometry in particular still really stands out in my memory. It was also good for bizarre synesthesia, like one time I saw the right and left sides of the room growing big and small opposite to one another back and forth while also hearing the right and left side of my hearing the music go loud and quiet in tandem, which was really strange to experience. Actually, the only thing I can recall being similar to that was one time on a blotter I was never able to identify, but had reason to suspect it might be DOI; I need to get around to taking that little bit of that I have....


The experiences you describe sound a lot like a type of dissociation I've become much more acquainted with as of late. I like to think of it as the reason that people like to incorporate ideas of backwards/upside down/mirror worlds in fiction.... One way I've been thinking about it is like a Möbius strip: the strip has only a single surface yet the way it's folded makes it so that you're always relatively on one side or the other at any given point, and if you consider the strip a flatland, then if you travel around the strip one time, you'll end up in the same place, but as your mirror image. Furthermore, if when you begin you already have a duplicate mirror image self, they'll end up where you started. The thing about everything being mirrored is, it may seem extremely different to what you're used to, but it has exactly as much structure as the version of it you're used to; for example, if I flip the valuation claims in the statement "This food is delicious and I love it; I would recommend everyone try it!" it becomes "This food is disgusting and I hate it; I would caution everyone avoid it!" Both are rational sentences, even though they describe completely opposite contexts. This is a concept I had to grasp recently to bring myself back from the edge of insanity, as it's impossible to trust anything when you perceive reality in two opposite ways that seem equally stable, and both supported by the things everyone says to you, even if it's that one version is telling you you're crazy while the other version is telling you you're sane.


What would life be like if we always perceived things from the other side instead? Would we still agree upon everything? It feels like it sometimes.

That may or may not be the case. [This one study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945162/) that tested several phenethylamine psychedelics actually claims that 2C-I is an agonist at 5-HT2A receptors in one functional pathway and an antagonist at another. I feel like I could believe it, it's definitely an unusual one, even though I like it.

I only got to test this one two or three times but I loved it. I wish it was still widely available.


I liked it a whole lot more than 2c-e but have had many many more experiences with 2c-e.


2c-i is definitely close to the top of the list for me with 2c drug experiences.

Having done it this way so long, I feel like proper labels would only be more incriminating. Terrible scientist of me though! At work we have barcoded labels, printer labels, etc. when I can get away with it, I still just write on it quick with a sharpie.


Harm reduction and jokes aside: label your chemicals. It would be very easy to confuse 2ce for 2cb for example and just have a really bad time due to dosing higher than expected. Or even worse with different chems if you happen to have DOx around.  My repertoire is limited to a handful of substances that are labeled in short hand or otherwise obvious to the sole user

I wonder if you ever had 2c-c or 2c-d, as they are even lighter still. And I would wager that you haven’t tried..scratch that, that no one at blue light has tried - a **bold statement **- 2C-At with the next heaviest halogen after iodine, Astatine “the rarest naturally occurring element in the Earth's crust, occurring only as the decay product of various heavier elements. All of astatine's isotopes are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a half-life of 8.1 hours” “the longest lived natural isotope is half decayed in less than a minute” “A sample of the pure element has never been assembled, because any macroscopic specimen would be immediately vaporized by the heat of its own radioactivity.” Only about a gram exists at any given time in all of the earth’s crust and only about 50 micrograms have ever been made at one time!

Of course Shulgin thought of this! I didn’t realize I had already read about this in the extensions and commentary for 2ci!

I moved overseas for seven years, and the friend that was babysitting my chemicals determined that they were her property after all that time. I agreed and bought her a scale. 


I wasn't particularly interested in 2C-I at the time, but it was available. I didn't like stimulants and was looking for insight, and 2C-I didn't sound like it met those criteria. I also tried my first 2C-x (2C-C) before I left the country, and found that it made me feel sickly, which turned me off further. On top of that, people were reporting a very high incidence of HPPD from 2C-I around that time, which made me even less eager to try it.

As with all 2C-x, this is a worthwhile chemical. I'm sad that I split the amount that I had and didn't take enough to fully experience what 2C-I is all about. I'm left with some vague idea and memories.

Kinda makes me regret never acquiring 2ci.  2ce was my first RC and I absolutely loved it for quite awhile.  2ci just always seemed like a weaker cousin of 2ce so I never bothered with it. 

Now, I feel like I could more readily appreciate any subtle differences.

In a 4 hour interview with Hamilton Morris, David Nichols claimed to be the first one to make 2ci.  He doesn't mention a year.

This was pretty surprising to me - I have always assumed it was Shulgin's creation. 


I also learned from that interview that Shulgin created (and patented for use as an antidepressant) methylone.

Interesting, I had no idea about either of those things, especially that methylone was patented as an antidepressant.  It sure does take away depression, lol.  But I can't imagine it being good for that purpose, except as a rapid acting emergency antidepressant.  maybe if you took really low doses?

2C-I is quite unique among the 2C-Xs.  it is far from the best in terms of introspection and spirituality, but it's god damn fun, very recreational, and the visuals, headspace, and somatic sensations are different from the others, while of course sharing characteristics.


I was fortunate enough to obtain a handful of doses of this pretty recently... gotta take some soon.

I think a lot of people attribute a lot of things to Alexander Shulgin that he didn’t do. Several of the drugs he created were actually first synthesized by friends of his who were also chemists, and more of the ideas for drugs he had than people think were really just continuing things other chemists already started, like Albert Hofmann and the synthetic tryptamines.


I think MDMA is the biggest offender. A lot of people don’t seem to realize that MDMA existed before Alexander Shulgin was even born and that it was already in recreational use before he ever even tried it.

Back then serotonin releasing agents were new and the idea of taking them for depression didn’t seem so crazy, especially when the main pharmaceutical option for depression was still serotonin reuptake inhibitors and they didn’t really have any stigma yet.


In reality, SRAs are most likely horrible as antidepressants as envisioned back then. They do make good therapy drugs, though.

From what I understand, Shulgin named most of the simple 2C-X series, prior to their synthesis.  I never knew that others in the research group handled some of the synthesises tho.  Makes sense that Nichols would have wanted to leave his name out of it at the time tho, he was far more interested in having a career working "inside the lines" so to speak, sticking to academia and working towards having a legitimate academic lab with a DEA license.  I'm sure he got up to ALL kinds of crazy shit that he just managed to hide well lol.


Nichols was my hero more than Shulgin after awhile, back when I was more serious about wanting to pursue neurochemistry.  Going to work at his lab at Purdue was my pipe dream.


Total off topic aside here, but Myron Stolaroff is another wonderful writer from the Shulgin research group, if anyone is interested in the other members.  He wrote a few good works on psychedlics and spirituality, most famously The Secret Chief Revealed, the biography of Leo Zeff. Zeff was the psychologist that Shulgin passed MDMA to for underground use in therapy back in the day, the godfather of MDMA assisted psychotherapy.


Heck I think that book is on the MAPS site for free now that I think about it!


Edit -- here, tracked down the link [https://maps.org/images/pdf/scr.pdf](https://maps.org/images/pdf/scr.pdf)


And here is Stolaroff's work From Thanatos to Eros, which has discussion on many different  psychedelics, mostly 2C-X and MDX from what I recall (been a long time since I read it)

porkstock 2ce was my first RC too, along with 4-aco-DMT and I also loved it for quite a while being second real psychedelic I tried after LSD (not counting morning glory seeds) and wouldn't mind revisiting intense and unique visuals again, though not as much as I would like 4-aco-DMT as I didn’t explore it nearly as much as 2ce. Still those were almost 2 perfect RC’s to start with, at least available at that time.


Concerning 2c’s I tried in years to come, 2c-b is my favourite I also tried 2c-i, 2c-c and 2c-t-4, all unique but if I could chose to get some of those again I would rather explore 2c-c and 2c-t-4 some more than 2c-i, and would definitely revisit 2c-e again rather than 2c-i. The one I really regret not trying is 2c-t-7 and maybe famous 2c-d and 2c-c combo. But hey that’s my preference for relaxing 2c-c compared to more stimulating 2c-i, also 2c-i produced more body load for me compared to 2c-e while still not reaching nowhere near that strong visuals or euphoria and playfulness od 2c-b.

2C-I is most definitely psychedelic, if you, like me, accidentally IM 60mg, thinking it's ketamine. No Lastingham effects, but for 15 hours,my vision was fucked dueto not being able to see through the trip patterning.

After I run out of a last bit of, I think it was 2c-t-4 (accidentally blowing of part of what I was about to snort with my ex to make it more sad) I was actually regretting not using it IM as I just could feel it would be a really decent dose via that ROA so 60mg of 2c-i IM must have been hell of ride, way too much to handle for most people for sure.

Soon as I realised what I'd done and the sheer shitting myself emotions had reduced to manageable levels (10 minutes that felt like 10 millennia!), I got the vial of ket I was originally after and dosed a bit less than 200mg - probably 170-180 - enough to knock myself out until the main aspect of the rush would be over.

Dear god, I would be scared shitless to try adding a dissociative to that!   Dissos, to me, always wildly potentiate psychedelics.  But I guess a big enough dose would just take you so far out of the conscious realm that you wouldn't notice?


Lately I've been preloading a lot of my trips with a bit of a dissociative, especially MXE... just 10-15mg of MXE, enough to just feel a bit floaty, and then add a museum level dose of a 2C-X (especially them), and the results are intense.  If I add 20mg of 2C-B to that, I will be tripping so hard at the peak that I can't even talk... so many visuals I can't tell what I'm seeing... synesthesia sometimes, followed by a long plateau stage of profound thought and conversation.

As 60mg of 2ci IM is basically an OD and 2c's are safe but still not the safest drugs in huge dose not to mention that ROA in fact I can even see how adding a lot of K might have been a healthy choice in more than one way.

Most 2C-x drugs are still pretty darn safe though. My old dealer from a decade ago told me he once gave a friend 200+ mg of 2C-I and had him snort it all at once. Supposedly he was totally fine to the point that none of them ever even thought to worry about his health, but he absolutely refused to say anything about his trip.

I've found that with certain dissociatives, a large dose of THC can achieve breathtaking heights. Three or four times (one with mxe, the rest with ket), I've reached a stage of such inner stillness, that it feels like I've achieved enlightenment. Of course, it lasts half an hour at most, but if that drug triggered state is only a fraction of a percent of what real enlightenment is, that is such a wonderful, uplifting feeling, my descriptive powers do not do it justice.

I find that true with THC and many classes of drugs, especially if I'm not in a phase where my tolerance to THC is enormous. Though not that it potentates every specific drug in a positive way or even consistently.

I don’t consider myself well-versed in this subject but if enlightenment is what Google tells me it is, I experienced it from a manic episode.


The idea that you could then experience the same thing from dissociatives makes total sense to me.


At the peak of my experience, a friend randomly sent me this out of the blue:

It did not help my state of mind.

I appreciate the response, SpiralusSancti.


I recall now that the main thing that turned me away from 2ci was the adjective "stimulating." I think I have a prejudice against the word, don't like to think of myself doing stimulants I guess? But I do enjoy hiking and being otherwise active during a trip, so maybe it's something I would enjoy. 


I've only tried 2cb as far as other 2cx

They both tend to give me a headache after the trip, and 2ce a bit of sickly feeling during the comeup. 2cp is another one that's an option, but I've never got around to trying. 

I'd probably go for 2cd if I had the option to try any 2cx that's new to me. The 2cT series is intriguing but I think I'd have to steer clear since they don't seem quite as safe

2C-D gives me a mild next day headache and 2C-C makes me feel weirdly sick (which sucks, because I rather liked it.) I associate regular 2C-B use with an increase in heart flutters for a couple months, but that's very possibly just a coincidence.


I think only the thios (2C-T-7, 2C-T-21) and alkyls (2C-E, 2C-P) have killed people. I don't think any of the halogenated 2C-Xs have. The worst I remember was 2C-I causing HPPD more frequently than other psychedelics, which in the age of NBOx seems almost quaint. All in all, they're remarkably safe.

To semi-quote Shulgin.. a thing is either unique or it isn't. There is no "more unique" or "very unique"

But I'm just busting your balls, I know what you mean.

However, your description of 2ci sounds a lot like what most people say about 2cb. I can concur, having shared that one (only) once with my wife. We laid in bed feeling goofy and she rubbed my head with her feet at one point and even that felt amazing!

Shulgin makes a lot of that clear in PiHKAL. TMA was his 1st paper on psychedelic use in humans (~1960), but he mentions that it was made by P. Hey at University of Leeds in 1948.

Shulgin made MMDA in 1962 and thought at the time that it was his 1st new creation, but he says that it was also made by Gordon Alles at UCLA the same year. Alles was dead the next year and I think Shulgin said they didn't get a chance to meet.


But I was under the impression that Shulgin created most of the contents of PiHKAL and TiKHAL unless...it was clear that he didn't. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I guess it's not always explicitly stated, but I knew that he didn't create MDMA, LSD of course...mescaline.  Without thinking too hard, I'll assume there are a good handful that he didn't create/invent, but for 2ci to be one of those that he did not...that's a big surprise to me.


By "back then" do you mean 1990s? That's when Shulgin patented methylone as an antidepressant, at least according to wiki

2C-P is interesting. I find it to be the most different of the ones I've taken so far (B, C, I, E, and P). I think it earned its reputation, I found it to be oppressively powerful at times. The level of immersion was very intriguing though. It stands out as one I'm glad to have taken although I don't often find myself thinking about it.

Has 2C-P killed before? I remember reading at least one trip report where someone ended up in the hospital but they obviously lived to tell the tale. I know 2C-E deaths were associated with that one party. I think the number of deaths on either is still extremely limited, same with the 2C-Ts too I think. I wouldn't dose them as high as the halogen ones though.


I remember when everyone cared about 2C-I causing HPPD. Simpler times.

I'm not saying he necessarily didn't come up with them himself, just that he wasn't always the one making them himself. This is just from stuff I've heard over the years, I'm not totally sure from where. I think some of it may have come from Hamilton's Pharmacopeia but it's been a few years since I watched that now. But I know I also read a lot of those facts like the ones you mentioned in PiHKAL and TiHKAL because yeah, he's not hiding it at all, people just don't know the stories.


Some of the things in his books he didn't create though, especially tryptamines. A lot of the simple tryptamine modifications like the tail extensions with methyl, ethyl, propyl, and isopropyl arrangements as well as making acetate esters like 4-AcO-DMT were, if I recall correctly, patented by Albert Hofmann, who was trying to continue explorations of modifying other indoles in the same sort of way that had proved successful for LSD. Again it's not like Alexander Shulgin is hiding this either, I think a lot of people just assume too much that if it's in the book, it's made / said by him. People also often assume all the drug qualitative comments were written specifically by him when I'm fairly certain they actually came from his group of friends that would try new things together.

Yeah. Fluoxetine was introduced in 1987, Alexander Shulgin introduced the idea of using methylone as an antidepressant in 1996. The Columbine massacre happened in 1999, which to my knowledge was the beginning of the true stigma against SSRIs.

Aren't SSRIs still pretty commonly prescribed and used? As basically the main treatment for depression?

Yeah, but I'm not saying that's not the case, they just have a stigma now. In general the attitude I'm aware of in the medical field is one of searching for antidepressants that now have distinct rather than similar mechanisms of actions to SSRIs.

I'm looking back on it now and I can see how it looks like I'm saying they're not the main prescription anymore, but that's not the point I was trying to make by referring to them as the 'main' option. I was trying to draw a comparison between the fact that at that time the momentum was actually behind SSRIs, and nowadays the momentum is instead behind trying to find new main antidepressants like ketamine, psilocybin, and novel analogues that work through similarly glutamatergic pathways, and other more novel options. SSRIs may still be commonly prescribed but the impression I've gotten is that it's been a long time since they were considered to be what the focus should be on or where the inspiration would come from for depression treatment.

Yeah I get what you mean, Kaleida. Like they used to think SSRIs were the solution. Now they are searching for something that works better and through different mechanisms. 


Crazy to me that they advertised so heavily about a "chemical imbalance in the brain" that was never shown to be true. But it sounded good, and had a cute cartoon to go with it

Yeah, exactly. I'm not claiming to grasp this situation perfectly either, I'm just saying it makes sense to me, since Xorkoth pointed out that the idea of patenting methylone as an antidepressant seems odd now, that it may have seemed a lot more promising back then with SRAs being much less understood and SSRIs still being seen as the hot new thing in depression. I personally think taking an MDMA-like drug every day as a depression prescription seems like a terrible idea now too, but back then, I could see why it could seem like it had promise.


The whole "chemical imbalance" thing definitely irks me. But I'm one of those people who thinks that what we call mental disorder is often times really just more like having a different kind of brain or even just being in a different brain state. Like maybe some of the things we think of as insanity actually made more sense down our evolutionary line before we became too smart and started forcing ourselves to only reinforce the things we could make the most sense of, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but maybe sucks for the people who don't work in that particular way. I don't know, I think about this stuff a lot though.

I guess Indopan (aMT) was around as an antidepressant in the 60s. I don't recall when it was discontinued.

Ditto on the pipe dream of working for Nichols.  Once I earned my PhD in biochemistry I was researching potential postdocs and...yeah, that was my pipe dream. Having a PhD on the topic of yeast genetics doesn't quite qualify me to study neurochemistry.  Plus, I was a less than stellar grad student, so I assumed (probably rightfully) that I didn't stand a chance. Never tried to apply or even contacted Nichols, which after typing this out sounds like more of a lost opportunity than I think it really was.


Did you pursue another topic in science?

Though I don’t think I recall ever having a bad trip on 2ce even when taken up to 30mg (except the time I recklessly snorted 50mg of 5-meo-dmt at the peak of 30mg 2ce). Some mild difficult parts but it was relatively easy to manage compared to something like a very high does of shrooms or lsd.

Pretty sure it got recalled because of people getting seratonin syndrome and dying. Which may have been from them mixing it with other psychiatric drugs and not realizing the disaster potential there. aMT is one of the drugs you have to take very seriously cuz it can knock you off. When i use it i honestly try not to have any drugs in my system at all.


The last time i took it i broke that rule and had FXE the day before and it gave me this wicked headache for days. But yeah i remember reading about studies from back then where deaths happened, but also i believe it abuse/lovely potential got realised and maybe they didnt want a bunch of housewives rolling?

Damn I’ve only had AMT a few times a long time ago. It was an awesome compound though I had a little nausea coming up. It’s akin to a mix of mdxx and psychs and last quite a bit. Best thing is I didn’t feel depleted the following day like I tend to do with other substances. Def would like to get reacquainted with this lil guy

Ohh its such a good drug my favorite empathogen most likely, mainly cuz of the duration and lack of a comedown like you speak of. Its not as in your face with the rolling as say MDMA is, has more of a wave effect that just lasts forever.


 Its excellent and having sex on it is wonderful, it turns me into a damn porn star and i will just go again and again all nite. I have like about a gram tucked away but im not gonna use it often and will try to hold onto it for years. Concerning the nausea the best way to avoid it is plugging, but i know thats not an option for you now and me either.


 So im gonna try and dose lower around 20mgs and use ginger at the same time orally and see how i fair. In the past i would plug 60mgs at a time and it was just a breathtaking experience, i did it quite often at one point at least once a month.

it’s been over 10 years since I’ve used 2c-I. Now from what I recall my batches were always white in appearance. This batch has a rather tannish hue to it. I’m guessing the chemists didn’t bother with further refinement methods.  Not sure when I’ll be able to trip, but ima def do allergy test this weekend. Looks like 25i-nbome that I’ve ordered in the past so just sketches me out, but the 2c-I did came from a reputable source and I know hcl compounds aren’t always perfectly white. Still good to proceed with caution.

My material is not new, but my body is about a 1.5 decade older.  I think I'm going to start titrating this one soon.  I believe 2C-I was the most stimulating of the psychedelics I've tried.  I hope my body can still tolerate it.


Since my return to psychedelics, I've found 2C-E to be more stimulating than I recall it being, and this may be due to changes in my physiology.  Since 2C-I was a lot less mentally active for me, perhaps my experiments with it will give me a better sense what's going on.  And anyway, despite the fact 2C-I kind of fell out of favor for me it was still a lot of fun and was among the best for casual environments.  It pretty much made MDA/MDMA obsolete for me as it offered a much better high and much nicer after-effects.


My titration schedule probably looks like:  0.5 mg, 1.5 mg, 3 mg, 6 mg, and then 10-12 mg followed by maybe 16 mg, which in the past was a comfortable medium dose for me.  This will take me at least a few weeks to complete as I will be traveling for some of the time.


To [@higherconciousness](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/178700/): I hope your material turns out to be legit and you have a good time with it.

I still have some 2C-I from 2011. Sealed in safe environment. Still as potent as the day I got it. I use it sparingly since its nearly impossible to find. But it is my favorite 2C next to 2C-T-7.. and 2C-B of course!

I took 1.5 mg today an had a definite (+) that lasted ~9 hours.  I actually think this was stronger than 1.5 mg of 2C-E for me, but the latter may have a steeper response curve.  I was expecting/hoping for some stimulation to cut through the tired, foggy, post-migraine state I was in (despite getting plenty of sleep), but no such luck.  The effect was clearly psychedelic, principally somatic, and it amplified the body jangles which were already there.  I felt least bad while lying down and closing my eyes, and this would have probably been the case if I'd staid sober too.


Two days before, I'd had a (+/-) with 0.5 mg but I'm fairly sure I felt it.  That experience was quite pleasant, unlike this one.


Anyway, in my earlier years, I always considered 2C-I to be very stimulating and felt the stimulation to be a significant effect alongside the psychedelic effect, but perhaps that was merely a consequence of suggestibility.  I had also assumed that 2C-I had a strong "positive push"---that it would be hard to have a "bum trip" on it---but no such positive push was there today.  Maybe this kind of thing will develop at higher doses?  I will try to find out.  Though, I will also try to avoid any more experiments when my body is not feeling so good.


BTW, I use a fair amount of cannabis on these low dose trials to "bring out" more effects.

I put off the 3 mg trial until today so I could observe my body and give my mind more time to process the last experience.  Here is my mini report:


I sipped the dose over a 5 minute period.  This time the onset was very smooth with just some tummy/gut awareness.  No rushes.  At T+1:15 I was confident I didn't need to be near the toilet and went outside to rake leaves with my wife.  The chore felt pleasant, easy, and satisfying.  I did not feel stimulated, but I didn't feel any fatigue either.  I did seem to sweat about 3 times as much as might be normal, or maybe I was working harder than it felt like.  In about half-an-hour, we filled up all of our lawn bags and decided to walk to the hardware store to buy more.  They were sold out, so we finished the area with a plastic bag and then set out for a pleasant walk.  Wife (who only had cannabis) seemed to have a bit of a contact high and remarked about the considerable time dilation.  Visually, I noticed the perspective effect of pupil dilation and a slight enhancement of details but nothing dramatic.  The sunlight also seemed a bit cooler in color temperature than normal, but I noticed that yesterday (without psychedelic) as well.


When we got home, it was still only T+3.5, and I put on some Infected Mushroom / Classical Mushroom, which I followed with some other random psytrance.  The music euphoria was excellent, and I got a couple hours of good dancing in.  Around T+4.5 I prepared and ate my dinner while actively dancing.  I only ate half the portion though and saved the other half for after my shower, which was at T+5.  When I got out of the shower, I was feeling incredibly blissful, and after I finished dinner, we watched a couple episodes of "Babylon 5"---a series I'm viewing for the first time.  (IMO, this show is really excellent and seems very timely relative to current events in the real world.)


Overall I had a wonderful time today and experienced bliss on a level that I don't think I've felt since my early trips > 11 years ago.  I had stimulation no different from other psychedelics.  The urge to move to the music was there as was the energy when I did so, but I did not feel pushed or overdriven at all.  Granted, the effects weren't nearly as strong as my recent 8 mg 2C-E experience in which I d felt rather over-stimulated in the late plateau.  This is a big reason for me choosing to explore 2C-I again.  I wanted to feel the "2C-stimulation" with minimal mind-fuck, so that I could better understand what I felt on the 2C-E.  My reasoning is that if the stimulation from 2C-I bothers me, then the 2C-E "over-stimulation" was probably a drug effect that I'm more sensitive to.  OTOH, if I don't have this problem with 2C-I, then the "over-stimulation" of the 2C-E may have been more of a psychological effect---a bodily manifestation of some kind of thought-form that needed processing.  Of course, this thought-form could also re-emerge on 2C-I as well, but I assume I'm less likely to encounter it on the I than the E.


Perhaps it's too soon to judge, given that I only had 3 mg of 2C-I, and I got a surprising amount of sparkle out of that 3 mg!  I do recall when I was young, after my first (mild) trip with 2C-I (10 mg?  don't recall), I tried taking 3 mg before work as a stimulant.  I was waiting tables, and when it hit me, I felt really uncomfortable and then I felt like I was doing everything twice as fast---way too fast for a "normal stimulated day".  Also as the effects hit, I developed an ocular migraine, which was very disturbing.  Many migraine sufferers experience an *aura*, a kind of altered state before the headache sets in characterized by among other things visual distortions.  These visual distortions aren't trippy though.  They are more like playing a dirty Nintendo (NES) cartridge (sorry kids).  It's like having areas of stuck pixels (which can be static or moire-like patterns) that completely obscure the vision of parts of the eyes.  They also pulse with the heart beat, which is extra creepy.  Thankfully the aura only lasted an hour or so, and when I got home, I felt fine.  An Internet search helped me understand what I'd experienced.  I've had a couple other ocular migraines since without taking anything, so I have no idea if the 2C-I triggered it or if it was just an obnoxious coincidence.  The experience did leave me with the impression that 2C-I was hyper-stimulatiing in a way that might actually be worse in lower doses, and given my difficult 1.5 mg experience earlier this week, I was quite nervous for today.  Thankfully, today was not a repeat of either of those unpleasant experiences.  I now feel reasonably comfortable moving to 6 mg some days from now!


One thing that is becoming absolutely clear to me from these low dose expeditions is that even a (+) experience is still psychedelic, and as Sasha said, there are no casual experiments.  If I take 3 or even 1.5 mg 2C-I and my set or setting are bad, then my experience will likely be negative too.  It's unlikely to be a train wreck, like too high a dose in a bad setting could be, but it still matters a lot to how the trip goes.  Hence, it's best to prepare for these low dose experiences almost as much as I would for high dose experiences.  Furthermore, even 2-3 days between these kinds of low doses is fine for tolerance, my mind might still need longer for post-processing.

And now for a bonus feature: my one 2C-I train wreck.  Well, it worked out fine in the end, but Erowid might still classify it as such.  I've only had maybe three or four "bad trips", where I really really wanted it to end.  For a brief time, this was one of those.


It was a beautiful spring weekend day, and I wanted to visit a friend and trip with him.  He had just gotten into a new apartment, and invited me to come see him.  I didn't want to trip indoors, and the outdoor areas of his apartment complex were shared with other tenants and rather confined between the buildings.  So I suggested we find somewhere more natural to trip.  I thought it would be a great idea to drive up the canyon, into a state park where we could do a bit of hiking around and then, when the effects had faded, drive home.  There were just two small problems.


It was about 3:30 pm when we found parking at a picnic area that looked like had some room for us to wander from.  We dosed (12 mg I think) and then hiked a good distance from the tables onto a small hillside with a nice view.  At this point, everything was very pleasant.  My friend lit up a cigarette and just stood admiring the scenery.  I asked him how he felt.  He replied: "I feel awesome!"  Ahh, 2C-I.  I started to notice the sun getting lower, and my friend commented about how it would be dark soon and we didn't have any lights.  I replied: "No worries man, we'll just make our way back to the picnic area and wait until we're down enough to drive home".  Problem number 1: the area was officially closed at sunset.  Right on time, a pickup truck appeared in the distance.  My friend said "uhoh", and I'm like "no need to be paranoid".  He giggled at me when it approached and we could see the driver in uniform.  It stopped.  The ranger told us the park was closing and offered us a ride to our cars in the back of his truck.  By this point, the peak effects hit like crazy.  The ride was terribly fun (at least for me, my friend says he was wigging out bad), but as we walked out toward the parking area, the ranger shut a gate behind us.  We could have just hopped it, but we didn't want to get into it with a park ranger or something worse like actual cops.


So we're sitting in the car, and it's dark now.  It was pretty boring, and I didn't want to put the keys in the ignition (for some music at least), lest some cop show up and hit me with a DUI.  (I actually hid the keys, just in case.)  For a while, I watched the colorful blobs and patterns which were overlaying the now very dark landscape.  It was so dark---stiflingly dark.  We both were feeling quite paranoid about cops driving by on the road, seeing us, and stopping.  (The parking area was just a few spaces right off the road.)  I don't recall but I think one of us had weed on our person.  (Actually, I think we'd been smoking it too.)  Y'all know how insanely 2C-I makes pupils dilate.  We were sitting ducks.


And then it happened.  Problem number 2: I ran out of water.  I sucked on the nipple of my backpack water holder, and got that horrifying sound of the last bits of water mixed with air trickling from it.  Under normal circumstances, I had brought plenty of water for a short evening walk in the park, but in my anxious tripping state stuck inside my car, I'd managed to suck it all down and now I *really needed water*.  My friend didn't have any to offer me.  It was an emergency!  I found the keys and started the car.  I was going to get us out of there.  My friend thought I was nuts.  (I was.)  He asked me how I could drive with all those crazy visuals.  At first, it didn't seem too bad, but it took enormous concentration to follow the lines on the road, which seemed barely illuminated versus the visuals.  Then while going around a tight series of complex curve, I felt my hands and arms go completely numb and vanish like in "Spirited Away".  I just saw the steering wheel spinning in front of me as we somehow navigated the curves.  I considered pulling over, but it was a tight canyon with no pull-outs for miles.  Somehow, the part of me that was driving was able to disconnect enough from my tripping self to get us out of the canyon.  Once out, the road was straight and well lit, and the rest of the drive was much more relaxed.  About 30 minutes later, we got back to his apartment, smoked some weed and chilled for a bit.  Then I realized I was hungry and he had no food at all, but the effects had mostly dropped off so I was comfortable driving.  I ate one of the most satisfying meals of my life with him.


Some years later, I actually drove that same stretch of road at night again, and even while totally sober it was a bit scary.  Something about that particular canyon makes for terrible nighttime visibility and requires constant concentration to navigate the many curves.


So bad trips can happen even with light doses.  All it takes is just a little bit of ill preparation.  We got started much later than planned and didn't anticipate the park closure.  I also didn't bring an extra receptacle of water.  If I'd waited things out another 1-2 hours, the drive back would probably have been much less scary.  I've driven while lightly tripping on various other occasions but always late into the effects when I don't have visuals or disappearing arms.  That somatic hallucination was just crazy!


For comparison.  My other "bad" trips both involved ayahuasca of one form or another.

My first research phenethylamine was 2C-I, and I liked it a lot.  Then I discovered 2C-E, which I liked more, but I still used 2C-I at times in which I wanted a more "recreational" experience.  I'm not saying that 2C-I is necessarily casual.  My recent trips with it have not felt so casual, but when I was younger, I often took 2C-I in circumstances in which many people would use MDMA or other non-psychedelics.  It gave me tremendous energy and euphoria, and I liked to dance intensely for hours.  I also took it more than once to salvage a failed entactogenic experience---once after being disappointed by methylone and another time after being disappointed by MDA.  In both cases, I felt much more euphoric after the 2C-I kicked in.


I think it's worth trying, even though it probably won't be your favorite.  It can produce a lot of visual fireworks and euphoria, and it doesn't last too long.

It recently came back in my life and I might have been hasty but I was excited and I took 20mg. At one point I felt like every single cell in my body was excited, on the verge of orgasm  (can cells have orgasms?)


Much more visual than 2c-b imo and much more neon.


Overall it feels like a dream and I'm sad because I can barely describe what happened, but it was one of the most sensationally intense experiences I've had in years. I dont regret it, but next time i will aim for 14-15mg

Oh that's funny.  I just had a successful trip on 14-15 mg and was thinking about 20 mg for my next time, probably some time in the late autumn or winter.  When I was young, 20 mg was a very good level.  I also did 25 mg a couple times which had crazy visuals but also felt a bit hard on the body.  One of those, I had about half-an-hour of visual meltdown and feeling very disoriented.


Perhaps you are a bit sensitive to these compounds, which may relate to how long your trips last?  I've never known anyone to trip for 16 hours on a "normal" size dose, of either 2C-I or 2C-E.  Can you give a little more detail on how strong the effects are over time?  Like for me, 2C-I typically peaks at 2.5-3 hours and drops off rather abruptly between 5 and 6 hours in, and then there is another 3-4 hours over which I mostly return to baseline for a total trip duration of around 10 hours.  With 2C-E, the peak comes about half-an-hour later and the drop is much smoother and later, manifesting about 7 or 8 hours in and being followed by a 3-4 hour return to baseline for a total trip duration of around 12 hours.  I get strong after-effects from both which transition into a proper long-lasting after-glow over the next few days.


I find 2C-I and 2C-E to be quite distinct.  I find 2C-I to be much more casual and hedonistic.  It basically puts on a good show for me.  I find 2C-E to be much more truly psychedelic in the sense that the trip doesn't just happen in front of my eyes (so to speak).  Instead, I experience my mind directing it.  With 2C-E, I am much less likely to have visuals "just because", but if my mind is sufficiently involved, I can conjure up some incredible stuff that 2C-I can't touch.  I also think 2C-E has a lot more emotional depth and more feeling of intensity (for lack of a better term).  Even very low doses of 2C-E can somehow feel almost overwhelming to me in terms of sensory and emotional amplification.  Yet another difference is that 2C-I seems to have a particular stimulating quality, particular over the first 4 hours or so.  Presumably this is an adrenergic mediated stimulation.  On the other hand, 2C-E seems to bring a lot more psychedelic / serotonergic body energy / body load than 2C-I, and this could be viewed as a different sort of stimulation.  I do plan to continue using both.

In my opinion, 2C-C is even more casual than 2C-I and is also not really stimulating.  My main gripe is that the stronger effects barely lasted an hour for me, and most of the rest of the trip was rather weak.  Between this and its low potency, I felt that high doses were a waste of money and material.  I ended up mostly using it at around 20-30 mg for daytime outings like hikes or museums when I wanted some "enhancement" while being able to drive not too long after taking it, and then it ran out.  When the opportunity arose to replace it, I opted instead for more 2C-D which I find to be more interesting for short trips, even if my come-ups are quite rough.

Very surprised there isn’t more 2C-I around. It’s always been a wonderful ally. Low chance for overdose, very safe, dose same as 2C-B. It’s easier to handle than LSD and doesn’t last as long. The synth is almost identical to 2C-B.


Very similar to 2C-B although I find it’s less in the body.


One of my favourites along with 2ct7. In many ways, although not as ethereal and smooth as 2ct7, it has far less body load.

I found 2C-D to be even more neutral than 2C-I. Apparently at higher doses around 60mg it’s very entactogenic. 


Never had enough 2C-D around to try the higher doses.

But doesn't it have more to do with demand than supply? I mean if there is demand for 4-MMC, the market will shift towards it. Just look at Germany, 4-MMC has exploded all over the scene there, in the clubs and festivals.


Not only is it relatively safe compared to cocaine, it's more fiendish than MDMA. The demand is huge. Lol definitely the devils drug. ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


But with 2C-I and 2C-B, they are amazing, sure, but you're not going be having people buy it every week like 4-MMC/3-MMC.


It's bigger in Europe more so than when it was even legal 15 years ago. It's easy for the large syndicates to setup a shop anywhere these days.

I was under the impression that many of the 2c-series along with mescaline had similar synthesis route sharing precursors, but I've not looked into it recently. I suspect it's more supply and demand. 2cb became popular before it was banned. The rest of the series did not.

2CE and 2CI were really easy to get in the DNM golden age ~5 years ago. I wonder if they just didn't sell much. I don't remember being too impressed with 2CI compared to 2CB, but 2CE was a nice change

A long long time ago in the States, we could get all kinds of 2C-X except 2C-B because 2C-B was the only one that was scheduled.  I was super stoked when I saw 2C-I available because I'd always wanted to try 2C-B and figured that 2C-I was as close as I could get.  I didn't know better and thought 2C-I was excellent.  I figured Shulgin et.al. preferred 2C-B because of the shorter duration, but it turns out that both 2C-I and 2C-C are quite different from 2C-B.  I do think more people would probably prefer 2C-B over 2C-I than the reverse, but I think 2C-I is still worthwhile on its own.

So are you judging duration by how long you have to wait to sleep?


I suspect both 2C-I and 2C-E have more adrenergic action than the others you mentioned.  Have you tried 2C-D?  I tend to think of 2C-D as also one of the more stimulating (possibly adrenergic) ones.

So I've taken 2C-I twice since my last post here, both times in combination with 2C-B.


1st go was 10mg of 2C-I and 5mg of 2C-B. The stimulation was still present although at a much less degree then 20mg of 2C-I alone. I remember sitting down to pee and my knees were just shaking. I prolly had a few beers as well knowing me. The visuals were immaculate. Neon still, but the B clearly changed the character.


The 2nd go was at a music festival and it was with 5mg 2C-I and 10mg 2C-B. This was the least stimulating of the 3 experiences and probably actually my favorite. It was primarily a 2C-B trip with an extra flare of visuals and tactile sensation. At the end of the night I smoked a small amount of DMT (30mg?) with a lady I met and we went and laid down afterwards and just snuggled and touched eachother. This was on the the tail of a trip (prolly 7 hours in) and it was as much if not more enactogenic than MDMA in a similar setting. It was amazing. She didn't want to go past snuggling (she had a boyfriend) though it would have been no problem for me to do the deed and enjoy it. A few days later she told me she had such a great experience snuggling with me that she broke up with her bf. 


Whoops, not the first time Ive caused a breakup.


I do think that 2C-I is best taken in a somewhat active environment (concert, bed with a lover, etc). Taking it alone is ok, but I find the stimulation is much more noticeable and uncomfortable.


It's a shame it's not common at all these days, because I do think it's a wonderful molecule. 


I probably won't be trying again soon, 3x in 3 weeks is a bit much for me, but if I develop any new insights or opinions I will post them here.

Halogenated 2,4,5-trisubstituted phenethylamines are much easier to make than alkylated ones. Especially 2C-B and 2C-C, 2C-I can be notoriously tricky to get the iodine attached to for some reason. 3,4,5-trisubstituted phenethylamines like mescaline, allylescaline and the sort are relatively trivial to whip up but they're also much weaker by mass and don't really blast peoples' asses the way 2C-B does. I think 2C-B won the capitalist game by being good for partying without making people introspect too much, having a quick come up, good visuals and body feel, and by being one of the simplest to produce alongside a solid mass-to-potency ratio, personally.

I'm just glad there are still people synthesising mescaline when 2C-B is clearly where the money is. Would 2C-E fall somewhere between 2C-B/C and 2C-I in terms of complexity then? If so I love that they're alphabetical.

There's almost nobody synthesizing mescaline at all, it's dramatically cost ineffective compared to an insane variety of other drugs, and it's even cost ineffective compared to just running bath tub sized extractions on San Pedro/Bridgesii, which is where the majority of (and 100% of North American/South American) mescaline on DNMs is currently sourced from. I've only seen synthetic mescaline coming out of Europe, where access to mescaline containing cacti is scarce. Reducing any phenethylamine (including butanamines, amphetamines, N-benzylations require a SECOND reduction even, etc.) is inherently pretty dangerous due to the risk of the reaction running out exothermically, and on top of that mescaline synths involve not only the use of alkylating but ALSO halogenating reagents, there's a reason that allylescaline, proscaline, and isoproscaline are still being conjured in beakers around the world but mescaline is just being pulled out of cacti, it's both safer and more cost effective when the latter three require less than 50mg for a full dose and mescaline's demanding 10 times more for what's the same synthetic procedure but varied by a single reagent.


2C-E, as well as other alkylated 2,4,5-Trisubstituted phens like 2C-iP, 2C-P, 2C-D, etc., are marginally trickier to work with than 2C-I but not a ton, in fact there's a lot of overlap. There have been people who've found a handful of weird back-handed routes to 2C-I/DOI/Other 2,5-Dimethoxy,4-Iodo compounds, but for the most part none have been cost effective enough to justify continued clandestine production or they involve wacky ass precursors that just aren't very accessible nowadays but were back in Shulgin's era. 2C-I Also received generally unfavorable reviews compared to 2C-B and 2C-C, so given that 2C-B and 2C-C are by far the easiest ones to make, the best selling, AND the easiest to acquire reagents for, I think capitalism just chose which we have for now. Given 2C-C's weakness by mass as well, 2C-B obviously won out in that regard. I wish more DOC and DOB made it on the street frankly, if 2C-B/2C-C are being made then a single reagent swap in the process alters whether you get a 2C-x or a DOx. I just think it's tricky to keep unethical street dealers from selling DOB/DOC as acid and killing people, like they did with the N-benzylated phenethylamines (which are, imo, some of the most beautiful psychedelics to have ever existed).

What are you even talking about? Mescaline requires neither halogenating or alkylating agents. You are clearly confused. Read pihkal again.


Regardless, this forum and this thread in particular is not suitable for synthesis discussion, so please keep on topic or i will start snipping. There are better forums for that anyway.

you're not wrong, and people have devised many creative ways, but surprisingly for mescaline, most* people are still following a modified version of shulgins route. They're just using different reducing systems and catalysts.


And thank you. I do love synthetic chemistry but BL simply isn't the place for it. I tend to cut the chatter sooner than later before it gets too detailed.

Thanks for these excellent reports!


I totally agree that one should plan on *doing something* with the stimulation.  For me 2C-I was the first psychedelic I really developed a love for dancing on.  When I was young and invincible, I'd take 2C-I and just go all out for a few hours, either at home or in an indoor club type setting.  I did this a couple times on 20 mg, and the combo of 2C-I, intense exercise, and psytrance music gave intense euphoria and visuals.  


Sex on 2C-I is also very excellent---much more raw and physical feeling than on 2C-B I think.  Ann Shulgin described 2C-I as a "lusty compound" in the chapter on Aachen in PIHKAL.  I'm almost inclined to suggest that whereas 2C-B has a strong feminine feel, 2C-I feels very masculine.  It's a pretty crude metaphor though, and overall I think I like sex on 2C-I better.


Now I'm reading that you combined 2C-B and 2C-I, and I wonder if you may have discovered the secret formula for a sexual magnetism potion (lol).  Seriously, the combo sounds very interesting and is not something I gave much thought to because of the mismatch in durations.  Did taking 2C-B with your 2C-I help with getting to sleep sooner?

100% I'm sorry I didn't mention it. The 20mg 2C-I trip i reported, I don't think i slept for close to 15 hours post ingestion. The B and i combo, especially the 10mg B, 5mg i, i slept like a baby. I will be taking that combo again for sure :D

I was super stoked when I saw 2C-I available because I'd always wanted to try 2C-B and figured that 2C-I was as close as I could get.  I didn't know better and thought 2C-I was excellent.  I figured Shulgin et.al. preferred 2C-B because of the shorter duration, but it turns out that both 2C-I and 2C-C are quite different from 2C-B.  I do think more people would probably prefer 2C-B over 2C-I than the reverse, but I think 2C-I is still worthwhile on its own.

If this is on the market, somebody will make and sell 25I-NB(OMe/OH) as acid any time now out of capitalistic greed, so be sure to test your blotters folks! 1g of 2C-I roughly converts into 2,5000 doses (2,500 tabs, or 25 full 10x10 sheets) of 500ug blotter, so there's a lot of gain in it for clandestine chemists who prioritize money over the safety and well-being of others. Just a heads up guys! 


(Also that blotter is often lain to paper in dangerously irregular fashions to be careful, please. I love these compounds but they demand respect and will not hesitate to kill).

I highly doubt that many people are interested in doing that these days. 25i overall has such a bad rap. If anything, people might be more willing to synthesize rarer nboxxes. 


Also theoretically, 1g of 2C-I could make 1.39g of 25i assuming 100% conversion. 1/307*427=1.39 so your math isn't too far off. It would be 1.5g if you made the HCL salt.

I would say yes, but that's just me. Along with GHB, I find it the best sex enhancing drug I've ever taken. I really like it at sub psychedelic level (9mg approx?), more as an aphrodisiac. 


As a psychedelic it's pretty unique as well. It's extremely visual and neon, and just as if not more tactile than 2C-B, while more focused cognitively. Its deeper and imo darker as well. It does not have the same inherent positive push that 2C-B has, and things can get really uncomftorable. I find high dose 2c-b to get pretty spacey and I've yet to experience that same effect of not being able to finish a thought or a sentence with 2C-I. 


Granted, my highest dose with 2ci was 22mg. At 22mg 12 hrs later I remember attempting sleep. But when I closed my eyes, my CEVs were brighter than my vision with my eyes open. I think I fell asleep with my eyes open that morning.


I consider myself quite sensitive to most 2C's.

Btw that is much more pronounced with 2C-E. 2C-I is definitely more recreational, but I still find it to be holy. When I mention these long afterglows/durations, it's mainly more because I do not want to let the feeling go vs actual pharmacological drug effect. Eventually I can so stretched out with no sleep that things start to become tripping again. That's when I know I NEED to lay down.

Yeah it's happening around me on the street rn bc some random fool 'casts the adequate spells' on 2C-B they acquired and it's dangerous especially to those who don't know about reagent testing due to the war on drugs. Always test your drugs guys! I know I sound like a tape on loop but as somebody who's taken 25C-NBOMe in an accidental high dose (as did two loved ones) thinking it was LSD, always test, please be safe, and please grow and heal as much as you can from these wonderful tools whether they're lysergamides, 25X-NBXX, whatever they are.

As always your wisdom is greatly appreciated! The exact yield would be around ~138±1% by Ralf Heim's OG paper iirc, but I was just going off the dome for a vague guess as to what would be added by molecular weight + conversion yields. The way that producers occasionally complex them with HPBCD (or move them as freebase) further complicates discussions like this, and I apologize for bringing up a topic with so many obvious snags, I am simply trying to echo the "test your blotters please!" sentiment on this harm reduction forum, if that makes sense.


Not to interrogate or ask for a peer reviewed source, but just out of genuine curiosity, is there a reason you suspect that the market would respond better to more niche 25X-NBXX's as opposed to fallling more towards the inevitable greed of capitalists who would be fine selling a canadian teenager a poorly dosed sheet of 25B-NBOH made out of DNM acquired precursors instead of exploring something accesible and neat like 25N-NB4OMe (just a random example I'm throwing out as a seemingly novel and unique N-benzylated phenethylamine).


Note: Didgital, you've got a lot of wisdom and experience in these circles, I apologize if anything I wrote is still slightly incoherent or sounds snarky/bitchy in any way at all, still tapering off the post-op medications so my articulation skills are returning slow but steady.

That's a yes btw. Get the 2C-I.

Just a heads up guys!

Does it?


My knowledge is that 2c-i avarage dose is around 20mg, which would give 50 such doses from a gram, no?


You could be suggesting that the 2c-1i nmay be converted to some kinda nbome first though, dunno? I'm no chemist. I have recently heard however of someone trying to pass off some type of nbome as 2c-1, or am I confused here?


@Mr.Krinkle one of my kid's partners rates 2C-i as her favourite ever psychedelic. She hasn't had any for years now though due to it being seemingly impossible to find over here. She's not massively experienced with psyches either so there's that (she's had shrooms/lsd/2c-b though, could be more duno that's all I'm aware of), but she definitely rated the 2c-i


And before the bl morality police start moaning at me said 'kid's partner' is likely older than most people on bl, lol

All of the 2C-x compounds can be converted into a NBOxx relatively easily. So say you actually took 1g of 2C-I and converted it to 25i-NBOMe, you would get around 1.4g which is 1400x 1mg doses or 2800x 500mcg doses.

Honestly in a strange way, it was a win for China when the USA scheduled 2C-I. Because China took their 2C-I stockpiles, and coverted them to the NBOMe derivatives, which are typically MUCH more potent. 1g of 2C-I is 50 doses. 1g of 25i-nbome is 1000 doses.

Interesting. I have yet to try 2C-I, but have yet to attribute a feminine feel to any phenethylamine I have tried. Come to think about it, most compounds I assign to a neutral or masculine feel. Wonder what that says about me. I'd say cannabis may be a bit feminine. Maybe DMT and psilocin if I tried them more or the former as Ayahuasca. But it is hard to pinpoint exactly what is meant when assigning genders to the feels of compounds.


I also wonder which compounds weren't somewhat "lusty" for the Shulgins... I was about to say that these compounds only amplify what is already there (which is of course somewhat true), but then I remembered an occassion where a mere 13 mg of 2C-B while hiking in the nirgendsland made me so extremely horny seemingly out of nowhere I was about to consider taking the risk and 'relieving' myself. It would have been a great view too!

It's been a long time since I did 2CI but from what I recall it was very similar to 2CB


2CE however felt a lot more serious. like I was in a big church or something, still very fun

2C-I is great but kinda speedy imo while 2C-E feels "heavier". I'd rather get 2C-D or 2C-C for more mellow trips.

Never got a chance to try 2C-D, but as a big fan of 2C-E, 2C-D was always the "mellow" one that intrigued me. Unfortunate that they were never priced according to dose, just by weight, making 2C-D relatively expensive
