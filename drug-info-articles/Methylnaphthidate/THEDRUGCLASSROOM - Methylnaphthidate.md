# HDMP-28
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/hdmp-28/*

HDMP-28 is a stimulant that appeared on the research chemical market in 2014. It is of little recreational value and it has only been used to a limited degree.

The drug’s structure is similar to that of [methylphenidate](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/methylphenidate/) , with both drugs functioning as monoamine reuptake inhibitors. Unlike methylphenidate, it does affect serotonin.

Little is known about the drug and there are still just a small number of experience reports.

## Experience Reports

## Effects

#### Positive

- Stimulation
- Mood lift (fairly reliable, but moderate)
- Increased motivation
- Increased focus
- Music enhancement (minor)
- Euphoria (minor)

#### Negative

- Appetite reduction
- Increased heart rate
- Increased blood pressure

Functional stimulation is the primary effect offered by HDMP-28, though some level of mood lift is common. Music enhancement has been reported in a minor way.

The comedown effects are usually no greater than mild fatigue.

## Chemistry & Pharmacology

#### Chemistry

It is a piperidine class stimulant that shares much of its structure with methylphenidate. They differ in that methylphenidate’s benzene is swapped for a larger naphthalene moiety.

#### Pharmacology

HDMP-28 functions as a triple reuptake inhibitor (TRI), meaning it affects dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. It is biased towards dopamine and serotonin, with the greatest affinity for the dopamine transporter.

## History

#### Early 2000s

Investigations with the drug began, though it wasn’t extensively studied. Some pharmacological information became available, revealing it was a TRI.

#### 2014

Recreational use didn’t occur until 2014, at which point it was sold by some research chemical (RC) vendors and reports of its effects appeared.

#### 2014 – 2015

Sales continued in the RC market. HDMP-28 failed to take off given its fairly uninteresting effects.

#### 2016

Use hasn’t grown, though it remains available from some sources.

## Legal Status

#### United States

Uncontrolled

#### Controlled

Switzerland

## Safety

Little is known about the drug, making it difficult to say how safe it is, particularly with long-term use.

Due to this lack of information, it’s best to use the drug at the lowest possible dose, as infrequently as possible, and without combinations.
