## Effects
The effect depends very much on the set and the setting. Blood pressure and pulse increase, pupils dilate. Detachment of the body from the mind and ego dissolution are common, near-death experiences also occur relatively often, especially when high doses are consumed. The perception of time changes greatly during intoxication. A few minutes can be perceived as very long and intense. In addition, different feelings such as fear, euphoria, etc. can be experienced within a short period of time. Consumers report immersion in very "bizarre" worlds in which connections between being, environment and matter arise. Physical perception can also be influenced, in that one feels weightless or thinks one is falling.
With 5-MeO-DMT, the potential effect is greater, but less optical than with DMT.

## Dosage
MeO-DMT must be dosed very carefully, as even a few milligrams more can cause a very intense and unpleasant effect, which can result in psychological and mental problems lasting several weeks.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
The risk associated with the use of 5-MeO-DMT is mainly psychological and depends on the personality structure of the user. The perceptual changes during a trip can be so intense that especially inexperienced users feel overwhelmed by the flood of impressions. The perception of sudden emotional outbursts can also be perceived as rather disturbing and overwhelming. At high doses, such psychological side effects can be felt for days to weeks. If the rules of the set and setting are not followed, there can be false reactions, loss of orientation, panic, paranoia and horror trips. Physical side effects include nausea, vomiting, increase in heart rate, slightly accelerated breathing, increased blood pressure, pupil dilation, increased salivation, tremors, restlessness, headaches and movement disorders.

### Long-term Risks
Permanent disturbances in self- and reality recognition are possible. The view of the world can be permanently called into question, which can make it difficult to cope with everyday life. Latent (hidden) psychoses can be triggered.

## Safer Use
- Only consume when you feel good. If you are afraid of the strong effects, do not use. Do not use if you are afraid of the substance.
- Do not use 5-MeO-DMT alone! Take it in a safe atmosphere and together with experienced people you trust.
- Take 5-MeO-DMT while sitting or lying down, as physical perception and ability to move are impaired during intoxication.
- Dose carefully at first. If there is no effect, increase the dose the next time. Do not add more on the same day.
- The consumption of MAO-inhibiting foods such as matured cheese, smoked fish or meat, sauerkraut, tofu, chocolate etc. should be avoided before and after consumption.
- People with high blood pressure should not consume 5-MeO-DMT.
- A trip with 5-MeO-DMT should remain an exceptional experience. Make sure you take long breaks from using 5-MeO-DMT and talk to others about your experience so that it can be processed.
