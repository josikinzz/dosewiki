**DOM** (2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine) is a psychdelic substituted amphetamine with effects similar to LSD. It has a slow come up, and an extremely long duration.

## History

DOM first saw human use in 1967, when tablets sold under the street name 'STP' started to become popular in the Haight-Ashbury District of San Francisco. These tabs contained an excessively high dose in the range of 15 to 20mg. This, combined with the long onset of the drug, led to numerous non-fatal overdoses.

## Dosage

| Threshold | 0.5-1mg |
| --- | --- |
| Light | 1-2.5mg |
| Common | 2.5-5mg |
| Strong | 5-7.5mg |
| Heavy | 7.5mg+ |
| LD50 | 18mg/KG |

## Duration

Note: This is a very dose dependent substance, with higher doses yielding longer, more intense results.

| First effects | 1-2 hours |
| --- | --- |
| Coming up | 1-2 hours |
| Peak | 2-3 hours |
| Plateau | 4-6 hours |
| Coming down | 4-12 hours |
| After-effects | 4-16 hours |

## Harm Reduction

### Warning

**DOM** has been known to have a long comeup (up to 3 hours in some cases), as well as being one of the longer-acting psychedelic phenethylamines. For this reason, redosing is not recommended.
