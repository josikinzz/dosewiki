3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-hydroxyamphetamine (MDOH, MDH), also known as N-hydroxy-MDA, is an entactogen, psychedelic, and stimulant of the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes. It is the N-hydroxy homologue of MDA, and the N-desmethyl homologue of MDHMA.

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin listed the dose range as 100 to 160 mg orally and its duration as approximately 3 to 6 hours. He describes MDOH as being very psychedelic and producing increased pleasure in beauty and nature. Shulgin also mentioned several negative side effects also seen with MDMA ("Ecstasy") such as difficulty urinating and internal dryness. He has noted that the properties and effects of MDOH are very similar or near-identical to those of MDA and that MDOH might be converted into MDA in the body.
