**2C-B-FLY** is a lesser-known novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) and [benzodihydrodifuran](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodihydrodifuran) classes that produces an array of [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) and [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Route_of_administration) . Reports have characterized its effects profile as possessing features of [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) and [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) , with a duration of 6–8 hours (or up to 12 hours in larger doses).

2C-B-FLY is a derivative of the [2C-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x) family of psychedelic [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) , specifically [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , of which it significantly differs from in terms of its potency, metabolism, and potential toxicity. It was first synthesized by Aaron P. Monte in 1996.

Around 2005, 2C-B-FLY appeared and gained some popularity in the online [research chemicals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemicals) market before largely disappearing in October 2009, when a batch of [Bromo-DragonFLY](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bromo-DragonFLY) was accidentally mislabeled as 2C-B-FLY (Bromo-DragonFLY is dosed in micrograms, where 2C-B-FLY is dosed in milligrams) led to two deaths as a result of taking overdoses of Bromo-DragonFLY meant to be effective doses for 2C-B-FLY. This event led to its immediate withdrawal until around 2016, when it resurfaced on the market again.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 2C-B-FLY, and it has little history of human usage. It has no documented history of being sold on the streets and is commercially distributed through online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) vendors.

Due to its high potency and sensitive dose-response, many reports also indicate that the effects of this substance should not be seen as a simple substitute for [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) . It is highly advised to approach this potent, long-lasting, and unpredictable hallucinogenic substance with the proper amount of precaution and harm reduction practices if choosing to use it.

## History and culture

In a 2007 [MAPS](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAPS) newsletter interview, [Ann Shulgin](/w/index.php?title=Ann_Shulgin&action=edit&redlink=1) revealed that 2C-B-FLY as one of her favorite [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substances while also acknowledging the high variability in responses it seemed to display.

## Chemistry

2C-B-FLY is a substituted molecule of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_Phenethylamine) and [dihydrobenzofuran](/w/index.php?title=Dihydrobenzofuran&action=edit&redlink=1) chemical classes. 2C-B-FLY features a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain and contains a bromine atom attached to carbon R 4 of the phenyl ring.

It is an atypical psychedelic phenethylamine which is closely analogous to [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) ; it is the dihydrofuran analog to 2C-B, where it incorporates the methoxy groups bound to R 2 and R 5 of 2C-B into five-member dihydrofuran rings fused to the central benzene ring.

2C-B-FLY belongs to a group of phenethylamine derivatives referred to as the FLY compounds, named for their insect-like appearance of two “wing-like” tetrahydrofuran rings fused on the opposite sides of the central benzene ring. The incorporation of the two methoxy groups into the 5 member rings fixes them into the optimum position for binding to the receptors they interact with resulting in an increase in potency compared to the compound's non-rigid counterpart [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) .

## Pharmacology

2C-B-FLY is a psychedelic phenethylamine, and is the dihydrodifuran analog of 2C-B.

Little is known about how the totality of its effects are produced, 2C-B-FLY's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience remains subject to on-going scientific investigation.

## Subjective effects

In comparison to [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , this compound presents a significantly more pronounced body high/load, stronger visual effects, more complex [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) and more in-depth [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) which are comparable to [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) or [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) at higher doses. Lower doses, however, are associated with more [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) as opposed to classical psychedelic effects.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- The physical effects of 2C-B-FLY are comparable to that of traditional [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_Phenethylamine) such as [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) and [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) along with more pronounced side effects. There have been reports gastrointestinal disturbances following the use of this compound which include [diarrhea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diarrhea) , [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , moderate to severe [stomach bloating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stomach_bloating) and general gassiness at [moderate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Moderate) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses. These effects are comparable to that of [5-MeO-MiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-MiPT) , [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) and other compounds with suspected [MAO](/w/index.php?title=MAO&action=edit&redlink=1) -altering properties. This suggests that 2C-B-FLY may potentially have such MAO-altering properties of its own, which may make it dangerous to combine with certain substances. 
- **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** and **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - At [light](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Light) [dosages](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage) , this compound is generally stimulating but in a gentle, non-forceful manner similar to that of [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) . At higher dosages one may find the amount of stimulation to increase to an uncomfortable level with undertones of sedation or lethargy in a manner similar to that of [2C-C](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-C) or [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) .
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of 2C-B-FLY can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft, all-encompassing and mild tingling sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the [onset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Onset) and hits its limit once the [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) has been reached. It is comparable to that of a milder [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) experience. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)**
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** - Compared to 2C-B, this effect is far more pronounced and unpredictable in its manifestation. Small increases in the dose may result in large changes in this effect. 
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Bodily pressures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_pressures)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)** - This effect is more commonly reported than 2C-B or other traditional phenethylamines.
- **[Muscle cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_cramps)**
- **[Stomach bloating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stomach_bloating)**
- **[Stomach cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stomach_cramps)**

- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) , [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Morphing) and [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, intricate in appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style. It is very comparable to that of [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) .
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**

- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) and [2C-D](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-D) than [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) or [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) . It can be comprehensively described through its [style variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, synthetic in style, structured in organization, brightly lit and multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, flat in edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, angular in corners, non-immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity. They have a contradictory combination of a very "natural" but also "neon digital" feel to them and at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#8B_-_Exposure_to_inner_mechanics_of_consciousness) visual geometry over [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#8A_-_Exposure_to_semantic_concept_network) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
2C-B-FLY produces a moderate range of hallucinatory states in a fashion that is comparable to [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) or common doses of [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) . This is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics such as [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . It tends to occur at heavier dosages and integrates seamlessly with the accompanying geometry. These effects generally include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) ### Cognitive effects
 
- 2C-B-FLY tends to maintain a level of relatively normal and sober thought structure regardless of the subjective visual, physical and cognitive accompanying effects intensity. This leaves the user in control in a manner which would not be possible on many compounds such as [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) or [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) due to their accompanying [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) . 
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This compound presents entactogenic effects on a level which is less intense than that of [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) but similar in quality to that of [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) or [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) .
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Enhancements](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)** ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of this compound are comparable to that of a mild [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) or [entactogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) . The experience generally feels negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and may occur due to the physically fatiguing aspects of this substance. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)**
- **[Diarrhea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diarrhea)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: 2C-B-FLY](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_2CBFly.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 2C-B-FLY do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 2C-B-FLY is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with a very limited history of human usage.

Anecdotal evidence from people within the community who have tried 2C-B-FLY suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

2C-B-FLY is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 2C-B-FLY is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 2C-B-FLY presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 2C-B-FLY all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 2C-B-FLY. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

If 2C-B-FLY does have suspected MAO-altering effects, this could indicate that 2C-B-FLY is more likely to induce [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) or general [monoamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine) overload (especially at high dosages) than other [serotonergic psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelic) . This may make it dangerous to combine it with [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) , [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) and certain substances which modulate synaptic concentrations of neurotransmitters such as [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) through unknown mechanisms. These substances include but are not limited to:

## Legal status

- **Austria** : 2C-B-FLY is illegal to possess, produce and sell under the NPSG. (Neue-Psychoaktive-Substanzen-Gesetz Österreich). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Canada** : 2C-B-FLY would be considered Schedule III as it is a derivative of 2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine.
- **Germany** : 2C-B-FLY is controlled under the NpSG (New Psychoactive Substances Act) as of November 26, 2016. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.
- **Italy** : 2C-B-FLY is a schedule I substance and is illegal to possess, produce, sell and buy. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Poland** : 2C-B-FLY is unscheduled in Poland. However, it would be considered in Group II-P drug as it is a derivative of 2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine.
- **Sweden** : As of April 2018, 2C-B-FLY is illegal to possess, sell, buy and use under Swedish law.
- **Switzerland** : It is unclear whether 2C-B-FLY is in the scope of a substituted phenethylamine under Verzeichnis E point 130, since it is not an "alkyl, alkoxy, alkylenedioxy or halide derivative of phenethylamine", while additionally containing further univalent substituents, according to the scope. Although it could theoretically be considered an alkoxy derivative, it would still miss one hydrogen atom on the alkyl part of the alkoxy substituent. It is also unclear if it can be considered a true ether analog of an ether analog of 2C-B which would make it controlled under Buchstabe C.
- **The Netherlands** : 2C-B-FLY is legally available as a research chemical (not for human consumption). However, it is part of a substance group that may be banned soon as part of a recently passed law on New Psychoactive Substances (NPS).
- **Turkey:** 2C-B-FLY is a classed as drug and is illegal to possess, produce, supply, or import.
- **United Kingdom** : It is illegal to produce, supply, or import this drug under the Psychoactive Substance Act, which came into effect on May 26th, 2016.
- **United States** : 2C-B-FLY is unscheduled and uncontrolled in the United States. However, it may fall under the scope of the Federal Analogue Act if it is intended for human consumption given its similarity to 2C-B.
