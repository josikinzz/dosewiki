**Dextroamphetamine** (also known as *Dexamphetamine, Dex, Dexies* , and sold under brand names like *[Adderall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall)* , *[Dexedrine](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1636-9080/dextroamphetamine-sulfate-oral/dextroamphetamine-oral/details)* , and *[Zenzedi](https://zenzedi.com/)* ) is a central nervous system stimulant and the right-handed enantiomer of amphetamine. It's more potent than its mirror twin, [levoamphetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levoamphetamine) , especially in stimulating dopamine and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) activity in the brain.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , increased focus, [motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement) , [appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression) , [wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness) , [thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . At lower to moderate doses, it can promote productivity, alertness, and sociability. However, higher doses may induce restlessness, anxiety, compulsive redosing, and over-stimulation. It is classified as a classical stimulant due to its ability to promote mental and physical arousal through increased catecholamine activity.

A notable property of dextroamphetamine is its high potential for abuse and rapid tolerance buildup. Repeated use over short periods can lead to diminished effects, compulsive use patterns, and a pronounced comedown characterized by [mental fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue#Mental) , [irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability) , and [anhedonia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anhedonia) .

Recreational or street amphetamine is usually a racemic mix of both enantiomers, resulting in a broader and less focused effect profile compared to pure dextroamphetamine.

It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

Dextroamphetamine is the dextrorotary [enantiomer](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Enantiomer) of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , it is typically obtained via the chiral resolution of racemic amphetamine, but can also be synthesized via typically more envolved enantioselective syntheses.

Its physical properties are close to identical to those of (racemic) [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or [levoamphetamine](/w/index.php?title=Levoamphetamine&action=edit&redlink=1) and tends to also be handled as its sulfate salt.

## History and culture

In 1937 Smith, Kline and French introduced tablets of the dextrorotary enantiomer of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) (at that time sold as Benzedrine)under the tradename Dexedrine.

## Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Alcohol** - Drinking alcohol on stimulants is considered risky because it reduces the sedative effects of the alcohol that the body uses to gauge drunkenness. This often leads to excessive drinking with greatly reduced inhibitions, increasing the risk of liver damage and increased dehydration. The effects of stimulants will also allow one to drink past a point where they might normally pass out, increasing the risk. If you do decide to do this then you should set a limit of how much you will drink each hour and stick to it, bearing in mind that you will feel the alcohol and the stimulant less.
- **GHB** / **GBL** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of sedatives. If the stimulant wears off first then the depressant effects of the GHB/GBL may overcome the user and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Opioids** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of opiates. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the patient and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Cocaine** - The rewarding effects of cocaine are mediated by DAT inhibition, and an increase of exocytosis of dopamine through the cell membrane. Amphetamine reverses the direction of DAT and the direction vesicular transports within the cell by a pH mediated mechanism of displacement, thus excludes the regular mechanism of dopamine release through means of exocytosis because the effects Na+/K+ ATPase are inhibited. You will find cardiac effects with the combination of cocaine and amphetamine due to a SERT mediated mechanism from the subsequent activation of 5-HT2B, which is an effect of serotonin-related valvulopathy. Amphetamines generally cause hypertension in models of abuse, and this combination can increase the chances of syncope due to turbulent blood flow during valve operation. The rewarding mechanisms of cocaine are reversed by administration of amphetamine.
- **Cannabis** - Stimulants increase [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) levels and the risk of [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) and [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) which can lead to negative experiences.
- **Caffeine** - This combination of stimulants is generally considered unnecessary and may increase strain on the heart, as well as potentially causing anxiety and physical discomfort.
- **Tramadol** - Tramadol and stimulants both increase the risk of seizures.
- **DXM** - Both substances raise heart rate, in extreme cases, panic attacks caused by these substances have led to more serious heart issues.
- **Ketamine** - Combining amphetamine and ketamine may result in psychoses that resemble schizophrenia, but not worse than the psychoses produced by either substance alone, but this is debatable. This is due to amphetamines ability to attenuated the disruption of working memory caused by ketamine. Amphetamine alone may result in grandiosity, paranoia, or somatic delusions with little to no effect on negative symptoms. Ketamine, however, will result in thought disorders, disruption of executive functioning, and delusions due to a modification of conception. These mechanisms are due to an increase of dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway caused by amphetamine due to its pharmacology effecting dopamine, and due to a disruption of dopaminergic functioning in the mesocortical pathways via NMDA antagonism effects of ketamine. Combining the two, you may expect mainly thought disorder along with positive symptoms.
- **PCP** - Increases risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states.
- **Methoxetamine** - Increases risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states.
- **Psychedelics** (e.g. ***[LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin)*** ) - Increases risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . 
- **25x-NBOMe** - Amphetamines and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation that when combined they can result in tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction and, in extreme cases, heart failure. The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants are also not good in combination with psychedelics as they can lead to unpleasant thought loops. NBOMes are known to cause seizures and stimulants can increase this risk.
- **2C-T-x** - Suspected of mild MAOI properties. May increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
- **5-MeO-xxT** - Suspected of mild MAOI properties. May increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
- **DOx**
- **aMT** - aMT has MAOI properties which may interact unfavorably with amphetamines.
- **MAOIs** - MAO-B inhibitors can increase the potency and duration of phenethylamines unpredictably. MAO-A inhibitors with amphetamine can lead to hypertensive crises.
