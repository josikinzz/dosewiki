# 25E-NBOH
*Source: https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25E-NBOH*

**4-Ethyl-2,5-dimethoxy-(N-(2-hydroxybenzyl))phenethylamine** (also known as **25E-NBOH** and **2C-E-NBOH** ) is a closely related analog of [25E-NBOMe](/w/index.php?title=25E-NBOMe&action=edit&redlink=1) . 25E-NBOH is a synthetic [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) chemical class and is reported to share most of its properties with the exception of a moderately reduced potency and a shorter duration with [25E-NBOMe](/w/index.php?title=25E-NBOMe&action=edit&redlink=1) . Phenethylamine's produce an array of visually-dominant and [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulating) [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) .

25E-NBOH is a derivative of the hallucinogen [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) . It was first developed by Martin Hansen at the University of Copenhagen in 2010 as a brain imaging agent, but has subsequently been sold as a designer drug, first being identified in Brazil in 2018 on seized blotter paper, as well as in several European countries. Although it is unknown exactly how 25E-NBOH exerts its effects it is believed to act by binding to [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) in the brain. Related substances of the NBOH family include: 25B, 25C, and 25I, all of which were identified in 2016 by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA).

Similar to other known [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , compounds of the NBOH family are not [orally](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orally) active and should be administered [sublingually](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sublingual) by placing and holding it in one's mouth and allowing it to absorb over a period of 15-25 minutes.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [open and closed-eye visuals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) , [time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion) , [enhanced introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) , [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) , [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . User reports characterize 25E-NBOH as a clear headed, dose-sensitive psychedelic that is capable of producing strong visual distortions along with a significant "body load". 25E's body load manifests itself through [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) . Users describe the body load as making their muscles very sore and many take supplements to counteract these effects.

Little to no research has been done on the effects of 25E-NBOH on humans or animals. However, being an analogue of the NBOMe class it is suspected that it may have a similar safety profile. When using this substance it is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) .

## History and culture

25E-NBOH was first introduced to the scientific community in 2010 by Martin Hansen as a brain imaging agent. It wasn't until 2017 that the substance found its way onto seized blotter paper in Brazil. It is likely that the substance has been used prior to 2017, but their is a lack of hard evidence. Today, 25E-NBOH is used as a cost effective alternative to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or passed off as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) .

## Chemistry

## Pharmacology

25E-NBOH's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) effects are believed to be mediated by its binding to the [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) and [5-HT2C](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) as an agonist. Information regarding the pharmacological properties of 25E-NBOH is still scarce, but its action is similar to that of the other [serotonergic psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelic) .

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - 25E-NBOH is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is comparable to that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , although it is 'encouraged' instead of 'forced'.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of 25E-NBOH is manifested as one of the most proportionally intense in comparison to almost all of the classical psychedelics. The sensation itself can be described as an intense and slightly uncomfortable energetic pins and needles sensation that constantly encompasses a person's entire body. It is usually felt over the surface of the skin but occasionally manifests itself in the form of a continuously shifting, tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in intermittent waves. Alongside this, many users report uncomfortable body feelings characterized by dysphoric aches and urges to shift the position of one's body and prolonged tensing of unusual combinations of muscle groups. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - Feelings of frequent but unpredictable rushes of warm physical euphoria are extremely common and very pleasurable. These move from the top of the head downwards before enveloping one's whole body.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Mild to extreme nausea is consistently reported when consumed in moderate to high doses and either passes once the user has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Frequent urination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frequent_urination)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component can be considered to be less intense when compared with that of entactogenic stimulants like [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - This is a rarely observed effect but is believed to be a risk in those predisposed to them, especially while in physically taxing conditions such as being dehydrated, fatigued, undernourished, or overheated. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#_morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**

- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry that is produced by this substance can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colorful in scheme, glossy in color, sharp in their edges and equally rounded and angular in their corners. It gives off a contradictory natural and synthetic feel that at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) visual geometry over [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
25E-NBOH produces a full range of high-level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. This particularly holds true in comparison to other substances within the family of psychedelic phenethylamines. These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - In comparison to other psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , 25E-NBOH is extremely reliable at producing hallucinations embedded within visual [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) . This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, and concepts. They are more likely to present themselves within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The head space of 25E-NBOH is described by many as one which is both insightful and relatively unaltered in its thought processes even at moderate to high dosages. 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This component is [introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) dominant and consistently manifested only in the context of a non-social setting in which the user is alone.
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings are a little weaker and less sharp than those produced by substances such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) but still often prove strong enough to provide long-lasting therapeutic effects.
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**

- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. However, many reports indicate that this substance is relatively reliable at inducing synaesthetic states in those who are predisposed to them.

### Experience reports

25E-NBOH's use is not widespread and there are currently 0 experience reports which describe the effects of this substance in our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: 25E-NBOH](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_25ENBOH.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

25E-NBOH like other [classical psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Classical_psychedelics) is not believed to have any long term safety concerns. Anecdotal reports suggest that 25E-NBOH is non-habit forming. It is recommended that a break is taken between use of this or other [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) to allow for tolerance to reset and the body to recover.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_use) when using this substance.

### Lethal dosage

There is no known lethal dosage for 25E-NBOH however, this does not mean it is impossible to die from its ingestion.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Although no formal studies have been conducted, it is not unreasonable to assume that like [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) in general, 25E-NBOH is not habit-forming and that the desire to use it can actually decrease with use.

Tolerance to the effects of 25E-NBOH is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 1-2 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 2-4 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 25E-NBOH presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) but not evenly, meaning that after the consumption of 25E-NBOH, some psychedelics will have significant reduced effects while some others will only be slighly affected.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

### Drug interactions

- **Lithium** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of bipolar disorder. There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 25E-NBOH. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

### Condition interactions

- **Bipolar disorder** - Those effected by Bipolar disorder are at a greater risk of having an episode or a psychotic break and are strongly advised not to use this substance.
- **Schizoaffective disorder** - Those effected by Schizoaffective disorder are at a greater risk of having an episode or a psychotic break and are strongly advised not to use this substance.

## Legal status

- **United States** : 25E-NBOH is not regulated under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, however it's structurally similar to substances from the NBOMe class. Meaning that 25E-NBOH falls under the the Federal Analogue Act of 1986. This considers it as s Schedule I controlled substance, making illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, process, or distribute without a license from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
