## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as diphenylmethanes. These are compounds containing a diphenylmethane moiety, which consists of a methane wherein two hydrogen atoms are replaced by two phenyl groups.

### Background

Pipradrol (Meratran)
11
was initially developed in the 1950s as an antidepressant, however, the adverse effects associated with its use and its abuse potential led to its withdrawal and international regulation
12
.  Pipradrol was made illegal in many countries in 1970s because of its potential for abuse. It is currently classified under the Misuse of Drugs Act as a Class C substance
10
.
Experimentation with the drug and its derivatives for recreational purposes has led to many cases of acute toxicity and has been linked to three fatalities. The social and in particular acute clinical harms of pipradrol derivatives have led to their control under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 in the UK in 2012
3
.
Interestingly, this drug has been studied for bactericidal properties, however, is not currently, used for this purpose
2
. In addition to this, it has shown favorable effects in postpartum depressive symptoms
6
.

### Indication

Used to manage fatigue
10
and depression

,

,
11
. Used as an adjunct therapy in the management of obesity
10
.

### Pharmacodynamics

Pipradrol (Meratran) is a psychoactive agent and a central nervous system stimulant that has proven useful in the field of psychiatry
10
.
Pipradrol was initially used as an adjunct in the dietary management of obesity as well as for the management of dementia symptoms. Numerous reports have been made on the properties of pipradrol, demonstrating its favorable effects in the treatment of depression and fatigue in addition to a variety of other conditions including narcolepsy, spasmodic torticollis, schizophrenia and in geriatric practice
10
.

### Mechanism of Action

D(1) dopamine receptor
Agonist

### Absorption

Rapidly absorbed
4
.

### Metabolism

Rapidly metabolized, and not found in plasma approximately 4 hours post administration
4
.

### Toxicity

Toxicity Data: Oral LD50 (rat): 180 mg/kg; Oral LD50 (mouse): 120 mg/kg; Oral LD50 (rabbit): 180 mg/kg
MSDS
.
The toxicity of this drug is dependent on the dose ingested, and is owed to its central nervous stimulant activity
3
,
4
.
Overdoses of pipradrol hydrochloride cause nausea, anxiety, insomnia and abdominal pain, however, these symptoms often disappear when the drug is withdrawn. In severe cases, convulsions may occur
5
,
4
.  This drug is contraindicated in anxiety, psychosis states, and schizophrenia, as it can worsen these symptoms. Hallucinations have been reported after taking this drug
3
.
Over the last decade there has been greater use of novel psychoactive substances (‘legal highs’) across Europe and the United States, including increasing frequency of reports of diphenylprolinol (D2PM) and desoxypipradrol (2-DPMP) use
9
.
There are increasing reports that D2PM (desoxy analogue of pipradrol) and  2-DPMP (a pyrrolidine analogue of pipradrol) are used in Europe as drugs of abuse. 2-DPMP has sympathomimetic properties similar to cocaine and, in addition, prolonged and clinically significant neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported
9
.  The binding and activity of D2PM at the dopamine re-uptake transporter, is also similar to cocaine, though it appears that D2PM has less potent biological activity

### Mechanism of action

Pipradrol and pipradrol derivatives are norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors
3
.
In a pharmacokinetic study, it was shown that pipradrol conditioned place preference (CPP)
13
was blocked by selective D1 dopamine antagonist, implicating that a rewarding effect of pipradrol may involve the activation of D1 dopamine receptors.
Pipradrol has a definite cerebral stimulating effect without affecting the blood pressure or respiration and has been used to counteract post-anaesthetic and chlorpromazine depression in man. Structurally related to phenylmethylamphetamine, a potent stimulant with a long half-life, pipradrol differs from amphetamine in that its action is more intense at higher centers, it does not exhibit pressor activity, there is no post-excitement depression, and this drug does not decrease appetite, as occurs with amphetamine
