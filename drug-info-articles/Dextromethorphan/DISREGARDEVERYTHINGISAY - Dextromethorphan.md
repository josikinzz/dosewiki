DXM or Dextromethorphan is an antitussive (cough suppressant) drug. It is one of the active ingredients in many over-the-counter cold and cough medicines, including Robitussin, Delsym, Benylin and others, including many generic labels. It is a dissociative hallucinogen of the Morphinan chemical class with multiple mechanisms of action. These include actions of a nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, inhibiting the reabsorption of the neurotransmitter serotonin even after it has performed its function of transmitting a neural impulse, essentially allowing it to accumulate and be reused, causing physically euphoric effects. It is also a sigma-1 receptor agonist, allowing for its antitussive effects, and the action of its major metabolite dextrorphan as an NMDA receptor antagonist, essentially blocking the connections between neurons and creating for its dissociative effects.

Instead of acting as a direct antagonist of the NMDA receptor itself, Dextromethorphan is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and converted into the active metabolite dextrorphan in the liver; a metabolite that is nearly 10 times more potent and the true mediator of this substance’s dissociative effects.

It was first patented and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1954 and subsequently sold as an over-the-counter cough suppressant in 1958, with the first record of its recreational use dating back to 1962.

Although it is often considered to be a “kiddie drug” by many people within the online drug community, DXM is without doubt, visually on par with all of the other commonly used dissociatives such as Ketamine, MXE and PCP, and an extremely powerful substance.

The DXM experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe…

**Physical effects:**

The subjective physical effects of DXM can be broken down into nine components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Disconnection from tactile input**
- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - The DXM body high is a sharp, pleasurable tingling sensation which is location specific to the hands, feet and head.
- **Suppression of touch** - This partially to entirely suppresses one’s own sense of touch, creating feelings of numbness within the extremities. It is responsible for the anaesthetic properties of this substance.
- **Physical autonomy**
- **Loss of motor control** - A loss of gross and fine motor control alongside of balance and coordination is prevalent within DXM and becomes especially strong at higher dosages. This means that one should be sitting down before the onset unless they are experienced in case of falling over and injuring oneself.
- **Euphoria** - This results in feelings of physical euphoria which range between mild pleasure to powerful all-encompassing bliss.
- **Decreased bodily weight** - This creates the sensation that the body is floating and has become entirely weightless. This effect is strangely stimulating and encourages physical activities at low to moderate dosages by making the body feel light and effortless to move.
- **Dizziness** - Although uncommon, some people report dizziness under the influence of DXM.
- **Nausea** - It’s worth noting that high dose DXM trips can sometimes result in nausea and vomiting at the peak of trip. This is more intense than the nausea found within Ketamine and MXE. For most people, however, this is surprisingly not as unpleasant as they would initially expect due to the accompanying detachment from the physical senses.

**Cognitive effects:
**

The head space of DXM is often described as particularly impairing, disorientating and generally less clear headed in comparison to that of MXE and Ketamine. The cognitive effects of DXM can be broken down into 9 separate subcomponents which are listed and described below:

- **Disconnection from consciousness**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**
- **Time distortion**
- **Introspection**
- **Deja-Vu**
- **Removal of cultural filter**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Direct communication with the subconscious**
- **States of unity and interconnectedness**

**Visual effects:**

*Suppression*

This substance does not enhance visual stimuli, instead it tends to degrade and decrease visual aptitude in a variety of ways which generally include:

- **Decreased visual acuity**
- **Suppression of pattern recognition**
- **Blurred vision**
- **Double vision**

*Distortions*

DXM exhibits a full array of dissociative distortions and alterations in visual perception which generally includes,

- **Perspective distortions**
- **Environmental Cubism**
- **Environmental Orbism**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry found within DXM can be described as intricate in complexity, fast in movement, soft in edges, rounded and angular in corners, large in size, immersive in presence and very brightly coloured in scheme when compared to that of MXE.

*Hallucinatory states*

At high dosages, DXM can produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that that is less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. These effects include:

- **Internal hallucinations** - These hallucinatory states can be described as containing plots, settings, autonomous entity contact and scenarios. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability and fixed in style. They can include both new experiences and memory replays which are capable of being weeks in length and real time in experience.
- **External hallucinations**

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of DXM are common in their occurrence and exhibit a range of effects which commonly includes:

- **Enhancements**
- **Suppression**
- **Distortions**
- **Hallucinations**

**After glow:**

The afterglow is a feeling that occurs within the 24 hours after the trip itself. It is long lasting and as equally enjoyable as the trip itself to many people. It can be be described in terms of its physical sensation as one of euphoria, rejuvenation, relaxation and a light bounciness. In terms of its mental thought processes however, it can be described as a complete loss of anxiety, contentedness and an extremely high appreciation for music.

**Grapefruit Potentiation:**

It’s worth noting that grapefruit juice is extremely efficient for potentiating and enhancing the DXM trip if approximately 1 glass of white grapefruit juice or more is drunk every hour throughout the day before the trip. The effects will be considerably stronger and more intense. For people who are drinking store brought syrup, this is extremely useful as it means drinking less foul syrup.

The Grapefruit juice acts on DXM by inhibiting the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes of the 3A and 1A groups. DXM is converted to DXO by this same enzyme, only with different groups. Therefore, with enough grapefruit juice, your overall trip should be more intense, as the DXM is converted into DXO at a faster rate.

**Health effects, potential addiction and tolerance:**

The biggest speculation regarding the long term health effects DXM abuse was that it may cause a form of brain damage know as Olney’s lesions or NMDA receptor antagonist neurotoxicity (NAN), due to similarities with Phencyclidine (PCP). Despite this however, studies show that in rats oral administration of dextromethorphan did not trigger Olney’s lesions in laboratory tests. Oral administration of dextromethorphan repeatedly during adolescence, however, has been shown to impair learning in those rats during adulthood.The occurrence of Olney’s lesions in humans, however, has not been proven or disproven. William E. White, author of the DXM FAQ which can be found here, has compiled informal research which can be found here from correspondence with dextromethorphan users suggesting that heavy abuse may result in various deficits corresponding to the brain areas affected by Olney’s lesions; these include loss of episodic memory, decline in ability to learn, abnormalities in some aspects of visual processing, and deficits of abstract language comprehension.

The biggest risk of DXM use is the potential accidental misuse of multi-symptom cold medications, rather than using a cough suppressant whose sole active ingredient is dextromethorphan, carries significant risk of fatality or serious illness. Multi-symptom cold medicines contain other active ingredients, such as paracetamol (acetaminophen), chlorpheniramine, and phenylephrine, any of which can cause permanent bodily damage such as kidney failure, or even death, if taken on the generally-accepted recreational dosing scale of dextromethorphan.

Combining dextromethorphan with other substances can compound risks. Stimulants such as amphetamine and cocaine can both cause a dangerous rise in blood pressure and heart rate. CNS depressants such as alcohol will have a combined depressant effect, which can cause a decreased respiratory rate. Combining dextromethorphan with other serotonergic drugs such as the 2Cx family, MDMA and AMT could possibly cause serotonin toxicity, a dangerous excess of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system.

Dextromethorphan generally does not produce withdrawal symptoms characteristic of [physically addictive substances such as alcohol](http://www.lapalomatreatment.com/alcohol-addiction/) or benzos, but there have been cases of psychological addiction. This is because in comparison to psychedelics such as LSD and mushrooms, DXM has no real tolerance and can be taken multiple days in a row if it is desired with tolerance only manifesting itself at different speeds within people and only through regular long term usage. This is something that can easily be prevented by manually limiting your usage of the drug.

**Legal issues:**

Antitussive preparations containing dextromethorphan are legal and uncrontrolled to purchase from pharmacies in most countries, with some exceptions being Sweden, Estonia and Latvia. As of January 1, 2012, dextromethorphan is also prohibited for sale to minors in the state of California, except with a doctor’s prescription.

No legal distinction currently exists in the any part of the world besides the state of illinois between medical and recreational use, sale, or purchase. The sale of dextromethorphan in its pure powder form has incured penalties towards people in the past, although no explicit law exists prohibiting its sale or possession.

If you want to try DXM, your easiest bet is visiting your local pharmacy, supermarket or buying it in pure form online. Pure powder is cheaper and signifigantly more efficient than syrup, it can be found with a quick google search for the term “DXM powder buy”, “pure dextromephorphan buy” or other similar phrases, usually being sufficient to find a supplier in the top 3 or 4 links.

In the UK specifically, Benilyn non-drowsy cough syrup is sold behind the counter in Boots, Morrisons, Sainsburys, Tesco’s and ASDA for under £5 with 225mg of DXM contained within every 150ml of liquid. You need to be atleast 16 years of age to purchase a bottle and they will not sell it to you if you look like an irresponsible teenager or have piercings / dyed hair.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, DXM is an extremely powerful drug, capable of taking people to incredibly rich induced mystical and transcendental states. This is despite the fact that it is nothing more than the active chemical in generic over the counter cough syrup and legal in every country across the world.
