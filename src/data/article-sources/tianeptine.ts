**Tianeptine** (trade names **Stablon** and **Coaxil** ) is an atypical [antidepressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressant) . While primarily a prescription drug, it is sometimes used in high doses for recreational [opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) effects. It has a unique and poorly-understood mechanism of action consisting of modulation of the brain's monoaminergic and glutamatergic systems.

While tianeptine is classified as a [tricyclic antidepressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tricyclic_antidepressant) (TCA), its pharmacological effects differ from those of typical antidepressants. This is primarily due to the fact that it is not thought to act immediately through the regulation of monoaminergic [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) (such as [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , or [noradrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) .) Rather, it is theorized to act upon [glutamate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Glutamate) and glutamatergic mechanisms, causing the brain to adapt more readily to stress and [depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression) . Clinical trials of tianeptine suggest that it is just as effective as other, more popular antidepressants such as fluoxetine (i.e., SSRI) and amitriptyline (i.e., TCA). However, tianeptine seems to exhibit fewer side effects and complications than traditional antidepressants.

In addition to its antidepressant effects, tianeptine also exhibits [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) (anti-anxiety) properties, specifically having shown promise in the treatment of panic disorders. Tianeptine also displays neuroprotective properties and has been shown to improve cognition in patients with depression. Tianeptine's anxiolytic and mood-boosting effects, in addition to its purposed neuroprotective and cognitive benefits, make it a popular [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) .

Subjective effects of recreational doses include [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) and/or [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) , [motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . Prescription guidelines indicate that tianeptine should be taken in 12.5 mg doses and taken three times daily, waiting 3-4 hours between doses. However, doses of 12-35 mg are more commonly used by recreational users.

It is worth noting that very little is known about the potential toxicity of recreational tianeptine use. Some users have reported that its [opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) effects can cause both physical and psychological dependence like traditional [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) (e.g. [heroin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heroin) , [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) , [hydrocodone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hydrocodone) ). It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

Tianeptine is a tricyclic antidepressant, as its molecular structure is composed of three cyclic compounds. Despite tianeptine's chemical similarity to other TCAs, its effects and [mechanisms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scientific_information#Pharmacology) are unique.

### Sodium and sulfate salts

Like many drugs, tianeptine can be manufactured into various salt forms to achieve maximum bioavailability, absorption, and overall effectiveness. Tianeptine is most commonly found in its sodium salt form because it is the only version that is sold by pharmacies and prescribed by doctors. However, the sulfate salt is now also being marketed on [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) vendor sites, suggested as being superior to the sodium salt, especially with respect to having a longer half-life and duration.

There is no formal research to suggest any increased efficacy of the sulfate form, but anecdotal reports from users suggest that it may be more effective and have a longer duration than the sodium salt. The sulfate form is not more potent, but it is metabolized slower by the body, thus making a single dose per day more effective. Anecdotal reports by users of both salt forms indicate that because the sulfate is metabolized more slowly, there is less potential for addiction. The sulfate form appears to provide a more level experience as opposed to the sodium form, which reaches its peak antidepressant effect more quickly and returns back to baseline more suddenly.

## Pharmacology

Unlike most prescribed antidepressants, tianeptine appears to have negligible direct effects on monoamines like dopamine and serotonin. Tianeptine slightly increases extracellular levels of [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , although it is not known how exactly it causes this release.

Experiments conducted on rats revealed that tianeptine does not increase levels of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) in subjects. Rather, it has been found to increase the *reuptake* of serotonin, being labeled a selective serotonin reuptake *enhancer* . This lies in contrast to the most popularly prescribed antidepressants, which are selective [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [reuptake inhibitors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) (SSRIs). However, tianeptine's alteration of serotonin is likely not relevant to its mechanism.

Tianeptine also contributes to a significant increase in neuroplasticity through the modulation of [glutamate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Glutamate) and its receptors, most notably through the indirect modulation of NMDA receptors. Such increases in brain plasticity have been linked to a significant reduction of stress and depression symptoms. More recent studies have concluded that tianeptine is also an effective [μ-opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid#Mu_.28.CE.BC.29) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) , which could contribute to its antidepressant and [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) properties.

It is also sometimes used to treat irritable bowel syndrome or asthma.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)**
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - More pronounced feelings of euphoria have been reported at doses near or above 100 mg. These feelings are extremely similar to that of a typical [opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) .
- **[Bronchodilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bronchodilation)** - Tianeptine increases the reuptake of serotonin, which has been found to combat bronchoconstriction.
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)**
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Nausea is experienced in high dosages, taken for its euphoric effects.
- **[Itchiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Itchiness)** - Like traditional opioids, itchiness may manifest at recreational doses, and can range from mild to severe depending on dosage and tolerance.
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)**
- **[Constipation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Constipation)**
- **[Physical fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue)** ### Visual effects
 
- - **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** - One may experience a state of semi-consciousness and [hypnagogia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnagogia) during heavy dosage nodding which results in dream-like states and up to level 3 [imagery](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lucid_dreaming#Internally_sourced_sensory_input) . This is often accompanied by ill-defined [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) . ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)** - Tianeptine has been found to be especially useful in mitigating the effects of panic attacks.
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - More pronounced feelings of euphoria have been reported at doses near or above 100 mg. These feelings feel extremely similar to that of a typical [opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) .
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - In addition to enhancing the ability to focus, tianeptine also improves the retention of short-term memories, stimulates quicker learning, and improves reaction time.
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)** or **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Rejuvenation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Rejuvenation)**
- **[Ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)** - Although rare, some users may experience adverse effects in terms of cognition such as the impairment of thought processes.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational tianeptine use have not been studied in any scientific context, and the exact toxic dosage is unknown.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Lethal dosage

The [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) of tianeptine has not yet officially been established; however, it seems to have a large therapeutic index and margin of safety. In 2007, a 26-year-old man committed suicide by taking an excessive amount of tianeptine in combination with alcohol. However, the amount required to overdose is not likely to be taken on accident. To ensure safety while using tianeptine, it is advised to not exceed 100 mg in a single dose or 300 mg total in one day.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

The chronic use of tianeptine can be considered as mildly addictive and is capable of causing both physical and psychological dependence. When physical dependence has developed, [withdrawal symptoms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids#Discontinuation) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of tianeptine develops with prolonged use, including therapeutic effects. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). This compound may share a cross tolerance with other [trycyclic antidepressants](/w/index.php?title=Trycyclic_antidepressants&action=edit&redlink=1) and [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) .

It is worth noting that because of tianeptine's short duration of effects, it may compel some to frequent redosing. The potential euphoric effects of high doses (> 100 mg) may cause some users to exceed recommended dosages, which could quickly raise tolerance and intensify negative side effects. In addition, tianeptine possesses certain properties as a [μ-opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid) [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) , possibly leading to addiction and withdrawal mechanics similar to that of [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiate) . However, as with most people looking to discontinue their antidepressant medications (both [SSRIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/SSRI) and [TCAs](/w/index.php?title=TCA&action=edit&redlink=1) ), daily users of tianeptine should [taper](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Taper) off their usage instead of suddenly halting it. This will ensure that negative discontinuation symptoms are kept to a minimum.

Tianeptine withdrawal can occur with as little as ~500mg per day, and increases in severity with the amount of daily dosage and time spent using the drug. Withdrawal symptoms are similar to opioids (flu-like symptoms, watery eyes, and nose, dry heaves et al.) and may include emotional instability. Due to the fact that Tianeptine generally has weaker recreational properties compared to other opioids, the withdrawal of this substance can feel significantly worse than an equally euphoric dose of a more traditional opioid.

## Legal status

Tianeptine is available by prescription in many European, Asian, and South American countries and distributed under brand names such as Stablon and Coaxil.

- **Canada:** Tianeptine is uncontrolled in Canada, meaning it is legal to possess without any sort of license or prescription. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Germany:** Tianeptine is a prescription medicine, according to Anlage 1 AMVV.
- **Russia:** In Russia, since 2010, tianeptine is a Schedule III controlled substance.
- **Sweden** : Tianeptine is not an approved prescription medicine, and is therefore a controlled substance.
- **Switzerland** : Tianeptine is not controlled under Buchstabe A, B, C and D. It could be considered legal.
- **Turkey** : Tianeptine is a 'green prescription' only substance and illegal when sold or possessed without a prescription.
- **United Kingdom:** Tianeptine is illegal to produce, supply, or import under the Psychoactive Substance Act, which came into effect on May 26th, 2016.
- **United States:** Tianeptine is currently a federally uncontrolled substance in the United States. However, many nootropics vendors have ceased carrying it due to its recreational use and abuse potential. In March of 2018, the Michigan state legislature passed a bill to classify tianeptine sodium salt as a Schedule II controlled substance, making it the first state to schedule the drug.

Tianeptine, sold under the brand names Stablon, Tatinol, and Coaxil among others, is an atypical tricyclic antidepressant which is used mainly in the treatment of major depressive disorder, although it may also be used to treat anxiety, asthma, and irritable bowel syndrome.
Tianeptine has antidepressant and anxiolytic effects with a relative lack of sedative, anticholinergic, and cardiovascular side effects. It has been found to act as an atypical agonist of the μ-opioid receptor with clinically negligible effects on the δ- and κ-opioid receptors. This may explain part of its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects; however, it is thought that tianeptine also modulates glutamate receptors, and this may also explain tianeptine's antidepressant/anxiolytic effects.
Tianeptine was discovered and patented by the French Society of Medical Research in the 1960s. It was introduced for medical use in France in 1983. Currently, tianeptine is approved in France and manufactured and marketed by Laboratories Servier SA; it is also marketed in a number of other European countries under the trade name Coaxil as well as in Asia (including Singapore) and Latin America as Stablon and Tatinol but it is not available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Italy or the United Kingdom. In the US, it is an unregulated drug sold under several names and some of these products have been found to be adulterated with other recreational drugs. It is commonly known by the nickname "gas station heroin".

## Medical uses

### Depression and anxiety

Tianeptine shows efficacy against serious depressive episodes (major depression), comparable to amitriptyline, imipramine and fluoxetine, but with significantly fewer side effects. It was shown to be more effective than maprotiline in a group of people with co-existing depression and anxiety. Tianeptine also displays significant anxiolytic properties and is useful in treating a spectrum of anxiety disorders including panic disorder, as evidenced by a study in which those administered 35% CO2 gas (carbogen) on paroxetine or tianeptine therapy showed equivalent panic-blocking effects. Like many antidepressants (including bupropion, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, moclobemide and numerous others) it may also have a beneficial effect on cognition in people with depression-induced cognitive dysfunction. A 2005 study in Egypt showed tianeptine to be effective in men with depression and erectile dysfunction.
Tianeptine has been found to be effective in depression, in people with Parkinson's disease, and with post-traumatic stress disorder for which it was as safe and effective as fluoxetine and moclobemide.

### Other uses

A clinical trial comparing its efficacy and tolerability with amitriptyline in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome showed that tianeptine was at least as effective as amitriptyline and produced fewer prominent adverse effects, such as dry mouth and constipation.
Tianeptine has been reported to be very effective for asthma. In August 1998, Dr. Fuad Lechin and colleagues at the Central University of Venezuela Institute of Experimental Medicine in Caracas published the results of a 52-week randomized controlled trial of asthmatic children; the children in the groups who received tianeptine had a sharp decrease in clinical rating and increased lung function. Two years earlier, they had found a close, positive association between free serotonin in plasma and severity of asthma in symptomatic persons. As tianeptine was the only agent known to both reduce free serotonin in plasma and enhance uptake in platelets, they decided to use it to see if reducing free serotonin levels in plasma would help. By November 2004, there had been two double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trials and an under-25,000 person open-label study lasting over seven years, both showing effectiveness.
Tianeptine also has anticonvulsant and analgesic effects, and a clinical trial in Spain that ended in January 2007 has shown that tianeptine is effective in treating pain due to fibromyalgia. Tianeptine has been shown to have efficacy with minimal side effects in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.

## Contraindications

Known contraindications include the following:

Hypersensitivity to tianeptine or any of the tablet's excipients.

## Side effects

Compared to other tricyclic antidepressants, it produces significantly fewer cardiovascular, anticholinergic (like dry mouth or constipation), sedative and appetite-stimulating effects. Unlike other tricyclic antidepressants, tianeptine does not affect heart function.
μ-Opioid receptor agonists can sometimes induce euphoria, as does tianeptine, occasionally, at high doses, well above the normal therapeutic range (see § Recreational use below). Tianeptine can also cause severe withdrawal symptoms after prolonged use at high doses which should prompt extreme caution.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

#### Atypical μ-opioid receptor agonist

In 2014, tianeptine was found to be a μ-opioid receptor (MOR) full agonist using human proteins. It was also found to act as a full agonist of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR), although with approximately 200-fold lower potency. The same researchers subsequently found that the MOR is required for the acute and chronic antidepressant-like behavioral effects of tianeptine in mice and that its primary metabolite had similar activity as a MOR agonist but with a much longer elimination half-life. Moreover, in mice, although tianeptine produced other opioid-like behavioral effects such as analgesia and reward, it did not result in tolerance or withdrawal. The authors suggested that tianeptine may be acting as a biased agonist of the MOR and that this may be responsible for its atypical profile as a MOR agonist. However, there are reports that suggest that withdrawal effects resembling those of other typical opioid drugs (including but not limited to depression, insomnia, and cold/flu-like symptoms) do manifest following prolonged use at dosages far beyond the medical range. In addition to its therapeutic effects, activation of the MOR is likely to also be responsible for the abuse potential of tianeptine at high doses that are well above the normal therapeutic range and efficacy threshold.
In rats, when co-administered with morphine, tianeptine prevents morphine-induced respiratory depression without impairing analgesia. In humans, however, tianeptine was found to increase respiratory depression when administered in conjunction with the potent opioid remifentanil.

#### Glutamatergic, neurotrophic, and neuroplastic modulation

Research suggests that tianeptine produces its antidepressant effects through indirect alteration and inhibition of glutamate receptor activity (i.e., AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors) and release of BDNFTooltip brain-derived neurotrophic factor, in turn affecting neural plasticity. Some researchers hypothesize that tianeptine has a protective effect against stress induced neuronal remodeling. There is also action on the NMDA and AMPA receptors. In animal models, tianeptine inhibits the pathological stress-induced changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission in the amygdala and hippocampus. It may also facilitate signal transduction at the CA3 commissural associational synapse by altering the phosphorylation state of glutamate receptors. With the discovery of the rapid and novel antidepressant effects of drugs such as ketamine, many believe the efficacy of antidepressants is related to promotion of synaptic plasticity. This may be achieved by regulating the excitatory amino acid systems that are responsible for changes in the strength of synaptic connections as well as enhancing BDNF expression, although these findings are based largely on preclinical studies.

#### Serotonin reuptake enhancer

Tianeptine is no longer labelled a selective serotonin reuptake enhancer (SSRE) antidepressant.
Tianeptine had been found to bind to the same allosteric site on the serotonin transporter (SERT) as conventional TCAs. However, whereas conventional TCAs inhibit serotonin reuptake by the SERT, tianeptine appeared to enhance it. This seems to be because of the unique C3 amino heptanoic acid side chain of tianeptine, which, in contrast to other TCAs, is thought to lock the SERT in a conformation that increases affinity for and reuptake (Vmax) of serotonin. As such, tianeptine was thought to act a positive allosteric modulator of the SERT, or as a "serotonin reuptake enhancer".
Although tianeptine was originally found to have no effect in vitro on monoamine reuptake, release, or receptor binding, upon acute and repeated administration, tianeptine decreased the extracellular levels of serotonin in rat brain without a decrease in serotonin release, leading to a theory of tianeptine enhancing serotonin reuptake. The (−)-enantiomer is more active in this sense than the (+)-enantiomer. However, more recent studies found that long-term administration of tianeptine does not elicit any marked alterations (neither increases nor decreases) in extracellular levels of serotonin in rats. However, coadministration of tianeptine and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine inhibited the effect of tianeptine on long-term potentiation in hippocampal CA1 area. This is considered an argument for the opposite effects of tianeptine and fluoxetine on serotonin uptake, although it has been shown that fluoxetine can be partially substituted for tianeptine in animal studies. In any case, the collective research suggests that direct modulation of the serotonin system is unlikely to be the mechanism of action underlying the antidepressant effects of tianeptine.

#### Other actions

Tianeptine modestly enhances the mesolimbic release of dopamine and potentiates CNS D2 and D3 receptors. Tianeptine has no affinity for the dopamine transporter or the dopamine receptors. CREB-TF (CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein) is a cellular transcription factor. It binds to certain DNA sequences called cAMP response elements (CRE), thereby increasing or decreasing the transcription of the genes. CREB has a well-documented role in neuronal plasticity and long-term memory formation in the brain. Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript, also known as CART, is a neuropeptide protein that in humans is encoded by the CARTPT gene. CART appears to have roles in reward, feeding, stress, and it has the functional properties of an endogenous psychostimulant. Taking into account that CART production is upregulated by CREB, it could be hypothesized that due to tianeptine's central role in BDNF and neuronal plasticity, this CREB may be the transcription cascade through which this drug enhances mesolimbic release of dopamine.
Research indicates possible anticonvulsant (anti-seizure) and analgesic (painkilling) activity of tianeptine via downstream modulation of adenosine A1 receptors (as the effects could be experimentally blocked by antagonists of this receptor). Tianpetine is also weak histone deacetylase inhibitor and analogs with increased potency and selectivity are developed.
Tianeptine has been shown to be a high-efficacy agonist of PPAR-delta, a nuclear receptor.

### Pharmacokinetics

The bioavailability of tianeptine is approximately 99%. Its plasma protein binding is about 95%. The metabolism of tianeptine is hepatic, via β-oxidation. CYP enzymes are not involved, which limits the potential for drug-drug interactions. Maximal concentration is reached in about an hour and the elimination half-life is 2.5 to 3 hours. The elimination half-life has been found to be increased to 4 to 9 hours in the elderly. Tianeptine is usually packaged as a sodium salt but can also be found as tianeptine sulfate, a slower-releasing formulation patented by Janssen in 2012. In 2022 Tonix Pharmaceuticals received permission from the US FDA to conduct phase II clinical trials on tianeptine hemioxalate extended-release tablets designed for once-daily use. The project was discontinued in late 2023 because of disappointing results in clinical trials.
Tianeptine has two active metabolites, MC5 (a pentanoic acid derivative of the parent compound) and MC3 (a propionic acid derivative). MC5 has a longer elimination half-life of approximately 7.6 hours, and takes about a week to reach steady-state concentration under daily-dosing. MC5 is a mu-opioid agonist but not delta-opioid agonist, with EC50 at the mu-opioid receptor of 0.545 μM (vs 0.194 μM for tianeptine). MC3 is a very weak mu-opioid agonist, with an EC50 of 16 μM. Tianeptine is excreted 65% in the urine and 15% in feces.

## Chemistry

In terms of chemical structure, it is similar to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), but it has significantly different pharmacology and important structural differences, so it is not usually grouped with them.

### Analogues

Although several related compounds are disclosed in the original patent, no activity data are provided and it was unclear whether these share tianeptine's unique pharmacological effects. More recent structure-activity relationship studies have since been conducted, providing some further insight on μ-opioid, δ-opioid, and pharmacokinetic activity. Derivatives where the aromatic chlorine substituent is replaced by bromine, iodine or methylthio, and/or the heptanoic acid tail is varied in length or replaced with other groups such as 3-methoxypropyl, show similar or increased opioid receptor activity relative to tianeptine, with up to 13x higher potency than tianeptine itself. Amineptine, the most closely related drug to have been widely studied, is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor with no significant effect on serotonin levels, nor opioid agonist activity. Tianeptinaline, analog of tianeptine, is a notable class I HDAC inhbitor.

## History

Tianeptine was introduced for medical use in France under the brand name Stablon in 1983.

### Development

Under the code names JNJ-39823277 and TPI-1062, tianeptine was previously under development for the treatment of major depressive disorder in the United States and Belgium. Phase I clinical trials were completed in Belgium and the United States in May and June 2009, respectively. For unclear reasons development of tianeptine was discontinued in both countries in January 2012. In October 2023, Tonix Pharmaceuticals announced that it had discontinued its development of tianeptine as a monotherapy for major depressive disorder after disappointing phase-2 clinical trial results. An ongoing clinical trial, sponsored by the New York Psychiatric Institute, is examining tianeptine's use in treatment-resistant depression.
U.S. National Poison Data System data on tianeptine showed a nationwide increase in tianeptine exposure calls and calls related to abuse and misuse during 2014–2017.

### Recreational use

As a μ-opioid agonist, tianeptine in large doses has high abuse potential. In 2001, Singapore's Ministry of Health restricted tianeptine prescribing to psychiatrists due to its recreational potential.
Between 1989 and 2004, in France 141 cases of recreational use were identified, correlating to an incidence of 1 to 3 cases per 1000 persons treated with tianeptine and 45 between 2006 and 2011. According to Servier, stopping of treatment with tianeptine is difficult, due to the possibility of withdrawal symptoms. The severity of the withdrawal is dependent on the daily dose, with high doses being extremely difficult to quit. An official DEA statement states that the withdrawal symptoms in humans typically result in: agitation, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, hypertension, diarrhea, tremor, and diaphoresis, similar to other opioid drugs.
In 2007, according to French Health Products Safety Agency, tianeptine's manufacturer Servier agreed to modify the drug's label, following problems with dependency.
Tianeptine has been intravenously injected by drug users in Russia. This method of administration reportedly causes an opioid-like effect and is sometimes used in an attempt to lessen opioid withdrawal symptoms. Tianeptine tablets contain silica and do not dissolve completely. Often the solution is not filtered well thus particles in the injected fluid block capillaries, leading to thrombosis and then severe necrosis. Thus, in Russia tianeptine (sold under the brand name "Coaxil") is a schedule III controlled substance in the same list as the majority of benzodiazepines and barbiturates.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has expressed concern that tianeptine may be an "emerging public health risk", citing an increase in exposure-related calls to poison control centers in the United States. Sold retail as a dietary supplement and touted as a mood-booster and an aid for concentration, it is colloquially known as "gas-station heroin". In the US, it is an unregulated drug sold under several product names and has been found to be adulterated with synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs)  or other drugs.
A literature review conducted in 2018 found 25 articles involving 65 patients with tianeptine abuse or dependence. Limited data showed that a majority of patients were male and that age ranged from 19 to 67. Routes of intake included oral, intravenous, and insufflation entry. In the 15 cases of overdose, 8 combined ingestion with at least one other substance, of which 3 resulted in death. Six additional deaths are reported involving tianeptine (making 9 in total). In this report, the amount of tianeptine used ranged from 50 mg/day to 10 g/day orally.

## Legality

In 2003, Bahrain classified tianeptine a controlled substance due to increasing reports of misuse and recreational use.
In Russia, tianeptine (sold under the brand name "Coaxil") is a schedule III controlled substance in the same list as the majority of benzodiazepines and barbiturates.
