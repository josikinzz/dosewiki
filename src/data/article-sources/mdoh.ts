## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 100 mg) âThe material came on fairly rapidly. In about 30 minutes, I was intensely intoxicated, and more deeply than with MDMA. It was a glorious feeling, and beauty was everywhere enhanced. With eyes closed it felt marvelous, and it was appealing to pursue the inner experience. I did notice an internal dryness which was characteristic of MDMA, and I had similar difficulty in urinating, but not as intense as with MDMA.â

(with 120 mg) âThe colors of the market-place, of all the fresh foods, constituted a beautiful mosaic. Nothing practical, simply a real treasure to be used with individual intention and enjoyment. Everything was seen with new eyes, new meanings, faces, figures, the colors of the rainbow subconsciously individually applied. A âsoul-scapeâ. The following day very exhausted, tired, back-pain.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
This reminds me of my speculations in the discussion of both FLEA and the HOT compounds (HOT-2, HOT-7, HOT-17) where they also showed paired molecular structures with their prototypes that differ only by a single oxygen atom. Again, might there be some metabolic interconversion within the body? The immediate thought would be that the oxygen atom (the hydroxy group) might be metabolically removed, and the effects of either drug are due to the action of MDA. But the opposite direction is in many ways more appealing, the in vivo conversion of MDA to MDOH. Why more appealing? For one thing, oxidative changes are much more common in the body than reductive changes. For another, the conversion of amphetamine to N-hydroxyamphetamine is an intermediate in the conversion of amphetamine to phenylacetone, a known metabolic process in several animal species. And that intermediate, N-hydroxyamphetamine, is a material that gives the famous cytochrome P-450 complex that has fascinated biochemists studying the so-called NADPH-dependent metabolism.

I would put my money on the likelihood of MDA going to MDOH if it should turn out that the two drugs interconvert in the body. And in that case, it would be MDOH, or another metabolite on down the line that is common to both MDA and MDOH, that is the factor intrinsic to the intoxication that is produced. Human metabolic studies are needed, and they have not yet been done.

3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-hydroxyamphetamine (MDOH, MDH), also known as N-hydroxy-MDA, is an entactogen, psychedelic, and stimulant of the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes. It is the N-hydroxy homologue of MDA, and the N-desmethyl homologue of MDHMA.

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin listed the dose range as 100 to 160 mg orally and its duration as approximately 3 to 6 hours. He describes MDOH as being very psychedelic and producing increased pleasure in beauty and nature. Shulgin also mentioned several negative side effects also seen with MDMA ("Ecstasy") such as difficulty urinating and internal dryness. He has noted that the properties and effects of MDOH are very similar or near-identical to those of MDA and that MDOH might be converted into MDA in the body.
