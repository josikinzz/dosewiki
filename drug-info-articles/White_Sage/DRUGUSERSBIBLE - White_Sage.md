## Subjective Experience

White sage has a lengthy history of use as a ceremonial plant, with Native Americans
using it as incense to fend off evil spirits, to clear negative energy, and to create
sacred spaces. It has also been used medicinally across a number of civilisations.

I had used it a year or so earlier and vaguely recalled a light sedation but a harsh
uncomfortable smoke. I re-sampled it to document this more thoroughly for the
purposes of this book.

I broke the dry and brittle leaves into the bowl of a large bong. The smell had a mint-
like edge, but largely reminded me of the old sage & onion stuffing that used to arrive
on my plate at Christmas. It certainly had a pungent and strong odour, at least prior
to incineration.

```
T+0:00 I take the first hit, which is not as harsh as I recall. Indeed, given that
the smoke is thick and intense, it is quite mild. [8pm]
```
```
T+0:01 My head has lightened already, and I do feel a relaxing effect, with a
clear anxiolytic benefit. This is minor, but certain.
```

```
I repeat with two or three reasonably large hits. Via the large bong this isn’t
too bad to toke at all. It feels almost cleansing.
```
```
Strangely, the smoking ritual itself also feels pleasing, which could have
something to do with the pre-reading I have just completed on ceremonial
use.
```
```
T+0:05 I stop inhaling at this point, having taken maybe half a dozen hits over
the last five minutes. The light-headedness remains, and there is a vague
dreamy feel in play.
```
```
T+0:10 I was quite anxious at the start of this experiment, having endured a
difficult day. At least for now, however, this has dissipated. The headiness is
mild but present, and I can see how some people claim that this plant holds
meditative qualities. Physically I feel quite tranquil.
```
```
T+0:15 A relaxed mood remains, as does a little of the general ataraxy. I
continue to feel a background sedation and serenity, but expect this to slowly
drift down from here.
```
```
T+0:30 I have indeed moved towards base, although a balmy and mellow
ambience persists.
```
```
T+14:00 For the rest of the evening I felt relatively normal, but with muted
anxiety and a calmer disposition. This is quite usual during the slow unwind
from this sort of experience. The night’s sleep was disturbed, but with some
periods of deep sleep, and a period of vivid (or at least recalled) dreaming.
```
```
This morning I feel fairly standard, although perhaps a little off-key.
```
Whilst I found that this was not a ++ on the adapted Shulgin scale, as some members
of this class have been, it certainly invoked a clear psychoactive response. Overall, it
was quite pleasant for a one-off or rare occasion, but given that it contains thujone,
which has been reported as toxic to the brain, kidney, and liver, it is not one to make
a habit of.
