## Effects
The mechanism of action of modafinil is not yet fully understood. It is assumed that modafinil binds to the dopamine transporter and inhibits dopamine reuptake. Unlike other stimulants such as amphetamine or methylphenidate (Ritalin®, Concerta®), which in equivalent wakefulness-promoting doses increase neuronal activity throughout the brain, modafinil acts primarily on the brain regions responsible for controlling waking, sleep, wakefulness and vigilance (sustained attention).
Modafinil thus promotes alertness (physical and mental), increases attention and motor activity. Due to its stimulating, wakefulness-promoting properties, modafinil is consumed by healthy people as a so-called "smart drug" or "cognitive enhancer".According to user reports, modafinil has a much more subtle effect than other stimulants and does not trigger comparable states of intoxication. Modafinil causes less physical restlessness and the sleep-wake rhythm is less disturbed.
A mood-lifting and euphoric effect is controversial. According to a publication of the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA), modafinil causes psychoactive and euphoric effects, whereas various studies point to the lack of a euphoric effect.

## Dosage
The recommended daily dose when prescribed by a doctor is 200 mg at the beginning. If there is an insufficient response to this dose, a maximum daily dose of 400 mg may be administered/taken.
The long-term effect of modafinil when taken regularly and over a longer period of time has not yet been studied. If taken over a longer period of time, regular monitoring by a medical specialist is therefore recommended.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
In 2011, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended limiting the marketing authorisation for modafinil to the treatment of adults with excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. Due to the possible risks and side effects, modafinil has since not been approved for other indications, for the treatment of children and adolescents, and during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
The following side effects may occur: Headache, nervousness, palpitations, abdominal pain and/or dry mouth. In addition, modafinil can impair the effectiveness of oral contraceptives! Therefore, the use of additional contraceptive methods is recommended during intake. Further risks are cardiovascular diseases such as cardiac arrhythmias, diseases of the heart muscles, cardiac insufficiency and/or high blood pressure. Furthermore, the consumption of modafinil can have an effect on the psyche and trigger hostility, aggression ,psychoses/psychotic disorders, depression, insomnia, up to delusions and/or anxiety.
Symptoms of overdose with modafinil alone or in combination with other medicines: Insomnia; central nervous symptoms (restlessness, disorientation, confusion, agitation, hallucinations); nausea, diarrhoea; palpitations, high blood pressure, chest pain, slow heartbeat.

### Long-term Risks
Since modafinil affects the dopamine balance in the brain, among other things, there is an increased potential for physical dependence. If modafinil is consumed for the purpose of performance enhancement and promotion of alertness with the intention of being able to achieve high performance with little sleep, there is also a risk of psychological dependence.
The long-term effect of modafinil when taken regularly and over a longer period of time has been little studied so far. If taken over a longer period of time, regular monitoring by a medical specialist is therefore recommended.

## Safer Use
- Caution: The effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be impaired by the simultaneous intake of modafinil.
- Side effects such as blurred vision and dizziness may impair the ability to drive or operate machinery.
- Taking modafinil is not a substitute for sleep! Be sure to maintain good sleep hygiene.
- If you are using modafinil for cognitive enhancement, try to think of alternative strategies to improve your memory and recall. Sleep deprivation after taking modafinil in particular can impair cognitive performance.
- Take longer breaks (at least several days) between consumption.
- The effect of modafinil can last up to 10 hours. Therefore, pay attention to the time of intake.
- Remember to drink enough water. This can be forgotten during the effect of modafinil.
