**2C-C** (**2,5-Dimethoxy-4-chlorophenethylamine**) is a psychedelic phenethylamine of the 2C-x family.^[1] It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin and described in his 1991 book PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story.

In modern times, it is used as a recreational drug and an entheogen, rarely sold on the streets and almost exclusively obtained as a grey area research chemical through the use of online vendors. Therefore, it is relatively uncommon and has only a short history of human use.

Many users report that 2C-C is gentler and more sedating than other closely related psychedelic phenethylamines.

In terms of its chemistry, 2C-C is a substituted phenethylamine with methoxy groups attached to carbons R2 and R5 as well as a chlorine attached to carbon R4.

In terms of its pharmacology, 2C-C’s psychedelic effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the 5-HT2A receptor as a partial agonist. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

The effects listed below are based upon the [subjective effects index](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index) and personal experiences of [PsychonautWiki](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki#Contributors). The listed effects will rarely if ever occur all at once but heavier dosages will increase the chances and are more likely to induce a full range of effects.

**Physical effects:**

The physical effects of 2C-C can be broken down into 9 components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **[Spontaneous tactile sensations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_tactile_sensations)** - The “body high” of 2C-C can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft, all-encompassing and mild tingling sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **[Stimulation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** and **[Sedation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, the 2C-C experience begins with mild stimulation, but usually becomes very sedating as the experience progresses and lacks the distinctive energetic feeling associated with most phenethylamines. This feeling was accurately described in Alexander Shulgin’s PiHKAL as “*an intense form of relaxation.*”
- **[Nausea](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Although nausea remains present, in comparison to other phenethylamines such as 2C-E, 2C-I or 2C-B, this remains extremely mild and dissipates quickly even with higher dosages. It is perhaps one of the most physically underwhelming psychedelics out there for this reason alone.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)** and **[Motor control loss](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)** - Whilst at lower doses one may find that their bodily control is enhanced, at higher dosages it seems to become suppressed.
- **[Tactile enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Temperature regulation loss](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_loss)**
- **[Salivation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Salivation)**
- **[Increased heart rate](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**

**Cognitive effects:**

The head space of 2C-C is described by many as one which is both insightful and relatively normal in its thought processes even at moderate to high dosages.

The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes:

- **[Analysis enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Empathy, love and sociability enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_love_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as MDMA and 2C-B. They primarily manifest during the stimulating onset of the experience and dissipate once the full extent of the trip takes place.
- **[Thought acceleration](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Time distortion](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Sexual arousal](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sexual_arousal)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Thought connectivity](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Current mind state enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Current_mind_state_enhancement)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Memory suppression](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**

**Visual effects:**

*Enhancements*

2C-C presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally includes:

- **[Acuity enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**

*Distortions*

2C-C presents a full and complete array of possible visual distortions which generally includes:

- **[Drifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** *([melting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Melting), [flowing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Flowing), [breathing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#_morphing))* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and realistic in style.
- **[Tracers](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[Colour shifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of 4-AcO-DMT or Ayahuasca than that of LSD, 2C-B or 2C-I. They can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, slow and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, equally blurred and sharp in their edges and equally rounded and angular in their corners. They give off a contradictory natural and synthetic feel to them that at higher dosages. While the geometry for 2C-C has yet to be formally confirmed, it seems more likely to result in states of [Level 8B](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) visual geometry over [Level 8A](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry).

*Hallucinatory states*

2C-C produces a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. This holds particularly true in comparison to other substances within the phenethylamine family. These effects include:

- **[Transformations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations)** - In comparison to other psychedelics such as LSD, 2C-C is extremely high in hallucinations embedded within visual geometry. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.
- **[External hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations)** - 2C-C is capable of external hallucinations embedded within visual geometry. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They can be described as external in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.
- **[Machinescapes](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)**

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of 2C-C are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- **[Enhancements](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)**

**Physical health effects, potential addiction and tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational 2C-C use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the median lethal dose (LD50) is unknown. This is because 2C-C is a research chemical with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from those who have used 2C-C would suggest that there are little to no immediate or short-term negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly. The validity of these statements, however, cannot be confirmed.

The addictive potential of 2C-C has not yet been formally studied, but anecdotal evidence would suggest that 2C-C is not physically addictive. Many users describe a self-regulating quality and commonly report a tolerance build up when using the drug consecutively many days in a row. A build up in tolerance may lead to weakened effects and a diminished experience, however, this effect is nearly non-existent when consumption periods are spaced 5-7 days apart.

**Legal issues:**

- **United States:** 2C-C is listed in schedule I of section 202© of the Controlled Substances Act in the United States. This was signed into law as of July 2012 under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act.
- **United Kingdom:** 2C-C is a class A controlled substance as it is covered by the phenethylamine derivatives clause of the Misuse of Drugs Act of 1971.
- **Sweden:** 2C-C is classified as a “health hazard” as of March 1, 2005 in their regulation **SFS 2005:26**, making it illegal to sell or possess.
- **Japan:** 2C-C is controlled by the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law in Japan, making it illegal to possess or sell.
- **Australia:** Australia has a blanket ban over all substituted phenethylamines including the entire 2C-X family.

**Conclusion:**

Despite its lack of relative potency, 2C-C definitely holds up as an excellent psychedelic and is particularly useful for those who are inexperienced. Although I have yet to determine the proper dosage for this method, I would highly recommend smoking or vaporizing this compound using a standard water bong (like one used to smoke cannabis) as it delivers an intense experience which is somewhat on par with a phenethylamine-esque DMT breakthrough experience.

## SYNTHESIS
Synthesis from 2C-B. To a solution of 7.24 g 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine (2C-B) and 4.5 g phthalic anhydride in 100 mL anhydrous DMF there was added molecular sieves. After 16 h reflux, the reaction mixture was cooled and the sieves removed by filtration. The addition of a little CH2Cl2 prompted the deposition of yellow crystals which were recrystallized from EtOH. The resulting 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenyl)-2-(phthalimido)ethane weighed 7.57 g and had a mp of 141â142 Â°C. Anal. (C18H16BrNO4) C,H,N,Br.

A solution of 14.94 g of 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenyl)-2-(phthalimido)ethane and 4.5 g cuprous chloride in 300 mL anhydrous DMF was heated for 5 h at reflux. The cooled mixture was poured into 20 mL H2O that contained 13 g hydrated ferric chloride and 3 mL concentrated HCl. The mixture was maintained at about 70 Â°C for 20 min, and then extracted with CH2Cl2. After washing the pooled organic extracts with dilute HCl and drying with anhydrous MgSO4, the volatiles were removed under vacuum to provide a solid residue. This was recrystallized from EtOH to provide 12.18 g of 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-chlorophenyl)-2-(phthalimido)ethane as yellow needles that had a mp of 138â140 Â°C. Anal. (C18H16ClNO4) C,H,N,Cl.

To 60 mL absolute EtOH there was added 12.2 g 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-chlorophenyl)-2-(phthalimido)ethane and 2.9 mL of 100% hydrazine. The solution was held at reflux for 15 min. After cooling, the cyclic hydrazone by-product was removed by filtration, and the alcoholic mother liquors taken to dryness under vacuum. The residue was distilled at 145â155 Â°C at 0.05 mm/Hg to give 5.16 g of a clear, colorless oil. This was dissolved in anhydrous Et2O and treated with hydrogen chloride gas, producing 2,5-dimethoxy-4-chlorophenethylamine hydrochloride (2C-C) as white crystals with a mp of 220â221 Â°C. Anal. (C10H15Cl2NO2) C,H,N.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 24 mg) âI was at a moderately high and thoroughly favorable place, for several hours. It seemed to be a very sensual place, but without too much in the way of visual distraction.â

(with 40 mg) âThere were a lot of visualsâsomething that I had noted at lower levels. There seems to be less stimulation than with 2C-B, and in some ways it is actually sedating. And yet I was up all night. It was like a very intense form of relaxation.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
The halogens represent a small group of atoms that are unique for a couple of reasons. They are all located in a single column of the periodic table, being monovalent and negative. That means that they can be reasonably stable things when attached to an aromatic nucleus. But, being monovalent, they cannot be modified or extended in any way. Thus, they are kind of a dead end, at least as far as the 2C-X series is considered. The heaviest, iodine, was explored as the phenethylamine, as 2C-I, and as the amphetamine as DOI. These are the most potent. The next lighter is bromine, where the phenethylamine is 2C-B and the amphetamine is DOB. These two are a bit less potent, and are by far the most broadly explored of all the halides. Here, in the above recipe, we have the chlorine counterpart, 2C-C. There is also the corresponding amphetamine DOC. These are less potent still, and much less explored. Why? Perhaps because chlorine is a gas and troublesome to handle (bromine is a liquid, and iodine is a solid). The fluorine analogue is yet harder to make, and requires procedures that are indirect, because fluorine (the lightest of all the halides) is not only a gas, but is dangerous to handle and does not react in the usual halogen way. There will be mention made of 2C-F, but DOF is still unexplored.

The treatment of the 2C-B phthalimide described above, with cuprous cyanide rather than cuprous chloride, gave rise to the cyano analog which, on hydrolysis with hydrazine, yielded 2,5-dimethoxy-4-cyanophenethylamine (2C-CN). Hydrolysis of this with hot, strong base gave the corresponding acid, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-carboxyphenethylamine, 2C-COOH. No evaluation of either of these compounds has been made in the human animal, as far as I know.

**4-Chloro-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine** (commonly known as **2C-C** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) class that produces [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . It is a member of the [2C-x family](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x_family) of psychedelic phenethylamines, all of which were derived from the systematic modification of the [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) molecule.

2C-C was first synthesized by Alice C. Cheng and Neal Castagnoli Jr. in 1983 as an intermediate in a study evaluating the neurotoxicity of 6-hydroxydopamine analogs. Its activity in humans was later investigated and documented by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) in his book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) ("Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved").

Many users report that the effects of 2C-C are gentler, more relaxed, and [sedating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) than other closely related [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) such as [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) , and [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) . It is one of the least potent members of the 2C-x family, with muted visual effects and a relatively unaltered headspace.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 2C-C, and its history of human use is limited. Today, it is used for [recreational](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use) and therapeutic purposes. It is rarely sold on the streets and distributed online as a grey area [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) .

## Chemistry

2C-C or 2,5-dimethoxy-4-chlorophenethylamine is a substituted [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain. 2C-C contains methoxy functional groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 as well as a chlorine atom attached to carbon R 4 of the phenyl ring. 2C-C belongs to the 2C family of phenethylamines which contain methoxy groups on the 2 and 5 positions of the benzene ring.

## Pharmacology

2C-C's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience is the subject of ongoing scientific investigation.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** & **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, the 2C-C experience typically begins with mild stimulation, but usually becomes somewhat sedating as the experience progresses and surprisingly lacks the distinctive energetic feeling associated with most [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) . This is described in [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) as " *an intense form of relaxation.* "
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of 2C-C can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft, all-encompassing and mild tingling sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)** - Whilst at lower doses one may find that their bodily control is enhanced, at higher dosages this becomes suppressed.
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** - This compound seems to not increase heart rate as much as related substances.
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Muscle cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_cramps)** - Very high dosages of 2C-C are known to cause random muscle tightening, which can become uncomfortable.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Although nausea remains present, in comparison to other [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) such as [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , this remains relatively mild and tends to dissipate quickly. It is considered by some to be one of the most physically understated [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) known.
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component can be considered to be less intense when compared with that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and cartoon-like in style.
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry of 2C-C is more similar in appearance to that of [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) than that of [Psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , or [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) . They can be comprehensively described as unstructured in their organization, algorithmic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large, fast and smooth in motion, colorful in scheme, glossy in color, sharp in their edges and angular in their corners.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
2C-C can produce a full range of hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. However, the dose required to reach this state is significantly higher than many related 2C-x phenethylamines. These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - 2C-C is capable of producing high levels of hallucinogenic imagery, although typically only at very heavy doses. When this effect does occur, it commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in theme.
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - 2C-C is capable of external hallucinations embedded within visual geometry. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They can be described as external in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The head space of 2C-C is described by many as one which is both insightful and relatively normal in its thought processes even at moderate to high dosages. 
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are not as pronounced than those found on substances such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) .
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This [introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) dominant effect is only manifested consistently in the context of a non-social setting in which the user is alone.
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** - Relative to other psychedelics, 2C-C does not produce this effect except at very high doses. 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)** - Relative to other psychedelics, 2C-C does not produce this effect except at very high doses.
- **[Mindfulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** - Due to it's relaxing nature, some users report being able to sleep after the peak effects subsided. ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)** - This effect does not typically occur except at higher doses.
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** - This effect does not typically occur except at higher doses. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)** - In contrast to some other psychedelics, this effect does not typically occur except at very high doses.
### Combinational effects

- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis majorly intensifies and extends both the sensory and cognitive effects of 2C-C. Extreme caution should be exercised with this combination as it can also elevate the [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) risk of cannabis.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - When combined with dissociatives, the geometry, euphoria, dissociation and hallucinatory effects are often greatly enhanced. Dissociative-induced [holes, spaces, and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids) while under the influence of 2C-C have significantly more vivid visuals than dissociatives alone. It also results in more intense [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) and corresponding [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) which can develop into [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Nitrous](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nitrous)** - Nitrous oxide is commonly used in combination with psychedelics. The two are known to possess powerful cross-synergistic effects, including the capacity to send the user directly into an ["ego death"](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death) state. The speed and intensity with which this occurs is very rapid and the euphoria that can result often leads to the urge to [compulsively redose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) .
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - When combined with MDMA, the physical and cognitive effects of 2C-C become strongly amplified. The visual, physical and cognitive effects of 2C-C are also intensified with strong sensations of euphoric pleasure manifested through distinct body highs and headspaces, and uniquely colorful visuals. The synergy between these substances is unpredictable, and it is best to start with markedly lower dosages than one would take for both substances individually. This combination may increase the neurotoxic effects of MDMA based on its similarity to LSD, which has been found to increase MDMA neurotoxicity.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Alcohol can increase the disinhibiting and euphoric effects of 2C-C which lends to its use in recreational settings. It can be used in light doses to "take the edge off" a trip as well as dull its psychedelic effects in a fashion somewhat similar to benzodiazepines. However, this is not typically recommended due to alcohol’s ability to cause [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) and [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) and [physical fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue) which can negatively affect a trip if taken in moderate to high dosages. Heavy drinking is strongly discouraged as it can easily lead to black outs and unpredictable behavior.
- **[Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines)** - Benzodiazepines can, depending on the dosage, slightly to completely reduce the intensity of the cognitive, physical and visual effects of a 2C-C trip. They are very efficient at stopping ["bad trips"](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trip) at the cost of amnesia and reduced trip intensity. Caution is advised when acquiring them for this purpose due to their very high abuse and addiction potential.
- **[Psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics)** - When used in combination with other psychedelics, each substance's physical, cognitive and visual effects intensify and synergize strongly. The synergy between those substances is unpredictable, and for this reason generally not advised. If choosing to combine psychedelics, it is recommended to start with significantly lower dosages than one would take for either substance individually.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 2C-C use do not appear to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 2C-C is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with a limited history of human use.

Anecdotal reports from those who have tried this compound suggest that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (although nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be conducted to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Although no formal studies have been conducted, it is not unreasonable to assume that like psychedelics in general, 2C-C is not habit-forming and that the desire to use it can actually decrease with use.

Tolerance to the effects of 2C-C is not built almost immediately after ingestion. Similar to [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) there seems to be no apparent tolerance buildup if used repeatedly for a few days. 2C-C does however produce cross-tolerance with other serotonergic psychedelics, meaning that after the use of 2C-C all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 2C-C. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals.

2C-C is a substituted phenethylamine with psychedelic effects. It’s known for producing fairly relaxed experiences that tend to be comfortable or at least manageable in terms of physical and mental activity.

It was first synthesized in the 1980s and publicized in the 1990s, but it’s never become a popular drug. The substance remains a research chemical that’s almost exclusively purchased online. 2C-C is substantially less popular than LSD, psilocin, and even 2C-B.

## Timeline

#### Oral

Total: 4 – 6 hours

Onset: 00:30 – 01:30

A lot of users report some changes within 30 to 45 minutes, but it can take up to 1.5 hours (occasionally longer) for the psychedelic effects to become noticeable.

#### Intranasal

Total: 3 – 5 hours

Onset: 00:10 – 00:20

---

After the drug wears off it doesn’t keep people awake very long. Sleep is often possible within a few hours and people feel sober pretty fast. By the next day you’re usually normal, with the exception of potential mood changes, both positive and negative.

## Effects

#### Positives

- Open eye visuals
- Closed eye visuals
- Relaxation
- Insightful thinking
- Increased care for others
- Stimulation
- Euphoria
- Music enhancement
- Auditory hallucinations

#### Negatives

- Confusion
- Anxiety
- Nausea
- Increased heart rate
- Increased blood pressure
- Impaired coordination
- Tension

2C-C is typically viewed as a recreational and pretty relaxing psychedelic, with neither its physical nor mental effects being overwhelming or difficult at common doses. These qualities have led to some people calling it a good drug for people new to psychedelics.

There are two common views of the substance. One is that it’s a pleasant recreational and sometimes introspective or entactogenic psychedelic. The other is that it’s boring and not worth it.

A very harsh or negative view of 2C-C is pretty uncommon, so the biggest critique tends to be that it’s underwhelming.

It’s one of the most relaxing psychedelic phenethylamines. Sometimes that means it’s sedating (people occasionally even feel like they could sleep on it). Other times it’s neutral/stimulating with its energy, yet still relaxing in terms of how comfortable you feel in your body and mind. Even if it lowers your energy level or makes it nice to lie down, it’s usually still possible to get up and be active if you want to.

Words like “tranquil” and “comfortable” have been applied to the experience, though they definitely won’t apply for all users and at all doses.

Because it doesn’t really feel like a stimulant, it’s distinct from other members of the 2C-x series, the DOx series, and LSD.

**Come Up**

The come up period is the main time 2C-C can feel less comfortable. Nausea, tension, jitteriness, and restlessness are more common. They’ll usually subside in 30-60 minutes. Nausea is still pretty rare compared to other psychedelics, including other 2C-x drugs, and vomiting is very uncommon.

Its come up is sometimes compared to the initial feel of MDMA or the buzz offered by alcohol. Neither are perfect comparisons though. It simply has the potential to offer effects that feel similar to elements of those drugs, such as a pleasant mood lift, slight perception changes, a general sense of alteredness, a prosocial mindset, and a good body high.

**Visuals**

The visual changes will vary by dose and user. Common doses tend to provide noticeable and significant hallucinations, such as breathing, patterns, object movement, and colors (both enhancement of colors and hallucinating new ones).

Patterns, colors, and other effects are also frequently present when you close your eyes. The closed-eye experience can let people enter a sort of “internal world” where they feel physically comfortable, relaxed, and dissociated from their body.

However, for whatever reason, there are some users who mainly get a mood or bodily effect at common doses, not a prominent visual response.

When you reach stronger doses, it can be a pretty intense drug in terms of visual hallucinations.

**Headspace**

The substance isn’t very confusing or forceful with its effects, especially at common doses. This can be a nice quality, but the flip-side is that it’s also potentially less likely to deliver insightful and creative thinking. As a significantly altered mental state may be viewed as a key part of the psychedelic experience, some users come away feeling underwhelmed and disappointed if it’s not present during a 2C-C experience.

At common doses you’ll usually maintain your ability to communicate, though it could be moderately impaired and communication can be anxiety-provoking.

The chance of entering a psychotic or very confused state is pretty low. It’s a clear-headed psychedelic overall, but that doesn’t make paranoia, delusional thinking, and panic attacks impossible.

Even though it may often be less intense, it has the capacity to yield insightful mental states. 2C-C can make it easier to explore personal or spiritual topics with relatively low anxiety and confusion.

It also has the potential to facilitate open communicate between people. There are some prosocial and caring effects that contribute to an appreciative mental state. In this sense it has some entactogenic qualities, even if it’s not going to truly feel like an entactogen when all aspects of the experience are considered.

Erotic thinking is sometimes encountered and it may be paired with an enhancement of sexual activity. This stems from a combination of its mental effects and tactile enhancement, which can make everything from lying in a warm bed to sex to a shower more enticing. It’s still more common for people to simply feel closer to their friends or a partner in a non-sexual way.

Another effect that has sometimes been reported is an increase in laughter or an enhancement of humor.

**Physical**

The body high is usually pleasant. Some common elements include warmth, buzzing, and fuzziness. But negatives like tension or an unpleasant sensation of energy in the body can occur.

Coordination is often impaired in a sedative-like way, even to the point of experiencing heaviness in your limbs. Though lightness/floatiness are also common when moving.

A minority of users have uncomfortable periods of hot flashes and/or cold sensations, as if their temperature is fluctuating. And some portion also get a headache during or after the experience. The chance of getting a headache may be reduced if you keep up your water intake while on the drug.

## Chemistry & Pharmacology

#### Chemistry

2C-C is a substituted phenethylamine and a member of the 2C-X series, meaning it has a methoxy group at both the 2 and 5 positions, and another substitution at the 4 position.

In the case of 2C-C, the substituent at the 4 position is a chlorine atom.

The amphetamine counterpart of 2C-C is DOC.

#### Pharmacology

It’s known to function as an agonist at serotonin receptors, including 5-HT2A, a primary target for psychedelics. It also binds, albeit with a lower affinity, to 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C. Though it has some affinity for non-serotonin receptors, it’s usually too low for the binding to be relevant.

Compared to 2C-B, it has a lower selectivity for 5-HT2A over 5-HT1A, though it remains far more selective for 2A.

## History

#### 1983

It was synthesized by Alice Cheng and Neal Castagnoli Jr at the University of California, San Francisco. They made it as part of an investigation of 6-hydroxydopamine analogs, but it was only an intermediate.

#### 1991

Alexander Shulgin described its synthesis and effects in PiHKAL. The 2C-C entry in PiHKAL reported an oral dose of 20 – 40 mg and a duration of 4 – 8 hours. It was described as lacking visuals at 24 mg, but offering a “lot of visuals” by 40 mg. It was also noted to be “sedating in some ways,” though not to the point of sleep.

#### 2000s

Experience reports began showing up online and they’ve become more common over time.

#### 2005

(Lee, 2013) – Drug detection stats in Taiwan from 1991 to 2011. The paper used data from urine and non-urine drug seizure samples.

2C-C was first detected in the country in June 2005.

#### 2010s

(Vidal Gine, 2014) – 2009 to 2012 drug analysis data from Energy Control was reported.

2C-C was among those detected as an adulterant in the controlled drug market. Out of 173 analyzed samples, 2C-C was only detected once and was reportedly found alongside 25C-NBOMe in an “LSD” sample.

#### July 2012

The substance was added to Schedule 1 in the US alongside other 2C-x substances and various other drugs.

## Legality

#### United States

Schedule 1

#### Other

Australia: Illegal. There’s a blanket ban covering all 2C-x drugs and other methoxyphenethylamines.

Canada: Schedule 3

UK: Class A

## Safety

The safety of 2C-C is unknown, largely due to it being a research chemical. It’s best to use common doses, infrequently, and without combinations.

Among the likely physical risks are increased cardiovascular stress and a lower seizure threshold, making the drug contraindicated in people with a cardiovascular disorder or epilepsy.

Some of the likely psychological risks include temporary psychosis, confusion, panic attacks, and anxiety. It’s unwise to use the drug if you have a mental health condition.

#### Risky Combos (list may not be complete)

- Other psychedelics
- Stimulants
- Tramadol

2C-C, also known as 4-chloro-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine and 2C families. It is taken orally.
2C-C was first described in the scientific literature by Alice Cheng and Neal Castagnoli in 1984. It was described in greater detail by Alexander Shulgin in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved). The drug is Schedule I of section 202(c) of the Controlled Substances Act in the United States, signed into law as of July 2012 under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act.

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists 2C-C's dose range as 20 to 40 mg orally and its duration as 4 to 8 hours. Its onset is described as delayed compared to 2C-B and as being 1.5 to 2 hours. In addition to oral administration, a single report of 20 mg by intravenous injection was described as overwhelming, with effects peaking after 5 minutes and lasting perhaps 15 minutes. The effects of 2C-C have been reported to include psychedelic visuals, sensual enhancement, stimulation, sedation, and relaxation, among others. Its stimulating effects are said to be less than those of 2C-B and it is said to be sedating in some ways.

## Interactions

2C drugs like 2C-C are known to be metabolized by the monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes MAO-A and MAO-B. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as phenelzine, tranylcypromine, moclobemide, and selegiline may potentiate the effects of 2C drugs like 2C-C. This may result in overdose and serious toxicity.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

2C-C acts as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors. It also binds to the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor with 15-fold lower affinity than for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. The drug shows little or no affinity for the monoamine transporters (MATs) and shows very weak or negligible monoamine reuptake inhibition. It shows high affinity for the rat trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), but only weak affinity for the mouse TAAR1.
In contrast to many other psychedelics, 2C-C, as well as 2C-P and certain 2C NBOMe analogues, has shown reinforcing effects in rodents. It produces dose-dependent conditioned place preference (CPP) in mice and self-administration in rats. These findings suggest that 2C-C may have misuse potential. The mechanism by which these effects are produced is unknown. However, 2C-C was found to decrease dopamine transporter (DAT) expression and to increase DAT phosphorylation in the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) similarly to methamphetamine in rodents. Decreased DAT expression may result in reduced dopamine reuptake, while DAT phosphorylation is associated with dopamine reverse transport and efflux, in turn increasing extracellular dopamine levels.
2C-C has also been found to produce neurotoxicity at high doses in rodents, which appears to be mediated via neuroinflammation.
