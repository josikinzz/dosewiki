**N-Methyl-N-isopropyllysergamide** (also known as **methylisopropyllysergamide** , **Lamide** and **MiPLA** ) is a lesser-known novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) class. MiPLA is structurally related to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and likely has a similar mechanism of action, working primarily by binding to the [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) -2A [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) in the brain. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

MiPLA was first discovered by Albert Hoffman as a part of the original structure-activity research for [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] It has recently been researched in greater detail by by a team led by David E. Nichols at Purdue University. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] MiPLA and its effects are also mentioned in Alexander Shulgin's "Pharmacology Notes #9" and "Pharmacology Notes C". According to Shulgin, human subjects administered MiPLA at doses of 180–300 μg experienced LSD-like psychedelic effects, making it about two- to threefold less potent than LSD.

User reports describe the effects of MiPLA as similar to those of LSD but with some notable differences. It has been described as more mentally and physically oriented than LSD but with a less introspective headspace, accompanied by subtle visuals. It also has a notably shorter duration at around 6 hours and is generally described as less anxiety-provoking than LSD and other lysergamides.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of MiPLA. It is highly advised to use harm reduction practices when using this substance.

## Chemistry

The chemical name of MiPLA is methylisopropyllysergamide. MiPLA belongs to a class of organic compounds known as lysergamides, which are a subclass of ergolines (derivatives of the alkaloids found in the ergot fungus). The most prominent member of the lysergamides is [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , lysergic acid diethylamide.

MiPLA is a structural isomer of LSD. Like LSD, the chemical structure of MiPLA is based on the lysergic acid amide structural skeleton. However, whereas LSD has two ethyl groups bound to the amide nitrogen, MiPLA is substituted with a methyl and isopropyl group. MiPLA is a chiral compound with two stereocenters at R 5 and R 8 . The differences in psychoactivity between the stereoisomers have not yet been investigated.

MIPLA and its ethylisopropyl homologue are the only simple N,N-dialkyl lysergamides that approach the potency of LSD itself, being around 1/3-1/2 the potency of LSD, while all other dialkyl analogues tested (dimethyl, dipropyl, methylethyl etc.) are only around 1/10 as potent as LSD, although some N-monoalkyl lysergamides such as the *sec* -butyl and *t* -butyl derivatives were also found to show an activity profile and potency comparable to LSD, and the mono-isopropyl derivative is only slightly weaker than MIPLA. Apart from its lower potency, the hallucinogenic effects of methylisopropyllysergamide are similar to those of LSD itself, and the main use for this drug has been in studies of the binding site at the 5-HT 2A receptor through which LSD exerts most of its pharmacological effects.

## Pharmacology

As with its structurally related lysergamides, MiPLA principally acts as a 5-HT2A partial agonist, through which it exerts its psychedelic effects. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience is unclear.

Owing to similarities in chemical structure, MiPLA and LSD have highly similar binding profiles at monoamine receptors (i.e. [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) ). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

One study found MiPLA to fully substitute for LSD in rats, with about half the potency of the training drug. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Subjective effects

MiPLA is commonly reported to be significantly shorter in its duration and less uncomfortable in both its [negative physical side effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Uncomfortable_physical_effects) and general [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) .

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - Similar to LSD, MiPLA is considered to be primarily stimulating in nature. This is in distinction to other, more commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) which are more consistent in producing [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) and [relaxedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) .
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of MiPLA can be described as proportionally intense in comparison to its accompanying visual and cognitive effects. It behaves as a pleasurable, fast-moving, sharp and location specific tingling sensation. For some, it is manifested spontaneously at different unpredictable points throughout the experience, but for most it maintains a steady presence that rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. In comparison to LSD, MiPLA is a little less sharp in the tingling sensations it produces as but is otherwise essentially indistinguishable.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - Physical euphoria on MiPLA is not as consistent as it is with substances like [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) or [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) , and can just as easily manifest as physical discomfort without any apparent reason.
- **[Changes in felt bodily form](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_bodily_form)** - This effect is often accompanied by a sense of warmth or [unity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness#Unity_between_the_self_and_specific_external_systems) and usually occurs during and up to the peak of the experience or directly afterward. Users can feel as if they are physically part of or conjoined with other objects. This is usually reported as feeling comfortable and peaceful in its sensations.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - Feelings of enhanced tactile sensations are consistently present at moderate levels throughout most MiPLA trips.
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)**
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)** - Generally mild in comparison to traditional [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) .
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning)** - This effect is significantly less pronounced than it is with [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) and its related compounds, the four-position [substituted tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine#List_of_substituted_tryptamines) .
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Increased salivation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_salivation)**
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - The possibility of seizures is extrapolated from the seizures that have been reported following the use of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . They are thought to mainly be a risk in those who are genetically predisposed to them, particularly while accompanied by physically taxing conditions such as dehydration, fatigue or undernourishment. ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) , [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Morphing) and [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed yet cartoon-like in appearance. The distortions are slow and smooth in motion and fleeting in their appearance. This is nearly identical in appearance to the visual drifting which occurs under the influence of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) .
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**

- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The [visual geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_geometry) evoked by MiPLA can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [4-HO-MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-MET) than [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as primarily intricate in complexity, algorithmic in form, unstructured in organization, brightly lit, colourful and cartoonish in scheme, organic in feel, flat in shading, soft in its edges, large in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, either angular or round in its corners, non-immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity. At higher dosages, it consistently results in states of [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) visual geometry over [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) .
 
In comparison to LSD specifically, MiPLA's geometry tends to be more rounded in its corners, slightly softer in its edges, warmer in hue, and slightly less intricate in its form. Aside from this, it is otherwise identical in its appearance.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
MiPLA is capable of producing a full range of low and high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is a less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) but considerably more likely to when compared to that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . This can feel similar to the hallucinations which occur with [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) but tends to occur almost exclusively at [heavier](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) [doses](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage) . Some of these effects include:
 
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)**
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - This effect is very consistent in dark environments at appropriately high dosages. They can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in style and occasionally of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme.
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is consistent in its manifestation and [outrospection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Outrospection) dominant.
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This effect is experienced exclusively on low or [threshold](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage#Threshold) dosages and feels less forced than it does with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) .
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational MiPLA use has not been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because MiPLA is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

The current body of anecdotal reports suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

However, as is the case for LSD, it is possible that MiPLA can act as a potential trigger for those with underlying psychiatric conditions. Those with a personal or family history of mental illness are generally advised not to use this substance, particularly outside of a supervised medical setting.

It is strongly recommended that one uses [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Overdose

The LD 50 of MiPLA is unknown. Adverse psychological reactions may be more likely to occur at higher doses. Some of these include [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and (more rarely) [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . Medical attention is usually only needed in the case of severe psychotic episodes or “fake acid” (a counterfeit substance such as [25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) or [DOx](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOx) ). Administration of [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) can help to relieve the negative psychological effects of MiPLA.

### Dependence and abuse potential

Like other [serotonergic psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelics) , MiPLA is believed to have a low potential for abuse and dependence. This is owing to its structural and pharmacological similarities with [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . See [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD#Dependence_and_abuse) to learn more about the dependence and abuse potential of LSD. It should be noted that all claims related to the abuse potential of MiPLA are preliminary and based on anecdotal (as opposed to clinical) evidence and should be interpreted with caution.

As with LSD, tolerance to the effects of MiPLA forms almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it is assumed to take about 5-7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 14 days to be return to baseline (in the absence of further consumption).

Due to its activity at the 5-HT 2A receptor, MiPLA produces cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of MiPLA all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of MiPLA. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Legal status

MiPLA is not scheduled under the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. It is considered to exist in a legal grey area throughout most of the world, meaning that it might not be specifically illegal but individuals may still be charged for its possession under certain circumstances such as under analogue laws and with the intent to sell or consume.

- **Austria** : MiPLA is technically not illegal but it may fall in the NPSG (Neue-Psychoaktive-Substanzen-Gesetz Österreich) as an analogue of LSD. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Germany** : MiPLA is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.
- **Switzerland** : MiPLA can be considered a controlled substance as a defined derivative of Lysergic Acid under Verzeichnis E point 263. It is legal when used for scientific or industrial use.
- **United States** : MiPLA is not scheduled but may be considered to be an analogue of LSD, which would make it illegal to possess for human consumption under the Federal Analogue Act. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
