Another novel lysergamide!


Dose is more like 0.5-1mg and effects more dreamy and less psychedelic than LSDs.


edit: There's a 1.25mg report on UKCR, [https://www.ukchemicalresearch.org/Thread-LSM-775-1-25mg](https://www.ukchemicalresearch.org/Thread-LSM-775-1-25mg).


PS: Coming from the same people who brought us AL-LAD, LSZ, 1P-LSD, ETH-LAD, so this is indeed legit *snip*.

Fascinating!!! That low blood pressure feeling that the trip reporter described didn't exactly make me want to run out and grab this one, but nevertheless fascinating!

Centralized..


@ Blood pressure: I had / still have issues with BOHX compounds apparently lowering blood pressure though not reliably. Maybe Shulgin reporting this on BOHD (IIRC) was merely a fluke.


@ LSM: Yeah probably has been considered for a longer while. We are not likely to see lysergamides even less potent than this one. But I guess it all depends on the laws that have to be evaded and the cost-efficiency.

I knew this  was made a while ago in a trial run but, the manufacturer said it was 1/10th the potency of lsd and not really worth pursuing. I would like to see more current reports as that is the only one I can find. And it was written when this compound was not available for sale. 

I don't really want to drop 100$for 10mgs of crystal when I'd be lucky to get 11 doses out if it. 

Also I would assume that the body load from a 1mg dose is not very comfortable. I get tingling in my fingers from 150 ugs of any lysergamine so it could be quite uncomfortable at that dose.

I've modded out some source/vendor related matters. I don't really care what the truth about those matters is because we do not allow vendor discussion. What is in the OP is already pushing that limit, any further focus on that topic will be diverted back to our original topic: the substance LSM.


Please refrain from cluttering this thread with peripheral and content-empty matters like vendors or how interested you are in this. We appreciate that plenty of people may become interested in this, but keep in mind that people will use this thread as an information deposit rather than squabbles / overly social or guideline defiant discussion.


We do have the social threads. Use the forum appropriately. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) thnx

Is it possible to lay LSM on blotter? Or are the doses to high to fit on one square?

There's stuff like 5mg DOM blotters, so it's certainly possible.

Golden age of lysergamides ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Yes, I'd say 5 mg is about max you can fit on a blotter. But mind you, it's not going to be one of the really, really paperthin blotters you can sometimes get LSD on. To have 5 mg on there it needs to be more thick and "cardboard"-like. It's my experience anyway.

Just got an answer from a vender, LSM is not very soluble in methanol and ethanol. If I can find the right dropper bottle, I might test this out.

I would figure that lsp would have been persured instead of this.

Acetonitrile is what I was thinking. 

Surprised that lsp was not persured instead of this, Lower dosages.

This is probably orthostatic hypotension. There is a chance that this molecule have strong dopaminergic + Alpha-2 activity.

I've tried a really low dose of LSM a few month ago. It was something  between 400-500ug..I did not experience any symptomps indicating low  blood pressure or other unwanted side-effects.. But the effects in  general were nothing to write home about. I was at ++. It is definetely  psychedelic and had the distinct "lysergamide-feeling" but no noteworthy  sensory effects or profound psychedelia, well at this dosage..  I was  told that this isn't going to change much with increasing dosage but I  didn't try it myself and I am still curious if this holds true with  doses >1,5mg.. 

If I continue my experimentation with this stuff I will report back but my first experience wasn't actually encouraging ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

How you feel is a really poor way to tell blood pressure esp. high blood pressure can be totally symptomless. If you want to check blood pressure get a sleeve and check it - esp with psychedelics feelings can relate to other things like emotion or be psychosomatic etc. I suspect LSM-775 is more likely to raise it slightly inline with other psychedelics. I had no concern or particular thoughs about blood pressure but did note nausea on it.

I was lucky enough to get some of this maybe 3 or so months a go and found it an interesting experience; some people like above just found it mild and didn't pursue it up. One person I have spoken to who took high doses was very keen and suggested it had effects at the opiate receptors - personally as with blood pressure I think one has to be careful about guess and complex actions through only subjective experience. But he was right it was worthwhile. I think you need to take a hefty dose to get the real nature of it.

I only just heard a vendor made it available - if it's not as blotter it is soluble in something like vodka. There was an old paper suggesting strong solutions didn't keep so worth blottering and drying; I fan dried it with a dehumidifier running in the dark; full dry in short order and then I would guess fairly stable again - keep away from tap water as ever.

I'll put my trip report up later.

Report up - like I say I think the dose is really 1mg or more (know one person was keen to pursue it higher; shame he's not put his rather interesting observations on it here) but whilst it isn't going to compete with LSD and I got quite a lot out of it; the sedate character is rather unusual and although there was some nausea it was more worthwhile and distinct than LSZ

Want to point out that (while I have no experience with LSM yet) sedation with lysergamides is not unheard of, just look at LSA-containing seeds. Lethargic woozy high dreams... is that not a possible description for both LSA's as well as morphine?


Considering there are no lysergamides with micromolar affinity for opioid receptors - that I know of - it is pretty unlikely that modifying a diethyl amide into the morpholide would suddenly lend it that property. I would need to see some seriously compelling evidence to suspect that.


Not really sure what lethargic dreamy trips from pharmacologically different drugs share in action, if necessarily anything. The 'how you feel is a poor way to actually tell' sentiment is a good one, one that I would echo. Nevertheless, I am interested to hear if the sedated feeling is anything like that of LSA-seeds.


@LSP being more likely: it would not be UK legal, would it? I think "Lysergide and other N-alkyl derivatives of lysergamide" is in the misuse of drugs act, and LSP would be covered.


**edit:** Additionally: reports of unusually unreliable potency and instability in solution (degradation into inactive iso-LSD) which logically accounts for said unreliability?? That makes me suggest that you be extra stingy with how you treat this substance. Use desiccants, invariably... avoid making an aqueous solution unless you plan to consume it quickly or evaporate it onto some kind of carrier (in which case don't make your solution so aqueous).

This... There's still debates going on that MXE hits kappa+u opioid receptors, but anyone who's done MXE can and will tell you it defintely doesn't....

I got some of this in the mail a few days ago and made blotter dosed around 1.1-1.2 mg. Today I had the chance to try it and took 1 hit. I was alone throughout the trip. I have experience with various psychedelics. I've tried LSD, 1p-LSD, AL-LAD, ETH-LAD, LSZ, HBWR, and other psychedelics.


I started feeling it pretty quickly. It has a fast come up. It usually takes me at least 2 1/2 hours to reach the peak of a lysergamide trip, but I was peaking within an hour.


About 10 minutes after I took it I noticed a body high and some nausea. My vision started to look a little acidy. Things looked softer and colors were more vibrant. I laid on the couch listening to Bardo Pond and as I was coming up there was a lot of music enhancement.


As the effects became stronger I noticed some sound distortion. I heard a lot of strange whooshing sounds. Colors looked very earthy, almost sepia toned, but still very rich and vibrant. It seemed very "natural". It felt very dreamy and sedating. It was pretty visual. I noticed a lot of size and shape distortion and saw fractal patterns. I've read that the visual and psychedelic effects of LSM are weak, but they were very prominent for me. All my senses were enhanced. It has a very sensual feeling like acid.


Unfortunately the nausea started to become very unpleasant and the sickness became overwhelming. My heart was beating fast and I became very sweaty. I felt like I might pass out. I tested my blood pressure and it was high. I tried to throw up but couldn't.


I went downstairs and laid on the couch for a while and the sedative effect was very strong. I was drifting in and out of consciousness. I haven't tried dissociatives or opioids, so I can't say how similar it is in effect, but it was much different from other psychedelics I've tried. I was experiencing very bad nausea the whole time and it was extremely unpleasant.


Laying there on the verge of passing out and feeling like I had to throw up felt extremely similar to being way too drunk. I couldn't wait for it to be over. I ate some ginger before the trip but it didn't help at all. Whenever i got up and moved around i felt very sick so I just laid on the couch for a long time and drifted in and out of consciousness. I put a trash can next to the couch in case I had to throw up.


After about 2 hours of laying there I suddenly had to vomit. Afterwards I felt slightly better but still pretty bad. 


I started feeling a little better after a few hours but the positive effects didn't ever really outweigh the feelings of sickness. At least it doesn't last as long as acid.


LSM is the most unique lysergamide I've tried. It's more like LSZ than anything else I've tried. It felt more like a tryptamine than other lysergamides do. There was a lot of spatial distortion.


Overall it was definitely not worth it. LSM is unique but for the most part it was a horrible experience. It was pretty psychedelic but the body load was much worse than any other psychedelic I've tried. It was so bad I threw away the rest of my LSM while I was tripping. It's basically like drinking way too much but also being on acid at the same time.


2c-e, mushrooms, mescaline, and HBWR have given me uncomfortable amounts of nausea before but none of them come anywhere close to LSM. I really wouldn't recommend trying it, but if you do, you should start with a low dose. It's going to be sold as 1000mcg blotter. I would recommend taking no more than half a hit to try it out.

Interesting, cj18. Do you think that ondansetron, or maybe something like diphenhydramine, could possibly have helped enough to make it a worthwhile experience?

I don't know. The body load was so bad I really doubt anything could get rid of it, but I don't have any experience with anti-nausea medication. Ginger didn't help. If it weren't for the nausea it would definitely be a worthwhile experience but I'm not willing to try LSM again.

Damn, sounds harsh, cj187. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif) Thanks for the report. It's definitely not looking too great to me right now... but the "more like a tryptamine than other lysergamides" sentiment is somewhat interesting.

It was an interesting experience. I agree with Sir Ron Pib that it feels like it could be a natural plant entheogen. It somehow reminded me of 5-meo-dmt.


I'm wondering if I took a higher dose than I thought. Reports I've read made it sound like LSM is not very visual, but I was pretty impressed by the visuals. There was a quite a bit of distortion of size and shape and distance, and colors looked very beautiful. There was a lot of auditory distortion too. I didn't weigh out the powder when I got it so it's possible that I got more than I ordered.

I dunno, for some reason I really want to try this one.  I've never really been to excited about the other lysergamides (although I'd like to try ETH-LAD)...but this one really peaks my interests.  Sounds like a morning glory seed trip to me in every way.  Sign me up please!

Seems like making this is a waste of good lsd. The price is really high for something you need almost mg or more for a dose. I don't know why they would make this instead of, pro lad, lsb, or lsp ( which might not be much better). I could only imagine how bad the nausea would have been from ingesting that much material.

It's not a waste of LSD, it doesn't require LSD to make (I assume not anyway).  But yeah, I'd have preferred any of those 3 you mentioned too (especially PRO-LAD).  Still it's exciting someone is making all these lysergamides that only existed as a sparkle in our eyes before.

Yeah, I'd prefer any of those too. I have a hunch that LSP and/or LSB are going to be complete winners. I did think that about LSZ too, though, and it's the only lysergamide I didn't like. I think it's a safe bet, that PRO-LAD is going to be something very, very close to ETH-LAD and AL-LAD.


I think the reason they haven't synthesized any of the mentioned, is because there's probably some difficulty in producing a large batch. As I understood it, scaling up ETH-LAD was rather difficult too, and it did  take them quite a while to get it right.


I'm still not sure if I'll get some LSM just to have it in the collection, it doesn't sound too exciting.

So what happens to the morpholide ring in your body? Does it do what i think it does and get opened up at the oxygen, or does it stay intact?

I wonder if this was synthesized as a way to salvage a failed synth of some other lysergamide? It doesn't make a lot of commercial sense to synth this because of it's low potency, and it's - let's say "off the beaten path" effects profile. I'll be surprised if we ever see this molecule again once it's gone, so it's a pretty special opportunity for collectors and seekers of the exotic and rare.


I'd definitely give this a try if it came my way, but not sure I'm ready to commit to an order of it.


So far it seems (to me) like the most interesting lysergamides have been r6 subbed ones like ETH-LAD and AL-LAD. It would be pretty great to see PRO-LAD some day, and maybe even PARGY-LAD (whether or not the previous batch was real). I wonder if r6 halogen subbed lysergamides would be possible? I seem to remember TIHKAL mentioning flouroeth-LAD.

@rave23: Not sure if that's easy to say, but I think the morpholiNe ring may undergo one of several metabolisms, some major and some minor... total deamination and detachment of that ring / cleavage of C-N bond also so opening near the nitrogen [seems like the nitrogen will be a much more reactive position] / possibly involving N-oxidation of that same nitrogen... but who knows, morpholinamides like these may be rather special undergoing some conjugation or other intermediate states not possible with the more simple compounds like morpholine on its own..

Are you just curious? Cause I think it won't be a big enough dose anyway to worry about freeroaming morpholine..


@perpetualdawn:

Hmm yeah will easily go into synth discussion, but rather than 'failed' experiments which probably tend to yield a lot of gunk you really don't wanna continue with I guess normally it would have been somewhat likely that availability of reagents revealed an opportunity. We also will avoid source discussion but I think they are professional enough that this wouldn't be true and it just might be a side project. Also may involve UK laws... so many find UK and their laws so relevant and UK has big history with RCs of course. Just one of those things.

I was told by the manufacturer that adding a morpholide ring dramatically decrease potency. And this was discussed over a year ago before 1p-lsd was released. Basically he said one you remove the diethyamide the potency and efectivity drops dramatically. So its been around for a while but was just now released. I haven't seen it in the UK nor anyone offering UK customers access that I know of. If they made blotters I might try it, but no way I'm buying that much crystal for something that is rare and quite special, but not special enough for me. This took a skilled chemist to make so it is amazing its available.

The diethyl on the amide (i.e. LSD) was of course first found to be great and potent, then with LSZ, most specifically the R,R enantiomer, it was found that there is an optimal way for the "antlers" to stick out, namely quite lateral, by constraining them and checking which form is primarily active.


With the morpholide, you also basically bind/constrain the diethyl antlers together, but at the tip so that you are basically shaping them in a relatively unfortunate way: not lateral. LSD-Pip and LSD-Pyr will probably be similar in these respects but worse. Of course the reality is not this oversimplified and each of these chemicals has characteristics of its own. By making an azetidine or morpholine bridge you change the whole thing, you cannot magically constrain without actual modification.


I must say though, that I wonder about the 2,6-dimethylmorpholide, the methyls would still give you that lateral antler vibe : P


The inferior binding to 5HT2A also does not explain the reported side-effects, that would just reduce efficacy and potency, and as consequence subjective intensity... Instead, it may be more promiscuous in binding to other receptors compared to LSD, but don't really have an initial clue which.

Yes this is how I interpreted the reports as well; it's binding less efficiently to 5HT2A, because of the clumsy morpholide in the place of the diethyl (which is shown to be the critical spot for 5HT2A docking, like you said) - but maybe remaining efficient on other receptors, so that the effects are something like acid with less 5HT2A action. Acid with the "trippy" knob turned down.


Great info Solipsis

Reports of both the effects and potency of this one are strongly reminiscent of natural LSAs a la hawaiian baby woodrose or morning glory seeds. 


I'm leaning towards the suspicion that the morpholide is opening up and maybe getting lopped off. Consider that ergometrine--one of the more powerfully psychoactive LSAs found in natural sources--is the N-isopropanolamide, and that cleavage at the N a second time could produce the unsubstituted LSA ergine, which is the most abundant LSA in natural sources. 


We could also explain the relatively higher active dose by only partial metabolism to an active compound. 


Which isn't necessarily a bad thing--LSA is powerful stuff, and actually gave me the best trip of my lifetime. 


But that also bodes VERY poorly for the bodyload--some psychedelics cause nausea on the comeup, or induce a purge... but in my experience of LSA, even during those moments of insight and clarity in the best and most productive trips... The nausea is always there. Not in the background. You don't forget about it. You just *choose to ignore it* .

I guess coz it's related to ergine which has clearly been influential - be interested to know if it's similar. Personally AL/ETH are worthwhile if you like LSD

Tuned in to see how this was fairing - surprised there isn't more interest but interested by your comments so thanks; I am not sure I would call the bodyload that bad for the most part but you can certainly feel it - nausea as such I don't worry too much about - it's common with many right up to ayahuasca and Iboga which are clearly amazing and a small price to pay; ayahuasca made me see the whole nausea issue a bit different

LSD is perfect and I am not going to pretend it's going to anything like as good for the majority but it's something different to LSD makes it interesting - 1P-LSD/LSD are very available if people want those. I am not really convinced nausea is related to dose - 1mg is still tiny by most standards


I think Xorkoth is right LSD isn't the staring material although the precusor very likely could make LSD instead. I would so love to see PRO-LAD but I think it is an order of magnitude harder to pull off - we never thought we would see these lysergamides even come to market so it's still a wonder

The $ concern is valid in that ergoline precursors are (relatively) much harder to get, and much more expensive in bulk, than... well, pretty much any other drug precursor. Also lysergamide chemistry is tedious and difficult--it requires significantly more expertise, time, and equipment, than the simple phenethylamines, tryptamines, artlcyclohexylamines, etc. there's a reason this stuff doesn't get pumped out of China like everything else. 


Due to all this, given that there is always finite precursor, time, and manpower, it would make more sense economically to go for an equipotent analogue rather than something which requires ten times the dose. 


I'm glad that it was made, because it's so different. But I'm sure it was mostly made only because there were previously disputed accounts over its potency--though it was known to be less potent, there was significant variation in its reported strength. 


I've also been told that the lab which produces this stuff won't be 

able to distribute future batches at the current (relatively fair) price point.

LSB (R-sec-butyl) and LSP (pentan-3-amine) are similar in potency to LSD. MIPLA is 1/2 the potency.

Precusor price is one thing but if x is wildy more complex and expensive than y in production, final dosage might not be the deciding factor; presume the decision to make it must have be viable and from production to end sale there's finiancial leeway somehow but I don't know - seems you have more info than me - if this is a one off affordable run I am glad I tried an obscure item. Your proposition of the morpholide undergoing metabolism, (effectively potenitally being a prodrug) I hadn't considered. No idea of the feasability of this but an interesting speculation at least.

The morpholide undergoing metabolism leading to what, ergine? I can't think of anything related that would be so potent that the minor metabolism leading to it would yield an active metabolite dose...?

If they have made eth lad which is the hardest synth of the 4 lysergamine out now,  I don't think that prolad would be more difficult to make. Whether it's worth the cost is a whole another story. 

 I think the lab made it to see if  the from switch the diethyamide "antlers" to a morpholide ring affected potency. It seems alot of shulgin notes on activity levels are a little off. Al lad is a little less potent than shulgin reported and a few others as well.

I don't think it was just for the purpose to discover if "the switch from diethyamide "antlers" to a morpholide ring affected potency" - because the quantities available far exceed what would have been needed to answer that question. But maybe they want the whole world to see the answer to that question. Or maybe it's just fun to make something new and unleash it on the world! Anyways, I'll bet they're loosing money on this one so big kudos for doing it.


I hope we see PRO-LAD, it seems one of the more intriguing/promising ones on the horizon. I'm also cheering for flouro-eth-lad.

I love AL-LAD and 1P-LSD and it's hard not to just spend the money on those or LSD. But this could be interesting. I might grab 10 mg and wait and see what other people say about it, I didn't like ETH-LAD so I am not going to rush out and grab a lot no matter how limited edition it may be. I don't want to miss out like I did with LSZ though either. There is such limited info for a drug that's available.

well if eth lad took nearly a year to make enough stock to last for a little whilee, i would figure flouro-eth-lad would be even more difficult then eth lad itself which is a super hard synthesis. i wonder if the flouro would make it more potent? i kinda doubt that though seems the more stuff you add to or change the lsd structure you lose potency.

re the prodrug idea. I have spoken to someone whos done LSA/ergine/MGS and LSM-775 and said they prefered the later. I take this to mean they weren't either the same or entirely different. could be it's not a prodrug but simply has a similar range of affinities.

How would I measure this out safely if I want to take 1 milligram dose (or less)? I have a milligram scale but it's a cheap one that works well for 10mg+. I have 50mg of material. Liquid measurement or? I don't know if it would be stable in solution though? I think that is not enough material to lay a sheet of 500 microgram doses would it be? Cause with blotter don't you need to lay like 10 sheets in one go for it to be accurate? As you can see I am confused since I've never had a powder so potent. Almost worried I could absorb a big dose on my skin or from breathing it if I'm not careful.

I wouldn't keep it suspended in solution any longer than you have to.


If you don't have any desire to split doses (ie. use 0.75mg, assuming you make .5mg unit doses) you can dissolve in methanol and use a dropper or pipette to lay on a substrate (blotter if you like, or sugar cubes, or anything). The only disadvantage is that the material will not dissolve evenly over each unit of substrate you lay it on, so you can't reliably split doses in a smaller fashion than your initial chosen unit.


Another option is to dissolve it in de-ionized water, create appropriately dosed icecubes, store in freezer. Or just dissolve in methanol, measure out a few doses using a pipette or dropper, and evaporate the rest of the methanol to recover the solid product.


I wouldn't try to lay blotter with such a small volume--even with larger quantities it's still a delicate technique that takes practice and involved waste.


Don't worry about absorbing it through your skin--you can't. It's not possible even with LSD in insanely large quantities. It's a complete myth. However, you can easily absorb product through any mucus membranes that it comes into contact with. This means do not touch your mouth or eyes before washing your hands.


But this stuff just isn't that potent. Sure, it's still a lot more potent than most people are used to handling, but it's an order of magnitude less so than LSD--more in line with DOx or NBOMEs. Meaning, don't spill, and don't leave anything unaccounted for, and obviously don't eyeball. But you don't have to be paranoid about a breathmask and goggles or anything.


edit: test your scale's accuracy--most common pocket scales are accurate to somewhere +/- 4mg. Some are better. I wouldn't use less than ~20mg of product, but you don't necessarily need to weigh and dissolve all 50mg. (Unless by "accurate to" you're saying that you have a scale that only displays to 0.01 grams ie 10mg. In which case, you simply can't use it for something like this--buy another scale: there are cheap pocket scales that read to the single milligram or a tenth of a milligram, and which can generally be trusted within a few mg +/- displayed reading... so long as you check the calibration to ensure that this is the case.)

Thanks for the info. I'm used to making 1mg etizolam doses. I go about this by weighing out 50mg, dissolving that in 50mL of 99% isopropyl alcohol, and then dosing 1mL with a pipette onto healthy buckwheat crackers and then storing after the alcohol evaporates. It has proven to be very accurate (and etizolam is tasteless too, so I get a healthy dose of magnesium with every unhealthy dose of sedation). I'd want to keep my stuff in the freezer for long term storage though because I won't power through doses like I do with etizolam. 


Do you know if LSM would dissolve in this isopropanol I'm used to using? I'm guessing it would for sure, I am just not into chemistry too much. I will have to think of an appropriate substrate, that can be frozen, but if I have to move then the ice cubes would melt so that could be an issue. I could definitely do this with sugar cubes, but perhaps I could contrive of something more suitable for long term storage.


I could weigh 10 milligrams and dissolve in 10mL of isopropanol, then dose one substrate with a mL, then let the rest evaporate and just take back my material. Maybe something like that. Will trip on eth-lad next time and think about this. I could even try to dose larger-sized capsules that are fastened vertically, and allow the solvent to slowly evaporate leaving LSM residue on the capsules.

Is leaving it in ethanol solution really that bad? I've had 1p-LSD suspended in everclear for over a year now with no noticeable loss of potency or discoloration - so, I hope not lol!

Alcohol, whether ethanol or isopropanol will act as an anti-oxidant. It's best to use anhydrous alcohol as well or as high of a concentration as possible, water is likely to cause oxidization. If kept in a browned glass container and away from UV light, I would assume it should last quite a long time. Due to the potency, if you trust your vendors weight accuracy then I would suggest putting it all into solution if you don't have a microgram scale, a mg scale can have a +/-2 mg error rate usually and 10mg scales can be off by more than that. Measuring in liquid volume is simple and effective.

I have a small, thick HDPE container with a pippette that used to contain GBL. That should be good, and knowing the mass isn't a problem. Could use isopropanol 99%.


But I heard LSM degrades in solution, do they mean when it's just in water? And wouldn't freezing help keep the LSM alive and well too?

Dissolving anything in solution means increasing reactive rate--I'm not sure if any actual tests of LSD degradation have occurred in alcohols, but would still expect it to occur under similar circumstances to LSD in (de-ionized) water. Alcohol is a protic solvent. 


In any case, degradation of LSD itself isn't nearly as much of an issue as most people think, except in the case of chlorine in tap water. 


I don't think LSM degradation has ever actually been tested--at least not as far as I'm aware. I would expect it to be fairly labile, however. 


Leaving it in solution is *probably* fine--it's just hard to say for how long, and whether loss of potency might eventually become noticeable. Especially since this is something of a novelty item and might not last forever, I imagine many people want to keep some tucked away for possibly many years. It doesn't make much sense to me to do this in solution--I wouldn't store any chemical that way with such a long-term perspective, even the very stable ones like phenylethylamines. 


But this is maybe more about an abundance of caution. Chances are--unless your solution is contaminated with something reactive, or unless you store it very badly ie. Excessive exposure to light and heat--you'd still have an active product even years later. Though who knows how much would be lost along the way. Freezing it--or even just keeping it cold ie. In the fridge--likely reduces the risks significantly.

Agreed with IntFACTs post..


Where do you get that alcohols will act as anti-oxidant, liga? How?


As for 1P, no reason I can think of why it would be any different from normal liquid LSD - often in ethanol solution or ethanol-in-water such as vodka..


On another forum was said:


> According to some of the papers I’d read, a concentrated solution containing LSM will remain active for a week at most, before breaking down into its inactive epimer, iso-LSD.

Of course do your own fact checking instead of assuming this, I would personally start at the isomer design website and find their reference sources on the LSM page they should have.

The ring constrained modification here is on the amide, the methyl substitution for longer alkyl / aliphatic chains is on the 6 position...


The effects of lysergamides can be very similar, but the more analogues we see being tried and compared, I think will start giving users an idea such as that messing with the 6-pos chain may dial up or down the intensity of the psychedelia which may be partially a pharmadynamics thing and partially just from different kinetics or resistance to metabolism at that position...


While messing with the amide (LSZ, LSM, LSP, LSB) may cause the action to be more qualitatively different and more or less of a promiscuous ligand, while hardly affecting kinetics.. So perhaps mainly pharmacodynamics.


Putting amides on the indole 1-pos (like 1P-LSD or ALD-52) may be primarily or solely a kinetics thing since they are considered pro-drugs.


Not saying this is ALL necessarily true fact, but it is my suspicion and an example of what we may find as fact or opinion after trying them and analyzing the metabolism and binding profiles... that it very well matters where we modify the structure. 

Just saying that each modification just creates a new unique drug while true is a simplification and cop-out. It can have very varying significance, sometimes very little at all which is excellent if you want a legal clone.

Has all interest in this particular chemical died off? I'm always interested in any new information regarding various lysergamides. Though some of the early trip reports don't sound super promising, I thought there might be a bit more interest/use of this than there seems to be.

Just read Sor Ron Pibbs's trip report and this has me very intrigued.  It sounds sort if like LSA which I really love but hate it's brutal vasoconstriction and this sounds like a interesting alternative (I can deal with potential nausea). 

Also, I'm an insomniac so non-stimulating psychedelics are of great interest to me. I wonder how this stuff would combine with like 1p-LSD or Al-LAD or something like that... I'm curious if it might reduce the stimulation of LSD's??

Well this one is one is one the list and do plan on trying it soon but I have a few others that are ahead of it.

So, finally, I had built up the courage to try this one. First I dosed approximately 775ug trying to get a feel, but nothing. I then doubled the dose and a distinct lysergamide feeling took hold - only this was different! When I say different, I mean sedating as fuck! I would say LSM hit me like a cross between LSA-containing seeds and some old school barbiturate or something, very dreamy. 

All in all, the trip itself was enjoyable, forced me into a sedated dream like state - far more chill than 2C-C or Miprocin. The next morning however, I awoke to massive waves of nausea and puking, and finally felt better later in the day. So I've got mixed feelings about this one. I felt pretty damn shitty when I started to come around the next morning, which is the opposite of most lysergamides - I like warm afterglows not a shitty sickness. Anyways, not too many reports on this one lol, now I see why.

Oh wow, I took my last hit of acid years ago.  It was the last hit I ever need to take.  I told my friend that I shed a layer of skin, it literally felt like it.  He said I died and was reborn, and it was just the most intense acid trip ever, off a single blotter of something I will not name as it would start a debate as I've seen in the past.  Once you have felt acid permeate every cell of your body and explode into every last hidden corner of your mind and reveal its last lessons, you will find yourself no longer yearning to put anything lysergic into your body.


All these analogues are understandable but I don't think a single one of them were necessary.  


I don't like the direction they went with this guy.


Hope you are feeling well!

As to the legality of lysergic acid morpholide, in the UK, the lysergamide and any N-alkyl derivatives means only alkyl groups are covered (morpholine doesn't qualify as any sort of N-alkyl).

Unfortunately, the dreaded Psychoactive Substances act prohibits any psychoactives other than alcohol, nicotine and alkyl nitrites (last one exempted due to intervention by a tory MP so far back in the closet, he's in fucking Narnia)

Then again, seeing the totally corrupt arsewipe who make up our present government, if you have enough money, you can get out of anything (after seeing Matt Hancock is writing a book, 'How I Conquered Covid' after overseeing 100 000 deaths, due to incompetence, I have no respect for any legislation these fuckwits have introduced).

To qualify the above, LSZ needed to be specifically included in the MoDA, as it wasn't an N-alkyl derivative, due to the 4 membered ring. Same is true for morpholine (or piperidine, pyrrolidine etc)


What would be interesting is lysergic acid diallylamide, although it is more difficult to get anywhere near the conformation that the 2 diethyl groups take, which makes LSD so special.
