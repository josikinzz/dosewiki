It is strongly discouraged to take large amounts of this substance or to [insufflate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration#Insufflation) (snort) it. Please see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25I-NBOMe#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) for more details.
**25I-NBOMe** (also known as **2C-I-NBOMe** , **NBOMe-2C-I** , **Cimbi-5** , **Smiles** , and one of many drugs referred to as **N-Bomb** ) is a novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) chemical class that produces an array of visually-dominant and stimulating [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) .

The name 25I-NBOMe, which short-hand for 2C-I-NBOMe, is a derivative of the phenethylamine psychedelic [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) . It was first synthesized and documented in 2003 by Ralf Heim at the Free University of Berlin. It was further researched by a team at Purdue University led by [David Nichols](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/David_E._Nichols) . It has been studied in its 11C radiolabelled form as a potential ligand for mapping the distribution of 5-HT2A receptors in the brain, using positron emission tomography (PET).

It is worth noting that compounds of the [NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) family (any of which could be referred to as "N-Bomb", especially 25I-NBOMe and [25N-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25N-NBOMe) ) should be administered [sublingually](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sublingual) by placing and holding it into one's mouth and allowing it to absorb over a period of 15-25 minutes.

Extremely little is known about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 25I-NBOMe in humans. It had no history of human use before being sold online as a [designer drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) in 2010. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] . It has been associated with many deaths and hospitalizations. Anecdotal reports suggest that this substance may be difficult to use safely due to its highly sensitive dose-response and unpredictable effects.

## Chemistry

25I-NBOMe or 2C-I-NBOMe is a serotonergic N-benzyl derivative of the substituted phenethylamine psychedelic known as [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) . 25I-NBOMe is a substituted phenethylamine with methoxy groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 as well as an iodine atom attached to carbon R 4 . It differs from [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) structurally through a substitution on the amine (NH2) with a 2-methoxybenzyl (BOMe) group. 25I-NBOMe shares this 2-methoxybenzyl substitution with other chemicals of the NBOMe family. This NBOMe addition contains a methoxy ether CH 3 O- bound to a benzene ring at R 2 .

## Pharmacology

25I-NBOMe has efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) where it acts as a Full [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

Among psychedelics, this compound is considered to be pharmacologically unique in terms of the high potency, affinity, and selectivity with which it binds to the 5-HT2a receptor. Contrary to popular belief, it is not a "full agonist" [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] , although questions have been raised about how the effects it produces differ from other 5-HT2a partial agonists, which include the range of traditional psychedelics.

The Ki values of the following targets were greater than 500 Ki: 5-HT1A, D3, H2, 5-HT1D, α1A adrenergic, δ opioid, serotonin reuptake transporter, 5-HT5A, 5-HT1B, D2, 5-HT7, D1, 5-HT3, 5-HT1E, D5, muscarinic M1-M5, H3, and the dopamine reuptake transporter.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, 25I-NBOMe is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating. For most people, this substance induces a unique type of physical stimulation which can be described as feeling extremely energetic but in a way which does not force the tripper to move unless they genuinely choose to do so. For others, however, the stimulation can be quite uncontrollable, occasionally resulting in bodily shakes and a grinding of the teeth comparable to that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and traditional stimulants such as [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) .
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)** - In terms of the body’s perceived weight, this substance consistently leaves people feeling extremely light, often to the point of total weightlessness.
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" itself can be described as a mild, all-encompassing, soft but euphoric tingling sensation. This tingling sensation is also accompanied by spontaneous rushes of [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) that become longer and more drawn out proportional to the dosage consumed.
- **[Mouth numbing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mouth_numbing)** - Assuming the substance has been taken [sublingually](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sublingual) , the very first physical effect which a person will notice immediately after sublingual absorption is a strong, unpleasant metallic chemical taste. This is accompanied by a very distinct feeling of general numbness of the tongue and mouth which can stay for up to an hour after the blotter paper has been consumed.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - As the user begins to come up, nausea is not uncommon and can sometimes result in initial vomiting, although nausea usually disappears when the user has vomited or the trip fully set in. In comparison to other psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) and [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) , this could actually be considered very mild in its intensity.

- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)**
- **[Seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures)** - This effect is far more common in doses exceeding a heavy dose and may manifest as status epilepticus wherein seizures last more than 5 minutes or do not stop without medical intervention

- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Magnification](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Magnification)** - At higher doses, users can experience a "fish-eye" effect, where magnification changes based on the direction the user is looking relative to the object.
 
#### Suppressions

#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry produced by this substance is similar to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and can be comprehensively described as algorithmic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, fine and zoomed out in detail, fast and smooth in motion, structured in shape, colorful in scheme, glossy in color, sharp around the edges and equally angular as well as rounded across their corners. In comparison to other more commonly used psychedelics they can be described as significantly more intricate than the visual geometry found within [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) and most of the [2C-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x) family in general as well as completely on par with [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [Psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) and [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) at appropriately high dosages.
 
25I-NBOMe’s geometry leads reliably leads to [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry with [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) remaining so far unconfirmed. It seems to consistently be able to build up in visual intensity when the user stares at a central point. This eventually envelops the visual field and creates the sensation that the tripper has broken through into a continuously shifting geometric landscape or structure with a vast sense of immersive physical size attributed to it.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
25I-NBOMe is capable of producing a full range of hallucinatory states within the level 1 - 3 range extremely consistently. However, level 4 hallucinatory breakthroughs are reported but very different and inconsistent in comparison to other more commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) and [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) .
 
These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)** - This component is an uncommon effect that typically only occurs at very strong to heavy doses. It also tends to be accompanied by overwhelming if not dangerous physical and cognitive effects.
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** - ( *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ). These are more common within dark environments and can be described as lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of 25I-NBOMe are described by many as notably light in comparison to the classical [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . It is not uncommon for people to report feeling that their thought stream has maintained general normality in its specific style throughout low to moderate dosages. At high dosages, however, strong to overwhelming cognitive alterations become present, which can lead to states of [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , and general sensory overload. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is generally only present at low doses.
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)** and **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)** - Although one of 25i-NBOME's effects is thought acceleration, the opposite may occur at higher doses.
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)** - This effect is considered to be very mild compared to traditional psychedlics.
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** & **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - This effect seems to occur more readily than other psychedelics, perhaps due to its very prominent stimulating properties 
- **[Feelings of impending doom](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Feelings_of_impending_doom)** - This is generally only experienced during the comedown period or if one has taken a large amount of the substance.
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - The [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) effects range from mild to powerful, but are inconsistently manifested. Entactogenic effects for people who try this substance usually become prominent in the presence of others. These feelings of increased sociability, love and empathy do not seem to be quite as strong or profound as those found within other [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) (such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) and [AMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/AMT) )
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)** 
- **[Laughter fits](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Laughter_fits)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
- **[HPPD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/HPPD)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Enhancements](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Dosage independent intensity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage_independent_intensity)** - While the reasons for this are not understood, many reports suggest that this substance can produce unexpectedly strong or weak effects even when taken at the seemingly same dose in an unpredictable manner. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] This may contribute to the relative risk it is poses compared to most other psychedelics.
- **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- While they are occasionally reported, the transpersonal effects produced by this substance seem to be significantly less consistent and reproducible than other [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , which perhaps corresponds with the notably mild changes to one's perceptual and cognitive processes. 
- **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

**Short-term as well as long-term damage of NBOMes have been occasionally tied to serious physical and mental problems on seemingly random people, including memory and speech difficulties, heart problems, HPPD and in some cases Anxiety and PTSD, from particularly difficult experiences.**

25I-NBOMe is a relatively new substance, and little is known about its pharmacological risks or its interaction with other substances. The [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) has not yet been determined although it is potentially fatal at heavy dosages. [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) advises that due to 25I-NBOMe's extreme potency it should not be insufflated as this method of administration appears to have led to several deaths in the past year.

This substance came to media attention in early 2012 after a cluster of seven non-fatal [overdoses](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) with the drug were reported in or around Richmond, Virginia. As of May 2013, 25I-NBOMe has reportedly led to five overdose deaths in the United States. In June 2012, two teens in Grand Forks, North Dakota and East Grand Forks, Minnesota fatally overdosed on a substance that was allegedly 25I-NBOMe, resulting in lengthy sentences for two of the parties involved and a Federal indictment against the Texas-based online vendor.

A 21-year-old man from Little Rock, Arkansas died in October 2012 after taking a liquid drop of the drug nasally at a music festival. He was reported to have consumed caffeinated alcoholic beverages for "several hours" beforehand. It is unclear what other drugs he may have consumed, as autopsies usually do not test for the presence of research chemicals.

A man in Australia died from injuries sustained by running into trees and power poles while intoxicated by 25I-NBOMe.

A Brazilian 16-year-old died from overdose in April 2016. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

The addition of 5-HTP can greatly increase the effects of 25i-NBOME and should be avoided. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

25I-NBOMe is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 25I-NBOMe is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 1 week for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 25I-NBOMe presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 25I-NBOMe all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Overdose

Due to the very high potency and seemingly unpredictable effects the margin between a normal and an overdose of NBOMe compounds is extremely small when compared to many other substances. The exact toxic dose is unclear since it seems to depend a lot on personal physiology, rather than predominantly dose. However, various anecdotal reports suggest that dangerous side effects begin to appear when exceeding 1000 μg and it possibly becoming lethal for the more sensitive people at roughly 2000 μg. Reports of other people surviving much higher doses, sometimes even without any major side effects have been documented as well.

There is also the uncertainty of dosage on blotter paper since it is rather difficult to lay such an exact dosage. Insufflating, vaporizing or drinking tinctures of this substance is highly discouraged because of this and has been tied to many documented deaths . One study found that 25I‐NBOMe and 25C‐NBOMe blotter papers contained 'hotspots' with higher quantities of the drug, implying an inherent risk of overdosing.

The overdose effects of NBOMes are typically a dangerously high [heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) , [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [hyperthermia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hyperthermia) and significant [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) also accompanied by [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attack) , aggressive behavior, [numbness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression) or pain, [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) and often [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure) . The risks in an overdose include anything from organ failure to cardiac arrest and death [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] . There are also multiple reports of people lethally injuring themselves or falling to death . [Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) can help with the psychological effects during an overdose although medical attention should always be called in even a possible overdose of 25I-NBOMe.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .* Due to the highly unpredictable nature of the NBOMe series, it is generally advised to avoid mixing them with other psychoactive substances.

- **2C-T-X** - The 2C-T-X phenethylamines can be unpredictable in their interactions and the NBOMes are known to be unpredictable even alone. As a result, this combination should be avoided.
- **5-MeO-xxt** - The 5-MeO tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions and the NBOMes are known to be unpredictable even alone. As a result, this combination should be avoided.
- **Amphetamines** - Amphetamines and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation. When combined they can result in tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction and, in extreme cases, heart failure. The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants are also not good in combination with psychedelics as they can lead to unpleasant thought loops. NBOMes are known to cause seizures and stimulants can increase this risk.
- **aMT**
- **Caffeine** - Caffeine can bring out the natural stimulation from psychedelic drugs to make it uncomfortable. High doses can cause anxiety which is hard to handle while tripping.
- **Cannabis** - Cannabis has an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of psychedelics. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid over intake.
- **Cocaine** - Cocaine and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation. When combined they can result in severe vasoconstriction, tachycardia, hypertension, and in extreme cases heart failure.
- **DOx**
- **DXM**
- **[Lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** [- Lithium is commonly prescribed in the treatment of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication)) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with psychedelics significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **MAOIs** - MAO-B inhibitors can increase the potency and duration of phenethylamines unpredictably.
- **MDMA**
- **MXE** - As an NMDA antagonist, MXE potentiates NBOMes which can be unpleasantly intense.
