## SYNTHESIS
Synthesis from 2C-B. To a solution of 7.24 g 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine (2C-B) and 4.5 g phthalic anhydride in 100 mL anhydrous DMF there was added molecular sieves. After 16 h reflux, the reaction mixture was cooled and the sieves removed by filtration. The addition of a little CH2Cl2 prompted the deposition of yellow crystals which were recrystallized from EtOH. The resulting 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenyl)-2-(phthalimido)ethane weighed 7.57 g and had a mp of 141â142 Â°C. Anal. (C18H16BrNO4) C,H,N,Br.

A solution of 14.94 g of 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenyl)-2-(phthalimido)ethane and 4.5 g cuprous chloride in 300 mL anhydrous DMF was heated for 5 h at reflux. The cooled mixture was poured into 20 mL H2O that contained 13 g hydrated ferric chloride and 3 mL concentrated HCl. The mixture was maintained at about 70 Â°C for 20 min, and then extracted with CH2Cl2. After washing the pooled organic extracts with dilute HCl and drying with anhydrous MgSO4, the volatiles were removed under vacuum to provide a solid residue. This was recrystallized from EtOH to provide 12.18 g of 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-chlorophenyl)-2-(phthalimido)ethane as yellow needles that had a mp of 138â140 Â°C. Anal. (C18H16ClNO4) C,H,N,Cl.

To 60 mL absolute EtOH there was added 12.2 g 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-chlorophenyl)-2-(phthalimido)ethane and 2.9 mL of 100% hydrazine. The solution was held at reflux for 15 min. After cooling, the cyclic hydrazone by-product was removed by filtration, and the alcoholic mother liquors taken to dryness under vacuum. The residue was distilled at 145â155 Â°C at 0.05 mm/Hg to give 5.16 g of a clear, colorless oil. This was dissolved in anhydrous Et2O and treated with hydrogen chloride gas, producing 2,5-dimethoxy-4-chlorophenethylamine hydrochloride (2C-C) as white crystals with a mp of 220â221 Â°C. Anal. (C10H15Cl2NO2) C,H,N.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 24 mg) âI was at a moderately high and thoroughly favorable place, for several hours. It seemed to be a very sensual place, but without too much in the way of visual distraction.â

(with 40 mg) âThere were a lot of visualsâsomething that I had noted at lower levels. There seems to be less stimulation than with 2C-B, and in some ways it is actually sedating. And yet I was up all night. It was like a very intense form of relaxation.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
The halogens represent a small group of atoms that are unique for a couple of reasons. They are all located in a single column of the periodic table, being monovalent and negative. That means that they can be reasonably stable things when attached to an aromatic nucleus. But, being monovalent, they cannot be modified or extended in any way. Thus, they are kind of a dead end, at least as far as the 2C-X series is considered. The heaviest, iodine, was explored as the phenethylamine, as 2C-I, and as the amphetamine as DOI. These are the most potent. The next lighter is bromine, where the phenethylamine is 2C-B and the amphetamine is DOB. These two are a bit less potent, and are by far the most broadly explored of all the halides. Here, in the above recipe, we have the chlorine counterpart, 2C-C. There is also the corresponding amphetamine DOC. These are less potent still, and much less explored. Why? Perhaps because chlorine is a gas and troublesome to handle (bromine is a liquid, and iodine is a solid). The fluorine analogue is yet harder to make, and requires procedures that are indirect, because fluorine (the lightest of all the halides) is not only a gas, but is dangerous to handle and does not react in the usual halogen way. There will be mention made of 2C-F, but DOF is still unexplored.

The treatment of the 2C-B phthalimide described above, with cuprous cyanide rather than cuprous chloride, gave rise to the cyano analog which, on hydrolysis with hydrazine, yielded 2,5-dimethoxy-4-cyanophenethylamine (2C-CN). Hydrolysis of this with hot, strong base gave the corresponding acid, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-carboxyphenethylamine, 2C-COOH. No evaluation of either of these compounds has been made in the human animal, as far as I know.
