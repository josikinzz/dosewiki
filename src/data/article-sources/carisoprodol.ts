## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as carbamate esters. These are compounds containing an ester of carbamic acid with the general structure R2NC(=O)OR' (R' not H). They are esters of carbamic acids.

### Background

Originally approved by the FDA in 1959
Label
, carisoprodol is a centrally acting muscle relaxant used in painful musculoskeletal conditions in conjunction with physical therapy and other medications
4
.  This drug is available by itself in an oral tablet or combined with aspirin, or in a fixed-dose combination with both aspirin and codeine
Label
,
16
,
17
.
In January 2012, this drug was classified as a Schedule IV substance under the controlled substances act in several US states due to alarming rates of abuse
5
,
8
despite having a low potential for abuse in addition to a low risk of dependence
13
.

### Indication

Carisoprodol is indicated for the relief of discomfort related to acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions
Label
.
Important limitations of use
Label
:
• Should only be used for acute treatment periods up to two or three weeks
• Adequate evidence of effectiveness for more prolonged use has not been established
• Not recommended in pediatric patients less than 16 years of age

### Pharmacodynamics

Carisoprodol is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant that does not act directly on skeletal muscle but acts directly on the central nervous system (CNS).  This drug relieves the painful effects of muscle spasm
12
,
19
. A metabolite of carisoprodol,
meprobamate
, possesses both anxiolytic and sedative properties
Label
. Clinical studies have shown that this drug causes impairment of psychomotor performance in neuropsychological tests.

### Absorption

The absolute bioavailability of carisoprodol has not yet been established. The mean time to peak plasma concentrations (Tmax) of this drug was about 1.5-2 hours in clinical studies
Label
. Co-administration of a fatty meal with carisoprodol (350 mg tablet) had no impact on carisoprodol pharmacokinetics
Label
.

### Metabolism

The main pathway of carisoprodol is liver metabolism is by the cytochrome enzyme CYP2C19 to form meprobamate. This enzyme exhibits genetic polymorphism, which may affect the metabolism of this drug

### Toxicity

LD50 values
The LD50 values of carisoprodol for rats are 450 mg/kg for intravenous (IV) and intraperitoneal injection, and 1,320 mg/kg for gavage dosing. In mice, the LD50 values are 165 mg/kg for intravenous injection, 980 mg/kg for intraperitoneal injection, and 2,340 mg/kg for gavage dosing. The LD50 value for rabbits given carisoprodol by intravenous injection is 124 mg/kg
18
.
Overdose
An overdose of carisoprodol leads to CNS depression, and in severe cases, induction of a coma. Shock, depression of respiratory function, seizures and death have also been reported in rare cases. Several symptoms may be associated with carisoprodol overdose, such as horizontal and vertical nystagmus, blurred vision, mydriasis, mild tachycardia and hypotension, respiratory depression, euphoria, CNS stimulation, muscular incoordination, and/or rigidity, confusion, headache, hallucinations, and dystonic reactions. Alcohol or other CNS depressants or psychotropic agents can exert additive effects on carisoprodol even when one of the agents has been ingested at the normal, therapeutic dose. Fatal accidental and non-accidental overdoses have both been reported with carisoprodol ingestion alone or ingestion of carisoprodol in combination with alcohol or psychotropic drugs
15
.
A note on dependence and withdrawal
In the postmarketing reports after carisoprodol use, cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse have been reported with long-term use. The majority of dependence and withdrawal cases, as well as abuse, have occurred in patients with a history of addiction or who have used this drug in combination with other drugs having abuse potential. However, multiple post-marketing adverse event reports have been made of carisodopril-associated abuse when used without other drugs possessing abuse potential. Withdrawal symptoms have been observed and reported following sudden abrupt cessation after long-term carisodoprol use. To reduce the chance of carisodopril dependence, withdrawal, or abuse, carisodopril should be used with caution in addiction-prone patients and in patients taking other CNS depressants including alcohol. This drug should not be taken for longer than 2 to 3 weeks for symptomatic relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort
Label
.
Use in pregnancy
This drug has been classified as Pregnancy Category C. There are no clinical trial data on the use of carisoprodol during human pregnancy. Animal studies show that carisoprodol crosses the placenta and leads to adverse effects on fetal growth and postnatal survival. In postmarketing reports, the main metabolite,
meprobamate
, has not demonstrated a consistent association between maternal use and an increased risk for specific congenital malformations
Label
.
Use in nursing
Limited data in humans demonstrate that this is found excreted in breast milk and may reach concentrations in breast milk of 2-4 times the maternal plasma concentrations
Label
. It is therefore advisable to exercise caution when this drug is used during breastfeeding
Label
.

### Mechanism of action

The mechanism of action of carisoprodol in relieving discomfort associated with acute painful musculoskeletal conditions has not been confirmed.
In studies using animal models, the muscle relaxation that is induced by carisoprodol is associated with a change in the interneuronal activity of the spinal cord and of the descending reticular formation, located in the brain.
Label
The abuse potential of this drug is attributed to its ability to alter GABAA function.

### General Function

A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (PubMed:18577768, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:18577768, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Hydroxylates PUFA specifically at the omega-1 position (PubMed:18577768). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of PUFA (PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997). Also metabolizes plant monoterpenes such as limonene. Oxygenates (R)- and (S)-limonene to produce carveol and perillyl alcohol (PubMed:11950794). Responsible for the metabolism of a number of therapeutic agents such as the anticonvulsant drug S-mephenytoin, omeprazole, proguanil, certain barbiturates, diazepam, propranolol, citalopram and imipramine. Hydroxylates fenbendazole at the 4' position (PubMed:23959307)

## Quick Reference
- **Common Nomenclature:** Carisoprodol

## Subjective Experience

Carisoprodol is a muscle relaxant, which according to the US National Library of
Medicine “is used with rest, physical therapy, and other measures to relax muscles
and relieve pain and discomfort caused by strains, sprains, and other muscle
injuries.” However, it is also known for its sedating, anxiolytic and hypnotic
properties, for which it has been recreationally used for a number of years, and is
sometimes claimed to have similar effects to barbiturates..

Dose presents a slight dilemma in that I am tempted to take two of the pills (700mg)
for which there are numerous trip reports on Drugs-Forum.com. However, in
consideration of the TripSit figures, and the disaster I had with the last sedating
prescription drug I sampled (pregabalin) I elect to target 425mg, about one pill and a
quarter, which sits more or less in the centre of the common range.

Research also identified serious warnings with respect to interaction with other
drugs, including alcohol and opioids, so I ensure that I am absolutely clean at the
time of testing. I would also point out that at time of writing addiction potential and
a number of other adverse effects are widely cited.

Finally, I am carrying a shoulder injury at the moment, so it will also be interesting to
see how this bears up.

I initiate the experiment at approximately 5pm, on an empty stomach.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I sit down at my computer and swallow the dose with a glass of water.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:10 The first hint of a heady-dreaminess manifests itself in the form of
mild but nonetheless discernable waves.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 I certainly feel sedated but not particularly elevated. I sense that I am
somewhat devoid of energy, but relaxed. Lethargic is a good word for this.
There is certainly a psychoactive effect albeit of an unexciting nature.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Note that the pain from my injury is still there, although it might be of a lower
order.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:00 This is quite stable now. To varying degrees I am sedated, slightly
zoned out and weary. There is no discomfort present, and the pain I carried
into this is indeed reduced.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I feel no particular mood lift but I do feel that I could retire and sleep should I
choose to.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:30 The earlier manifestations are still present but the intensity has now
faded somewhat.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+5:00 The effects have continued to fade, and I am now ready to retire to
bed.
\`\`\`
The night’s sleep was reasonable: no more disturbed than usual but not the blissful
eight hours I had hoped for. My shoulder pain was still in situ when I awoke and the
after effects the next morning comprised a minor sedation or placebo.

Note that the subsequent night’s sleep was of very poor quality. This may or may not
be connected, ditto the general lack of form.

Overall this was a solid if unspectacular ride, lacking uplift and euphoria, but
delivering an anxiolytic and relaxing sedation. Recreationally I suspect I would have
got more from it with a higher dose, but realistically it would be difficult to justify a
revisit, particularly given the potential risks referred to earlier.

Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Carisoprodol**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Controlled
- SCHEDULE: Schedule IV
 
Carisoprodol (Soma) was added to Schedule IV in December 2011 (See [Federal Register Vol 76 No 238](http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/12/12/2011-31542/schedules-of-controlled-substances-placement-of-carisoprodol-into-schedule-iv) ). This means it is illegal to sell without a license and illegal to possess without a valid license or prescription. 
 
 On November 17, 2009, the DEA entered a proposed rule to move carisoprodol to Schedule IV (Federal Register Volume 74, Number 220). It is extremely likely that this rule will become final and carisoprodol will become Schedule IV in the United States. See [DEA Diversion.Gov](http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/rules/2009/fr1117.htm) . The DEA has been considering controlling carisoprodol for more than a decade and has listed it as a "Drug of Concern" since August 2006.

**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) , [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) or [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Carisoprodol** , also known by the brand name **Soma** , is a carbamate [sedative-hypnotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) . Carisoprodol is used medically as a centrally-acting [muscle relaxant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) and hypnotic for the short-term treatment of [insomnia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insomnia) . Carisoprodol also has weak [analgesic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) effects. Carisoprodol is sometimes found in formulations also containing [caffeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Caffeine) and acetaminophen. Carisoprodol produces similar effects to [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturate) . Carisoprodol acts as a prodrug to [meprobamate](/w/index.php?title=Meprobamate&action=edit&redlink=1) , meaning it is metabolized to meprobamate when it enters the body.

Carisoprodol, like barbiturates, has been primarily replaced by [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) due to a larger therapeutic window, having less severe adverse effects and being safer in overdose.

## Chemistry

Chemically, carisoprodol is classified as a carbamate. It is extremely similar in structure to meprobamate, the only difference being an isopropyl group bonded to an amine group. Carbamates are derivatives of carbamic acid. The empirical formula is carisoprodol is C 12 H 24 N 2 O 4 and has a molar mass of 260.33 grams per mole.

## Pharmacology

Carisoprodol is a prodrug that is metabolized to meprobamate, besides having its own effects. The precise mechanism of meprobamate is not completely understood. However it is believed that meprobamate acts similarly to [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) and [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , acting as a positive allosteric modulator of a GABA A receptor . Unlike barbiturates and benzodiazepines, in animal studies meprobamate has been shown to retain most of its effects without having [gamma-aminobutyric acid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) present . Meprobamate has also been noted to be an adenosine [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) , making it unique among hypnotics .

Carisoprodol is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 2C19 enzyme in the liver and has a biological half-life of about two hours. Carisoprodol and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys in urine.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - In terms of energy level alterations, this drug has the potential to be extremely sedating and often results in an overwhelmingly lethargic state. However, unlike [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , carisoprodol causes direct GABA-A agonism at higher doses, resulting in more significant sedation in comparison. It can be described as more akin to [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) .
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)**
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)**
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)**
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)**
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - This effect generally occurs only at heavier doses, but may be present at lower doses as well. The euphoria felt on carisoprodol is significantly stronger than that felt on [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) .
- **[Decreased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_libido)**
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)** - Compared to other agents such as [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) , this effect is generally considered to be quite weak. ### Visual effects
 
- - **[Acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acuity_suppression)** - Like many [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) , high doses of carisoprodol may cause blurred vision. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - Compared to most other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) , this effect is particularly strong.
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)**
- **[Language suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression)** - At higher doses, carisoprodol is known cause slurred speech.
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Delusions of sobriety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions)** - This is the false belief that one is perfectly sober despite obvious evidence to the contrary such as severe cognitive impairment and an inability to fully communicate with others. It most commonly occurs at heavy dosages.

## Toxicity and harm potential

Carisoprodol likely has moderate toxicity relative to dose. However, carisoprodol is potentially [lethal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) when mixed with [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) like [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) . Carisoprodol has been taken off the market is several countries such as Sweden and Indonesia due to side effects and abuse.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Carisoprodol is extremely physically and psychologically addictive. Carbamate withdrawal, like [barbiturate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturate) withdrawal, is medically serious and can potentially cause a life-threatening withdrawal syndrome that can cause [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure) , [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and death. Drugs which lower the seizure threshold such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) and [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) should be avoided during withdrawal.

Tolerance will develop to the sedative-hypnotic effects of carisoprodol after prolonged use. It is unknown exactly how long it takes for tolerance to reach baseline.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Depressants** ( *[1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) , [2M2B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2M2B) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) / [GBL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL) , [methaqualone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methaqualone) , [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids)* ) - This combination potentiates the [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , and [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) caused by one another. At higher doses, it can lead to a sudden, unexpected loss of consciousness along with a dangerous amount of depressed respiration. There is also an increased risk of suffocating on one's vomit while unconscious. If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs before a loss of consciousness, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **Dissociatives** - This combination can unpredictably potentiate the [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) and [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) that can be caused by each other. It may also result in a sudden loss of consciousness accompanied by a dangerous degree of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs before consciousness is lost, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **Stimulants** - Stimulants mask the [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) effect of depressants, which is the main factor most people use to gauge their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant effects wear off, the effects of the depressant will significantly increase, leading to intensified [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) , and dangerous [black-out states](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) . This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if one's fluid intake is not closely monitored. If choosing to combine these substances, one should strictly limit themselves to a pre-set schedule of dosing only a certain amount per hour until a maximum threshold has been reached.

## Legal status

In most jurisdictions, carisoprodol is considered a prescription-only and/or controlled drug.

- **Germany:** Carisoprodol is a prescription medicine, according to Anlage 1 AMVV.
- **United States** : In the United States, carisoprodol is a Schedule IV Controlled Substance . Therefore, it is prescription-only and anyone caught in possession of the substance with or without intent to distribute is punishable by law.

Carisoprodol is a muscle relaxant that is sometimes prescribed to treat musculoskeletal disorders (e.g. back pain). It’s also been used recreationally for decades, with its effects reminiscent to some extent of barbiturates, [benzodiazepines](http://thedrugclassroom.com/categories/benzodiazepines/) , and [ethanol](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/alcohol-ethanol/) .

There’s been an increase in concern about its abuse potential since the 1990s. Some countries have responded by moving away from the substance.

It’s intertwined with meprobamate, a drug it’s metabolized to.

## Effects

**Positive**

- Sedation
- Relaxation
- Physical euphoria
- Cognitive euphoria
- Increased sociability
- Disinhibition
- Anxiety reduction

**Negative**

- Dizziness
- Drowsiness
- Headache
- Impaired coordination
- Slurred speech

#### Medical use

Carisoprodol is a centrally-acting muscle relaxant that’s taken for acute musculoskeletal disorders. It seems to reduce discomfort, but it’s only recommended for a few weeks. The drug is often used alongside rest, physical therapy, and NSAIDs.

Taking it with NSAIDs may boost the overall efficacy, albeit while raising the chance of adverse CNS effects.

It’s not recommended as a first-line treatment even though it’s been widely prescribed in some regions.

The primary negatives in medical settings are drowsiness and psychomotor impairment.

**Pain relief**

Early studies showed it could produce analgesia not seen with meprobamate. It also seems to increase the analgesic efficacy of opioids.

One study in humans demonstrated an elevation of the pain threshold when undergoing tooth pulp stimulation. While 700 mg of carisoprodol produced an effect, 800 mg of meprobamate did not.

#### Nonmedical use

Euphoria (cognitive and physical) is most prominent at strong+ doses. It usually offers more physical euphoria than benzodiazepines.

A lot of the relaxation, physical impairment, anxiolysis, and euphoria is comparable to ethanol to some degree.

Not everyone experiences positive effects. Even at high doses, some users primarily encounter depression, sedation, and some dysphoria.

It’s regularly taken with other drugs, mainly depressants. This may lead to greater euphoria, relaxation, and sedation. But it’s also much riskier. A number of near-fatal and fatal cases have been connected to its use with [opioids](http://thedrugclassroom.com/categories/opioids/) and benzodiazepines.

*Dose-response*

350 – 1050 mg is most likely to primarily cause relaxation and drowsiness, though the other aforementioned positives are possible.

Those who take over 1400 mg (sometimes much more) more reliably report what some have described as a hypomanic state. It’s characterized by cheerfulness, disinhibition, socialization, physical euphoria, and sometimes psychomotor excitement (with impairment).

## Chemistry & Pharmacology

#### Chemistry

It’s very similar to meprobamate and is structurally n-isopropyl-meprobamate. Both are carbamate derivatives.

Carisoprodol is sold as a racemic mixture.

#### Pharmacodynamics

A few mechanisms may be playing a role, but the most important activity occurs at GABA receptors. Part of the activity comes from carisoprodol itself and part comes from metabolism to meprobamate.

Carisoprodol is associated with altered interneuronal activity in the spinal cord and descending reticular formation. As a centrally acting muscle relaxant, it doesn’t directly impact transmission at the neuromuscular junction (as opposed to tubocurarine, for example).

The drug acts as a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) and a direct agonist at GABAa receptors. Different receptor complexes are affected to varying degrees, but it clearly affects a1b2y2, the most prominent configuration in the brain.

It differs from benzodiazepines and barbiturates, and alternative binding sites seem to play a role. Some evidence suggests there’s one site for PAM and another for direct agonism.

Studies in animals have shown flumazenil partially inhibits the drug’s activity.

Pentobarbital and meprobamate can fully substitute for the discriminative stimulus of carisoprodol in animals.

**Direct agonism**

This is reportedly seen with meprobamate as well, but carisoprodol is more active and more potent. Picrotoxin can antagonize the activation, lending support to carisoprodol truly operating at GABAA receptors.

Greater direct activation is seen at a2 receptors relative to a1 receptors, which are more abundant in the CNS. A3 is affected less than the other alpha subunits.

The agonism is higher at b1 receptors, whereas PAM is greater at b2 receptors.

Carisoprodol’s agonist activity contributes to its more concerning effects in overdose. The fatal concentration may be as low as 140 uM, which correlates with the concentration associated with significant levels of direct activation.

**PAM**

Modulation is present at a1b1y2 and a1b2y2 (among others), with the efficacy being higher at b2 receptors than b1. The efficacy isn’t affected by the presence of a gamma (y) subunit.

PAM is greater at receptors with an a1 subunit. It still has notable effects on a2 and a2 receptors, but it isn’t selective for them.

**Other mechanisms**

There’s more acetylcholine antagonism than with meprobamate, but it’s not significant.

Adenosine reuptake inhibition appears to exist, which may contribute to the sedative action.

Limited evidence suggests NMDA antagonist and pro-serotonin activity could exist.

#### Pharmacokinetics

It is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract and distributed in the CNS.

Tmax: 1 – 2 hours

Cmax: It appears to be between 2 and 7 ug/mL following a 350 mg dose.

- One report showed a peak of 2.1 ug/mL. It dropped to 1.1 ug/mL by 3 hours and 0.24 ug/mL by 6 hours.

Half-life: 1.5 to 2 hours

**Metabolism**

The drug is metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP2C19. The metabolites include meprobamate, hydroxycarisoprodol, and hydroxymeprobamate.

Meprobamate is active with an acute half-life of ~11.3 hours.

Study

One test showed 9/10 human participants extensively and quickly metabolized the drug to meprobamate, which was detectable within 20 minutes of a 700 mg administration.

Meprobamate was greater than carisoprodol in serum by 2.5 hours.

---

## History

#### 1956

Frank M. Berger of Wallace Laboratories (later Carter-Wallace) created the drug. He was also part of the team responsible for synthesizing meprobamate, which became a popular pharmaceutical in the 1950s.

A number of meprobamate derivatives were being created and tested, leading to the development of carisoprodol. It was quickly found to have some unique pharmacological properties compared to meprobamate.

#### 1959

Carisoprodol is introduced following FDA approval. Papers described it as exhibiting some of the same properties as mephenesin and meprobamate.

#### 1960s

It was investigated in humans and animals, with it primarily being compared to meprobamate and other muscle relaxants.

The drug was found to cause clear EEG changes in animals without leading to much sedation at low doses. In this respect it was likened to atropine.

Some investigations found it to be an analgesic in certain situations, including in human trials.

Most of the discussion about the substance suggested it had a low abuse potential and minimal risk of physical dependence.

#### 1978

A report had appeared demonstrating the abuse potential, ultimately contributing to a rise in concern about its effects.

#### 1990s

Following reports documenting physical dependence and recreational use, concerns increased about carisoprodol. Yet, a paper found that just a small percentage of physicians understood carisoprodol’s prodrug status and they believed it had a lower abuse risk than meprobamate.

The DEA recommended federal scheduling in 1996. This was opposed by the FDA at the time due to a lack of available evidence, though carisoprodol ended up becoming a “drug of concern.”

It was ranked 18 out of 123 for drugs involved in emergency department (ED) visits in the US in 1998.

#### 1990s – 2000s

More claims appeared of it being used to boost or change the effects of opioids and sometimes benzodiazepines, cocaine, and ethanol.

Even though it wasn’t scheduled at the federal level, individual states began scheduling it.

There was a significant rise in ED visits involving the drug:

- 1994: 6,569
- 2001: 11,239
- 2005: 19,513

#### 2000s

SAMHSA reported a doubling of nonmedical use between 2004 and 2008. The National Forensic Laboratory Information System listed it as one of the top 25 most abused drugs in the US in 2008. During the same year, ~10.5 million prescriptions were dispensed.

#### 2000s – 2010s

A contributing factor to the rise in nonmedical use was the availability of carisoprodol from online sellers.

Some countries (e.g. Sweden) moved away from using it. They either removed it from medical practice or further restricted its use.

More regions, including US states, scheduled the drug.

**2012**

It became a Schedule 4 drug in the US following an apparent rise in misuse and adverse events.

A post in the Federal Register explained the move with these points:

- “Carisoprodol possesses sedative properties that may underlie its therapeutic usefulness and potential for abuse.”
- “In vitro studies demonstrated that carisoprodol possesses barbiturate-like efects.”
- The “discriminative stimulus effects are similar to other Schedule 4 drugs such as barbital, meprobamate, and chlordiazepoxide.”
- “The record demonstrates that excessive carisoprodol use creates toxicity and withdrawal symptoms similar to other Schedule 4 drugs.”

---

## Legal Status

#### US

Schedule 4

#### Controlled

*You should always check your local laws. This list may not be complete.*

It’s usually not controlled as an illicit drug, but prescriptions may be far less common than in the US. Some countries have taken it off the market.

---

## Safety

As usual, the negative effects at common doses are mild, such as drowsiness and impaired coordination.

#### Overdose

Taking a very strong dose can lead to coma, respiratory depression, amnesia, and even death. A smaller number of reports exist detailing agitation, seizures, movement disorders, and muscular rigidity.

One hypothesis is that overdoses with effects like agitation and muscular rigidity might be carisoprodol-dominant and suggest less metabolism has occurred.

Neuromuscular symptoms and evidence of myoclonus existed in 16% of overdose cases (29 of 176) in San Francisco during 1997.

Most overdoses primarily feature CNS depression.

It appears using over 12 grams is potentially life-threatening, though nothing near that should even be attempted acutely.

- 34-year-old male
- Found two carisoprodol vials and two propoxyphene vials. 
- There was a high propoxyphene concentration.
- Heart blood: 8.1 ug/mL

#### Withdrawal

There is clearly the potential for severe withdrawal with chronic use. It’s connected in part to meprobamate, which accumulates with chronic use and has a longer half-life.

It’s similar to what can occur with benzodiazepines and ethanol. The greatest chance of severe effects exists when abruptly stopping the drug.

A fairly high incidence of hallucinations (mainly visual and auditory) has been reported. This fits with a report that claimed around 20% of meprobamate withdrawal cases feature hallucinations or other psychotic symptoms.

The symptoms appear to peak 3 – 5 days after cessation and have sometimes lasted up to 8 days. An example timeline is having insomnia appear on the first night post-cessation, followed by psychosis by 36 – 48 hours.

Anxiety, insomnia, tremor, hallucinations, and tachycardia are common symptoms. Seizures are possible.

**Case reports**

- First 
- He became suspicious, agitation, hallucinated small animals, heard voices, and saw flashes of bright light.
- This lasted for a few days.

Carisoprodol, sold under the brand name Soma among others, is an oral medication used for musculoskeletal pain. Effects generally begin within half an hour and last for up to six hours.
Common side effects include headache, dizziness, and sleepiness. Serious side effect may include addiction, allergic reactions, and seizures. In people with a sulfa allergy certain formulations may result in problems. Safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not clear. How it works is not clear. Some of its effects are believed to occur following metabolic conversion into meprobamate, carisoprodol's main active metabolite.
Carisoprodol was approved for medical use in the United States in 1959. Its approval in the European Union was withdrawn in 2008. It is available as a generic medication. In 2019, it was the 343rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800,000 prescriptions. In the United States, it is a Schedule IV controlled substance.

## Medical uses

Carisoprodol is meant to be used along with rest, physical therapy and other measures to relax muscles after strains, sprains and muscle injuries. It comes in tablet format and is taken by the mouth three times a day and before bed.

## Side effects

The usual dose of 350 mg is unlikely to engender prominent side effects other than somnolence, and mild to significant euphoria or dysphoria, but the euphoria is generally short-lived due to the fast metabolism of carisoprodol into meprobamate and other metabolites; the euphoria derived is, according to new research, most likely due to carisoprodol's inherent, potent anxiolytic effects that are far stronger than those produced by its primary metabolite, meprobamate, which is often misblamed for the drug-seeking associated with carisoprodol, as carisoprodol itself is responsible for the significantly more intense central nervous system effects than meprobamate alone. Carisoprodol has a qualitatively different set of effects to that of meprobamate (Miltown). The medication is well tolerated and without adverse effects in the majority of patients for whom it is indicated. In some patients, however, and/or early in therapy, carisoprodol can have the full spectrum of sedative side effects and can impair the patient's ability to operate a firearm, motor vehicles, and other machinery of various types, especially when taken with medications containing alcohol, in which case an alternative medication would be considered. The intensity of the side effects of carisoprodol tends to lessen as therapy continues, as is the case with many other drugs. Other side effects include: dizziness, clumsiness, headache, fast heart rate, upset stomach, vomiting and skin rash.
There are 368 drugs known to interact with carisoprodol including 28 major drug interactions. The interaction of carisoprodol with essentially all opioids, and other centrally acting analgesics, but especially codeine, those of the codeine-derived subgroup of the semisynthetic class (ethylmorphine, dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, nicocodeine, benzylmorphine, the various acetylated codeine derivatives including acetyldihydrocodeine, dihydroisocodeine, nicodicodeine and others) which allows the use of a smaller dose of the opioid to have a given effect, is useful in general and especially where skeletal muscle injury and/or spasm is a large part of the problem. The potentiation effect is also useful in other pain situations and is also especially useful with opioids of the open-chain class, such as methadone, levomethadone, ketobemidone, phenadoxone and others. In recreational drug users, deaths have resulted from combining doses of hydrocodone and carisoprodol. Another danger of misuse of carisoprodol and opiates is the potential to asphyxiate while unconscious.
Meprobamate and other muscle-relaxing drugs often were subjects of misuse in the 1950s and 60s. Overdose cases were reported as early as 1957, and have been reported on several occasions since then.
Carisoprodol is metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys, so this drug must be used with caution with patients that have impaired hepatic or renal function. Because of potential for more severe side effects, this drug is on the list to avoid for elderly people.

### Withdrawal

Carisoprodol, meprobamate, and related drugs such as tybamate, have the potential to produce physical dependence of the barbiturate type following periods of prolonged use. Withdrawal of the drug after extensive use may require hospitalization in medically compromised patients. In severe cases the withdrawal can mimic the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal including the potentially lethal status epilepticus.
Psychological dependence has also been linked to carisoprodol use although this is much less severe than with meprobamate itself (presumably due to the slower onset of effects). Psychological dependence is more common in those who use carisoprodol non-medically and those who have a history of substance use (particularly sedatives or alcohol). It may reach clinical significance before physiological tolerance and dependence have occurred and (as with benzodiazepines) has been demonstrated to persist to varying degrees of severity for months or years after discontinuation.
Discontinuation of carisoprodol, as with all GABA-ergics, can result in cognitive changes which persist for weeks, months, or rarely even years including greatly increased anxiety and depression, social withdrawal, hair-trigger agitation/aggression, chronic insomnia, new or aggravated (often illogical) phobias, reduced IQ, short term and long-term memory loss, and dozens of other sequelae. The effects, severity, and duration appear to be slightly dose-dependent but are mainly determined by the patient's pattern of use (taken as prescribed, taken in bulk doses, mixed with other drugs, a combination of the above, etc.), genetic predisposition to substance use, and a history of substance use all increase the patients risk of persistent discontinuation syndrome symptoms.
Treatment for physical withdrawal generally involves switching the patient to a long-acting benzodiazepine such as diazepam or clonazepam then slowly titrating them off the replacement drug completely at a rate which is both reasonably comfortable for the patient but rapid enough for the managing physician to consider the rate of progress acceptable (overly rapid dose reduction greatly increases the risk of patient non-compliance such as the use of illicitly obtained alternative sedatives and/or alcohol). Psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy have demonstrated moderate success in reducing the rebound anxiety which results upon carisoprodol discontinuation but only when combined with regular and active attendance to a substance use support group.
Carisoprodol withdrawal can be life-threatening (especially in high dose users and those who attempt to quit "cold turkey"). Medical supervision is recommended, with gradual reduction of dose of carisoprodol or a substituted medication, typical of other depressant drugs.

### Non-medical use

Combining a muscle relaxant like carisoprodol with opioids and benzodiazepines is referred to as "The Holy Trinity" as it has been reported to increase the power of the "high".
Recreational users of carisoprodol usually seek its potentially heavy sedating, relaxant, and anxiolytic effects. Because of its potentiating effects on narcotics, it is often used in conjunction with many opioid drugs. Carisoprodol is not tested for on standard drug testing screens, although tests for it do exist. 
On 26 March 2010 the DEA issued a Notice of Hearing on a proposal for the placement of carisoprodol in schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act, later confirming its classification under schedule IV. 
Carisoprodol is sometimes mixed with date rape drugs.

## Overdose

As with other GABAergic drugs, combination with other drugs that depress the respiratory system, such as alcohol, sedatives and opioids possess a significant risk to the user in the form of overdose. Overdose symptoms are similar to those of other GABAergics including excessive sedation and unresponsiveness to stimuli, severe ataxia, amnesia, confusion, agitation, intoxication and inappropriate (potentially violent) behavior. Severe overdoses may present with respiratory depression (and subsequent pulmonary aspiration), coma, and death.
Carisoprodol is not detected on all toxicology tests which may delay diagnosis of overdose. Overdose symptoms in combination with opiates are similar but are distinguished by the presentation of normal or pinpoint pupils, which are generally unresponsive to light. Carisoprodol (as with its metabolite meprobamate) is particularly dangerous in combination with alcohol. Flumazenil (the benzodiazepine antidote) is not effective in the management of carisoprodol overdose as carisoprodol acts at the barbiturate binding site. Treatment mirrors that of barbiturate overdoses and is generally supportive, including the administration of mechanical respiration and pressors as indicated and, in rare cases, bemegride. Total amnesia of the experience is not uncommon following recovery.
In 2014 actress Skye McCole Bartusiak died of an overdose due to the combined effects of carisoprodol, hydrocodone and difluoroethane.
In 1999 actress Dana Plato died after taking carisoprodol (Soma) along with a few doses of a hydrocodone / acetaminophen painkiller (Lortab), in an overdose that was ruled a suicide.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Carisoprodol, has a chemical structure similar to glutamate, a neurotransmitter, and dimethylglycine.
Carisoprodol's structural similarity to meprobamate indicates GABAergic activity, including GABAA agonism, similar to the mechanism of benzodiazepines but distinct; benzodiazepines are positive allosteric modulators of the GABA A receptor, and which have no direct agonist activity but rather increase the potency of the endogenous agonist GABA at this receptor. Similar to benzodiazepines, this allows carisoprodol to not only work as a muscle relaxant, but also help with anxiety. However unlike benzodiazepines, carisoprodol does not treat or prevent seizures. In fact it increases the risk of seizures, with the risk being even higher when discontinuing the drug after long-term use, especially if the drug is stopped suddenly, precipitating withdrawal.

### Pharmacokinetics

Carisoprodol has a rapid, 30-minute onset of action, with effects lasting around two to six hours. It is metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P450 oxidase isozyme CYP2C19, excreted by the kidneys and has about an eight-hour half-life. In patients with low levels of CYP2C19 (poor metabolizers), standard doses can lead to increased concentrations of carisoprodol (up-to a four-fold increase). A considerable proportion of carisoprodol is metabolized to meprobamate, which is a known addictive substance; this could account for the addictive potential of carisoprodol (meprobamate levels reach higher peak plasma levels than carisoprodol itself following administration).
It is slightly soluble in water and freely soluble in ethanol, chloroform and acetone. The drug's solubility is practically independent of pH.

## History

In June 1959, several American pharmacologists convened at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan to discuss a newly discovered structural analogue of meprobamate. The substitution of one hydrogen atom with an isopropyl group on one of the carbamyl nitrogens was intended to yield a drug with new pharmacological properties. It had been developed by Frank Berger at Wallace Laboratories and was named carisoprodol.
Building on meprobamate's pharmacological effects, carisoprodol was intended to have better muscle relaxing properties, less potential for addiction, and a lower risk of overdose. Carisoprodol's effect profile did indeed turn out to differ significantly with respect to meprobamate, with carisoprodol possessing stronger muscle relaxant and analgesic effects.

## Usage and legal status

### Norway

Reports from Norway have shown carisoprodol has addictive potential as a prodrug of meprobamate and/or potentiator of hydrocodone, oxycodone, codeine, and similar drugs. In May 2008 it was taken off the market in Norway.

### European Union

In the EU, the European Medicines Agency issued a release recommending member states suspend marketing authorization for this product in the treatment of acute (not chronic) back pain.
As of November 2007, carisoprodol has been taken off the market in Sweden due to problems with dependence and side effects. The agency overseeing pharmaceuticals considered other drugs used with the same indications as carisoprodol to have the same or better effects without the risks of the drug.

### United States

In December 2011, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) issued the final ruling placing carisoprodol on Schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The placement of carisoprodol on Schedule IV was effective in January 2012.

### Canada

Federally, carisoprodol is a prescription drug. Provincial regulations vary. As of April 14, 2025 there are no forms of carisoprodol being marketed in Canada, and the drug was removed from the Prescription Drug List and reclassified as a Schedule V Controlled Substance.

### Australia

Carisoprodol is no longer included in the Australian Register of Theraputic Goods, but can still be accessed through the Special Access Scheme.

### Indonesia

In September 2013, carisoprodol was taken off the market due to problems with diversion, dependence and side effects.
In September 2017, one child died and 50 suffered seizures when pills containg a combination of paracetamol, caffeine, and carisoprodol were mixed into children's drinks in elementary and junior high schools in Kendari.
