## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenothiazines. These are polycyclic aromatic compounds containing a phenothiazine moiety, which is a linear tricyclic system that consists of a two benzene rings joined by a para-thiazine ring.

### Background

Prochlorperazine, also known as compazine, is a piperazine phenothiazine and first-generation antipsychotic drug that is used for the treatment of severe nausea and vomiting, as well as short-term management of psychotic disorders such as generalized non-psychotic anxiety and schizophrenia.
Label
It mainly works by depressing the chemoreceptor trigger zone and blocking D2 dopamine receptors in the brain. It was shown to also block histaminergic, cholinergic and noradrenergic receptors.
9
Prochlorperazine was first developed in the 1950s
11
and was first approved by the FDA in 1956. Although newer antiemetic agents such as 5-HT3 antagonists are more heavily promoted, prochlorperazine is still widely used in nausea and vomiting.
10

### Indication

Indicated for the symptomatic treatment of severe nausea and vomiting.
Label
Indicated for the management of manifestations of psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia and generalized non-psychotic anxiety. The use of prochlorperazine for the management of generalized non-psychotic anxiety is typically not a first-line therapy and should be limited to doses of less than 20 mg per day or for shorter than 12 weeks.
Label
,
8
Off-label uses include use in emergency settings for adult and pediatric migraines. The American Headache Society recommends the use of prochlorperazine as the first-line medication in this setting. In pediatric migraines, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent is often used in combination with dopamine antagonist.
9

### Pharmacodynamics

Prochlorperazine is an antipsychotic agent that works to promote postsynaptic inhibition of dopaminergic neurons.
10
It also exerts its anti-emetic actions via anti-dopaminergic effects, where it displays similar efficacy as ondansteron, a 5HT-3 receptor antagonist and anti-emetic, in preventing delayed nausea and vomiting.
3
Prochlorperazine was shown to inhibit histaminergic, cholinergic and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors.
1
,
9
The blockade of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors may result in sedation, muscle relaxation, and hypotension. It displays anti-anxiety effects as well.
10
Compared to other phenothiazine derivatives, prochlorperazine is less sedating and has a weak propensity for causing hypotension or potentiating the effects of CNS depressants and anesthetics.
12
Other than its primary action on D2 receptors, one study showed that prochlorperazine may inhibit the P2X7 receptor in human macrophages, leading to inhibition of calcium ion influx.
9

### Mechanism of Action

D(2) dopamine receptor
Antagonist

### Absorption

Following oral administration, prochlorperazine is reported to be well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The onset of pharmacological action is about 30 to 40 minutes following oral administration and 10 to 20 minutes following intramuscular administration. The duration of action for all routes is about 3 to 4 hours.
12
Following oral administration in healthy volunteers, the mean oral bioavailability was about 12.5%. In these patients, the time to reach the peak plasma concentrations was about 5 hours. Repeated oral dosing resulted in an accumulation of prochlorperazine and its metabolite. Following multiple twice daily dosing, the steady state of prochlorperazine was reached by 7 days.
1

### Metabolism

Prochlorperazine undergoes hepatic metabolism involving oxidation, hydroxylation, demethylation, sulfoxide formation and conjugation with glucuronic acid.
13
The oxidation reaction is mediated by CYP2D6.
3
N-desmethyl prochlorperazine was detected in the plasma
1
, as well as prochlorperazine sulfoxide, prochlorperazine 7-hydroxide and prochlorperazine sulfoxide 4'-N-oxide, following oral and buccal administration.
5
Prochlorperazine may enter the enterohepatic circulation.

### Toxicity

LD
50
and Overdose
Oral LD
50
in rats is 750 mg/kg. Intraperitoneal and subcutaneous LD
50
in mice are 191 mg/kg and 320 mg/kg, respectively.
MSDS
In placebo-controlled trials, there were increased incidences of mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis receiving antipsychotic medications. The risk of death in drug-treated patients was about 1.6 to 1.7 times that of placebo-treated patients. Deaths were largely resulting from cardiovascular, such as heart failure and sudden death, or infectious, such as pneumonia, conditions.
Label
Due to its antagonist action on dopamine receptors, prochlorperazine is associated with a risk for developing extrapyramidal symptoms such as tardive dyskinesia, which is a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. This risk is also conferred on other antipsychotic agents that block dopamine receptors. It is proposed that increased duration of the drug treatment is likely thus increased total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient leads to increased risk for developing the syndrome and the likelihood that it will become irreversible. As with other antipsychotic agents, prochlorperazine is associated with a risk for causing neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), which is a potentially fatal symptom complex, which is manifested as hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability.
There is no known antidote for prochlorperazine thus overdose treatment should be supportive and symptomatic. Overdose of prochlorperazine may produce dystonic reactions that involve extrapyramidal mechanism. To reduce these symptoms, antiparkinsonism drugs, barbiturates, or diphenhydramine may be used. Symptoms of central nervous system depression, such as somnolence or coma, may also be observed. Amphetamine, destroamphetamine, or caffeine and sodium benzoate may be used to induce stimulatory effects. In contrast, agitation and restlessness may also be seen in case of overdose. Other possible manifestations include convulsions, EKG changes and cardiac arrhythmias, fever, and autonomic reactions such as hypotension, dry mouth and ileus. Hypotension can be responded with the standard measures for managing circulatory shock.
Label
Nonclinical Toxicology
In a rat developmental or reproductive toxicity study, abnormalities in both the reproductive measures and neurobehavioral testing were observed following administration of 25 mg/kg of prochlorperazine.
13
Use in specific populations
As the use of antipsychotic agents during the third trimester of pregnancy is associated with a risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery, the use of prochlorperazine in pregnant patients is generally not recommended and it should be limited after careful consideration of the potential benefit of drug therapy justifying the potential risk to the fetus. Caution should be exercised when prochlorperazine is administered to a nursing mother. While lower doses of prochlorperazine is reported to be safe for elderly patients, caution is still advised, especially those with higher susceptibility to hypotension and neuromuscular reactions.

### Mechanism of action

The mechanism of action of prochlorperazine has not been fully determined, but may be primarily related to its anti-dopaminergic effects. Prochlorperazine blocks the D2 dopamine receptors in the brain, which are somatodendritic autoreceptors. Inhibition of D2 receptor signaling results in the blockade of postsynaptic dopamine receptors in the mesolimbic system
11
and an increased dopamine turnover. Nausea and vomiting are proposed to arise from peripheral or central stimulation of  serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) and dopamine type 2 receptors, the predominant receptors expressed at the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ).

### General Function

A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of fatty acids, steroids and retinoids (PubMed:18698000, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997, PubMed:21289075, PubMed:21576599). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:18698000, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997, PubMed:21289075, PubMed:21576599). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997). Metabolizes endocannabinoid arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide) to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid ethanolamide (20-HETE-EA) and 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid ethanolamides (EpETrE-EAs), potentially modulating endocannabinoid system signaling (PubMed:18698000, PubMed:21289075). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Metabolizes cholesterol toward 25-hydroxycholesterol, a physiological regulator of cellular cholesterol homeostasis (PubMed:21576599). Catalyzes the oxidative transformations of all-trans retinol to all-trans retinal, a precursor for the active form all-trans-retinoic acid (PubMed:10681376). Also involved in the oxidative metabolism of drugs such as antiarrhythmics, adrenoceptor antagonists, and tricyclic antidepressants

## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: 2 mg
- Light: 2.5 - 5 mg
- Common: 5 - 20 mg
- Strong: 20 - 40 mg

**Duration:**
- Total: 4 - 8 hours

**Prochlorperazine** ( **Compazine** , **Stemzine** , **Buccastem M** , **Stemetil** , **Phenotil** ) is a [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) D2 [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) [antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antagonist) that belongs to the [phenothiazine](/w/index.php?title=Phenothiazine&action=edit&redlink=1) class of [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) agents that are used for the treatment of nausea and vertigo. It is also a highly potent typical antipsychotic and is 10–20× more potent than chlorpromazine. It is also used to treat migraine headaches.

## Chemistry

Prochlorperazine is a piperazine derivative of the phenothiazine class of organic compounds. Prochlorperazine contains a thiazine ring, a six-member ring which includes one nitrogen and one sulfur atom. The thiazine ring is fused to two benzene rings, creating a tricyclic phenothiazine. Prochlorperazine contains a chlorine atom bound to R 2 of the phenothiazine group.

Additionally, there is a three carbon propyl chain bound at R 10 to the nitrogen atom of the structure. The propyl chain is bound at its terminal carbon to a piperazine ring at R 1 . Piperazine is a six-membered saturated ring with two nitrogen atoms at positions 1 and 4. The piperazine ring of prochlorperazine is also substituted at R 4 with a methyl group. Prochlorperazine is found in pills as a maleate. It is analogous to [chlorpromazine](/w/index.php?title=Chlorpromazine&action=edit&redlink=1) , another antipsychotic phenothiazine.

## Pharmacology

Prochlorperazine is thought to exert its [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) effects by blocking [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) receptors.

Prochlorperazine is analogous to [chlorpromazine](/w/index.php?title=Chlorpromazine&action=edit&redlink=1) ; both of these agents [antagonize](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antagonist) [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) D2 receptors in various pathways of the central nervous system. This D2 blockade results in antipsychotic, antiemetic and other effects.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

## Toxicity and harm potential

Nervous system side effects have been associated with the use of prochlorperazine. [Extrapyramidal side effects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrapyramidal_symptoms) such as acute [dystonic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystonia) reactions, [pseudoparkinsonism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinsonism) (not to be confused with Parkinson's disease), or akathisia can affect 2% of patients at low doses, whereas higher doses may affect as many as 40% of patients.

Prochlorperazine can also cause a life-threatening condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Some symptoms of NMS include a high fever, stiff muscles, confusion, irregular pulse or blood pressure, a fast heart rate (tachycardia), sweating, or irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias).

### Lethal dosage

The lethal dosage of this compound is unknown. Symptoms of overdose, however, may include agitation, coma, confusion, difficulty breathing, fainting, irregular heartbeat, loss of consciousness, muscle spasms, uncontrolled muscle movements, restlessness, seizures, severe constipation, stomach pain, severe drowsiness, dizziness, tremors, or trouble urinating.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other antipsychotics, dependence can be present with long-term use and is both physical and psychological dependence. When physical dependence has developed, withdrawal symptoms may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

## Legal status

- **Australia** : The substance is Schedule 3, meaning it is available with the advice of a pharmacist without a prescription. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **United Kingdom** : The drug is available over the counter as a pharmacy medicine and as a prescription medication. The OTC brand is Buccastem M, a [buccal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_Administration#Buccal) delivery system of prochlorperazine for motion sickness or nausea.
- **United States** : Prochlorperazine is available only through prescription. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Prochlorperazine, formerly sold under the brand name Compazine among others, is a medication used to treat nausea, migraines, schizophrenia, psychosis and anxiety. It is a less preferred medication for anxiety. It may be taken by mouth, rectally, injection into a vein, or injection into a muscle.
Common side effects include sleepiness, blurry vision, low blood pressure, and dizziness. Serious side effects may include movement disorders including tardive dyskinesia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is generally not recommended. It is a typical antipsychotic which is believed to work by reducing the action of dopamine in the brain.
Prochlorperazine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1956. It is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 355th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 600 thousand prescriptions.

## Medical uses

### Vomiting

Prochlorperazine is used to prevent vomiting caused by chemotherapy, radiation therapy and in the pre- and postoperative setting. A 2015 Cochrane review found no differences in efficacy among drugs commonly used for this purpose in emergency rooms.

### Migraine

Prochlorperazine, generally by intravenous, is used to treat migraine. Such use is recommended by The American Headache Society. A 2019 systematic review found prochlorperazine was nearly three times more likely than metoclopramide to relieve headache within 60 minutes of administration.

### Labyrinthitis

In the UK prochlorperazine maleate has been used for labyrinthitis, which includes nausea and vertigo.

## Side effects

Sedation is very common, and extrapyramidal side effects are common and include restlessness, dystonic reactions, pseudoparkinsonism, and akathisia; the extrapyramidal symptoms can affect 2% of people at low doses, whereas higher doses may affect as many as 40% of people.
Prochlorperazine can also cause a life-threatening condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Some symptoms of NMS include high fever, stiff muscles, neck muscle spasms, confusion, irregular pulse or blood pressure, fast heart rate (tachycardia), sweating, and abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias). Research from the Veterans Administration and the United States Food and Drug Administration show injection site reactions. Adverse effects are similar in children.

### Warning

The FDA-approved label for prochlorperazine includes a warning for increased risk of mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis.

### Discontinuation

The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time.
There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped.

## Pharmacology

Prochlorperazine is thought to exert its antipsychotic effects by blocking dopamine receptors.
Prochlorperazine is analogous to chlorpromazine; both of these agents antagonize dopaminergic D2 receptors in various pathways of the central nervous system. This D2 blockade results in antipsychotic, antiemetic and other effects. Hyperprolactinemia is a side effect of dopamine antagonists as blockade of D2 receptors within the tuberoinfundibular pathway results in increased plasma levels of prolactin due to increased secretion by lactotrophs in the anterior pituitary.
Following intramuscular injection, the antiemetic action is evident within 5 to 10 minutes and lasts for three to four hours. Rapid action is also noted after buccal treatment. With oral dosing, the start of action is delayed but the duration is somewhat longer (approximately six hours).

## Society and culture

In the United Kingdom, prochlorperazine is available for the treatment of nausea caused by migraine as a tablet dissolved in the mouth, and in Australia as a tablet swallowed whole. In the UK, it is available via a prescription and as a pharmacy medicine, meaning it does not require a prescription but is only available after talking with a pharmacist.

### Marketing

Prochlorperazine is available as tablets, suppositories, and in an injectable form.
As of September 2017 it was marketed under the trade names Ametil, Antinaus, Buccastem, Bukatel, Chlormeprazine, Chloropernazine, Compazine, Compro, Daolin, Dhaperazine, Emedrotec, Emetiral, Eminorm, Lotamin, Mitil, Mormal, Nautisol, Novamin, Novomit, Proazine, Procalm, Prochlorperazin, Prochlorperazine, Prochlorpérazine, Prochlorperazinum, Prochlozine, Proclorperazina, Promat, Promin, Promtil, Roumin, Scripto-metic, Seratil, Stemetil, Steremal, Vergon, Vestil, and Volimin.

### Historical Formulations

Prochlorperazine was combined with paracetamol and marketed for humans as the combination drug Vestil-A; it was combined with isopropamide (brand name Darbazine) as a combination drug for veterinary use. 
Until 1981, a combination diet pill composed of prochlorperazine and dextroamphetamine was marketed as Eskatrol in the United States by Smith, Kline & French Laboratories.

## Research

Alexza Pharmaceuticals studied an inhaled form of prochlorperazine for the treatment of migraine through Phase II trials under the development name AT-001; development was discontinued in 2011.

## Synthesis

The alkylation of 2-chlorophenothiazine (1) and 1-(3-Chloropropyl)-4-methylpiperazine [104-16-5] (2) in the presence of sodamide gives Prochlorperazine (3); or by alkylation of 2-Chloro-10-(3-chloropropyl)phenothiazine [2765-59-5] (4) and 1-methylpiperazine (5).
