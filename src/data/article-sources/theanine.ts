## Subjective Experience

Discovered as a component of green tea in 1949, theanine is usually presented as a
neutralizer for mood or anxiety, and sometimes, as an enhancer of cognitive
performance. It is also frequently claimed to be synergistic with caffeine. For this
reason I will initially take it with my morning tea.

I never have high expectations of materials which are sold as supplements, nor in fact
of nootropics in general, so this isn’t an exercise that I am particularly looking
forward to. Having stated this, it has plenty of positive reviews, including on a
number of drug related websites.

From the research, I anticipate an onset of about 30 minutes, and a duration of
perhaps 3 hours or so.

I open the packet, freshly (and legally) purchased from Amazon, to reveal a very
fluffy white powder. So light is its constitution that some of it puffs out of the bag,
making a bit of a mess of my desk.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I weigh 300mg on the scales and pour it into my now half-empty cup
of green tea. I slowly drink this over the next 5 minutes. [09.15am]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:10 The mild caffeine jump is emerging and it does seem to have a slightly
different character to usual. This isn’t the easiest to assess, as it is somewhat
on the margins, but it does align with claims that it takes some of the edge
from caffeine stimulation.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
In addition, I was tired this morning, and although I still am, I am less
inclined to want to sleep (although simultaneously I am not buzzing, jittery or
fuzzy). Is there a sense of increased clarity? It is subtle, but perhaps there is.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:30 I have seen theanine described as relaxing but not sedating and I
wouldn’t disagree with this assessment. What I can also state confidently at
this point is that it has had an impact on the effects of the caffeine, making it
smoother and noticeably mellower.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 There have been no major developments since the last note, with the
calmative effect on the caffeine-high still in play, and a perception of greater
clarity of mind still present.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I should stress that this is all in the shallow end in terms of impact, but there
is definitely something to it, and it is pleasant.
\`\`\`
These effects gently faded during the course of the morning, delivering a very soft
landing and enabling my early afternoon nap to proceed as usual.

At 5:30pm I decided to take another 300mg, but this time without the caffeine.
Would this have any effect at a time I was feeling a little stressed? Surprisingly, it did.
It removed anxiety and induced a relaxed disposition for some hours. I was a little
worn and tired at times, but I cannot deny the existence of psychoactivity.

The following morning I awoke normally and I felt fine. I did experience a little
stomach upset overnight but this could be attributed to the substantial meal I ate
during the previous evening, rather than the large (possibly excessive) doses I
experimented with. With respect to this I would use significantly less on any future
theanine expeditions.

Finally, I subsequently discovered both historical and contemporary accounts of
monks drinking green tea because it aids meditation. Bearing in mind that green tea
is higher in theanine content than other teas, from my experiences above I can
certainly see why it would lend itself to this. Mindfulness, calmness and alertness are
indeed words that align well with what was a gentle and pleasing sojourn.

**L-Theanine** (also known as **Theanine** , **L-γ-glutamylethylamide** and **N5-ethyl-L-glutamine** ) is an analog of the amino acids of [glutamate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Glutamate) and glutamine. It was discovered as a constituent of green tea in 1949 and in 1950 was isolated from gyokuro leaves, which have high theanine content.

The appearance of the name "theanine" without a prefix is understood to imply the L- [enantiomer](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Enantiomer) , which is the form found in fresh teas and in some, but not all dietary supplements. The opposite D-enantiomer has far less studied pharmacologic properties, but is present in racemic chemical preparations, and substantially in some studied theanine supplements.

This compound is used as a [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) for its calming and relaxing properties. It is often taken in combination with [caffeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Caffeine) as it has been shown to mitigate its negative aspects, such as [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) and [diminished sleep quality](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness) , while possibly improving upon the positive aspects. Its ability to enhance attention has been repeatedly verified.

A recent systematic review of the effects of theanine and caffeine has confirmed that the combination seems to improve aspects of attention. The combination of L-theanine and caffeine may improve attention more than caffeine alone.

## Chemistry

Theanine, or N-ethyl-L-glutamine, is an amino acid analogue of L-glutamine. Its structure is comprised of a five carbon straight chain carboxylic acid called pentanoic acid, which is bonded to an amino group at R 2 , and an additional ketone group at R 5 . Also substituted at R 5 of the pentanoic group is an ethylamino chain connected at its amino constituent. Theanine is understood to refer to the levorotary enantiomer, which is well documented, rather than the relatively unresearched dextrorotary enantiomer.

## Pharmacology

Theanine is structurally similar to the excitatory [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) [glutamate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Glutamate) , and in accordance, binds to glutamate [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) , though with much lower affinity in comparison. Specifically, it binds to ionotropic glutamate receptors including the [AMPA](/w/index.php?title=AMPA&action=edit&redlink=1) and [kainate](/w/index.php?title=Kainate&action=edit&redlink=1) receptors and, to a lesser extent, the [NMDA](/w/index.php?title=NMDA&action=edit&redlink=1) receptor. It acts as an [antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antagonist) of the former two sites and as an [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) of the latter site. In addition, it inhibits glutamine transporters and glutamate transporters, and thus acts as [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) of glutamine and glutamate.

Theanine increases [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) , and [glycine](/w/index.php?title=Glycine&action=edit&redlink=1) levels in various areas of the brain. It also affects [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) in a manner which is still a matter of debate in the scientific community, with separate studies showing increases and decreases in brain serotonin levels using similar experimental protocols.

These various changes in neurotransmitter levels contribute to the calming and nootropic properties of theanine.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** & **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - Theanine is mildly stimulating at [light](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage#light) to [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage#common) dosages but becomes sedating starting with [strong doses](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage#Strong) at around 300mg.
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)** - At [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage#Heavy) doses, theanine induces muscle relaxation that is vaguely comparable to that of the relaxation produced by [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) .
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - Theanine can produce a physical feeling of glowing warmth that is present throughout one's body at higher doses.
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)** - Headaches are usually only reported at high doses, well above 200mg. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)** - Theanine produces anxiolytic effects which are comparable to a mild dose of a benzodiazepine but without the accompanying [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) .
- **[Mindfulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)** - Some users report that theanine can produce uniquely distinct states of mindfulness.
- **[Memory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_enhancement)** - Theanine has been shown to improve memory and attention in subjects with mild cognitive impairments.
- **[Addiction suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Addiction_suppression)** - Some anecdotal reports suggest that theanine may mitigate some of the effects of [opioid withdrawal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid_withdrawal) , aswell as withdrawal from GABAergic substances like [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) and [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines)
- **[Thought organization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_organization)**
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: Theanine](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Theanine.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

Theanine is non-addictive, is not known to cause brain damage, and has an extremely low toxicity relative to dose. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] There are relatively few physical side effects associated with acute theanine exposure. Various studies have shown that in reasonable doses in a careful context, it presents no negative cognitive, psychiatric or toxic physical consequences. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Theanine is not habit-forming.

Tolerance to the effects of theanine are built up after prolonged and repeated usage. After noticeable tolerance has been built, it takes about 5 days for tolerance to be reduced by half and 10 days return to baseline. Theanine presents cross-tolerance with no other known compounds, meaning that after the consumption of theanine all other psychoactive compounds will not have a reduced effect.

## Legal status

Theanine is freely available to possess and distribute and is approved in most countries as a dietary supplement.

- **Canada** Theanine is available as a dietary supplement and is freely available to possess and distribute in Canada. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

  "wikipedia": `# Theanine
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine*

Theanine , also known as L-γ-glutamylethylamide, N5-ethyl-L-glutamine, or γ-glutamylethylamide, is a bioactive, non-proteinogenic amino acid similar to the proteinogenic amino acids glutamic acid and L-glutamine. It is produced by certain plants such as the tea plant (Camellia sinensis), and by some fungi. Theanine was discovered in 1949 as a constituent of green tea and was isolated in 1950 from gyokuro tea leaves. Theanine constitutes about 1–2% of the dry weight of green tea leaves.
Theanine is sold as a dietary supplement. It is packaged in gelatin capsules, tablets, and as a powder, and may be an ingredient in branded supplements with caffeine. It is also used as an ingredient in food and beverages. Japan approved its unlimited use in all foods (including chocolates, soft drinks, and herb teas) except infant food in 1964, and the US Food and Drug Administration has considered it to be safe at doses up to 250 milligrams (mg) per serving since 2007. 
In 2011, the European Food Safety Authority found there was insufficient evidence for a causal relationship between theanine consumption and improved cognitive function, alleviation of psychological stress, maintenance of normal sleep, or reduction of menstrual discomfort. A 2025 review found that theanine has been poorly studied to date, having inconsistent research quality and unreliable clinical trials.

## Structure and properties

The chemical name N5-ethyl-L-glutamine and other synonyms (see box) for theanine reflect its chemical structure. The name theanine, without prefix, is generally understood to imply the L- (S-) enantiomer, derived from the related proteinogenic L-amino acid glutamic acid. Theanine is an analog of this amino acid, and its primary amide, L-glutamine (also a proteinogenic amino acid). Theanine is a derivative of glutamine that is ethylated on the amide nitrogen (as the name N5-ethyl-L-glutamine describes), or alternatively, to the amide formed from ethylamine and L-glutamic acid at its γ- (5-) side chain carboxylic acid group (as the name γ-L-glutamylethylamide describes).
Relative to theanine, the opposite (D-, R-) enantiomer is largely absent from the literature, except implicitly. While natural extracts that are not harshly treated are presumed to contain only the biosynthetic L- enantiomeric form, mishandled isolates and racemic chemical preparations of theanines necessarily contain both theanine and its D-enantiomer (and from racemic syntheses, in equal proportion), and studies have suggested that the D-isomer may actually predominate in some commercial supplement preparations. Amino acid racemization in aqueous media is a well-established chemical process promoted by elevated temperature and non-neutral pH values; prolonged heating of Camellia extracts—possible for oversteeped teas and in undisclosed commercial preparative processes—has been reported to result in increasing racemization of theanine to give increasing proportions of the nonnatural D-theanine, up to equal proportions of each enantiomer.

## Discovery and distribution

Theanine is found primarily in plant and fungal species. It was discovered as a constituent of tea (Camellia sinensis) in 1949, and in 1950 a laboratory in Kyoto successfully isolated it from gyokuro leaf, which has high theanine content. Theanine is substantially present in black, green, and white teas from Camellia sinensis in quantities of about 1% of the dry weight. Deliberately shading tea plants from direct sunlight, as is done for matcha and gyokuro green tea, increases L-theanine content. The L-enantiomer is the form found in freshly prepared teas and some human dietary supplements.

## Digestion and metabolism

As a structural analog of glutamate and glutamine, the theanine in teas or supplements  is absorbed in the small intestine after oral ingestion; its hydrolysis to L-glutamate and ethylamine occur both in the intestine and liver, possibly functioning as a donor for glutamate synthesis.

## In vitro

Theanine is structurally similar to the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and binds to glutamate receptors in vitro, though with much lower affinity in comparison. Specifically, it binds to ionotropic glutamate receptors in the micromolar range, including the AMPA and kainate receptors and, to a lesser extent, the NMDA receptor. It acts as an antagonist of the former two sites, and a partial co-agonist of the NMDA receptors. In vitro, theanine also binds to group I mGluRs. In addition, it inhibits glutamine transporters and glutamate transporters, and thus blocks the reuptake of glutamine and glutamate.
Theanine may elicit umami taste, a consequence potentially associated with binding to and activation of the T1R1 + T1R3 heterodimer or umami (savory) taste receptor.

## Regulatory status

The regulatory status of theanine varies by country. It is sold as a dietary supplement across the United States and European Union. In Japan, L-theanine has been approved for use in all foods, with some restrictions in the case of infant foods. In the United States, the FDA considers it to be GRAS and allows its use as an ingredient in foods and beverages up to a maximum of 250 mg per serving.
In 2003, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (Bundesinstitut für Risikobewertung, BfR), an agency of their Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture, objected to the addition of isolated theanine to beverages. While it was estimated the quantity of green tea consumed by the average Japanese tea drinker per day contains about 20 mg of the substance, there were no studies measuring the amount of theanine being extracted by typical preparation methods, or the percentage lost by discarding the first infusion. Therefore, with the Japanese being exposed to possibly much less than 20 mg per day, it was the opinion of the BfR that pharmacological reactions to drinks typically containing 50 mg of theanine per 500 milliliters could not be excluded –reactions such as impairment of psychomotor skills and amplification of the sedating effects of alcohol and hypnotics.
On November 13, 2023, an Inspection by the Administration of Food Safety, Veterinary Medicine and Plant Protection of the Republic of Slovenia banned the sale of Prime energy drinks in Slovenia as they contain L-theanine, which is not allowed in non-alcoholic beverages. Prime Hydration may be freely sold.

## Research on supplement use

Theanine supplements have been marketed with a variety of claims that they improve cognitive performance, reduce stress, improve sleep quality, and alleviate menstrual cramps. Evaluating these claims in 2011, the European Food Safety Authority assessed they were not supported by evidence in studies provided at that time.
A 2020 review of low-quality studies suggested that L-theanine supplementation of 200–400 milligrams per day may reduce stress and anxiety in people with acute stress, but there was insufficient evidence for the use of L-theanine as a medication to treat stress and anxiety. A 2024 review indicated that L-theanine supplementation may be more effective than placebo in alleviating psychopathological symptoms associated with anxiety disorders, ADHD, and schizophrenia.
A 2025 review reported that theanine research has lacked rigor, was mainly based on anecdotes, had ill-defined mechanisms, and exhibited unreliable clinical trials.
