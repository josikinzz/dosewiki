Salvinorin B Ethoxymethyl Ether
 
Basics
 
by Erowid
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
Salvinorin B ethoxymethyl ether is a novel and unusually potent artificial salvinorin with an extremely limited history of use; the first known human bioassays occurred in 2008. 
 
[ [Main Salvinorin B Ethoxymethyl Ether Vault](https://erowid.org/salvinorin_b_ethoxymethyl_ether.shtml) ]
 
Dose #
 
Threshold dose when vaporized is between 10 and 50 micrograms; marked effects occur between 150 and 300 micrograms. The potency of salvinorin B ethoxymethyl ether is rivaled only by a few synthetic compounds, such as LSD and some opioids.
 
Price #
 
Has not been reported for sale anywhere.
 
Law #
 
Salvinorin B ethoxymethyl ether is not specifically scheduled. However, it may be considered illegal in states where salvinorin A is scheduled if those states have controlled substance analog laws.
 
Chemistry #
 
Salvinorin B ethoxymethyl ether is an artificial compound created via a semi-synthetic method using salvinorin B, which is not psychoactive, as the starting material. 1
 
Pharmacology #
 
Salvinorin B ethoxymethyl ether is among the most potent and selective kappa opioids reported to date. Although the naltrexone derivative nalfurafine (TRK-820) is even more potent, it shows much lower selectivity. Salvinorin B ethoxymethyl ether appears to exclusively target the kappa opioid receptors. Salvinorin B ethoxymethyl ether was shown to be about ten times as potent as salvinorin A in vitro, and this increased potency has been confirmed via limited human bioassays.
 
Production #
 
Production Summary Needed.
 
History #
 
On October 24, 2007, *Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry* (online edition) published an article by Thomas A. Munro and his colleagues regarding their work with salvinorin B ethoxymethyl ether and several other salvinorin B alkoxymethyl ethers.
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
The Substance:
 
Symmetry.
 
The Experience:
 
No common terms known.
 
EFFECTS #
 
Threshold dose when vaporized is between 10 and 50 micrograms. Marked effects occur at 150 to 300 micrograms, vaporized. Effects commence within seconds, peak in about a minute, and diminish rapidly after about five minutes, similar to salvinorin A. However, unlike with smoked or vaporized salvinorin A, minor effects are still noticeable at the half-hour point. Effects reported at doses of 100 to 200 micrograms include: spoked geometric closed- and open-eye visions, alterations in perspective, and palinopsia ("trails" or pronounced afterimages). At higher doses of up to 400 micrograms, effects reported include mental confusion, derealization, and more vivid geometric visions. A sense of "foreboding" has been reported at both lower and higher doses. The effects appear to be similar to those produced by salvinorin A, although one individual experienced with both compounds expressed the opinion that s/he would be able to distinguish between the two. 2
 
Onset #
 
Effects of vaporizing the material begin within seconds.
 
Duration #
 
Effects diminish rapidly after about five minutes, similar to salvinorin A. However, unlike with smoked or vaporized salvinorin A, minor effects are still noticeable at the half-hour point.
 
Visuals #
 
In the very few people who have tried it, visual effects have included spoked geometric closed- and open-eye visions, alterations in perspective, and palinopsia ("trails" or pronounced afterimages). At higher doses of up to 400 micrograms, the visions can be more vivid and geometric.
 
PROBLEMS #
 
No problems have been reported from the use of salvinorin B ethoxymethyl ether. Potential problems may be similar to those found with salvinorin A or *Salvia divinorum* .
 
Contraindications #
 
There are no known contraindications related to salvinorin B ethoxymethyl ether. However, competitive opioid antagonists that include kappa opioid receptors among their target receptors, such as naltrexone (and to a lesser extent, naloxone), are likely to block the effects of salvinorin B ethoxymethyl ether.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
It is very unlikely that salvinorin B ethoxymethyl ether is addictive. However, it has not been studied for addiction liability.

**Salvinorin B methoxymethyl ether** ( **2-O-methoxymethylsalvinorin B** , or **2-MMSB** ) is a semi-synthetic analogue of the natural product [Salvinorin A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Salvinorin_A) which is used in scientific research. It has a longer duration of action of around 2–3 hours, compared to less than 30 minutes for salvinorin A, and has increased affinity and potency at the κ-opioid receptor. Like the related compound herkinorin, salvinorin B methoxymethyl ether is made from salvinorin B, which is most conveniently made from salvinorin A by deacetylation, as while both salvinorin A and salvinorin B are found in the plant Salvia divinorum, salvinorin A is present in larger quantities.

Salvinorin B methoxymethyl ether has a Ki of 0.60 nM at the κ opioid receptor, and is around five times more potent than salvinorin A in animal studies, although it is still only half as potent as its stronger homolog salvinorin B ethoxymethyl ether.

Salvinorin B methoxymethyl ether (2-O-methoxymethylsalvinorin B) is a semi-synthetic analogue of the natural product salvinorin A used in scientific research. It has a longer duration of action of around 2–3 hours, compared to less than 30 minutes for salvinorin A, and has increased affinity and potency at the κ-opioid receptor. It is prepared from salvinorin B. The crystal structure is almost superimposable with that of salvinorin A. Structures bound to the κ-opioid receptor have also been reported.
Salvinorin B methoxymethyl ether has a Ki of 0.60 nM at the κ opioid receptor, and is around five times more potent than salvinorin A in animal studies, although it is still only half as potent as its ethoxymethyl ether homolog, 'symmetry'.
