Legal Status

U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Paroxetine**
- REGULATED: No
- STATUS: Over-The-Counter
- SCHEDULE: Un-Scheduled
 
Propylhexedrine (Benzedrex) is unscheduled in the United States and is approved for over-the-counter sale. Propylhexedrine is legal to buy, possess, and ingest without a license or prescription. Sales for human consumption are regulated by the FDA and each formulation or product requires specific FDA approval. 
 
 It appears that Propylhexedrine was placed in Schedule V in the United States in May 4, 1988 (53 FR 10869) and then removed from Schedule V on Dec 3, 1991 (56 FR 61372). Unfortunately, we do not have access to the federal register entry to determine why it was unscheduled. [ [DEA Ref](http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/actions/chronlogical.htm#2000) ]
