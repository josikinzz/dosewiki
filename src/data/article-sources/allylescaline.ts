## SYNTHESIS
A suspension of 4.0 g LAH in 150 mL anhydrous THF under N2 was cooled to 0 Â°C and vigorously stirred. There was added, dropwise, 2.8 mL 100% H2SO4, followed by 5.5 g 3,5-dimethoxy-4-allyloxyphenylacetonitrile in 10 mL anhydrous THF. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0 Â°C for a few min, then brought to a reflux on the steam bath for 30 min. After cooling back to room temperature, there was added sufficient IPA to destroy the excess hydride, followed by sufficient 10% NaOH to form granular solids. These were removed by filtration, and washed with 20 mL IPA. The filtrate and washes were stripped of solvent under vacuum andthe residue added to 100 mL dilute H2SO4. This was washed with 2Ã50 mL CH2Cl2, made basic with aqueous NaOH, and extracted with 2Ã75 mL CH2Cl2. These extracts were pooled, the solvent removed under vacuum, and the residue distilled at 110â120 Â°C at 0.4 mm/Hg to give 4.9 g of a colorless oil. This was dissolved in 15 mL IPA, neutralized with concentrated HCl (55 drops required), and diluted with 50 mL Et2O. The product was removed by filtration, washed with Et2O, and air dried to give 4.9 g of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-allyloxyphenethylamine hydrochloride (AL) as white crystals.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 24 mg) âThe onset was extremely gradual and graceful, with the first alert that one could really sense at about 50 minutes. This was succeeded by a slow gentle climb to the peak at one hour and fifteen minutes. The experience itself left all of the sensory modalities functional; speech was cogent and rather fluid. In fact, there was an unusual ease of free association. All throughout the session, the talk was high in spirits and somehow indicative of an inner excitement. Affect was entirely pleasant, but not exalting nor conducive to insight or to problem solving. There were no requirements for withdrawal into the self. The material seemed wholly social in nature. No visual, auditory or olfactory sharpening was in evidence. The plateau for this material seemed unusually long. I was unable to sleep for several hours, and took 25 mg Librium before sleep arrived. The next day was a lethargic and slow one, with the inner feeling that the effects had not worn off until the middle of the day following ingestion.â

(with 35 mg) âI was a distinct +1 in 35 minutes and a +2 by the end of the hour. My head congestion in no way cleared up, absolving the material from having that particular virtue. The entire experience was somewhat dissociatedâI could not connect with my feelings. Although my mind remained clear, there was a hangover feeling at the end of the experiment.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
As AL is one of the most potent 3,4,5-trisubstituted phenethylamines yet described, and since the corresponding amphetamines are of yet greater potency, it would be a good guess that 4-allyloxy-3,5-dimethoxyamphetamine (3C-AL) would be an interesting compound to explore. It could be made from syringaldehyde in reaction with allyl iodide, followed by the formation of a nitrostyrene with nitroethane, followed by reduction with aluminum hydride. It is, as of the present time, both unsynthesized and unexplored.

## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: 15 mg
- Light: 20 - 30 mg
- Common: 30 - 40 mg
- Strong: 40 - 60 mg
- Heavy: 60 mg +

**Duration:**
- Total: 8 - 12 hours
- Onset: 45 - 240 minutes

**4-Allyloxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine** (also known as **allylescaline** ) is a lesser-known novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) class. It is a structural analog of [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) and related to [escaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Escaline) and [methallylescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methallylescaline) . It is relatively uncommon and has little to no history of human usage.

The effects of this compound were first described by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) in his book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) : A Chemical Love Story. He lists the dosage range as 20 – 35 mg orally and describes the duration of action to be 8 - 12 hours.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index) bear appreciable similarity to [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) and include [open and closed-eye visuals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) , [time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion) , [enhanced introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) , [conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking) , [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , and [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) . However, it is reported to produce comparatively less visual and cognitive effects when compared to mescaline or other closely related analogs.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of allylescaline. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

Allylescaline, or 4-allyloxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is a substituted phenethylamine featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino -NH2 group through an ethyl chain. Escaline contains two methoxy functional groups CH 3 O- which are attached to carbons R 3 , and R 5 and an additional allyloxy group at carbon R 4 of the phenyl ring. Allylescaline is the 4-allyloxy analog of [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) .

Allylescaline, also referred to as 4-allyloxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is research compounds that is not well-known. The IUPAC name for Allylescaline is 4-Allyloxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine 4-Allyloxy-3,5-dimethoxy-1-ethylami with the molecular formula being C13H19NO3 and a molecular weight of 237.29 g/mol. Allylescaline is known to have an average mass of 237.294998 Da and a monoisotopic mass of 237.136002 Da.

## Pharmacology

Allylescaline acts as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . The [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from allylescaline's efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptors. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

It is the 4O-allyl homolog of mescaline, and binds similarly to the serotonin receptors. It seems to have considerably increased potency by weight, with an active dose in humans reported to be 20-40 mg (compared to 300-400 mg for mescaline).

It is relatively uncommon and has little to no history of human usage. Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of allylescaline. The effects of this compound were first described by Alexander Shulgin in his book PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, allylescaline is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating without being forced. For example, when taken in any environment it will usually encourage physical activities such as running, walking, climbing or dancing. In comparison, other more commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) or [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) are generally sedating and relaxed.
- **[Spontaneous tactile sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_tactile_sensations)** - The "body high" of allylescaline can be characterized as proportionally very intense in comparison to its accompanying visual and cognitive effects. It is manifested in a number of forms including an intense soft, warm glow that grows over the body and is capable of becoming extremely physically euphoric. This is contrasted by a pleasant yet sharp electric sensation that moves up and down the body.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - Allylescaline causes enhanced tactile sensations at all doses. Notably, allylescaline causes awareness of every sensation and every nerve ending in the body once level 8A geometry is reached. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - Relative to other psychedelics, allylescaline has been noted for the physically euphoric aspect that is vaguely reminiscent of other [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) . In high or excessive dosages this effect can be diminished by uncomfortable physical side effects.
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** - When it occurs, this effect is mild to moderate
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Mild to extreme nausea is commonly reported and either passes instantly once the user has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Muscle cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_cramps)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational allylescaline use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because allylescaline is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people within the psychonaut community who have tried allylescaline suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Allylescaline is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of allylescaline is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Allylescaline presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of allylescaline all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

## Legal issues

- **Germany** : Allylescaline is controlled under Anlage I BtMG ( *Narcotics Act, Schedule I* ) as of February 1, 1997 (called " *4-Allyloxy-3,5-dimethoxy-phenethylazan* "). It is illegal to manufacture, possess, import, export, buy, sell, procure or dispense it without a license.
- **Japan** : Allylescaline is a controlled substance in Japan effective March 25th, 2015.
- **Sweden** : Allylescaline is illegal in Sweden as of January 2016.
- **Switzerland** : Allylescaline is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis E.
- **United Kingdom** : It is illegal to produce, supply, or import this drug under the Psychoactive Substance Act, which came into effect on May 26th, 2016.

Allylescaline (AL), or allylmescaline, also known as 4-allyloxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine and scaline families related to mescaline. It is taken orally.
The drug acts as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, including the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. It is closely related to other scalines including mescaline, escaline, and proscaline, among others.
Allylescaline was first described in the scientific literature by Otakar Leminger in 1972. Subsequently, it was further described by Alexander Shulgin in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved). It was encountered as a novel designer drug in 2013.

## Use and effects

According to Alexander Shulgin in his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved) and other publications, the dose range of allylescaline is 20 to 35 mg and its duration is 8 to 12 hours. Its onset ranged from 10 minutes to 50 minutes, with peak effects occurring at around 1 to 1.25 hours. The drug has been described as having a very gradual onset, an unusually long plateau of effects, a very gradual descent, and some effects persisting past 12 hours or even into the middle of the next day. Allylescaline is about 10 times as potent as mescaline, which has a listed dose range of 200 to 400 mg. It was the most potent scaline (mescaline analogue) of all those described.
The effects of allylescaline have been reported to include perceptual changes, warmer and enhanced colors, objects looking different or more "plastic", colorful hallucinations in the dark, surroundings being much more interesting than usual, no sharpening of the senses including visual, auditory, or olfactory, pleasantly and abundantly increased energy, creative and free-flowing thoughts, clearheadedness, unusual ease of free association, everything feeling funny and laughter, feelings of inner excitement and enjoyment, desire to move, simultaneous positive and negative feelings, working through and being freed of depression, feelings of dissociation and being disconnected from one's thoughts, wholly social and no requirement of withdrawal, religious feelings and connection, slight vertigo, light drunkenness, restless sleep and unusual and difficult dreams during sleep, and next-day hangover such as lethargy.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Allylescaline acts as a potent agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, including the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. It also possesses other activities, such as weak interactions with dopamine D2-like receptors. A 2021 study evaluated the pharmacodynamics of many scalines, but did not include allylescaline. However, a subsequent 2025 study comprehensively assessed and reported the drug's pharmacodynamics.

## Chemistry

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of allylescaline has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of allylescaline include mescaline, escaline, proscaline, methallylescaline, cyclopropylmescaline, and 3C-AL, among others.

## History

Allylescaline was first synthesized and studied by Otakar Leminger in 1972. The drug was later synthesized by Alexander Shulgin and further described in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved). It was encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe in 2013.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Sweden

Allylescaline is illegal in Sweden as of January 2016.
