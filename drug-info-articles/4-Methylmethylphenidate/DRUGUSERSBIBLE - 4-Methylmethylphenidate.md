## Subjective Experience

This was on the market for just a few months in the middle of 2015, having been
released shortly after the UK ban on EPH and other phenidates. However, I found it
to be a little uninspiring and dull, despite a session of fairly hefty redosing.

It provided an EPH-like functional stimulation, with little recreational action. I felt
that something was missing, although I am not sure what.

So disappointing was it that I used it on just the one occasion, and left the rest in its
baggy for over two years. It was eventually binned.

To be fair, others have reported far more positively than this, with a handful even
citing a recreational edge at high doses.
