Insufflation causes significant nasal discomfort. Compulsive redosing is extremely common, often leading to 0.5-2 gram sessions. Limited long-term safety data exists; preliminary evidence suggests neurotoxic and cardiotoxic risks with chronic use. Low oral bioavailability (7 percent) explains preference for insufflation.

      "notes": "5-APB is commonly sold as 'Benzofury' and is structurally related to MDA and MDMA. The hydrochloride salt is 10% more potent by mass than the succinate salt, so doses should be adjusted accordingly. High affinity for the 5-HT2B receptor suggests significant cardiotoxicity risk with chronic use, similar to fenfluramine and MDMA. Adverse reactions including cardiovascular issues and serotonin syndrome have been reported, especially at high doses or in combinations. Legal status varies by country; classified as Class B in the UK and controlled in many jurisdictions.",

Unlike N,N-DMT, 5-MeO-DMT is approximately 4-20 times more potent and carries greater safety concerns, including several documented fatalities. It preferentially activates 5-HT1A receptors over 5-HT2A receptors, making it an atypical psychedelic. The substance produces profound ego dissolution and non-dual states. Accurate dosing with a milligram scale is critical due to steep dose-response curve. Combining with MAOIs, antidepressants, or stimulants can be life-threatening. The substance is found naturally in various plants and the secretions of the Sonoran Desert toad (Incilius alvarius); toad venom use is strongly discouraged due to ecological concerns and variable alkaloid content. A trusted, sober sitter is essential, particularly due to risks of vomiting while semi-conscious. Only suitable for experienced psychedelic users who understand harm reduction practices. Integration of the experience can be challenging, with some users reporting ongoing psychological difficulty.",

GC-MS surveys show frequent adulteration with other cathinones; multi-reagent testing (Marquis produces no reaction or slight fizz, Liebermann gives bright yellow) plus FT-IR is recommended. It is a potent monoamine releaser with a serotonin-to-dopamine ratio of approximately 1.22:1, producing stronger stimulation and shorter duration than MDMA. Plasma half-life averages 1.5-2.1 hours with active metabolites nor-mephedrone and 4-carboxy-mephedrone; users compensate by redosing every 30-90 minutes, markedly increasing cardiovascular load and hyponatremia risk. Case reports describe acute psychosis, rhabdomyolysis, severe peripheral vasoconstriction, and necrotising skin lesions after prolonged IV use. Nasal use rapidly erodes mucosa. Hydration (but under 1 pint water per hour) and electrolyte drinks reduce adverse effects. Titration with small doses, keeping total session below 250 mg oral or 150 mg nasal, and minimum 3-week breaks substantially reduce comedown severity and tolerance. Unlike methamphetamine, mephedrone does not appear to produce dopaminergic neurotoxicity in animal studies.",

It has higher binding affinity and slower dissociation from α2δ-1 subunits compared to pregabalin, potentially offering improved analgesic effects with fewer CNS side effects. Dose adjustments are necessary for renal impairment: 50% reduction for moderate impairment (CrCl 30-60 mL/min) and 75% reduction for severe impairment. Most common side effects include dizziness (8-16%), somnolence (6-29%), peripheral edema, headache, and weight gain. Not effective for fibromyalgia in clinical trials. Concomitant use with opioids increases CNS adverse events without additional analgesic benefit.",

Naloxone can reverse overdoses but may require multiple doses. Never use alone; always have naloxone available. Test all substances for fentanyl contamination using reagent strips. Combining with any CNS depressant is potentially fatal.",

Unlike most benzodiazepines, pyrazolam does not undergo metabolism and is excreted unchanged in urine. Illegal in the UK (Class C), Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and other jurisdictions.",

      "notes": "Phenazolam is the same compound as clobromazolam; it first appeared on the market circa 2016 and has no approved medical use. Forum meta-reports consistently place its potency at approximately 40 times that of diazepam, with 0.25 mg often compared to 10 mg diazepam or 0.5 mg alprazolam; avoid any pressed tablets claiming multi-milligram doses. Onset is notably slow for a triazolobenzodiazepine, often 1-2 hours and sometimes 3 hours, which greatly increases redosing risk and blackout potential. Volumetric dosing is essential: dissolve a known amount in a measured volume (e.g., 1 mg in 10-20 mL ethanol/propylene glycol), mix thoroughly, and measure doses with an oral syringe; do not eyeball powders or shave tablets. Wait a full 3-4 hours before considering any redose due to delayed peak and amnesia. Multiple reports describe next-day impairment lasting well beyond the perceived high; avoid driving or hazardous tasks for at least 24 hours after dosing. In vitro human S9 data indicate CYP3A4-mediated metabolism and UGT N-glucuronidation; strong CYP3A4 inhibitors can potentiate effects markedly. Immunoassay urine screens may miss many designer benzodiazepines, and field reagents are unreliable; only confirmatory LC/GC-MS can verify identity. Co-use with opioids, alcohol, GHB, or gabapentinoids is the main cause of life-threatening events; treat as a hard contraindication. Flumazenil can precipitate acute withdrawal and seizures in dependent users and should only be used by clinicians. Because supply may include bromazolam or other benzos mis-sold as clobromazolam, assume mislabeling until proven otherwise and start at the absolute minimum dose.",

Effects last significantly longer than ketamine (4-6 hours) with reports of stronger visual distortions, minimal euphoria, greater disorientation, difficulty urinating, and next-day cognitive impairment described as feeling cloudy or foggy. Unknown bladder and urinary toxicity risk similar to ketamine bladder syndrome. Potency is undocumented; start with very low doses and avoid matching ketamine doses.

In April 2023, DrugsData.org revealed that ALL samples they previously identified as FXE actually contained 2F-NENDCK (CanKet, 2'-Fluoro-2-oxo-PCE), a positional isomer differing only by fluorine position on the phenyl ring. True 3-FXE and 2F-NENDCK are nearly impossible to distinguish without advanced analytical methods like NMR spectroscopy. Most user reports, dosage information, and effects attributed to FXE from 2017-2023 were likely describing 2F-NENDCK experiences. As of 2024-2025, some vendors claim to sell true 3-FXE, but independent laboratory verification is essential. Without drug checking services using reference standards, it is impossible to know which isomer you have. Assume any substance sold as FXE may be 2F-NENDCK unless verified by mass spectrometry or NMR. See the CanKet article for documented effects and dosages of the commonly-available 2'-isomer. This article describes the theoretical true 3-FXE, but reliable human use data may not exist.",

      "notes": "Tiletamine is typically supplied as the veterinary anaesthetic Telazol (1:1 with zolazepam); pure API crystals now circulate on the grey market and are at least 2-3x the potency of ketamine by weight. Human pharmacokinetics are poorly studied, but polar bear and porcine data place the elimination half-life at approximately 1.8 hours with rapid hepatic N-deethylation. Nasal administration burns sharply due to low pH, so users dilute in 0.9% saline or switch to IM for harm reduction. Repeated use has produced prolonged tremor syndromes, cerebellar ataxia, choreiform movements and week-long cognitive depersonalisation even at doses under 30 mg insufflated. Forum consensus caps single doses at 30 mg or below and total session load at 60 mg or below to minimise neuro-excitation. Because commercial vials always contain equimolar zolazepam, analysts should run a benzodiazepine panel; unexpected zolazepam greatly lengthens sedation and interacts unpredictably with alcohol or GABAergic drugs. Urinary excretion is primary, so renal-impaired users experience dangerously extended effects. Volumetric solutions (10 mg/mL in bacteriostatic saline or PG) help precision; never exceed 50 mg/5 mL IM to avoid tissue necrosis from acidic solution.",

Oral doses above 30 mg frequently produce intense visual geometry, ego dissolution, and marked cardiovascular effects including hypertension and tachycardia. Insufflation is 2-3x more potent per milligram but causes severe nasal burning and is generally discouraged. Volumetric dosing with a 0.001 g scale is essential to avoid accidental overdoses. Drug-checking data show tablets ranging 4-26 mg; reagent test each sample to exclude NBOMe substitutes. Pharmacokinetic studies indicate oral-fluid half-life of approximately 2.5 hours with peak plasma concentrations at 1 hour post-ingestion. Short-term tolerance develops after one session and returns to baseline within 4-7 days; partial cross-tolerance exists with LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline. Avoid use in individuals with cardiovascular conditions, seizure disorders, or family history of psychosis. Schedule I in most jurisdictions; legal status varies internationally.",

Users commonly report pronounced macropsia/micropsia, spatial warping and auditory hallucinations rather than classic dissociative euphoria. Severe amnesia, insomnia and thought-disorder are typical above 100 ug. Fatal synergy with benzodiazepines and alcohol documented. Practical harm-reduction: limit first exposure to 25-50 ug, dose once only per 14-21 days, avoid operating machinery for 48 h.

Vaporizing requires approximately 20% of an oral dose but increases lung irritation and overdose risk. The subjective profile combines MXE-like dissociation with stimulant effects. Profound anterograde amnesia and catatonia are common at strong doses. Four multidrug fatalities documented with plasma concentrations ranging 12-1380 ng/mL.

It is the dihydrodifuran analog of 2C-B with a significantly longer duration and more pronounced body load. Effects are similar to 2C-B, mescaline, and MDA, featuring entactogenic qualities at lower doses and deeper psychedelic experiences at higher doses. It was withdrawn from circulation in 2009 after fatal mislabeling incidents involving Bromo-DragonFLY, but returned to the market around 2016. The compound may have MAO-altering properties similar to 2C-T-7 and 5-MeO-MiPT, potentially increasing risks when combined with other serotonergic substances. Due to its sensitive dose-response, high potency, and limited research on toxicity and metabolism, users should approach this substance with substantial caution and employ rigorous harm reduction practices.",

Use caution due to limited long-term safety data. Legal status varies by jurisdiction; banned in many countries but may fall under analogue laws elsewhere. Those with personal or family history of mental illness should avoid use. Always start with lower doses and practice harm reduction in appropriate set and setting.",

Its long half-life of approximately 42 hours and active metabolites (delorazepam, lorazepam, lormetazepam) lead to accumulation with repeated use and prolonged effects lasting days. Delusions of sobriety are common at higher doses, where users feel sober despite significant impairment. Volumetric dosing is strongly recommended due to the substance's high potency. Withdrawal must be managed through gradual tapering to prevent potentially fatal seizures.",

Not approved in most Western countries but sometimes sold online or found in counterfeit pharmaceuticals. Medical doses range from 0.5-2mg; recreational doses above 2mg carry extreme overdose risk. Effects can persist for 3+ days with substantial amnesia and impairment. Withdrawal can be severe and life-threatening; gradual tapering under medical supervision is essential.",

      "notes": "Pregabalin has greater than 90% oral bioavailability and is eliminated renally as unchanged drug with a mean half-life of 6.3 hours in normal renal function. Dose reductions required in chronic kidney disease. While overdose alone is rarely fatal, severe respiratory depression and coma occur when combined with opioids or other CNS depressants. UK MHRA and US FDA warnings highlight these risks. Recreational users report warm euphoria, sociability, and alcohol-like motor incoordination at 300-600 mg, with tolerance developing rapidly. Case reports document daily intakes exceeding 3-6 grams with compulsive redosing and severe withdrawal. Intranasal use provides faster onset but causes nasal irritation and reduced efficiency. IV use risks particulate emboli from insoluble fillers and is strongly discouraged. Schedule V (US) and Class C (UK) controlled substance.",

Enterohepatic circulation contributes to the exceptionally long half-life. Not approved for medical use and sold only as a research chemical. Use extreme caution due to compulsive redosing potential, severe withdrawal risk, and danger when combined with other depressants.",

Chronic use may lead to cardiovascular issues, neurotoxicity at high doses, and psychological problems including stimulant psychosis. Overdose risk increases when combined with other stimulants or when using extended periods without sleep. Users should employ harm reduction practices including accurate dosing, avoiding frequent redosing, maintaining hydration, and avoiding dangerous drug combinations.",

At higher doses (approaching 150 mg), it acts as a reversible MAOI, greatly increasing the risk of serotonin syndrome when combined with other serotonergic substances. Effects can take over 2 hours to fully develop; redosing prematurely has led to dangerous overdoses. The drug shows wide variation in effects between individuals, with some reporting overwhelming experiences at 40 mg while others consume much higher doses. AMT is scheduled as a controlled substance in many countries, including the United States (Schedule I since 2004) and the United Kingdom (Class A since 2015). It was briefly marketed as the antidepressant Indopan in the Soviet Union during the 1960s in 5-10 mg doses.",

It is often mis-sold as MDMA or ecstasy but is significantly more toxic, causing hyperthermia, hypertension, and serotonin syndrome. PMA has a slower onset than MDMA (30-60 minutes vs 20-40 minutes), leading users to redose before effects are felt, resulting in accidental overdose. Deaths have occurred at doses as low as 60-80 mg. PMA is 5-10 times more potent than MDMA and acts as both a serotonin releaser and MAO-A inhibitor. Always test substances with reagent kits and avoid this substance entirely due to its poor safety profile and minimal recreational value.",

It acts as a G-protein-biased μ-opioid agonist and δ-opioid antagonist. While animal studies suggest reduced respiratory depression, tolerance development, and physical dependence compared to traditional opioids, human safety data is extremely limited. Commercial products containing isolated mitragynine pseudoindoxyl have emerged, but should not be confused with whole-leaf kratom products. Use extreme caution due to potent opioid effects, risk of dependence, and potential for dangerous interactions. Legal status varies by jurisdiction.",

      "notes": "Morphine is a potent naturally-occurring opioid analgesic extracted from the opium poppy, used for moderate to severe pain management. Overdose can result in fatal respiratory depression, especially when combined with other CNS depressants. Long-acting formulations exist for extended pain relief. Morphine is metabolized primarily via glucuronidation to M3G and M6G, with M6G being a more potent active metabolite. Use extreme caution with compromised respiratory function or liver impairment. Always practice harm reduction including using test doses and having naloxone available.",

The drug's high lipophilicity and lack of polar functional groups make it resistant to metabolic breakdown, resulting in effects that can persist for 24-72+ hours. Users report an increased risk of compulsive redosing due to the subtle and gradual onset of effects, which can lead to severe and prolonged agitation, psychosis, insomnia, and cardiovascular complications lasting up to 5-7 days. Use extreme caution with dosing and avoid redosing entirely. Volumetric dosing is strongly recommended due to the substance's ultra-high potency starting at sub-milligram doses.",

      "notes": "Carisoprodol is prescribed only for short-term relief of acute muscle spasm, yet dependence emerges quickly because it metabolises into the sedative meprobamate. Long-term use or abrupt cessation can precipitate significant withdrawal. Carisoprodol is a centrally acting muscle relaxant with sedative and anxiolytic properties, commonly prescribed for short-term treatment of musculoskeletal pain. It is rapidly metabolized in the liver to meprobamate, a long-acting anxiolytic and sedative-hypnotic with its own abuse history, making carisoprodol pharmacologically similar to combining a short-acting sedative with a longer-lasting one. Because of this metabolic pathway, effects may persist longer than expected, especially with repeated dosing. Recreational use often centers around the drug's sedative euphoria, which some users compare to a mild benzodiazepine, though with a heavier, less controlled sedation and occasional paradoxical stimulation. At therapeutic doses, carisoprodol causes muscle relaxation, drowsiness, and anxiolysis; at higher doses, it can cause confusion, ataxia, double vision, blackouts, and sudden loss of motor control. Abrupt movements or attempts to stand can cause sudden collapses, leading to falls and injuries. Tolerance to the euphoric and relaxing effects develops quickly, encouraging dose escalation and binge-style use. Dependence liability is compounded by meprobamate accumulation, which has a half-life of approximately 10 hours, leading to more prolonged sedation and risk of withdrawal upon cessation. Withdrawal symptoms can include tremors, anxiety, agitation, insomnia, nausea, hallucinations, and seizures; these can be severe after chronic high-dose use and may require medical supervision, often with benzodiazepine substitution. Mixing carisoprodol with other depressants such as alcohol, opioids, or benzodiazepines greatly increases the risk of respiratory depression, aspiration, coma, and death; many fatalities have involved such polydrug combinations. Recreational users sometimes combine carisoprodol with opioids or benzodiazepines in a cocktail known as the 'Holy Trinity,' which is considered highly dangerous due to synergistic CNS depression. Harm reduction strategies include limiting use to occasional sessions, spacing doses at least 4-6 hours apart, avoiding any other depressants, and never exceeding 700 mg in a single dose. Users should ensure they are in a safe environment before onset due to risk of sudden sedation and falls. Because it is often supplied as tablets with varying imprints, counterfeit risks exist; some tablets may contain other sedatives or opioids, so reagent testing is advised where possible. Long-term heavy use can impair memory, attention, and coordination, and chronic use is discouraged due to rapid tolerance and dependence liability.",

However, at recreational doses (typically 40+ mg), zaleplon can produce atypical hallucinogenic effects including visual hallucinations, cognitive disconnection, and deliriant-like experiences that differ markedly from both benzodiazepines and classical hallucinogens. These effects are accompanied by severe amnesia and compulsive behavior. Due to its ultra-short half-life (~1 hour), risk of next-day impairment is minimal when taken with adequate sleep time (7-8 hours). Should be taken on an empty stomach for optimal absorption. Complex sleep behaviors (sleep-driving, sleep-walking, preparing food while asleep) have been reported and can be dangerous. Not recommended for elderly patients or those with severe hepatic impairment. Combining with CYP3A4 inducers may reduce effectiveness.",

      "notes": "Estradiol is used in two primary contexts: (1) Menopausal hormone replacement therapy for cisgender women at lower doses (0.5-2mg oral), and (2) Gender-affirming feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women at moderate-to-high doses (4-8mg+ oral, or 4-10mg weekly injectable monotherapy). For menopausal use, prescribe at the lowest effective dose for shortest duration necessary. When prescribed to individuals with an intact uterus, progestin co-administration reduces endometrial hyperplasia risk. For gender-affirming care, adequate testosterone suppression is the primary goal; many require 6-8mg oral or injectable monotherapy. Contraindicated in estrogen-dependent tumors, active thromboembolic disorders, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, and pregnancy. Available as oral tablets, sublingual/buccal tablets, transdermal patches and gels, vaginal preparations, and injectable solutions (valerate, cypionate, enanthate esters).",

Duration can extend 12-24 hours with residual effects lasting up to 48 hours. The extended-release mechanism increases the ratio of unconverted DXM to dextrorphan (DXO) in the bloodstream, producing more physical/sedating effects and less intense psychedelic/dissociative effects compared to immediate-release DXM HBr. It is more difficult to reach third plateau with polistirex preparations. Users report that approximately 1.5-2x the dose of DXM HBr may be needed to achieve equivalent effects. Always verify products contain only DXM as the active ingredient - avoid formulations containing acetaminophen, antihistamines, guaifenesin, or other dangerous additives.",

Approved for ADHD in adults and children 6+ years, and for binge eating disorder in adults. Use caution with cardiovascular conditions and avoid combinations with MAOIs or other stimulants.",

Without lime, effects are more physically uncomfortable with greater nausea. Seeds are typically insufflated (blown into nostrils with bamboo tubes) or less commonly smoked. Some tribes combine with Banisteriopsis caapi (ayahuasca vine) to intensify and prolong effects.

Individuals with personal or family history of psychotic disorders should avoid use. Set and setting strongly influence the experience; ensure a safe, comfortable, familiar environment and consider having a trusted sober trip sitter present, especially for first-time users or higher doses. Psilocybe cubensis contains approximately 1% psilocybin by weight.",

Potency varies greatly between specimens depending on season, region, and preparation method. Traditional preparation methods (drying, heating/baking at 175°F+) decarboxylate ibotenic acid into the less toxic muscimol. Deaths are extremely rare but possible, especially with misidentification. Some historical accounts describe psychoactive urine recycling due to muscimol excretion. Not a classical psilocybin mushroom and effects are very different. Legal in most jurisdictions.",

It is generally well-tolerated but may cause insomnia, irritability, somnolence, or gastrointestinal upset. Higher rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors have been reported in pediatric patients, requiring close monitoring especially during initial treatment. Caution is advised in patients with liver or severe renal impairment, bipolar disorder, or those taking CYP1A2 substrates. Viloxazine is a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor and should not be combined with MAOIs or sensitive CYP1A2 substrates with narrow therapeutic ranges.",

NEP produces significant cardiovascular strain and can trigger anxiety, paranoia, and compulsive redosing. Fatalities have been linked to tachyarrhythmia and hyperthermia. Drug-checking is advised due to frequent cathinone mislabeling. Use meticulous hydration and cooling; avoid consecutive-day use. Recent research shows NEP is approximately three times as potent as its parent compound pentedrone.",

Ibotenic acid itself acts as a glutamate receptor agonist and may have stimulant-like properties distinct from muscimol's depressant effects. The compound is used extensively in neuroscience research as a brain-lesioning agent due to its excitotoxic properties. Not controlled under US, Canadian, or international law.

It has a very narrow therapeutic window and overdose can cause severe respiratory depression, cardiac arrhythmias, coma, and death. Chronic use can lead to liver damage and rapid tolerance development. Combination with alcohol (creating a Mickey Finn) is especially dangerous. Discontinued in the US in 2012 but still available in some countries. Should only be used for short-term treatment due to high addiction potential and serious toxicity risks.",

It was never approved for medical use due to severe dependency potential and respiratory depression. Etonitazene has an unpredictably steep dose-response curve and erratic pharmacokinetics, especially when injected, making it more hazardous than fentanyl. It has sporadically appeared in illicit drug supplies since the 1960s. Multiple doses of naloxone may be required to reverse an overdose, and renarcotization can occur as naloxone wears off. The substance is Schedule I in the United States and Class A in the UK. Avoid use; if encountered, start with extraordinarily small doses, never use alone, and always have multiple naloxone doses available.",

Effects include increased energy, euphoria, and appetite suppression. Original pharmaceutical pills (Menocil) contained 14mg aminorex fumarate. The drug lacks TAAR1 agonism, which may enhance its effects relative to typical amphetamines. Can be produced as a metabolite of levamisole, a cocaine cutting agent.",

It is a centrally acting appetite suppressant that acts as a prodrug, metabolized to more potent active metabolites (M1 and M2) with longer half-lives. Unlike amphetamines, it does not cause monoamine release and does not produce euphoria. Contraindicated in patients with history of cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, eating disorders, severe depression, mania, or narrow-angle glaucoma. Regular blood pressure monitoring is essential during use. Psychiatric side effects including mania, psychosis, and panic attacks have been reported.",

      "notes": "3F-PiHP is a fluorinated pyrrolidinophenone cathinone structurally related to α-PiHP, α-PHP, and 3F-PVP. It produces forceful stimulation, sociability, and euphoria but also frequent anxiety, paranoia, and powerful redosing compulsions, especially when vaped or insufflated. First identified in Sweden and Finland in mid-2019; limited pharmacological and toxicological data exist. User reports characterize it as a 'diet' α-PiHP with milder rush but similar compulsive redosing tendencies and harsh airway irritation when vaporized. Acetone washing or diluting with 70/30 VG/PG e-liquid can reduce throat burn. Common adverse effects include heartburn, tremor, and peripheral vasoconstriction. Harm reduction: maintain hydration, consider magnesium supplementation (200-400 mg), and space doses at least 10 minutes apart. Federal scheduling status in the U.S. is unscheduled; mislabeled products sold as 'α-PiHP' or 'A-Pyro' are common—reagent testing (Marquis, Simon's) plus instrumental analysis (FT-IR, GC-MS) recommended for identity confirmation.",

      "notes": "MEM is a rare psychedelic amphetamine first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin and described in PiHKAL as entry #122. It is structurally related to mescaline and other DOx compounds. Human data is extremely limited, making effects unpredictable. Known for producing strong visual and cognitive effects with notable stimulation. Notable reports describe synergy with MDMA, with Myron Stolaroff noting the combination as particularly powerful for therapeutic work. May cause overstimulation, anxiety, or vasoconstriction at higher doses. Long duration and slow onset (up to 90 minutes) increase risk of accidental overdose from re-dosing. Legal status varies by jurisdiction.",

Therapeutic doses of 10-40 mg provide mild stimulation comparable to caffeine, while recreational doses of 40-70 mg produce more pronounced euphoria and stimulation. The substance has a relatively favorable safety profile at low doses but can cause typical stimulant side effects including tachycardia, anxiety, and insomnia at higher doses. Use volumetric dosing for accuracy, limit sessions to avoid tolerance, monitor blood pressure, and avoid redosing late to preserve sleep. Legal status varies by country - prescription-only in some regions, controlled in others.",

Clinical trials were discontinued in 2007 due to narrow therapeutic index and psychiatric side effects at effective doses. Unlike benzodiazepines, it acts as an orthosteric agonist at the GABA binding site with preferential activity at extrasynaptic δ subunit-containing receptors. At low doses produces sedation and sleep enhancement; at higher doses produces distinctive hallucinogenic and deliriant effects. Not approved for medical use. Exercise extreme caution with combination use as respiratory depression risk is significant with other CNS depressants.",

The substance is described as relatively low-potency compared to other cathinones, requiring higher doses to produce effects, which increases the risk of adverse reactions. Pentylone is a metabolite of dimethylpentylone. Multiple deaths have been reported, often involving polydrug use. Unique adverse effects include persistent insomnia that may last beyond the primary effects. Low blood-brain barrier permeability may explain the higher doses required. Drug checking services strongly recommend testing substances sold as MDMA, as dimethylpentylone has become increasingly prevalent as an adulterant.",

Effects are often described as unpleasant with severe nausea, intense dry mouth, tachycardia, and prolonged hangover lasting up to 48 hours. At doses above 5g, risk of acute toxicity increases substantially. Myristicin works primarily by inhibiting FAAH and MAGL enzymes, indirectly boosting endocannabinoid levels rather than directly binding to cannabinoid receptors. Not recommended for recreational use due to severe side effects and unpredictable potency.",

User reports indicate anxiety and dysphoria are common, especially with redosing. Very limited history of human use with minimal toxicity data. Exercise extreme caution, use harm reduction practices, and avoid redosing to minimize adverse effects.

It is metabolized into pharmacologically active desmethyldiazepam with a half-life of 30-100 hours, contributing to prolonged effects and accumulation with repeated use. Halazepam was marketed as having lower toxicity and less tendency to cause paradoxical hostility than diazepam, though it was withdrawn from the US market in 2009 due to poor sales. Like all benzodiazepines, it carries significant risks of dependence, cognitive impairment, and dangerous interactions with other depressants. Abrupt discontinuation after prolonged use can cause life-threatening withdrawal seizures.",

It is significantly less effective than pseudoephedrine but remains available over-the-counter because it cannot be used to synthesize methamphetamine. Phenylephrine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and has no central psychoactive effects.

The long duration and potential for prolonged overstimulation require careful consideration of set, setting, and time commitment. Legal status varies by jurisdiction; it is Schedule I in the United States as a positional isomer of 2C-E and DOM.",

First detected in Slovenia in October 2020 and now controlled in multiple jurisdictions. Features sub-micromolar affinity for the PCP binding site with slightly reduced potency versus PCP but improved metabolic stability. User reports describe clear-headed but manic dissociation with distinctive cooling menthol-like body sensations rather than sedation. Higher doses produce pronounced amnesia, time loops, and delusional states. The substance is highly caustic when insufflated. Accurate measurement is essential; volumetric dosing strongly recommended. Reagent tests only confirm arylcyclohexylamine presence; GC-MS confirmation advised due to potential substitution with 3-Cl-PCP or 3-MeO-PCP. Employ harm reduction: limit use to monthly sessions with 10-14 day breaks, maintain hydration, and avoid all activities requiring coordination during effects and residual impairment.",

According to PiHKAL, doses below 100 mg produce no detectable effects, while 250 mg produces only 'slight and uncertain' effects consisting of modest closed-eye visuals accompanied by lethargy. Shulgin explicitly noted that 'at no dose that was tried was there any convincing indication of believable central effects.' Published pharmacological research demonstrates markedly lower 5-HT2A receptor affinity compared to other halogenated 2C analogues, consistent with the compound's exceptional weakness. The toxicity profile, metabolism, and effects at higher doses remain completely unknown. Extreme caution is warranted given the massive doses required for even minimal psychoactive effects and the complete absence of safety data. This compound is not recommended for use.",

      "notes": "ALEPH-2 is an extremely rare psychedelic amphetamine in the ALEPH and 2C-T family, combining anxiolytic warmth with classic phenethylamine visuals and intellectual stimulation. Almost no modern toxicology data exists; avoid combining with serotonergic or stimulating substances and dose with extreme caution. The ALEPH series is known for highly unpredictable individual dose-response curves - the same dose may produce markedly different effects between individuals or even in the same person on different occasions. Start at or below 2-3mg for initial trials; dose-response can be steep and idiosyncratic. Avoid redosing for at least 3 hours due to slow onset. As a DOx-like amphetamine with weak MAO-A inhibitory activity, avoid combinations with MAOIs, MDMA, or other potent serotonergics. Thio-substituted phenethylamines have a history of unpredictable toxicity and steep dose curves; prefer oral route only and space trials conservatively (weeks to months). Because material is extremely rare, mislabeling risk is high; confirm identity with reagent testing and analytical confirmation when possible. Use a calibrated milligram scale and consider volumetric dosing for sub-5mg measurements. Typical body-load risks include vasoconstriction, elevated heart rate and blood pressure, mydriasis, jaw tension, and insomnia during the tail end.",

The compound's inactivity discouraged Shulgin from synthesizing further alpha-position-extended mescaline analogues (such as alpha-propylmescaline or alpha-butylmescaline). Research in rodents suggests these extended homologues are non-hallucinogenic. Due to the complete lack of human psychoactive data and unknown safety profile, AEM should be considered an inactive research chemical with no established use case.

Unlike typical psychedelics, 4C-D produces minimal hallucinogenic effects even at high doses, instead causing mental alertness, mood enhancement, and mild stimulation. Shulgin described it as producing 'the alert of a psychedelic, with none of the rest of the package.' Clinical trials suggested efficacy for depression, Parkinson's disease symptoms, and cognitive enhancement in elderly patients. Very limited human data exists beyond Shulgin's testing and unpublished clinical trials. Use extreme caution with dosing as the therapeutic window and toxicity profile remain poorly characterized.",

Volumetric dosing and accurate milligram scales are essential. Re-dosing is strongly discouraged due to the slow onset. Some reports suggest increased risk of delirium and agitation compared to other 2C compounds. There have been hospitalizations and at least one reported death from overdose.

Reports suggest it may produce more physical side effects (muscle soreness, flu-like symptoms) than related dissociatives, especially at higher doses. Due to its high potency, volumetric dosing is strongly recommended. Fentanyl test strips may produce false positives with this substance.

Vaping the HCl salt is heat-sensitive: freebasing or very low flame/oil-burner technique is essential to avoid pyrolysis. Oral dosing produces a flatter, long-tail stimulation (up to 8-10 hours wakefulness) that many find more manageable. Binge patterns exceeding 500 mg/24 hours have precipitated stimulant psychosis with auditory hallucinations, paranoia and formication; strict session caps (under 100 mg/day) and 48-hour recovery windows are strongly advised. MD-PiHP is hygroscopic; store in airtight vials with desiccant. Hydration, magnesium supplementation, and temperature regulation reduce harm. Avoid use in pregnancy, cardiovascular disease or seizure disorders.",

      "notes": "1,4-BDO is a prodrug for GHB, metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Individual metabolic variability means two users can respond very differently to the same dose. Onset is slower than GBL, making redosing particularly risky as people often mistakenly believe the first dose was weak. Because BDO is a viscous industrial solvent, unreacted contaminants or degradation products may add toxicity beyond GHB's profile. The bitter, chemical taste can mask concentration errors if diluted in sweet drinks, creating overdose risk when sharing containers. Vomiting can delay absorption but does not reliably prevent overdose because BDO continues converting to GHB once absorbed. Measured dosing with an oral syringe or graduated cylinder is strongly recommended; kitchen spoons can vary by >50% volume. Redosing within 2 hours stacks CNS depression due to overlapping GHB conversion, frequently leading to unintentional blackouts. Severe amnesia is common, and users may underestimate how intoxicated they appear to others. Tolerance develops within days and users escalate to round-the-clock dosing, often drinking every 2-4 hours to avoid withdrawal. Withdrawal can begin within 2-6 hours of last dose and progress rapidly to delirium, seizures, and autonomic instability if untreated; medical detox is usually necessary. Mixing with alcohol, benzos, or opioids is the main driver of fatal cases, often due to compounded respiratory depression. In toxicology reports, BDO is sometimes missed because it is rapidly converted into GHB in the body. Chronic heavy use can cause severe gastrointestinal irritation, electrolyte imbalance, and cognitive dulling. Harm reduction practices include setting a strict session cap, preparing pre-measured doses to prevent blackout redosing, avoiding consecutive-day use, and never using without a sober sitter present. Even small overestimations can lead to coma due to the steep dose-response curve. Store in clearly labeled glass containers (never clear unlabeled bottles) and consider dyeing with food coloring to prevent accidental ingestion.",

Potency is roughly one-half of amphetamine weight-for-weight. Higher doses introduce typical amphetamine side effects including tachycardia, vasoconstriction, bruxism, and anxiety. Vaporizing or smoking is strongly discouraged as decomposition above 200°C can liberate hydrogen fluoride, a corrosive and toxic gas. Use harm reduction practices including adequate hydration, magnesium supplementation for jaw tension, and deliberate meal planning. Limit use to no more than twice weekly with at least 72 hours between doses to prevent tolerance and sleep debt. Positive urine amphetamine screens are possible as 2-FMA partially metabolizes to 2-FA and amphetamine isomers.",

Single IV doses should not exceed 16 mg. Use with caution in patients with electrolyte abnormalities, pre-existing heart conditions, or those taking other QT-prolonging medications. ECG monitoring is recommended for high-risk patients. Off-label use for pregnancy-related nausea should be reserved for cases where other antiemetics have failed. Does not cause extrapyramidal effects or akathisia as it has no activity at dopamine or muscarinic receptors.",

      "notes": "Thiopental is an ultra-short-acting barbiturate used primarily for anesthesia induction, rapid sedation, emergency seizure control, and reducing intracranial pressure. It must be administered intravenously by trained medical professionals. The drug's brief duration of action results from rapid redistribution to fat and muscle tissue rather than metabolism. Respiratory and cardiovascular depression are significant risks, especially with overdose or combination with other depressants. Not suitable for prolonged or repeated use due to accumulation in fatty tissues and risk of toxicity. Barbiturates have a very narrow therapeutic index. Recreational use is rare but carries extreme danger.",

The headspace is relatively lucid and functional compared to other dissociatives. Analytical work (HR-MS, GC-MS) has begun mapping 2-oxo-PCPr metabolites, but no peer-reviewed human pharmacokinetics exist. Some users report bladder and urinary irritation.

      "notes": "Tianeptine is prescribed therapeutically at 12.5 mg three times daily, but recreational use involves doses 10-100x higher. The short half-life and duration promote frequent redosing and rapid tolerance buildup. Despite animal studies suggesting minimal tolerance, human reports consistently describe severe withdrawal similar to traditional opioids. Naloxone reverses overdose; buprenorphine or methadone protocols are effective for withdrawal management. Multiple U.S. states have classified it as a controlled substance, and the FDA has issued consumer warnings about tianeptine products sold as dietary supplements.",

Oral routes have slower onset and longer duration than inhalation. Chronic exposure builds tolerance within days of daily use, with mild withdrawal upon cessation. THC is highly lipophilic and metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4; inhibitors like fluoxetine can significantly increase plasma levels. Oral consumption converts THC to 11-hydroxy-THC, a more potent metabolite. Co-administration with alcohol or depressants results in additive motor and cognitive deficits. Cannabis has unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with psychedelics. Stored in adipose tissue, THC can be released during fasting or exercise, occasionally triggering delayed effects or positive drug screens.",

It can prolong the QT interval, increasing the risk of torsades de pointes and sudden cardiac death, especially at higher doses or with interacting medications. The half-life varies widely (8-59 hours) and is much longer than the duration of analgesic effects, leading to accumulation with repeated dosing. Overdose risk is extremely high in opioid-naïve individuals or when combined with other depressants. Methadone is a cornerstone of opioid substitution therapy and medication-assisted treatment (MAT) programs. Injecting methadone pills or oral solutions can cause serious harm including collapsed veins and pulmonary complications.",

Users report clear-headed euphoria, moderate body load, and reduced vasoconstriction compared to βk-2C-B. Headaches and jaw tension are common toward the end of the experience. Intranasal administration causes extreme burning pain (likened to \"snorting glass\") with minimal potency gain and is strongly discouraged. Always verify material with reagent testing, as mis-labeled βk-2C-B and BOB (β-methoxy-2C-B) occasionally appear on the market. Hydration and magnesium supplementation (250-500mg) may reduce muscle tension. Very little scientific data exists on pharmacology or toxicity; approach with caution and harm reduction practices.",

It is the L-stereoisomer of racemethorphan and acts as a prodrug to levorphanol, being demethylated by liver enzymes to its active form. Approximately five times more potent than morphine, levomethorphan carries significant risks of respiratory depression, addiction, and overdose. Due to its metabolism to levorphanol (which has SNRI properties), levomethorphan poses a serious risk of serotonin syndrome when combined with MAOIs, SSRIs, SNRIs, or other serotonergic drugs. It is a Schedule II controlled substance in the United States. Due to its κ-opioid receptor agonist activity, it may produce dysphoric and psychotomimetic effects including dissociation at higher doses.",

Community reports place potency roughly five to seven times that of ketamine: 2-5 mg insufflated already produces dissociation, while 10-20 mg has left users with vertigo, tremor, depersonalisation, and dysphoria lasting days. The powder is hygroscopic and clings electrostatically, so volumetric dosing in PG or an ethanol-water mix (for example 10 mg/mL) is far safer than chasing individual milligram shards.\n\nVendors advertise rapid onset (1-10 minutes IM/IN) and a 1-2 hour elimination half-life, yet many users describe a heavier body-load than ketamine with little euphoria and pronounced after-effects. Stacking doses easily leads to ataxia and next-day fatigue; start with micro-doses, avoid redosing, and assume full cross-tolerance with other arylcyclohexylamines. Mandelin/Mecke reagents plus FT-IR or GC-MS are recommended to distinguish Tilmetamine from O-PCPr or O-PCE, and spacing sessions by at least seven days helps reset NMDA sensitivity.",

Mass-overdose clusters have occurred when it adulterated heroin, cocaine, or counterfeit tablets. Because psychoactive doses are in the microgram range, volumetric dosing and fentanyl test strips are critical. Multiple 4 mg naloxone doses may be required to reverse overdose.

It has pharmacological properties comparable to MDMA but with higher potency and longer duration. Unlike many amphetamines, 4,4'-DMAR lacks TAAR1 agonism, meaning it does not auto-inhibit its own effects, potentially making it more dangerous. It has been associated with at least 31 fatalities in Europe, often when combined with other substances. Serious health risks include serotonin syndrome, hyperthermia, seizures, cardiovascular complications, and pulmonary hypertension. The substance has a high potential for compulsive redosing.",

Modern knowledge comes almost entirely from research-chemical circles. Users report a functional, relatively clean stimulation with muted euphoria compared to amphetamine, though higher doses can induce anxiety, vasoconstriction, and tremor. Being an ortho-methyl analogue, it appears to have minimal serotonergic activity. Conservative dosing (spaced at least 4-6 hours), active cooling, and hydration are strongly advised. Individuals with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or anxiety disorders should avoid this substance.",

Many products sold as 5-IAI between 2010-2013 were mislabeled or adulterated; reagent testing is essential. Strong jaw tension, mild hyperthermia and pronounced pupil dilation are common.

Users report empathogenic warmth, mental stimulation, and occasionally mild visuals, but also pronounced body-load including hyperthermia, profuse sweating, bowel urgency, bruxism, and insomnia. Onset is slow; premature redosing has produced serotonin syndrome-like reactions. Cardiovascular stress and unpredictable individual response make conservative titration and external temperature control essential. Milligram-scale weighing and reagent testing are strongly advised. Classified as a Class B drug in the UK since June 10, 2014.",

The compound is chemically unstable and degrades to potentially more toxic metabolites. At least 10 deaths with confirmed 3-CMC exposure have been reported in Europe between 2019-2021. Short half-life encourages compulsive redosing, increasing risks of hyperthermia, hypertension, agitation, and severe comedown symptoms. Reagent testing is essential as purity varies widely. Strong harm reduction practices are critical, including avoiding binges, staying hydrated, monitoring body temperature, and never combining with other stimulants or serotonergic drugs.",

Extreme potency demands accurate milligram-scale weighing and volumetric dosing. Nasal administration is extremely painful and dangerous. Fluoroacetate metabolite (if formed) may take days to clear and accumulate with repeated dosing, potentially damaging high-energy tissues like brain, heart, and gonads.

Clinical references corroborate a long half-life (25-33 h) and flag potent pharmacokinetic interactions—valproate can double lamotrigine levels, while carbamazepine or ethinylestradiol can halve them—explaining several adverse-event threads on harm-reduction boards. Titration must start at 25 mg every other day to avoid rash; typical maintenance 100-200 mg divided once or twice daily. Users experimenting above 300 mg risk severe dermatological reactions and ataxia. Reports also note lamotrigine dulls psychedelic visuals and blunts dissociative effects.",

Full resynthesis takes 24-72 hours, meaning timing separation of grapefruit and medication does not prevent interactions. Parallel inhibition of intestinal P-glycoprotein raises systemic exposure to many substrates, while OATP1A2 blockade can paradoxically lower absorption of drugs like fexofenadine. Interaction magnitude varies with cultivar (white > ruby red), processing method, and individual CYP3A4 expression. Seville orange, tangelo and pomelo contain identical furanocoumarins and pose similar risks. One large grapefruit yields 200-250 ml juice. Chronic daily consumption produces cumulative CYP3A4 loss extending the interaction window to 72 hours. Older adults and patients on narrow-therapeutic-index drugs should avoid grapefruit entirely. The FDA classifies grapefruit juice as a moderate to strong CYP3A4 inhibitor affecting over 85 medications, with 43 having potential for serious adverse effects.",

Users who dose more than once monthly should consider periodic cardiac monitoring. Multiple salt forms exist with significantly different potencies: freebase is approximately 20% stronger than HCl and 65% stronger than succinate. Oral onset can exceed one hour; premature redosing is the leading cause of overdose. Strong doses produce MDA-like closed-eye visuals, pronounced vasoconstriction, bruxism, mydriasis, and hyperthermia. Pre-loading magnesium (200-400 mg) and maintaining hydration (500 mL per hour) can mitigate adverse effects. Wait at least 4-6 weeks between uses to allow serotonin system recovery and reduce cardiotoxicity risk.",

There is risk of serotonin syndrome when combined with serotonergic drugs. Use with caution in elderly patients due to increased risk of confusion, cognitive impairment, and cardiac events. Not recommended for long-term use due to side effect profile and lack of evidence for chronic use efficacy.

      "notes": "Mitragynine is the primary active alkaloid in kratom (Mitragyna speciosa), accounting for 12-66% of total alkaloid content depending on strain origin. Unlike traditional opioids, mitragynine displays functional selectivity and does not activate the β-arrestin-2 pathway, which may contribute to reduced respiratory depression risk compared to morphine. However, pure extracts carry significantly greater overdose risk than plant material due to the natural nausea ceiling in leaf powder. Mitragynine inhibits CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2 enzymes, presenting substantial drug interaction potential. The alkaloid is primarily hepatically metabolized to various metabolites including 7-hydroxymitragynine, which is more potent at μ-opioid receptors.",

Set and setting profoundly influence the experience. A butane torch lighter is recommended for smoking to ensure proper vaporization of salvinorin A due to its high boiling point. Extracts vary significantly in potency and should be approached with extreme caution. Individuals with personal or family history of psychotic disorders should avoid use. The experience is often described as more intense, bizarre, and dysphoric compared to classical psychedelics, with many users finding it profoundly uncomfortable rather than recreational.",

PIHKAL identifies 12-25 mg as the active range; harm reduction consensus converges on 15-22 mg oral for full effects. Sulfur-containing 2C-T compounds produce intense, sometimes uncomfortable body load with vasospasm risk, particularly via insufflation. Splitting doses over 60 minutes or dissolving in acidic juice markedly reduces nausea. Metabolism involves MAO-A/MAO-B and CYP2D6/CYP2C19; potential pharmacogenomic variability exists. Estimated elimination half-life is 4-6 hours based on user plasma data. Avoid MAOIs completely; fatalities have occurred with similar 2C-T compounds. High-efficacy 5-HT2B activity suggests caution with chronic use pending valvular safety data. Member of Shulgin's Magical Half-Dozen.",

Active at microgram doses; always use accurate scales and start with conservative doses. Sold on blotter paper; test with Ehrlich's reagent (turns purple) to confirm presence of an indole. While physical toxicity appears low, psychological risks include anxiety, panic, or challenging experiences, particularly at high doses or in unsuitable set and setting. Legal status varies by jurisdiction; illegal in many countries including the UK, France, and Sweden.",

      "notes": "The HCl salt is intensely caustic to mucous membranes, causing 30-120 seconds of severe burning pain with nasal administration, followed by prolonged rawness and potential bleeding after repeated use. The short duration (rarely exceeding 4 hours) strongly encourages redose cycles that can escalate total daily intake beyond 100 mg, with several reports linking such binges to paranoid ideation, jaw clenching, and psychotic episodes. Despite pronounced mental dissociation, the substance produces deceptive functional clarity, allowing users to navigate complex tasks while significantly impaired. Volumetric dosing is essential due to high potency; most milligram scales cannot accurately measure the active dose range. Combination with cannabis reveals deeper dissociative visuals but increases body load and confusion. The compound is covered by generic arylcyclohexylamine analogue laws in multiple jurisdictions including UK, Germany, Canada, and Australia.",

It is classified as Schedule I in the USA as a positional isomer of MDA, prohibiting all non-research human use. No verified human trials or reliable recreational reports exist in the literature. The compound undergoes rapid MAO-B metabolism, requiring extremely large doses to achieve CNS effects without enzyme inhibition. Based on structure-activity relationships, expected pharmacology involves mixed dopamine and norepinephrine release with weak serotonin activity, producing brief amphetamine-like stimulation. Harm reduction recommendations stress allergy testing at 5 mg or less and cautious titration in 30-50 mg increments only with laboratory-verified purity.",

It cyclizes in plasma (t1/2 approximately 3-4 minutes) to diazepam with an elimination half-life of approximately 0.75 hours for the parent compound, while the resulting diazepam exhibits its typical 20-40 hour half-life. Community users exploit the powder's hygroscopic nature to prepare aqueous or PEG/ethanol solutions for oral dropper dosing but note variable potency (approximately 0.7-1.0x diazepam by mass) and sticky handling issues. Subjective reports describe a flat diazepam-like sedation with strong muscle relaxation yet reduced euphoria unless 50-75 mg or higher doses are taken. High doses may reveal nonlinear conversion kinetics. Harm-reduction advice stresses sterile technique if injected, refrigeration of aqueous solutions (less than 4 degrees Celsius, 30 days maximum), and gradual tapers comparable to diazepam schedules.",

Powder is often tan-brown, poorly water-soluble; volumetric dosing in high-proof ethanol:saline (1 mg/100 mL) is recommended. User reports place functional potency around 0.5-1 mg oral ≈ 20-40 mg oxycodone, with IV threshold below 50 µg. Fatal blood concentrations cluster 0.3-2 ng/mL. Harm-reduction: never insufflate raw powder, always dilute ≥1 mg in ≥10 mL carrier; test shots ≤25 µg IV; do not use alone; keep at least 2 × 4 mg naloxone on hand; monitor ≥8 hours post-dose for re-sedation.",

This compound is a rearrangement product of 7-hydroxymitragynine with remarkable μ-opioid receptor affinity (Ki 0.087 nM) and functions as a G-protein biased agonist with minimal β-arrestin-2 recruitment, potentially explaining its reduced respiratory depression and tolerance development compared to morphine. The powder is tan-brown and sparingly soluble in water; volumetric dosing in 95% ethanol or PG:VG solutions is recommended. Duration exceeds that of 7-hydroxymitragynine and kratom leaf, with many users reporting 8-10 hour analgesia. Community harm-reduction recommends keeping 4 mg naloxone readily available and re-dosing every 20-30 minutes if respiratory depression re-emerges.",

Unlike classical psychedelics, it produces minimal to no visual effects but instead causes tactile enhancement and sexual stimulation. The 2-methyl substitution blocks MAO metabolism allowing oral activity, but also dramatically reduces affinity for 5-HT2A receptors responsible for classical psychedelic effects. Users report unpredictable dose-response; starting low and titrating upward on separate sessions is advised. Combining with MAOIs or stimulants increases physiological risk.",

There is speculation about possible μ-opioid receptor activity based on structural similarity to 3-HO-PCP, though this remains unconfirmed in humans. The powder is hygroscopic and electrostatically clingy; volumetric dosing in propylene glycol or ethanol-water solution (10 mg/mL) is strongly recommended to avoid milligram-scale dosing errors. Cross-tolerance with other arylcyclohexylamines develops rapidly; spacing sessions by at least 7 days is advised to restore baseline NMDA receptor sensitivity.",

Controlled studies show a single 10 mg IM injection quells acute agitation as effectively as haloperidol but with fewer extrapyramidal reactions. Orally-disintegrating formulations dissolve in under one minute and reach measurable plasma levels faster than standard tablets. Mean elimination half-life is ~30 h (range 21-54 h), explaining next-day lethargy. Case reports of ingestions >40 mg document coma, miotic pupils and hypoventilation—clinical presentation that can mimic opioid toxicity—managed with airway support and monitoring. Frequent recreational use is discouraged due to significant metabolic liabilities (weight gain, insulin resistance) and the risk of habituating to antipsychotic 'trip-abort' strategies. Reddit analysis shows olanzapine is among the most frequently recommended trip killers but warnings about side effects are rarely included in online discussions.",

LC-MS casework places fatal blood concentrations as low as 3 ng·mL⁻¹ when co-ingested with opioids. Metabolised to α-hydroxyphenazolam, prolonging sedation beyond the parent's 10-15 h β-elimination. Harm-reduction best practice is precise volumetric dosing (≥ 1 mg in 10 mL 50% ethanol-water), amber dropper bottles, desiccant storage, and explicit labeling. Jurisdictions including the UK (ACMD 2024 update) and several US states have issued temporary class controls after clusters of blackout-related accidents. Withdrawal mirrors other triazolo-BZDs: onset 24-48 h post-cessation, risk of seizures; tapering with a long-acting agent or medical supervision is advised.",

Limit cycles to 6 weeks maximum followed by at least 4 weeks off to restore aromatase enzyme levels. If estradiol falls below 15 pg/mL, reduce dose immediately or discontinue. Joint dryness above 75 mg/day may respond to omega-3 fatty acids (1 g EPA+DHA), collagen supplementation, and dose reduction. Discontinue immediately if depressive mood, hot flashes, or severe joint pain emerge. Not approved for human consumption; marketed illegally as dietary supplement despite FDA warning letters.",

Early user reports highlight marked body-load including bruxism, hypertension, nausea, and diarrhea even at lower doses around 25 mg rectal. Insufflated material produces strong nasal numbness and vasoconstriction but relatively minimal euphoria compared to methylone or eutylone. The substance has a brief peak with significant residual stimulation promoting compulsive redosing. Suspected mild MAO-B inhibition warrants avoiding tyramine-rich foods for 24 hours post-dose until further data emerge. Often mis-sold as MDMA or eutylone; multi-reagent testing and spectrometric confirmation recommended. Hydration and magnesium supplementation may help mitigate side effects. No peer-reviewed human pharmacology exists; all parameters extrapolated from methylone analogues and limited user reports.",

User reports suggest strong dissociation with a sedating, muddy headspace more similar to DCK than the manic clarity of 3-MeO-PCP. Insufflation causes severe nasal pain and prolonged throat irritation; oral or sublingual administration is recommended. Due to its novelty, no peer-reviewed pharmacokinetic data exists. By structural analogy to other PCP derivatives, tolerance develops rapidly, cross-tolerance occurs with all dissociatives, and reagent testing plus ideally GC-MS confirmation is essential before use.",

Tolerance tends to fade after roughly three days, but reagent testing and sub-10 mg allergy checks remain best practice. Unlike traditional stimulants, PPAP enhances neurotransmitter release only in response to neural activity rather than causing uncontrolled monoamine flooding. Animal studies show doubled dopamine/norepinephrine release without overflow at 2 mg/kg i.p., with minimal stereotypy until 25-50 mg/kg. Human self-experiments describe clear focus, wakefulness and pro-social energy at 20-80 mg oral, with effects plateauing around 3 hours and minimal crash. The LD50 in rats is 270 mg/kg p.o. Unlike selegiline, PPAP shows no measurable MAO inhibition. Estimated human elimination half-life is 4-6 hours. Legal status varies globally; unscheduled in the US but illegal in the UK under the Psychoactive Substances Act.",

Clinical reports document reversible cerebellar ataxia, sensorimotor gating disruption, and bladder toxicity resembling ketamine cystitis. The substance is four times more potent than ketamine, significantly reducing the dose needed for equivalent effects. Users report high variability in potency between batches. Harm reduction practices include volumetric dosing, nasal saline rinses after insufflation, setting strict session caps, and avoiding daily or weekly use to prevent urinary tract damage. Due to global scheduling, powders sold as MXE often contain analogues; confirm identity with multi-reagent testing and GC-MS analysis when possible.",

Very limited human data exist; anecdotal reports describe gentler-than-MDMA empathy with β-keto-like peripheral stimulation and a quick, fatigue-heavy comedown. Reagent testing is essential as seizures show many samples sold as EDMC actually contain eutylone or N,N-dimethylpentylone. Use a 0.001 g scale, stay hydrated with electrolytes during physical activity, and avoid re-dosing within the same session. Tolerance typically resets after 7-10 days; waiting two weeks between sessions minimizes neurochemical stress. Keep ambient temperature below 25°C when dancing.",

Subjective strength is about 1/5-1/6 of an equivalent Adderall dose. Peak plasma amphetamine appears 1-4 hours post-dose. Elimination half-life for parent plus metabolites is highly variable (1-17 hours) and prolonged in alkaline urine. Cardiovascular concerns parallel other amphetamines; case-control data link chronic anorectic use to pulmonary arterial hypertension, so limit weekly use and monitor blood pressure. Urine screens showing >500 ng/mL amphetamine after clobenzorex will also contain 4-hydroxyclobenzorex, allowing differentiation from illicit amphetamine use. Users emphasize smaller test doses (≤25 mg) due to biphasic profile: a short punchy alertness that dips after 2 hours before a shallow, long tail. Split-dosing (e.g., 30 mg a.m. + 15 mg noon) reduces midday slump. Stay hydrated, supplement magnesium/potassium, and schedule at least 48 hours stimulant-free to keep tolerance manageable.

No modern human studies exist; dose guidance is extrapolated from historic aminorex prescriptions and recreational 4-methylaminorex reports. Aminorex analogues have been linked to pulmonary arterial hypertension after chronic use, so strict cycle limits (under two weeks continuous) and cardiovascular screening are prudent. The lipophilic CF₃ group may lengthen elimination half-life and promote accumulation. Reagent-test cross-reactions are unreliable—confirm identity with GC-MS or multi-step reagent testing. Serious adverse events reported for aminorex-class stimulants include pulmonary edema, right-heart strain, and psychotic agitation at binge-level doses. Because fluminorex has never reached the grey market in observable quantities, any powder sold as this substance should be assumed mislabeled until proven otherwise.",

Therapeutic QTc prolongation averages 10-20 msec, but heavy recreational doses (>160 mg/day) or IV diversion markedly increases torsade risk. IM ziprasidone reaches Cmax within 60 minutes and has a 2-5 hour half-life, making it a common ER 'trip-stopper'. Forum reports describe 60-120 mg oral as a reliable 'stimulant-comedown knockout', with sleep onset 2-4 hours after dosing. Extrapyramidal reactions (akathisia, dystonia) and very rare tardive dystonia have occurred after weeks on 80-120 mg/day regimens. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is possible with massive overdose or polysubstance stacking. Because diversion is rare, material found on the grey-market is usually legitimate pharmacy stock; nonetheless, verify capsules are intact, avoid crushing/insufflating (poor absorption and nasal mucosal damage). Always baseline ECG (>450 msec QTc is a red flag) before experimenting above 40 mg. Oral elimination half-life averages 6-7 hours (2-5 hours IM) with minimal active metabolites. QT risks rise sharply with hypokalaemia, bradycardia or interacting drugs.",

      "notes": "α-PPP is the three-carbon homologue in the pyrrolidinophenone series (shorter alkyl chain than α-PVP and α-PBP). It acts as a potent DAT and NET inhibitor with negligible SERT activity, but uniquely also functions as a partial norepinephrine releasing agent and 5-HT2A antagonist—properties not shared by α-PVP. This 5-HT2A antagonism may contribute to its reportedly lower euphoria and reduced popularity compared to α-PVP. Community reports describe 20-40 mg insufflated or 30-60 mg oral as producing 4-6 hours of focused, relatively non-euphoric stimulation with social facilitation. Higher doses (≥90 mg oral, ≥70 mg intranasal) increase peripheral vasoconstriction, bruxism, and tremor without proportional mood elevation. Intravenous use is strongly discouraged due to severe vein irritation, intense compulsive redosing, and documented cases producing 100-150 mg boluses with cocaine-like rush but extreme cardiovascular strain. Animal studies reveal hyperthermia, locomotor sensitization, persistent monoamine depletion (particularly striatal serotonin), and spatial memory impairment following large binge doses (4 × 80 mg/kg). Plasma half-life is approximately 1-2 hours with cathinone-related metabolites potentially extending subjective stimulation. Reagent tests (Marquis, Mecke, Simon's) produce weak reactions; confirm identity with GC-MS as mis-sold α-PVP or MDPV is common. Employ strict volumetric dilution, nasal saline rinses, hydration (250 ml water per hour), and minimum 48-hour stimulant breaks to limit tolerance and sympathomimetic strain. Reports of pro-convulsant effects in epileptic users warrant caution in seizure-prone individuals.",

      "notes": "Halodrol is a non-aromatizing Turinabol analogue that produces 'dry', lean gains with comparatively low water retention. It is 17α-methylated, so pre-cycle, mid-cycle, and post-cycle liver panels (ALT, AST, GGT, bilirubin) are mandatory. Daily intake of 500-1000 mg NAC or 250-500 mg TUDCA is routinely recommended on forums. Blood pressure and a full lipid panel should be checked; HDL often drops 30-40% and LDL rises markedly. Because endogenous testosterone is suppressed within days, a SERM-based PCT (e.g., tamoxifen 40/40/20/20 mg or clomiphene 25/25/25/25 mg) plus an over-the-counter liver and lipid stack is advised. Even though gyno is rare (no aromatase), users report occasional progesterone-like nipple sensitivity—keep a low-dose AI or cabergoline on hand. Lower-back 'pump' and shin splints respond to taurine (3-5 g) and hydration. Splitting the daily dose (a.m./p.m.) or using even-spaced micro-capsules can flatten hormone spikes and reduce insomnia and irritability. Never exceed 8 weeks or 75 mg/day without medical supervision; cases of severe cholestatic jaundice and peliosis hepatis have been documented after OTC clones containing Halodrol.",

      "notes": "MDPV is one of the most potent dopamine reuptake inhibitors known, blocking DAT with IC50 values of 4.1 nM and NET at 26 nM while having minimal serotonergic activity. This pharmacological profile makes it significantly more potent than cocaine (50-fold at DAT) and produces intense stimulation with powerful compulsive redosing. The plasma elimination half-life is approximately 80-120 minutes, though subjective effects persist 4-6 hours due to slow brain egress. Dosing accuracy below 5 mg requires a 0.001 g milligram scale or volumetric solution preparation, as eyeballing powder leads to dangerous overdoses. Acute harms include severe vasoconstriction, rhabdomyolysis, hyperthermia, and excited delirium. Benzodiazepines are first-line treatment for emergencies; beta-blockers alone are contraindicated as they may cause unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation and paradoxical hypertension. Psychosis typically manifests after 24-48 hours of continuous use with visual shadow-people hallucinations, persecutory delusions, and tactile hallucinations. The substance has been involved in 99 confirmed deaths across Europe between 2009-2013. Harm reduction practices include pre-measuring single doses, limiting sessions to 20 mg maximum, maintaining aggressive hydration, supplementing magnesium for bruxism, and scheduling 2-week breaks between use. Reagent testing is essential as bath salt powders frequently contain α-PVP or eutylone misrepresented as MDPV.",

A 2022 forensic case reported fatal ventricular tachycardia with femoral blood 26 ng/mL, illustrating low LD50 margin. Fluorine substitution is predicted to raise metabolic stability, extending active phase relative to alkyl-only peers. User reports indicate very rapid onset when freebased (steam on foil), but subjective potency roughly half that of α-PVP: common 'one-hit' loads are 10-15 mg, with compulsive re-hits every 10-15 min. Intranasal use burns intensely and produces drip-induced gagging; many switch to glass-pipe inhalation. Tolerance rises sharply after a single night of use and fades over ~1-2 weeks. Harm-reduction best practices include volumetric solutions for accurate micro-dosing, pulse-ox monitoring, strict session limits (<150 mg total 24 h) and aggressive hydration/electrolyte replacement. Because MFPVP often appears as off-white crystals mixed with eutylone or NEP, multi-reagent testing (Marquis, Simon, Froehde) plus FT-IR or GC-MS confirmation is advised before consumption.",

Modern reports describe it as a stimulant with a profile between methylphenidate and MDPV, with strong drive to redose every 2-3 hours. Its pharmacology shows high affinity inhibition of dopamine and norepinephrine transporters, with negligible serotonin activity. The short half-life contributes to a sharp comedown marked by irritability, low mood, and insomnia. Accurate dosing is critical as pyrovalerone is active at low milligram amounts, making volumetric measurement safer than weighing single doses. The R-enantiomer is pharmacologically inactive.",

      "notes": "Flmodafinil (CRL-40,940; bisfluoromodafinil; lauflumide) is a bis(4-fluoro) derivative of modafinil with enhanced dopamine transporter affinity and improved lipophilicity. Unlike modafinil, it does not induce CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 enzymes, reducing drug-drug interactions. Animal studies demonstrate robust wake-promoting activity without classic amphetamine-like locomotor sensitisation. Human anecdotes report shorter subjective duration (6-8 hours) with crisper onset but potential late-phase anxiety spike 6-8 hours post-dose. Keeping daily use at or below 100 mg and finishing doses before 10 a.m. reduces sleep disruption. Powder is poorly water-soluble; users typically dissolve in warm propylene glycol or prepare volumetric solutions at 50 mg/mL. Insufflation produces faster onset but causes nasal irritation and chemical burn. A 0.001 g scale is essential due to variable online purity (90-99%). Single-session tolerance is minor but 3-day consecutive dosing halves potency; 5-7 drug-free days restore baseline. Cross-tolerance exists with modafinil, adrafinil, armodafinil and fladrafinil. WADA prohibits all dopamine transporter blockers; detection windows exceed 48 hours in urine.",

Weak MAO-A inhibition appears at approximately 130 μM, relevant only at very high doses. Oral threshold of 25-50 mg produces mild wakefulness while 75-200 mg common range yields pronounced alertness, pupil dilation, and appetite suppression. Intranasal use causes sharp burning; IV administration (≤40 mg) delivers rapid onset clean stimulation lasting approximately 2 hours but risks vasospasm. Systolic blood pressure rises of 20-30 mm Hg are typical. Half-life estimated at 1-2 hours promotes rapid tolerance and redose cravings. Allow 24-hour washout before using other stimulants or serotonergics due to MAO-A component. Marquis reagent gives weak yellow-orange; confirm identity by GC-MS or LC-MS. Powder is fluffy and static-prone; volumetric dosing (10 mg/mL in propylene glycol or ethanol) improves accuracy.",

      "notes": "Ethylbromazolam is structurally similar to bromazolam with an ethyl instead of methyl group on the triazole ring. User reports suggest approximately half the potency of bromazolam, with reportedly less sedation and amnesia than its parent compound. Estimated equivalence: 4 mg ethylbromazolam produces effects similar to 10 mg diazepam. Active at low milligram levels; volumetric dosing in ethanol or propylene glycol (1 mg/mL) strongly recommended. Drug-checking services in New Zealand, Australia, and the United Kingdom have detected ethylbromazolam in counterfeit Xanax bars and blue tablets since February 2025. No human pharmacokinetic studies exist; half-life is estimated from structural analogues. Dependence may develop after 1-2 weeks of daily use; taper with a long-acting benzodiazepine under medical supervision if necessary.",

Volumetric measurement is essential—dissolve powder in ethanol or propylene glycol for accurate titration. Stability is poorer than many designer benzos with notable degradation at room temperature. Always use a milligram scale accurate to 0.001g, avoid driving for at least 24 hours after use, and employ a sober sitter for doses above 1mg. Appears in flunitrazepam urine screens due to shared metabolic pathway.",

The compound blocks voltage-gated sodium channels similar to cocaine, producing local anesthesia and potential cardiac conduction effects. Users report severe mucosal irritation with intranasal use and caustic effects when administered intravenously. Oral administration provides cleaner effects with less vascular strain. Due to its recent emergence in late 2024, pharmacokinetic data is limited and reagent testing plus fentanyl screening is essential. Avoid use if predisposed to cardiac arrhythmias.",

Users report a more analytical, less warm dissociation compared to ketamine, with clearer headspace but pronounced motor incoordination. Oral bioavailability appears higher than ketamine, with many users finding oral dosing equally effective to insufflation. The substance produces less nasal irritation than ketamine but saline rinses remain advisable. Reaching a full dissociative state requires higher doses compared to ketamine. Chronic heavy use can cause ketamine-like bladder damage; harm reduction practices include limiting sessions to once every two weeks, staying under 150 mg per session, and maintaining hydration. Reagent testing is essential as 2-FDCK is frequently adulterated or misrepresented.",

Laboratory studies demonstrate it acts primarily as a potent serotonin reuptake inhibitor—approximately 15-fold more effective than methcathinone at SERT—alongside serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine releasing properties, explaining its reputation for producing empathogenic effects rather than typical stimulation. User reports consistently describe calm euphoria and antidepressant-like feelings at moderate to strong doses, with minimal physical stimulation. Energy Control harm reduction testing (2014-2016) found that only 23.4% of samples sold as 4-BMC were accurately identified, with frequent adulteration or substitution with other cathinones. Halogenated cathinones including 4-BMC possess documented neurotoxic and cytotoxic properties. Use harm reduction practices: start with threshold doses (20 mg), space sessions by at least one week, avoid combinations with serotonergic drugs or MAOIs, reagent test all samples, stay hydrated, and monitor cardiovascular effects. The compound's short duration encourages compulsive redosing which increases toxicity risks.",

      "notes": "2C-TFM is the most potent simple 2C analogue, with human active doses of 3-6 mg according to Trachsel and Shulgin. It rivals DOI and DOB in receptor binding affinity (Ki ≈ 75 nM at 5-HT2A/C). Because it is usually synthesized from 2C-I, retail batches from the mid-2000s were often contaminated with ~50% unreacted 2C-I, leading to mixed effects and legal complications in jurisdictions where 2C-I is prohibited. Purity must be confirmed with multi-reagent testing plus quantitative chromatography whenever possible. The compound produces an unusually clear-headed, color-saturated visual field with mild bodily stimulation and minimal vasoconstriction at doses ≤5 mg. Volumetric dosing in ethanol (0.1 mg/mL) is strongly recommended due to extreme potency. Users emphasize strict session caps (<8 mg oral, <4 mg nasal) to prevent accidental escalation. No human fatalities documented as of October 2025, but the safety margin above 10 mg remains undefined. Tolerance builds after a single moderate dose and dissipates in 7-10 days. Complete cross-tolerance with other serotonergic psychedelics. As of October 31, 2016, 2C-TFM is a Schedule III controlled substance in Canada.",

Crushing defeats the extended-release mechanism, converting it to an immediate-release preparation with higher peak plasma concentrations and increased abuse liability. Bioavailability is pH-dependent: acidic urine increases elimination rate while alkaline conditions prolong duration. Nasal insufflation of crushed beads carries risks of septal perforation and pulmonary talcosis from inert excipients. Acute toxicity includes tachyarrhythmia, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, and stimulant psychosis, with risk escalating above 60 mg or with redosing within 6 hours. Chronic heavy use (>40 mg daily for months) is associated with dopaminergic downregulation, cortical grey matter reduction, and cardiomyopathy. Use accurate scales for dosing, maintain hydration and electrolyte balance, avoid combinations with other stimulants or serotonergic drugs, and implement periodic abstinence periods (48-72 hours) to reduce tolerance development.

The R-enantiomer functions as a selective dopamine transporter inhibitor, conferring genuine stimulant properties. It is the only racetam banned in competitive sports by WADA due to performance-enhancing effects. Users consistently report clear mental energy at 100-200 mg, but tolerance develops rapidly after 2-3 consecutive days. A 1-2 times per week dosing schedule is recommended with choline supplementation to counter acetylcholine depletion. Insufflation produces harsh nasal burn and intense but short-lived effects; volumetric oral dosing is strongly advised. Common adverse effects include elevated heart rate, irritability, facial flushing, and insomnia if taken within 8 hours of bedtime. Grey-market powders vary widely in purity; use reagent testing or independent certificates of analysis and start with a 50 mg allergy test.",

Clinical pharmacokinetics show an elimination half-life of ≈220 hours with an active N-desalkyl metabolite (NS2360) lasting ≈374 hours; steady-state is reached only after 4-5 weeks. Single overdoses can linger for over a week. Community reports emphasize starting at ≤0.25 mg every 48 hours to limit insomnia, anxiety, and heart rate increases (8-15 bpm above baseline). Research chemical vendor authenticity varies; reagent testing with TLC plus chiral GC-MS is advised. Due to transporter ratios (NET ≈1.7 nM, SERT ≈11 nM, DAT ≈65 nM), clinical weight-loss occurs at 0.25-0.5 mg daily; above 1 mg shows no extra efficacy but marked cardiovascular response. Accumulation means missed doses do not immediately reverse appetite suppression; many users shift to 0.25-0.5 mg twice weekly once steady-state is achieved. Lacks recreational abuse potential in controlled studies. Long-term safety data are limited - monitor blood pressure, resting heart rate, ECG QTc, and liver enzymes every 4-8 weeks during extended use.",

      "notes": "25E-NBOH first appeared on Brazilian blotters in 2018 and is now encountered worldwide in the microgram range. Laboratory seizure papers contain 290-820 ug per 6 mm blotter, often hot-spotted. The molecule is heat- and acid-labile; oral swallowing destroys most activity, so users hold tabs under the tongue for 15-30 minutes. Forum reports describe pronounced open-eye patterning, saturated color shifts and a phenethylamine-style body euphoria that peaks earlier than LSD. A 2023 French toxicology case linked 25E-NBOH (blotter) plus the stimulant MDPHP to serotonin syndrome and loss of consciousness requiring ICU admission, illustrating how co-ingestion magnifies risk. Rodent assays show full 5-HT2A agonism with locomotor suppression and DOM-like discriminative stimulus at sub-milligram doses, confirming very high potency. Because NBOHs thermally decompose to their 2C parent in a hot GC inlet, forensic labs must use LC-MS or derivatization to avoid mis-identification. Harm reduction: keep single-use doses under 1 mg, use precise volumetric or blotter-laid dosing, test with Ehrlich/Marquis (expect weak or no reaction), avoid stacking strong sympathomimetics, and have benzodiazepines on hand for acute agitation.",

Crystalline HCl salt vaporizes around 210°C but generates caustic aerosol causing lung discomfort and transient dyspnea; propylene glycol/glycerin e-liquid (60:40) mitigates irritation but encourages covert dosing. Insufflation of 40+ mg causes severe burn and vasoconstriction; isotonic saline lavage plus vitamin E oil post-use reduces mucosal injury. Oral dosing extends effects to approximately 4 hours but increases risk of tachycardia (HR >120 bpm) and marked vasospasm. Harm reduction recommendations include cool environment, aggressive hydration (0.5 L/hour isotonic), 200-400 mg magnesium supplementation, and immediate cessation if limb numbness or chest pain occurs. Estimated half-life 3-5 hours based on user reports and rodent data. First-aid for acute agitation: 10 mg diazepam IV or 20 mg PO with external cooling.

      "notes": "Bromonordiazepam (also called desalkylgidazepam) is the active metabolite of the Ukrainian anxiolytic gidazepam and is now sold online as a long-acting research chemical benzodiazepine. Recreational users estimate approximately 6 mg equals 10 mg diazepam, placing it at roughly 0.6× diazepam potency. Light anxiolysis emerges at 3-6 mg, while sleep-inducing doses of 15 mg and above risk prolonged psychomotor impairment the next day. The elimination half-life averages 86-90 hours, with forensic casework suggesting a range of 72-120 hours; metabolites can be detected in urine up to 18 days post-dose. Because of this exceptionally long half-life, every-other-day dosing is recommended to avoid accumulation. The long half-life and low peak intensity make it popular for substitution and tapering from high-potency benzodiazepines (such as bromazolam), but large gaps (3-4 days) between dose reductions are needed before withdrawal symptoms emerge. Volumetric dosing (for example, 1 mg/mL in ethanol-propylene glycol solution) greatly improves accuracy for powders that often test 80-95% purity by GC-MS. Users report clean anxiolysis with minimal euphoria; high doses cause flat affect, anterograde amnesia, dysarthria, and falls. Overdoses are usually benign when taken alone but become life-threatening with opioids or alcohol; keep flumazenil unavailable to laypersons due to seizure risk.",

      "notes": "Agmatine is an endogenous amine stored in synaptic vesicles and released on neuronal activation. It agonises imidazoline I1/I2 sites, inhibits NOS, and blocks NMDA receptor channels in a voltage-dependent manner, collectively producing mild anxiolysis, vascular smooth-muscle relaxation, and anti-addictive effects. Oral bioavailability is roughly 30%, with plasma half-life 75-120 min but brain/spinal half-life ~12 h, explaining why twice-daily split dosing maintains opioid-tolerance–reversal despite short plasma kinetics. Clinical and case data show chronic ingestion of 2.67 g/day for five years with normal lab values, yet forum users report tachyphylaxis of subjective effects after 2-3 weeks; cycling (2 weeks on / 1 week off) restores efficacy. For opioid harm-reduction, 500-1500 mg taken 1-2 h after the opioid appears to prolong analgesia and reduce required dose, whereas pre-dosing helps attenuate emerging tolerance. High doses (>3 g) occasionally cause transient dizziness, diarrhoea, or profound diuresis due to vasopressin inhibition—keep fluids and electrolytes balanced. Because agmatine lowers blood pressure, hypotensive or dehydrated users should start at the low end of the range and titrate slowly. Some users report irritability or anger as a side effect.",

Animal studies indicate GBL is 5-7 times more potent than GVL, with human anecdotal reports aligning with typical single doses of 3-7 mL and binge totals exceeding 40 mL. Subjectively less euphoric but significantly longer-acting than GBL/GHB, with effects that plateau rather than peak sharply. This leads to misjudgment of redose timing, sometimes called 'slow-J'. Delayed convulsive overdoses have been reported 8-9 hours after a 3 mL redose combined with alcohol. Harm reduction recommendations include using pre-measured oral syringes, maintaining a strict 2-hour minimum between doses, avoiding alcohol combination, and tapering by 10% daily after multi-day use to prevent severe rebound insomnia. Laboratory studies show GVL is hepatically converted to GHV, which shows weaker GABA-B receptor affinity but similar autonomic depression to GHB.",

Due to molecular weight differences (146 vs 104), approximately 1.4 times more mass is needed compared to GHB for equivalent effects. Oral solutions are strongly acidic (pH approximately 3) and may cause throat irritation; buffering with food-grade carbonate reduces discomfort. The narrow therapeutic window between desired effects and overdose makes precise measurement with a 0.01 g scale essential. Redosing sooner than 2 hours greatly increases overdose risk. Main acute harms include loss of consciousness and respiratory arrest; always use with a sober sitter. Legal status is uncertain in most jurisdictions as it may be considered a controlled substance analogue. Shelf-life is limited in aqueous solution; store dry powder in desiccated conditions and prepare single-use solutions immediately before consumption.",

      "notes": "Data are extremely scarce: only one formal PiHKAL trial (100 mg oral produced no overt effects) and a handful of 2025 forum / Reddit self-experiments. Community consensus places active oral dosing somewhere in the low-hundreds of milligrams, broadly mirroring its ethyl homologue MBDB but requiring approximately 25-40% higher weight due to weaker serotonin release. Bluelight users describe mild 'wired but clear' stimulation, elevated heart-rate (90-110 bpm resting) and difficulty sleeping for over 8 hours after 200 mg or more. One vaper reported light euphoria, body warmth and jaw tension after 20-30 mg total free-base inhaled across an evening. Structure-activity discussion suggests Methyl-K behaves primarily as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor with limited oral bioavailability, explaining higher effective doses and the preference for intranasal / rectal routes to improve efficiency. Because almost nothing is published on toxicity, reagent-test every batch, use milligram-scale accuracy, and cap first-session totals at under 200 mg oral (or under 80 mg nasal) to gauge sensitivity. Strong cross-tolerance with other amphetamine-type stimulants develops after a single strong session and dissipates over approximately 1 week.",

      "notes": "Flumazenil is the benzodiazepine antidote and can abruptly trigger withdrawal or seizures in dependent individuals. It should only be used with seizure management on standby and careful screening for mixed overdoses. Flumazenil competitively blocks the benzodiazepine site on the GABAA receptor. When used on benzodiazepine-tolerant individuals it can precipitate an abrupt, sometimes life-threatening withdrawal characterised by agitation, hypertension and generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Case series show neurologic adverse-event reporting odds ratios >1700 for withdrawal seizures in pharmacovigilance databases. Doses >5 mg cumulatively rarely add benefit; lack of response after 5 mg suggests non-benzodiazepine sedatives are present. Because its terminal half-life (40-80 min) is often much shorter than diazepam (>30 h) or phenazepam (>60 h), patients require observation for at least 6 h and sometimes a low-rate infusion (0.1-0.5 mg/h) to prevent resedation. Intranasal flumazenil (0.04-0.08 mg/kg) reaches therapeutic plasma levels within 10 min and may be useful where IV access is delayed, but data are confined to paediatric pharmacokinetic studies. Harm-reduction practitioners occasionally micro-dose (0.1-0.2 mg) flumazenil during benzodiazepine tapering protocols to down-regulate tolerance; this should only occur under medical supervision with seizure prophylaxis (e.g., levetiracetam). Always have IV diazepam or midazolam ready to re-treat seizures induced by flumazenil.",

Users describe functional, cocaine-like stimulation with reduced peripheral tension compared to alpha-PVP. Duration is approximately 4-6 hours with reports of smoother comedowns than related pyrrolidinophenones. High oral bioavailability is reported; insufflation increases potency but causes nasal irritation. Use accurate scales for dosing as the compound is dense. Common side effects include insomnia, dry mouth, appetite suppression, and mild tachycardia. Despite its reportedly smoother profile compared to cathinone analogues, many users report compulsive redosing and difficult comedowns at higher doses. Employ harm reduction practices: start with low doses, maintain hydration, monitor heart rate, and allow at least 24 hours between sessions to limit tolerance development.

      "notes": "Rasagiline irreversibly acylates the flavin site of MAO-B, giving approximately 90% inhibition at 1 mg/day within 1-2 weeks. Although its plasma half-life is approximately 3 h, functional recovery depends on MAO-B resynthesis (approximately 40 days), so a single 1 mg dose can keep tyramine thresholds lower for several days. Selectivity diminishes above 2 mg/day, raising dietary and pressor risk comparable to classical non-selective MAOIs. Case surveys and pharmacovigilance reviews document serotonin-syndrome clusters when rasagiline is combined with SSRIs or MDMA-like agents—even at therapeutic doses. Bluelight users typically employ 0.5-1 mg to amplify phenethylamine or stimulant effects, reporting brighter mood, clearer focus, and longer stimulant plateau, but also warn that >2 mg 'feels wired' and makes tyramine flushes more likely. The primary metabolite (R)-1-aminoindan is mildly stimulant and neuroprotective in vitro, which may contribute to perceived clarity without amphetamine-like side-effects. Powder allows accurate volumetric titration (e.g., 0.1 mg/mL in 20% ethanol) and microdosing below 0.25 mg; gelatin capsules disguise bitterness. Always reagent-test party drugs before co-administration and keep 5-HT antagonists (cyproheptadine) on hand in festival settings where serotonergic stacks are common.",

Significant vasoconstriction, tachycardia and chest pain are reported; monitor heart rate and blood pressure, stay hydrated and avoid strenuous exercise. Onset is delayed; redosing within the first 4 hours greatly increases overdose risk. Start with no more than 5 mg orally using a 0.001 g scale or volumetric dosing; potencies vary and vendor mislabeling with 2-DPMP is documented. Cold or painful extremities indicate dangerous vasospasm; warm the area and seek medical help if discoloration appears. Benzodiazepines are first-line treatment for severe agitation. Allow at least 14 days between sessions to reset tolerance and reduce neuro- and cardiotoxic risk.",

Fenozolone is structurally related to pemoline and acts as a norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agent with weaker serotonin activity. Clinical imaging studies demonstrate focused sensorimotor activation comparable to fluoxetine with greater sympathetic arousal. Community reports suggest optimal doses of 15-25 mg oral for focused stimulation with minimal anxiety. Higher doses above 40 mg significantly increase cardiovascular strain and anxiety. Insufflation is harsh on nasal passages and not recommended. Unlike pemoline, hepatotoxicity has not been definitively documented, but liver enzyme monitoring is advisable with chronic use. Cross-tolerance develops with amphetamine-class stimulants. No fatal overdose data available in humans.",

Some blotters sold as 1D-LSD have been found to contain 1T-LSD (1-thienoyl-LSD) instead; reagent tests confirm lysergamide presence but cannot distinguish between analogues. Users report a slightly faster onset (20-30 minutes) and somewhat shorter duration compared to LSD-25. Volumetric dosing is recommended for microdosing. Cross-tolerance with LSD and other lysergamides is complete; wait at least 10-14 days between doses for full tolerance reset. Germany banned 1D-LSD under the NpSG law on June 14, 2024.",

This produces a steep and unforgiving dose-response curve. Unlike THC (a partial agonist), full agonism can cause severe harm including seizures, psychosis, strokes, and cardiac events. Pre-weigh doses on a 0.001g scale; vaporized pure powder reaches peak plasma levels within minutes. Herbal blends may contain variable concentrations (1-50mg/g) with hot spots. Tolerance develops rapidly (within days), and cross-tolerance with all cannabinoids occurs. Prolonged use significantly increases psychosis risk, especially in vulnerable individuals. Emergency care includes benzodiazepines for seizures/agitation, active cooling, and cardiac monitoring.",

Users describe short-lived, 'clean' mental stimulation with mild euphoria, minimal peripheral push, and a relatively soft comedown. Neurotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, and long-term health effects are unknown; treat with the same caution as any novel cathinone-like stimulant. Use accurate scales (±1 mg), start low, stay hydrated, avoid redosing more than once per 4-6 hours, and monitor blood pressure and heart rate. Because it is a ketone, false-positive drug-screen cross-reactivity with amphetamines is possible.",

Dosages remain uncertain with limited human data; start with allergy test at 1 mg or below. The compound produces intense euphoric rushes with stimulation but reportedly lacks the introspective depth of other manic dissociatives. Effects plateau after approximately 80-100 mg with only increased stimulation and muscle tension at higher doses; dissociative holes appear difficult to achieve. Use accurate milligram scales and consider volumetric dosing. Avoid redosing within 4 hours as this sharply increases delirium risk. Maintain hydration and avoid overheated environments. The short duration and forgiving dose-response curve may encourage compulsive use in party settings.",

      "notes": "MXM (3-MeO-2'-Oxo-PCM) is the N-methyl homologue of methoxetamine; replacing the ethyl with a methyl lowers potency roughly 2- to 3-fold but shortens the high to about three hours. Forum experiments suggest oral administration is far more efficient than insufflation, likely due to low nasal absorption; 50-75 mg oral produces warm, serene dissociation and mild empathogenic warmth, while the same amount intranasally may do little. Users describe a 'ketamine-lite' float with MXE-style emotional openness, but with faster tolerance and heavier compulsion to redose. Pharmacological screens (rat brain synaptosome & PDSP panels) show high-micromolar NMDA antagonism and mid-micromolar SERT inhibition, with negligible μ-opioid activity. Because bladder and renal fibrosis seen with chronic MXE are thought to be metabolite-linked, MXM's safety profile is unknown—urotoxicity precautions (hydration, 2-week breaks) are advised. Always reagent-test powders; MMXE often appears as adulterant in DCK/MXE markets. Volumetric dosing or 0.001 g scales are strongly recommended to avoid accidental 200 mg+ intakes.",

The para-fluoro substitution raises lipophilicity and slows oxidative metabolism, explaining >16 hour subjective duration. User reports highlight pronounced anorexia, clean but long-lasting stimulation and muted euphoria compared to classic 4-MAR. Oral dosing is markedly more effective than nasal; vaporization yields harsh pyrolysis products and is strongly discouraged. As with all aminorex derivatives, pulmonary arterial hypertension remains a serious long-term risk—regular echocardiograms are advised for frequent users. Batch purity has ranged 60-90 percent in analyzed samples. Always reagent-test (Mecke produces dark green/black) and start at ≤10 mg to gauge potency. Because the half-life overlaps with next-day activities, plan ≥24 hours before sleep is required and maintain hydration/electrolytes to manage vasoconstriction.",

      "notes": "First definitively identified in Austria in January 2022 and sold online as racemic trans-diastereomer (approximately 90% assay purity). No peer-reviewed pharmacodynamic studies yet exist; structure-activity relationships and subjective reports suggest potency slightly lower than 4-methylaminorex but still active at sub-25 mg doses. User reports from Bluelight and research forums indicate threshold effects at 2-4 mg insufflated and functional amphetamine-like stimulation around 15-25 mg with 12-18 hour wakefulness but modest euphoria. Analytical characterization confirms bromine isotopic LC-HRMS signature (m/z 255.0133 [M+H]+) and chiral separation reveals racemic trans-diastereomer form. Purity differences between batches (85-98%) warn of potential inactive filler or active by-products. Due to lack of toxicology data for halogenated aminorex derivatives, start at 5 mg or less, use 0.001 g precision scales, avoid redosing within 24 hours, maintain hydration and electrolyte balance, and monitor body temperature. Long estimated half-life (8-12 hours) means next-day impairment is likely. Co-administration with vasoconstrictors or pressor drugs elevates risk of pulmonary hypertension historically linked to aminorex compounds.",

Pronounced vasoconstriction and hypertension observed; users with cardiovascular risk factors should avoid. Always confirm identity with reagent testing (Marquis reagent typically shows faint yellow-brown; Mecke shows olive-green) and ideally chromatography, as 3-CEC is sometimes mis-sold as 3-MMC or other cathinones. Due to short half-life, compulsive redosing is common; limit sessions to under 150 mg total, maintain hydration and electrolytes, supplement sleep, and allow at least 2 weeks between uses to reset tolerance and neurotransmitter stores.",

It appears as an off-white crystalline powder, soluble in water and ethanol; aqueous solutions degrade within days due to β-keto hydrolysis - store dry, airtight and cool. Acts primarily as a DAT and NET reuptake inhibitor with partial SERT substrate activity. Typical acute adverse effects include tachycardia (100-130 bpm), hypertension (>140/95 mmHg), jaw clenching, peripheral vasoconstriction and hyperthermia. A fatal poly-intoxication case in a chemsex context (plasma 4-MPD 1285 ng/mL) has been documented. Users report poor oral bioavailability and strong craving for redosing. Setting strict dose and time limits, monitoring vitals, active cooling and maintaining electrolyte and water balance markedly reduce risk.",

Always conduct allergy tests with sub-threshold doses (under 50 ug) and use accurate 0.001 mg scales with volumetric dosing. Limited human pharmacological data exists; no controlled clinical trials have been published. NBOMes are not orally active and must be administered sublingually, buccally, or insufflated. Frequently mislabeled as LSD on blotter paper; NBOMes produce a bitter, metallic taste and cause tongue numbness unlike tasteless LSD. Reagent testing recommended: Marquis shows no color change, Froehde shows yellow-green, Ehrlich typically negative (unlike LSD which turns purple). Strong peripheral stimulation and vasoconstriction can persist hours after visual effects subside. Seek immediate medical attention for severe cold extremities, chest pain, or seizure activity.",

User reports describe a relatively gentle, tactile, and mood-enhancing experience with mild visual effects and a shorter duration than related tryptamines. Recent pharmacological research reveals 4-MeO-MiPT exhibits potent serotonin reuptake inhibition (SSRI activity, IC50 = 57 nM) alongside 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptor agonism, which may account for its atypical psychedelic profile characterized by reduced classical psychedelic effects compared to 4-HO-MiPT and 4-AcO-MiPT. Body load is usually mild (slight jaw tension, pupil dilation, occasional nausea). Potency appears 1.5-2x weaker than 5-MeO-MiPT but batches on the grey market vary; test a low allergy dose (<1 mg). No formal human pharmacology exists; assume cardiovascular and serotonergic risks common to other tryptamines. The fumarate salt is most common and is hygroscopic; store with desiccant. Insufflation greatly shortens onset but is reported as painful and increases nasal irritation.",

NBOMes cause intense peripheral vasoconstriction, tachycardia, hypertension, and may trigger seizures, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, and death. The substance has a bitter, metallic taste that distinguishes it from tasteless LSD. Never re-dose as effects stack unpredictably and dramatically increase body load and toxicity risk. Keep benzodiazepines available for severe anxiety, agitation, or cardiovascular complications. Avoid insufflation as this route is associated with higher death rates. NBOMes are often mis-sold as LSD; if a blotter tastes bitter, do not take it.",

Caustic on nasal tissue; dilute or use a saline wash after insufflation. High doses (30+ mg oral, 25+ mg nasal) increase risk of mania, violent behavior, seizures and prolonged psychosis. Drug checking recommended as 3-Cl-PCP is sometimes mis-sold as 3-MeO-PCP or ketamine. Provide a calm setting, sitter, and avoid redosing during peak to reduce accidents and amnesia.",

Neurotoxicity appears reduced compared with PCA but long-term serotonergic depletion has been observed in rat cortex at ≥10 mg/kg (Kindred et al., 2015). Human use reports are extremely scarce; users describe a ‘clean’, MDMA-lite empathy with typical amphetamine stimulation and minimal visuals. Marked hyperthermia and bruxism were noted at >30 mg.

Anecdotal reports suggest it produces smoother stimulation with enhanced mood elevation compared to 1,3-DMAA. It raises heart rate and blood pressure, causes vasoconstriction, and can precipitate serious cardiovascular events including tachyarrhythmias and intracranial hemorrhage at high doses or in susceptible individuals. Found in dietary supplements at doses ranging from 21-94 mg per serving. The FDA considers products containing 1,4-DMAA to be illegal dietary supplements. Due to lack of analytical reference standards, mislabeling is common; laboratory testing is recommended for purity verification. Start with minimal doses, avoid frequent use (no more than twice weekly), and maintain adequate hydration.",

      "notes": "2C-BZ is an extremely rare or possibly 'phantom' compound with no verified analytical confirmations in published literature. The compound has never been positively identified in seized samples, and anecdotal reports cannot be confirmed. If the compound exists, it would theoretically be the phenethylamine analogue of 3C-BZ (which is documented in PiHKAL). Due to the benzyloxy substituent at the 4-position, it may have higher potency than 2C-B, requiring milligram-scale precision. DO NOT assume any street sample sold as '2C-BZ' contains this compound. Always use reagent testing, and ideally full laboratory analysis (GC-MS/LC-MS/NMR) before consumption. Start with allergy doses (<1 mg) if attempting research. Assume similar risks to other 5-HT2A agonist phenethylamines.",

This compound is the N-(2-methoxybenzyl) derivative of 2C-T-2 and exhibits significantly increased potency compared to its parent compound. Accurate measurement with a 0.001 g (milligram) scale or volumetric dosing is essential; visual dosing is extremely dangerous and responsible for most NBOMe hospitalisations and fatalities. Acute risks include peripheral vasoconstriction, hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia, agitation, and seizures at high doses. Several fatalities have been reported within the NBOMe series from dose confusion and insufflation. NBOMes are inactive if swallowed and must be administered sublingually, buccally, or insufflated. Harm reduction: pre-measure individual doses, never redose within 24 hours, remain hydrated and cool, have benzodiazepines available for severe anxiety. Individuals with cardiovascular disease, epilepsy, or severe mental illness should avoid. NBOMes often fail common reagent tests; use multiple reagents and never assume blotters sold as LSD contain LSD.",

Severe reactions including hypertension, hyponatremia, and seizures have been reported with related piperazines. The synthesis and anorexigenic properties were described in a 1972 patent, but human metabolism, effective dosing, and long-term safety remain largely uncharacterized. Lab testing has occasionally misidentified or found contamination in samples sold as 3,4-CFPP. Start with a very low test dose and avoid combining with any serotonergic medication.",

Reports describe pronounced peripheral vasoconstriction, tachycardia, and body-load similar to other NBOMe and 2C-T compounds; individuals with cardiovascular risk should avoid. 4. Significant inter-individual potency variation has been noted; start at the very low end of the light range. 5. Heat, light, and moisture rapidly degrade the freebase; store airtight in a freezer. 6. NBOMe compounds have been linked to numerous fatalities and severe intoxications even at seemingly moderate doses.

All dosage estimates are extrapolated from structural-activity relationships with related NBOMes (25T2-NBOMe, 25T4-NBOMe) and limited anecdotal reports. This compound may inherit the severe toxicity profile of its parent 2C-T-7, which has been associated with multiple fatalities. NBOMe compounds have been linked to severe vasospasm, seizures, serotonin syndrome, and several deaths at milligram-level dosing. ALWAYS verify material with reagent testing and use an accurate 0.001g scale. Allergy test with 25 ug or less buccal/sublingual is STRONGLY recommended. Insufflation drastically increases bioavailability and medical risk; many NBOMe deaths involved nasal administration. Avoid stacking with any stimulants, MAOIs, or serotonergic drugs. Monitor body temperature and blood pressure closely. Due to extreme potency, volumetric dosing is recommended; label solutions clearly and store safely away from others.",

      "notes": "4-MeO-BF is a highly potent fentanyl analogue first identified in Europe in 2015. Fatal blood concentrations have ranged 2-18 ng/mL, only modestly lower than fentanyl itself. Street material varies wildly in purity; volumetric dosing with a 1 mg/mL (or weaker) solution and a 0.01 mL oral syringe is strongly advised - never eyeball powder. Naloxone 0.4-2 mg IV/IM will reverse toxicity, but its shorter half-life means repeat doses or continuous infusion may be required (re-narcotization common after 30-60 minutes). Always monitor at least 2 hours after last dose. Wear gloves and mask when handling bulk powder: accidental dermal/inhalational exposure has produced poisoning in forensic labs. The short duration drives frequent redosing - a major contributor to overdose.",

Significant batch-to-batch variability in potency has been documented; always use reagent testing and start with a low dose. The hydrochloride salt is 36% more potent by mass than the succinate salt. Common adverse effects include hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia, and jaw clenching. Post-use 'brain zaps,' anhedonia, and depressed mood lasting days to weeks are frequently reported.

DAT activity is negligible, explaining its low stimulant euphoria compared to BZP. Subjectively, it produces light empathic warmth, mild color enhancement/tracers, and prominent vasoconstrictive \"head pressure.\" Nausea, migraine-like headaches, myalgia, and anxiety are common above ~100 mg. Unlike BZP, 4-FPP inhibits several hepatic CYPs (notably 1A2, 2D6, 3A4), which can prolong co-administered drugs. Rodent LD50 (oral) ≈ 400 mg/kg; no confirmed fatalities as sole agent, but severe hyperthermia, seizures, and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in polydrug cases. Weigh carefully, stay hydrated, and avoid redosing (>120 mg markedly increases adverse effects).",

Acute risks include tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, agitation, bruxism, mydriasis, anxiety, and panic. Severe complications include rhabdomyolysis and serotonin-toxicity-like syndromes when combined with serotonergic agents. Purity varies widely in street samples; use reagent testing (Marquis: pale yellow to brown) and accurate milligram scales. Avoid frequent redosing to limit cumulative cardiotoxicity. Hydration (250 ml water per hour), electrolyte intake, and post-session nutrition mitigate comedown effects.

Sub-milligram accuracy is essential; use a 0.001 mg analytical balance and volumetric dosing. Vasoconstriction, tachycardia, and peripheral numbness are commonly reported. Serious incidents with the NBOMe/NBMD family include hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, seizures, and fatal overdoses - almost always from mis-weighed doses or insufflation. Never insufflate this compound. Always start low, dose once per session, ensure calm setting, and have benzodiazepines available. Swallowing the blotter dramatically reduces bioavailability; hold sublingually for 15-30 minutes for optimal absorption.",

Primary activity occurs through potent partial agonism at 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors with bias toward β-arrestin 2 signaling; peripheral α-adrenergic activity contributes to vasoconstriction and cardiovascular strain. Oral bioavailability is low; sublingual, buccal, or insufflated administration is typically used. Marked vasoconstriction, tachycardia, and hypertension have been reported at doses of 8 mg and above. Fatal intoxications with closely related NBOMe compounds have occurred, often involving polydrug combinations with stimulants or MAOIs. Individual response is highly variable; an allergy test dose (500 mcg or less) is strongly recommended before full experimentation. This substance should never be insufflated at high doses due to increased overdose risk.",

      "notes": "4'-Chlorodiazepam (Ro5-4864) displays nanomolar affinity for the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor/TSPO located on the outer mitochondrial membrane while showing orders-of-magnitude lower affinity for central GABA-A sites. Low-dose TSPO activation can produce neurosteroidogenesis and mild sedation; higher micromolar concentrations become anxiogenic and pro-convulsant in animals. Median convulsive dose (CD₅₀) in mice approximately 42 mg/kg i.p. No controlled human pharmacokinetic data exist. Extrapolations from dog and rat studies suggest oral bioavailability approximately 40-60% and an elimination half-life of 6-9 hours, with no confirmed active metabolites. Human case reports are extremely scarce; anecdotal user reports describe a narrow therapeutic window, inconsistent subjective effects (ranging from mild relaxation to pronounced inner restlessness) and delayed-onset seizures after redosing above 5 mg. Start with micro-doses (0.5 mg or less), use an analytical milligram scale, wait a full 2 hours before considering redose. Parenteral routes are strongly discouraged: solvent requirements and local TSPO densities create unpredictable tissue reactions. Because of the unique mechanism, benzodiazepine antagonists (flumazenil) are ineffective in overdose; supportive care and anticonvulsants are preferred.",

Because of low psychedelic potency, users may attempt multi-milligram doses, greatly increasing peripheral toxicity risk (tachycardia, hypertension, vasospasm). Very limited human data exists; serious adverse reactions (panic, chest pain, prolonged hypertension) have been reported. Use extreme caution with accurate milligram scales, start with allergy test (<0.25 mg), and avoid redosing. Parenteral routes (IV/IM) strongly discouraged. Blotters sold as other NBOMes/LSD have occasionally contained 25H-NBOMe.",

      "notes": "4-AcO-DPT is a research chemical tryptamine first reported around 2012 that acts as a prodrug to 4-HO-DPT through rapid de-acetylation. User reports indicate relatively poor oral bioavailability; intranasal or rectal routes produce shorter but more efficient experiences at roughly half oral doses, though insufflation can cause sharp stinging. The compound produces colorful, fast-moving visuals with pronounced physical stimulation including tremor, jaw tension, and visceral body load, yet comparatively less mystical depth than classic psychedelics. Rapid tolerance develops after a single session. Analytical purity varies on the grey market; verify with reagent testing where possible. Limited toxicology data exists, so conservative dosing, proper hydration, and having a sober sitter are strongly advised.",

Most users describe a 'bimodal' experience: colourful mescaline-like visuals and empathic warmth alongside noticeable peripheral stimulation (jaw tension, sweating, mild hypertension). Body-load is highly dose-dependent; doses ≥50 mg frequently produce tachycardia, nausea or vascular tightness. Start low, dose once, stay hydrated, and allocate 12-16 hours without responsibilities. Allow at least 14 days between sessions to minimise rapid tolerance and receptor down-regulation. No formal human pharmacokinetic data exist; limited modelling of blood spots from an emergency-department case suggested an elimination half-life of roughly 5–8 hours with active metabolites possibly extending activity.",

Oral bioavailability is poor, requiring 5-10 times the buccal dose with slower onset. User reports describe intense visual geometry, vivid color enhancement, tactile stimulation, and pronounced peripheral vasoconstriction with cold extremities and elevated heart rate. Like all NBOMes, this compound poses serious overdose risks including severe hypertension, seizures, and cardiotoxicity; deaths have been recorded with related compounds. Never administer orally by swallowing blotters directly; volumetric dosing is essential due to the extreme potency. A 0.001g scale is insufficient for accurate measurement. Buccal/sublingual administration causes tongue numbness; hold in cheek 15-20 minutes before swallowing residue. Start with a light dose to assess individual sensitivity as potency varies significantly between batches.",

All dosage and duration information is extrapolated from limited animal pharmacology studies and scarce user reports. In vitro studies suggest markedly reduced SERT (serotonin transporter) affinity compared to MDMA while retaining NET and DAT activity, with modest 5-HT2B agonism. This profile indicates the compound may be less empathogenic and more stimulant-focused than MDMA. Halogen substitution can extend half-life and increase 5-HT2B receptor activation, potentially raising cardiac valvulopathy risk. Neurotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, and hepatotoxicity profiles remain uncharacterized. Use an accurate milligram scale and reagent test kit (Marquis/Mandelin reactions should parallel MDMA but may develop more slowly). Maintain proper hydration (approximately 500-750 ml water per hour maximum with electrolytes), avoid prolonged strenuous activity, and monitor body temperature. Avoid re-dosing as this markedly increases acute risks. Given the novelty of this compound, approach each use as an experimental session with a sober sitter present.",

This combination produces pronounced stimulation alongside dissociation. Reports describe lucid, often manic psychostimulation with euphoria, pressured thought, and elevated cardiovascular parameters. The compound is exceptionally caustic when insufflated. Accurate 0.001g scales are mandatory; volumetric dosing (up to 50 mg/mL in water) is strongly recommended. Duration is shorter than PCP but longer than ketamine. Redosing greatly prolongs effects.

      "notes": "3-Methylethcathinone (3-MEC, 3-MeEC) is the 3-methyl positional isomer of 4-MEC and a close analogue of mephedrone. It emerged on the grey market around 2010-2012 and is usually encountered as an off-white crystalline powder. Pharmacological data are extremely sparse; limited in vitro assays suggest it acts primarily as a dopamine/norepinephrine releaser and reuptake inhibitor with weaker serotonergic activity than 4-MMC or MDMA. User reports describe a more alert, 'speed-like' character with only mild empathogenic warmth. Because the subjective peak is brief (approximately 40-60 minutes), many users feel compelled to redose every 30-60 minutes, rapidly escalating total intake and cardiovascular strain. Common acute adverse effects include tachycardia, hypertension, jaw tension, anxiety, and peripheral vasoconstriction; severe hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in cathinone overdoses. Stay hydrated but avoid over-hydration, monitor body temperature, and leave at least 2 hours between redoses. Purity of street samples varies greatly and 3-MEC has been found in products sold as 'NRG-2'; reagent testing (Marquis, Mecke) can help identify adulterants but will not distinguish between cathinone isomers. Lab analysis (GC-MS/LC-MS) is recommended where available. Avoid combining with other stimulants or heavy physical exertion. Individuals with cardiovascular, seizure, or psychiatric disorders should abstain.",

High doses can produce full anesthesia and complete dissociation (hole experience). Harm reduction: always confirm identity with reagent tests (Mandelin reagent typically yields olive-green to black coloration similar to ketamine). Start with an allergy test, avoid redosing within 24 hours to limit rapid tolerance and bladder stress, stay hydrated, and remain seated or lying down to reduce fall risk during peak effects.",

Users consistently describe markedly milder visuals than DMT but pronounced bodily warmth, slight dissociation, and a dreamy head-space. Many compare it to a cross between low-dose DMT and 5-MeO-DMT, though without the ego-dissolving intensity. Because safety data are limited, start with allergy test (<3 mg vaporized) and titrate slowly. *MAOI co-administration is strongly discouraged until more pharmacokinetic work is published.",

The substance produces moderate body load including nausea, muscle tension, and vasoconstriction. Users report a pronounced emotional and empathogenic quality with increased tactile sensitivity. The dose-response curve is steep above 15 mg. Due to the steep dose-response curve, precise measurement with a 0.001g scale is essential. Members of the 2C-T-x series may have weak MAO-A inhibitory properties. Sleep may be difficult until 10-12 hours post-ingestion. Little formal toxicology data exists; limited case reports suggest hypertensive incidents at doses at or above 22mg.",

Produces stronger peripheral vasoconstriction than parent 2C-B-FLY - cold extremities and limb numbness are common. Maintain moderate ambient temperature and hydrate adequately. Animal studies show significant locomotor suppression and sensorimotor gating disruption at doses equivalent to 1 mg/kg. Metabolized primarily by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 with active O-demethylated metabolites; poor metabolizers may experience prolonged effects. Free-base dissolves poorly in ethanol concentrations below 20%; use 95%+ ethanol or 1:1 PEG-400/ethanol for solutions (100 ug/mL typical).",

Often mis-sold as 'NRG-3' (a brand name that typically contained MDPV or α-PVP instead). Marked nasal mucosa irritation when insufflated; eye/airway irritation when vaporized. Acute harms mirror other cathinones: tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, and potential for rhabdomyolysis especially when combined with physical exertion or heat. Practice strict temperature regulation, maintain hydration with isotonic fluids, and implement harm reduction measures to minimize cardiovascular strain. Avoid multi-day binges as sleep deprivation significantly amplifies psychosis risk.",

Analytical studies confirm it hydrolyzes in vitro and in vivo to LSD-25. User reports and reagent-testing services indicate the blotters do not trigger Ehrlich or DMAB reagents, necessitating laboratory confirmation. Community consensus suggests oral potency is approximately 70 percent of equimolar LSD-25, with a noticeably slower onset but identical plateau once conversion occurs. Silicon-carbon bonds are hydrolytically labile; moisture-exposed tabs may degrade within weeks. Store in dry foil at less than 10 degrees Celsius. Always verify blotter identity with multiple reagents, arrange a 14-hour safety window before obligations, and keep benzodiazepines available for panic or prolonged stimulation.",

It first appeared in forensic seizures in late 2020 and is often mis-sold as MDMA, leading to 100 mg-scale overdoses. Harm-reduction groups list 20-50 mg as the entire active range; stay below 35 mg until identity is confirmed. Users describe rapid onset rush, intense peripheral vasoconstriction (cold extremities, chest pressure), and a short 2-hour plateau followed by edgy stimulation that tempts redosing. Reagent testing: Mandelin → reddish-brown; Liebermann → bright yellow, distinguishing it from MDMA. Volumetric solutions (1 mg/mL in PG/ethanol) allow sub-5 mg test doses. Strong hydration, electrolytes, breaks of ≥2 weeks, and benzodiazepine rescue (2-4 mg diazepam equivalent) are recommended to manage crashes and paranoia. Because half-life is short (~2-3 hours extrapolated from α-PVP rat pharmacokinetics) but sympathomimetic after-effects linger, insomnia and compulsive redosing are major risks.",

      "notes": "Fresh aerial tissue turns deep purple in 95% ethanol, signalling extraction of monotropitoside, gaultherin and related methyl-salicylate glycosides. Grayanotoxin-like diterpenes have been detected at <0.01% w/w and may underlie the dissociative 'pain-beside-me' effect noted by many users. Because the plant is myco-heterotrophic and locally sparse, sustainable harvest means taking ≤10% of a patch and only once the flowers droop. A purple tincture kept in amber glass remains potent ~3 years refrigerated. Powdered root (historically ½-1 drachm) produces heavier somatic numbness and occasional emesis; modern harm-reduction suggests staying below 4 g and combining with ginger to curb nausea. Preliminary mouse work shows significant antinociception at 100 mg kg⁻¹ correlating with salicylic-acid plasma peaks (t½ ≈ 3-5 h). No human fatalities documented, yet glycosidic salicylates can provoke Reye-like hepatic injury in children; avoid in under-16 s. Therapeutic dosing (tincture): start with 3 drops and wait 15-30 minutes; if no response, increase to 1 mL (≈30 drops). Condition-specific ranges include moderate pain or anxiety (3-10 drops as needed), severe pain (up to 20 drops per dose), migraine or chronic daily headache (30-100 drops every few hours), Lyme disease coinfection pain (30 drops up to 6x daily), and acute panic or psychotic episodes (1-3 mL doses, repeatable at 5-minute intervals in crisis). Herbalist David Winston recommends 20-30 drops (1-1.5 mL) 4x daily for chronic conditions, while insomnia typically responds to 3-20 drops 15-30 minutes before sleep. Continuous daily use should not exceed one month due to unknown long-term grayanotoxin exposure. Absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy, lactation, children (unknown safe pediatric dose), and concurrent use with ADHD stimulants. Overdose symptoms include blurred vision, dizziness, excessive perspiration, muscle weakness, hypotension, hypersalivation, and paresthesia around mouth or extremities; if ingestion occurred within 2 hours, administer activated charcoal (0.5-1 g/kg in children, 25-100 g in adults) and provide supportive care. Note: 1 dropper (squeezed 2x) ≈ 30 drops ≈ 1 mL; 1 teaspoon ≈ 120 drops. Ghost Pipe should be treated as a co-analgesic rather than a primary anaesthetic—users liken its action to 'moving the pain 6 inches to the left' rather than abolishing it.",

Many blotters may contain iso-lysergamides or residual solvents; Ehrlich reagent confirms indole presence but not purity. Gastro-intestinal discomfort and mild nausea are the main acute side-effects. Use harm reduction practices including accurate dosing, test kits, appropriate set and setting, and avoid combinations with other substances without thorough research.",

      "notes": "4-PrO-MET is marketed in Europe as pressed pellets labeled 15-20 mg; multiple user reports indicate substantial potency variability between batches, so titration from 2-3 mg is prudent. A German-language thread documents perceived microdose at 0.5-3 mg, light 4-8 mg, and 8 mg+ as very strong; half of a 15 mg pellet (approximately 7.5 mg) ranged from mild to quite strong depending on the commenter, underscoring variability in pressing and individual sensitivity. As an O-propionyl ester at the 4-position, 4-PrO-MET is expected to hydrolyze to 4-HO-MET in vivo; human data are absent, but analogous work with 4-PrO-DMT demonstrates psychedelic activity in animals and supports the prodrug model. Compared with 4-HO-MET, some users describe slightly slower onset and equal or lower mg-for-mg potency; others report unexpectedly strong visuals from a single pellet, suggesting either under- or over-filled tablets or uneven distribution of active compound. A conservative harm-reduction approach is to treat 4-PrO-MET as roughly equipotent to 4-AcO-MET and somewhat less potent than 4-HO-MET, keeping first trials at or below 5-7 mg. Come-up may be sneaky with waves, yawning, and mild nausea; set and setting control anxiety spikes. Visuals can be intense and cartoony, while headspace is often reported as lighter than psilocybin or LSD. Cannabis co-use reliably amplifies visuals but can worsen body-load. Acute tolerance develops within hours; wait at least 7-14 days before re-dosing to regain baseline response. Because this is a novel ester, reagent tests may not distinguish it from other tryptamines; consider multi-reagent testing plus, where feasible, analytical confirmation. Avoid insufflation due to ester hydrolysis uncertainty, harshness, and limited benefit; oral titration is preferred.",

Active metabolite of diclazepam and cloxazolam; users may feel its effects even when taking those prodrugs. Because it is potent (approximately 10 times more potent than diazepam by weight) and long-acting, start with the low end of the dosing range, especially in naive or respiratory-compromised individuals. Oral bioavailability is approximately 77-87 percent; food has little effect. Avoid abrupt cessation after more than 2 weeks of continuous use; taper 5-10 percent every 1-2 weeks to minimize withdrawal (seizure risk).",

Marked vasoconstriction, bruxism, and elevated heart rate have been reported. Keep hydrated (approximately 250 ml water per hour) and avoid overheating. Pre-loading with 200-400 mg magnesium may lessen jaw tension. Insomnia and transient low mood the following day are common; consider 100-200 mg 5-HTP only after the acute phase (12+ hours) if no contraindications. Do not redose repeatedly; anecdotal reports suggest sharply diminishing returns and increased side effects. 2-MAPB has been detected in fatal toxicology cases, but only in combination with other substances.",

Users report a slow come-up, mild closed-eye visuals, warmth/euphoria, tachycardia, jaw tension and long-lasting stimulation. Nausea, vasoconstriction and headaches are common at >80 mg. Because pharmacokinetics are uncharacterised, start with allergy test (1-2 mg) and do not redose for at least 3 hours. Always reagent-test—2,5-dimethoxybenzyl chloride and other NBOMe precursors can co-occur in samples.",

Marked inter-individual variability exists; some users report minimal effects below 30 mg while others reach full dissociation at 25 mg. Start low and titrate carefully. Visual and auditory distortions are lighter than PCP/3-MeO-PCP but balance issues, tinnitus, and time perception distortions are common. Prolonged vertigo, body numbness, and memory impairment (>12 hours) have been described after heavy redosing. No validated reagent test; will typically show weak to no color reaction with Marquis/Mecke. Send to laboratory for confirmation. Avoid driving for at least 12 hours after last dose. Harm reduction: weigh to 1 mg accuracy, dose no more than once every 3-4 days to control tolerance and potential bladder risks.",

Acute risks mirror those of other potent cathinones: tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, hyponatremia from excessive water intake, acute psychosis, and serotonin syndrome when mixed with serotonergics. Weigh doses on a 0.001 g scale and perform an allergy test under 2 mg. Redosing markedly prolongs stimulation and increases vasoconstriction—limit to one redose if at all. Maintain electrolytes with sports drinks, keep body temperature in check, and eat a balanced meal beforehand. Allow at least 4-6 weeks between sessions to reduce neuroadaptation and mood disturbances.",

Heating above 110°C rapidly converts it to CBD via decarboxylation, so CBDA products must remain unheated to preserve potency. In vitro and animal research shows CBDA has approximately 100-fold greater affinity for the 5-HT1A serotonin receptor compared to CBD and exhibits selective COX-2 enzyme inhibition. These mechanisms underlie its reported anti-nausea, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties. Human anecdotal reports describe a clear-headed, mildly uplifting effect without intoxication. Oral bioavailability appears substantially higher than CBD (approximately 19% versus 6%), so markedly lower doses achieve therapeutic effects. CBDA inhibits CYP450 enzymes (2C9, 2C19, 3A4) and should be used cautiously with narrow-therapeutic-index medications.",

It acts as a weak partial agonist at CB1/CB2 receptors with low affinity, but is a potent α2-adrenergic agonist and 5-HT1A antagonist, which may underlie its alert-yet-calm profile. Human clinical trial data (20 mg oral) demonstrated significant anxiety reduction without cognitive impairment. Safety concerns exist due to α2-adrenergic activation potentially causing sedation, dry mouth, and reduced blood pressure/heart rate. Metabolized primarily by CYP2J2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 enzymes. Commercial products vary widely in purity; verify COA showing ≥98% CBG and <0.3% THC to avoid unexpected intoxication.",

Users describe rapid, clean stimulation with mild empathogenic warmth, stronger on dopamine and norepinephrine than serotonin. Significant cardiovascular strain including tachycardia and vasoconstriction, along with harsh comedowns, have been reported above approximately 60 mg oral. Because metabolic and toxicological profiles are unknown, start with allergy tests (5 mg or less) and avoid frequent redosing. No published human toxicity cases exist, but animal hepatotoxicity data on structural analogues suggest possible liver stress at high doses.

Strong histamine release and chest-wall rigidity have been described with analogous compounds. Always employ test-dose strategy and never use alone - respiratory depression can appear abruptly during or immediately after peak. Fentanyl testing strips are unlikely to detect 4Cl-iBF reliably.

Acute toxicity can involve severe tachycardia, hypertension or hypotension, seizures, loss of consciousness, acute psychosis, and respiratory depression. Because the parent drug and active metabolites are lipophilic, impairment can outlast the subjective high. Emergency management is supportive (benzodiazepines for agitation and seizure control, antiemetics, IV fluids, cardiac monitoring). Naloxone is NOT effective.

      "notes": "ADB-INACA is an indazole-3-carboxamide frequently detected as a precursor or minor component alongside potent synthetic cannabinoids in seized products; real-world harms often reflect co-formulation with more active compounds rather than pure ADB-INACA effects. As a suspected precursor to compounds like ADB-BUTINACA, overall potency is expected to be low, though pharmacological data remain limited. Treat unknown powders and sprayed materials as if they contain nanomolar CB1 agonists; never eyeball doses, use a milligram scale or volumetric solutions, start at sub-milligram smoked or low-milligram oral doses, and wait through the full peak before redosing. Plant matter and papers can have uneven application creating dangerous hotspots; thorough homogenization and dilute solutions reduce per-puff variability. Acute risks for synthetic cannabinoids include tachycardia, severe anxiety or panic, agitation, nausea, confusion, transient psychosis, seizures, and rare hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, and cardiotoxicity; polydrug use amplifies these dangers. Color reagents cannot identify specific SCRAs; only GC-MS or LC-MS can confirm identity. Legal exposure may arise via analogue laws even where ADB-INACA remains unscheduled. Employ conservative set and setting, avoid driving during active window plus after-effects, stay hydrated, and set session limits to prevent compulsive redosing.",

Physiological risks include tachycardia, hypertension, mydriasis, bruxism, thermoregulatory dysregulation, chest tightness, and seizures. Harm reduction practices: use a milligram-accurate scale, start with half a common dose to gauge sensitivity, limit redosing intervals to minimum 3 hours, keep total session usage under 250 mg, maintain hydration with 250 ml isotonic drinks per hour, and take minimum 2-week breaks between sessions.

      "notes": "4-Methylephedrine (4-ME) is a phase-I reduction metabolite of the popular cathinone mephedrone (4-MMC). In users who take raw or poorly washed 4-MMC, small amounts may already be present as an impurity. Pure 4-ME occasionally appears on the grey market but formal pharmacology is limited. Available in-vitro data show it acts as a norepinephrine > dopamine transporter inhibitor/releaser with little serotonergic action, explaining its 'clean' peripheral stimulation and modest euphoria. CRITICAL WARNING: Reports suggest 4-ME may be significantly more cardiotoxic than ephedrine, with pronounced cardiovascular stress (tachycardia, vasoconstriction, blood-pressure rise) being more pronounced than central euphoria. Hydration, electrolyte balance and cooling are therefore essential. Because it is a metabolite, standard reagent tests for cathinones may give weak or negative color changes; confirm identity with GC-MS if critical. Legal status varies by jurisdiction.",

Pre-clinical data suggest anticonvulsant, anti-inflammatory, and 5-HT1A-mediated anti-nausea properties similar to CBDA, but human data are sparse. Like CBD, CBDVA appears to inhibit CYP3A4, CYP2C19 and CYP2C9, so therapeutic drug monitoring is advised when combined with narrow-therapeutic-index medications (e.g., warfarin, clobazam, tacrolimus). Because it is non-intoxicating, subjective effects are subtle; many users report clearer focus and reduced anxiety rather than overt euphoria. Long-term safety data are lacking; start low, especially if you have liver disease or take hepatically-metabolized drugs. Typical commercial products (tinctures, 'Forbidden V' hemp flower, etc.) contain a mixture of CBDVA, CBDA and THCA—confirm cannabinoid content before dosing.",

      "notes": "CBN is produced by oxidative degradation of delta-9-THC and is usually present in aged cannabis or as an isolate in commercial sleep products. It is mildly psychoactive at very high doses (approximately 25% of THC's CB1 affinity) but produces measurable sedation, muscle relaxation and mild analgesia at typical doses. Oral bioavailability is low (6-10%); high-fat meals increase absorption. CBN is metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 enzymes to 11-OH-CBN (2x as potent as CBN). Avoid driving or operating machinery after dosing. Products marketed as CBN often contain significant CBD or trace THC; verify with a certificate of analysis to avoid unintentional intoxication or failed drug tests. Legal status varies by jurisdiction; even hemp-derived CBN may be considered a controlled cannabinoid in some regions.",

      "notes": "Amfecloral was marketed in the 1960s-70s as the anorectic Acutran and withdrawn worldwide by 1973. It functions as a prodrug that hydrolyzes to approximately equimolar amounts of dextroamphetamine (and some levoamphetamine) plus chloral hydrate, producing a unique profile with milder stimulation than pure amphetamine but potential next-day grogginess from the sedative component. The chloral metabolite (trichloroethanol) is a GABAergic hypnotic that can potentiate other CNS depressants—exercise caution with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or barbiturates. Historically, it was noted for having \"little to no stimulant activity\" compared to other amphetamines, likely due to the powerful sedating effects of chloral hydrate. Little modern human data exists; dosage ranges are extrapolated from historic prescribing information (25 mg tablets, 1-3 times daily) and limited user reports. Chronic high-dose use may add hepatotoxic stress beyond that of amphetamine alone due to chloral's liver metabolism. Drug checking is strongly recommended as authentic material is extremely rare and the name is sometimes misused online.",

Sub-milligram precision is mandatory; use a 0.001g scale and volumetric dosing. Reports describe a calm, slightly dissociative high, but acute anxiety, tachycardia, and transient psychotic episodes have occurred, especially with products of unknown purity. Two psychiatric hospitalizations were reported in Ireland shortly after commercial release (2010). Headache and vasoconstriction are common above 1mg. The compound contains an iodobenzoyl moiety and a 5-fluoropentyl chain; toxic metabolites including iodine release and fluoroalkyl oxidative products are plausible. Some reports suggest oral consumption may produce highly toxic fluoroacetic acid via metabolism. Oral route should be avoided. Long-term safety is unknown. Avoid daily use, minimize combustion temperatures above 230°C to limit toxic pyrolysates, and store away from light to reduce degradation.",

In clinical trials (10-90 mg/day) it showed rapid relief of anxiety and modest antidepressant efficacy comparable to tricyclics with fewer anticholinergic effects. Human studies found adinazolam causes the most mental and physical sedation compared to diazepam and lorazepam, along with significant mental unpleasantness. Recreationally it produces a calm effect with less amnesia than diazepam, though individual reports vary. Because of its short half-life, interdose rebound anxiety is common and redosing drives escalation. Metabolized hepatically (CYP3A4) to N-desmethyl-adinazolam (active, 25-fold more potent), alpha-hydroxy-alprazolam, and estazolam; CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole can double plasma levels. Avoid combining with other CNS depressants, driving for at least 8 hours after last dose, and use extra caution in geriatric users due to falls risk.",

Acute adverse events include severe anxiety, panic, auditory hallucinations, visual distortions, tachycardia, hypertension, seizures, acute kidney injury, and rhabdomyolysis. Very limited human data exist; long-term neurotoxicity is unknown. Avoid driving for at least 6 hours. Due to its potency, AM-2233 is sometimes used to adulterate herbal cannabis products—unexpectedly strong reactions have been reported.",

Deaths often involve seizures, hyperthermia, pulmonary edema and cardiac arrest.\n• Many ‘spice’, ‘K2’, ‘24K Gold’ or ‘AK-47’ herbal blends have highly variable hotspots; even mixing cannot guarantee uniform concentration.\n• Metabolized mainly by CYP3A4; strong inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, grapefruit) may dramatically prolong and intensify effects.\n• No known antidote; treatment is supportive (benzodiazepines for agitation/seizure, IV fluids & cooling for hyperthermia).",

      "notes": "Etoxadrol is a dioxolane NMDA antagonist developed as a dissociative anesthetic; unlike arylcyclohexylamines (PCP/ketamine), it features a 1,3-dioxolane piperidine scaffold. Clinical work shows IV 0.75 mg/kg yields anesthesia averaging 26 minutes (14-53 minutes) with active airway reflexes but raised heart rate/blood pressure and tachypnea. Prominent post-dose phenomena include alternating nystagmus lasting hours and vivid dream-like states; approximately 20% of patients reported unpleasant or threatening dreams persisting up to 24 hours. One overdose case at 4.65 mg/kg caused catalepsy, amnesia, and analgesia lasting 6 days. Binding studies place etoxadrol as a high-affinity PCP-site channel blocker at NMDA receptors (Ki = 107 nM), explaining PCP-like behavioral effects and animal self-administration. Human non-medical reports are essentially absent; modern forum discussions focus on historical data, indicating extreme scarcity and poor tolerability compared to ketamine. Harm reduction: avoid non-medical use; if exposed in clinical or accidental context, monitor airway despite preserved reflexes, guard against emesis/aspiration during immobility, and anticipate hypertension/tachycardia. Do not combine with alcohol, opioids, or benzodiazepines due to synergistic respiratory/CNS depression; stimulant mixing increases cardiovascular and psychosis risks. Expect rapid tolerance/cross-tolerance across NMDA antagonists. Identity risk is high in any grey-market context; only lab confirmation (e.g., GC-MS) can verify. Psychological emergence reactions can be severe.",

Start with allergy test (<5 mg vaped or <25 mg oral).\n• May cause dose-dependent hypotension, tachycardia, dry mouth, nausea, and impaired motor coordination. Very high doses in rodents produced hypothermia and catalepsy.\n• Avoid driving for at least 6 h after use.\n• Being peripherally restricted does NOT guarantee absence of central effects if very large doses are taken or if the blood–brain barrier is compromised (e.g., by alcohol or inflammation).",

Psychoactive effects are generally subtle or absent; some users describe a clear-headed, slightly stimulating sensation of bodily calm. Because extracts often contain other cannabinoids, confirm lab reports to estimate actual CBDV content before dosing. Start low when combining with THC, as CBDV can transiently blunt THC intoxication and shorten its duration.",

It is produced naturally during storage and aging of cannabis, or rapidly when heated above ~110°C. CBNA itself has minimal affinity for CB1/CB2 receptors and is regarded as non-intoxicating. Limited animal research suggests mild anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity; anecdotal human use points to gentle sedation similar to low-dose CBN. Pharmacokinetic and toxicological data are sparse due to scarcity on the recreational market. Oral bioavailability is poor but improves with lipid carriers (e.g., MCT oil). Heating converts CBNA to CBN, changing the effect profile. Start with low doses, especially when combined with other CNS depressants. High doses (>100 mg oral) may cause pronounced drowsiness, dry mouth, and lowered blood pressure.",

It acts as a prodrug that rapidly hydrolyzes to MiPLA, similar to how 1P-LSD converts to LSD. Potency is approximately 60-80% of LSD by weight; many users find 150 ug comparable to 100 ug LSD. The experience is notably shorter (4-6 hours vs 8-12 hours for LSD) and described as more recreational with less headspace intensity. Visual effects are clean and cartoonish, while the body high is pleasurable without the anxiety common at higher LSD doses. Virtually no toxicity data exists in humans; start low, employ allergy testing, and allow at least 14 days between psychedelic sessions to minimize tolerance and HPPD risk. Reagent testing (Ehrlich) will give positive indole reactions but cannot confirm identity; laboratory analysis is required for certainty.",

Despite being theoretically related to active NBOMe compounds, extensive anecdotal evidence from 2013-2016 indicates this substance produces minimal to no psychoactive effects at doses ranging from micrograms to hundreds of milligrams across multiple routes of administration. Only one isolated positive report exists amid numerous reports of complete inactivity. Material sold as C30-NBOMe may be an inert compound, a mislabeled substance, degradation products, or simply inactive due to its unusual chemical structure. The substance is not documented in major harm reduction databases (PsychonautWiki, TripSit). Due to the extreme uncertainty regarding its true identity, pharmacology, and potential toxicity, any material purported to be C30-NBOMe should be approached with maximum caution and subjected to analytical testing before any consideration of use.",

      "notes": "Bufotenin is a naturally occurring tryptamine found in Anadenanthera (Yopo/Cebil) seeds and in the parotoid glands of certain Bufo and Incilius toads. The Colorado River toad (Incilius alvarius) contains primarily 5-MeO-DMT, not bufotenin, and 'toad-licking' is extremely dangerous due to cardiotoxic bufadienolides in the venom. Pure bufotenin freebase vaporizes at approximately 160°C; use low-temperature glass pipes or e-mesh devices to minimize harshness. The substance produces marked peripheral vasoconstriction, flushing, tachycardia, and has been associated with bronchospasm, especially at doses above 40 mg or when administered intravenously. Individuals with asthma, hypertension, or cardiovascular conditions should avoid use. Oral activity is normally negligible due to rapid MAO-A degradation; co-administration of reversible MAOIs renders it fully active but markedly increases physiological risks. Bufotenin acts as a monoamine reuptake inhibitor and can become dangerously toxic when combined with MAOIs, SSRIs, stimulants, or other serotonergic substances. Legal status: Schedule I in the USA, Class A in the UK, Schedule 9 in Australia, controlled under NpSG in Germany.",

As a potent κ-opioid receptor agonist with partial agonist/antagonist activity at the μ-receptor, it produces analgesia with less respiratory depression than morphine but a high incidence of dysphoria, vertigo, and hallucinatory experiences. Recreational reports describe darkened or tunnel vision, mild warmth, dissociative or salvia-like headspace, and amnestic episodes at higher doses. Can precipitate withdrawal in users dependent on strong μ-agonists (morphine, methadone, fentanyl). Concomitant CNS depressants markedly increase risk of respiratory depression. Intranasal spray is the most common human formulation (1 mg per spray). Oral bioavailability is very low (5-17%) due to extensive first-pass metabolism, making oral dosing unpredictable. Use sterile technique for injections; veterinary multi-dose vials often contain bacteriostatic preservatives but are not guaranteed pyrogen-free for human use.",

      "notes": "Atropine is a naturally occurring tropane alkaloid found in Atropa belladonna and related nightshades. Medically it is employed to treat bradycardia, organophosphate poisoning, and to induce mydriasis. Recreational use is strongly discouraged: its psychoactive profile is characterised by true delirium, intense peripheral anticholinergic burden, and profound amnesia. The effective dose range for central effects lies dangerously close to the toxic and potentially lethal range; fatalities have occurred at doses only modestly above those that cause hallucinations. Individual sensitivity varies widely and children are especially vulnerable. Severe complications include tachyarrhythmia, hyperthermia, urinary retention, seizures, respiratory failure, and coma. Physostigmine is the antidote but must be administered in hospital. Even low-concentration ophthalmic solutions can cause systemic poisoning if ingested. Pursue immediate emergency care if severe agitation, confusion, or visual disturbances follow exposure. The classic anticholinergic toxidrome mnemonic is 'hot as a hare, blind as a bat, dry as a bone, red as a beet, and mad as a hatter.'",

Users often stack with choline sources (CDP-choline, alpha-GPC) to reduce racetam-type headaches, though clinical necessity is unproven. Produces mild anxiolysis in some users without cognitive dulling. Not approved by U.S. FDA; prescribed in parts of Europe/Asia (750-1500 mg/day) for post-stroke cognitive impairment. Due to rapid metabolism, split dosing (e.g., 750 mg every 3-4 hours) is favored for sustained effect. Therapeutic effects may take 3-4 weeks to become noticeable. Rare adverse effects include headache, gastrointestinal upset, irritability, skin flushing. Discontinue if visual disturbances, agitation or severe nausea occur.",

      "notes": "Acetyldihydrocodeine is a 6-acetyl ester prodrug of dihydrocodeine discovered in Germany in 1914. It is rapidly deacetylated to dihydrocodeine and subsequently O-demethylated via CYP2D6 to the more potent active metabolite dihydromorphine. Potency is approximately 1.2-1.5 times that of dihydrocodeine by weight. CYP2D6 poor metabolizers may experience reduced effects, while ultrarapid metabolizers face greater overdose risk. Start with lower doses if opioid-naive. Poorly water-soluble and unsuitable for IV administration due to high risk of pulmonary embolism. Histamine release causing pruritus is common. Once used medically as an analgesic and cough suppressant in Europe, it is now rarely prescribed but remains under international control (Schedule I of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs). In the United States, it is a Schedule I controlled substance (DEA ACSCN 9051).",

It is considerably less studied than 25I-NBOMe and 25C-NBOMe, with minimal human pharmacokinetic data available. Oral bioavailability is poor; sublingual or buccal administration is required. Physiological risks parallel other NBOMes: vasoconstriction, tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, nausea, and anxiety. Severe toxicity including seizures, rhabdomyolysis, and cardiac events have been reported with related NBOMe compounds, particularly at high doses or when combined with stimulants. Due to microgram-range potency, volumetric dosing and allergy testing (start below 50 ug) are critical. Rapid tolerance develops after single use. Individuals with cardiovascular, hepatic, or psychiatric conditions should avoid this substance. This compound must be considered highly experimental with unpredictable dose-response characteristics.",

      "notes": "5-MAPDB is a dihydrobenzofuran entactogen first characterized by Monte et al. (1993) and pharmacologically profiled by Rickli et al. (2015). It acts as a relatively selective serotonin releaser (SERT IC50 ≈1.2 μM) with minimal dopamine transporter activity (DAT IC50 ≈77 μM), giving it a highly serotonergic profile more selective than MDMA. Human experience reports are limited and contradictory, with some users describing subdued, sedating effects and others reporting MDMA-like empathy and euphoria. Identity and potency in grey market samples are inconsistent—always reagent-test and start with an allergy dose. Acute risks resemble MDMA: hyperthermia, dehydration, hyponatraemia, bruxism, mydriasis, and transient hypertension/tachycardia. Due to measurable 5-HT2B receptor agonism, frequent use may theoretically increase risk of valvular heart disease; space sessions at least 4-6 weeks apart. Metabolized primarily by CYP2D6 and CYP1A2. No fatalities solely attributed to 5-MAPDB have been published as of 2025, but absence of evidence does not equal safety.",

Extremely narrow safety margin – milligram-scale errors have produced seizures, severe tachycardia, and fatalities. Always weigh with a 0.001 g (1 mg) readability scale and apply evenly to an inert herbal carrier; avoid 'eye-balling' liquid drops. Significant number of hospitalizations (Colorado 2013 outbreak, CDC) and several confirmed deaths have been attributed to ADB-PINACA or its isomers. Metabolized primarily via hepatic CYP3A4/2C9; inhibitors (ketoconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit) may prolong and intensify effects. Drug testing: parent rapidly drops below detection; metabolites detectable in urine for 24-48 hours, blood 6-12 hours. Legal status: Schedule I controlled substance in the US and controlled in most EU/UK jurisdictions. Harm-reduction: start <1 mg, wait at least 15 minutes between inhaled doses; have sober sitter; avoid driving for 8 hours.",

Expected to have sub-nanomolar CB1 affinity similar to related compounds (likely Ki < 1 nM), meaning single-milligram doses can cause severe intoxication, catatonia, or seizures. Fatalities and acute kidney injury have been documented with the parent compound and closely related isomers. Laboratory detection standards are limited; routine drug screens rarely detect this isomer, so users may test negative while impaired. Using a milligram scale (0.001 g readability) and thoroughly dissolving powder into carrier (PG/VG e-liquid or acetone for herb spraying) is essential for harm reduction. Always start with a single micro-dose puff and wait 10-15 minutes before re-dosing. Metabolized primarily via CYP3A4/2C9; inhibitors (ketoconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice) may prolong and intensify effects. Legal status: likely controlled under analog provisions in US and most EU/UK jurisdictions as a positional isomer of scheduled ADB-PINACA.",

Halogenated cathinones including 4-BMC possess neurotoxic and cytotoxic properties significantly higher than their methyl/chloro analogues. Acute adverse effects include tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, bruxism, and anxiety. No human pharmacokinetic studies exist; metabolism appears rapid via N-demethylation and β-ketoreduction followed by conjugation.

Pharmacodynamic data show similar affinity at norepinephrine and serotonin transporters but weaker dopamine transporter activity compared to mephedrone, resulting in mild empathogenic effects and potentially higher cardiovascular strain. Physical risks mirror other stimulants: tachycardia, vasoconstriction, hypertension, bruxism, dehydration, and potential hyperthermia in hot environments. Harm-reduction: weigh doses on a 0.001 g scale, allow at least 2 weeks between sessions, maintain hydration/electrolytes, and avoid stacking with other stimulants or serotonergic agents.",

Severe adverse events reported with other indazole carboxylate/carboxamide SCRAs include seizures, acute kidney injury and psychosis; similar risks should be presumed for AKB-57.\n4. AKB-57 contains an ester linkage (unlike the amide in AKB48), leading to rapid ester hydrolysis as the primary metabolic pathway. Metabolism is mainly hepatic (CYP3A4/CYP2D6); strong inhibitors (ketoconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit) may dramatically increase effect duration and toxicity.\n5.

      "notes": "• Pharmacology: In vitro data show 2-MMC acts as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agent with higher affinity for DAT and NET than SERT, producing more \"amphetaminic\" stimulation with comparatively modest entactogenic warmth compared to 3-MMC or mephedrone (Eshleman 2013; Brandt 2020). 2-Substituted cathinones are generally weaker than their 3- and 4-substituted counterparts.\n• Compared with positional isomers 3-MMC and 4-MMC, 2-MMC is regarded as less euphoric but more focused/functional. Oral dosing best preserves euphoria; insufflation is notably harsh (users report 8-8.5/10 pain scale) and shorter-lived.\n• Common acute adverse effects: tachycardia, vasoconstriction (cold extremities, erectile dysfunction), jaw clenching, anxiety at peaks, and strong urge to redose every 1-2 hours. The comedown is often reported as smoother than other cathinones.\n• High or repeated doses can provoke confusion, visual disturbances (nystagmus), difficulty urinating, and in rare cases brief psychotic reactions; stay hydrated, monitor body temperature, and limit session length.\n• Harm-reduction: Use a 0.001g scale; allow at least 2 hours before considering a booster. Avoid combining with other stimulants or MAO-inhibiting substances. Risk of serotonin syndrome exists with SSRIs or tramadol due to serotonergic activity. First identified in Sweden in 2014.",

Users report rapid tolerance formation (within 1-2 days), brief euphoria followed by pronounced compulsion to redose, severe insomnia, and an unpleasant crash. The compound is reportedly very caustic to nasal tissue when insufflated. Similar to α-PVP, users report auditory misperceptions and risk of psychotic features with extended use or sleep deprivation. Harm reduction: limit sessions to under 40 mg total, dose no more frequently than once every 2-4 weeks, monitor blood pressure and temperature, and keep benzodiazepines available for agitation (but avoid co-intoxication).",

Users report intense but short-lived stimulation similar to 4-CMC or cocaine, followed by a harsh comedown. Severe vasoconstriction, bruxism, tachycardia and thermoregulatory issues are common. Always use allergy testing (<5 mg), weigh doses accurately, monitor body temperature (keep below 38°C), hydrate with electrolytes, and avoid redosing cycles. No data exist on pregnancy safety, cancer risk, or long-term neurotoxicity.",

Effects are often described as a subdued, dreamy empathogen with light closed-eye visuals and a notable sedative body load. Nausea and mild vasoconstriction are common above 60 mg. Because it is largely serotonergic, combining with other serotonin-increasing drugs markedly raises the risk of serotonin syndrome. Users report a ceiling effect where doses above approximately 120 mg add side-effects rather than euphoria. Stay well-hydrated, avoid redosing within the same session, and allow at least two weeks between uses to mitigate tolerance and possible neurochemical depletion. Metabolic studies show 4-FPP inhibits various cytochrome P450 enzymes, which may contribute to its side-effect profile.",

User reports describe moderate stimulation with enhanced sociability and talkativeness at 20-40 mg insufflated, with rapid onset and 1-2 hour duration. A notable ceiling effect occurs where additional doses increase side effects more than benefits. The compound is often mislabeled or mixed with other substances in the market. Accurate dosing with a milligram scale is essential. Note: MPPP is also the name of a dangerous opioid analogue; verify substance identity before use.

Doses above 150 mg have produced severe confusion, blackouts, urinary tract irritation similar to ketamine cystitis, and hospitalizations. Multiple fatalities have been reported with this compound. Large crystals are caustic to nasal tissue; oral capsules are strongly preferred. Because of its extended half-life and metabolism, cognitive impairment and stimulation can persist 12-24 hours after dosing—avoid driving or safety-critical activities for at least 24 hours. Always use an accurate milligram scale; potency and purity between batches vary markedly. Street samples have been found to contain toxic impurities including zinc complexes.",

Users frequently report pronounced peripheral stimulation (increased heart rate and blood pressure) compared with MDMA, alongside moderate empathogenic warmth and mild visual enhancement. Severe vasoconstriction, bruxism, and nystagmus have been described at doses above 100 mg. Because reagent reactions overlap with 5-APDB and other APBs, professional analysis (FT-IR/GC-MS) is recommended. Start low, ensure cool environment, hydrate with electrolytes; avoid redosing within 8 hours to reduce neurotoxic and cardiotoxic risk.",

      "notes": "5-Cl-AMT (5-chloro-α-methyltryptamine; PAL-542) combines three properties with harm-reduction implications: it is a serotonin-dopamine releasing agent, a potent 5-HT2A agonist, and an in vitro MAO-A inhibitor. Treat it as an MAOI during the session window even though clinical reversibility is not established. Start with a microtest of 0.5-1 mg to gauge sensitivity; community trials report activity at 1-2 mg and full days' worth of effects from 8-12 mg. Because the come-up is slow and the duration long, redosing is usually unnecessary and can produce a late, heavy body load. Volumetric dosing is strongly advised so that sub-1 mg adjustments are possible; weigh at least 10-20 mg on a 0.001 g scale, dissolve to make 1 mg/mL or 0.5 mg/mL, and measure with an oral syringe. Plan a bland, low-tyramine diet the day of dosing and until baseline the next day (avoid aged cheeses, cured/fermented meats, soy ferments, Marmite, certain beers). Review medications and supplements for serotonergic or MAOI activity; conservative washout rules are prudent (at least 2 weeks after irreversible MAOIs; several days after SSRIs/SNRIs/linezolid/tramadol/DXM/5-HTP). Physiologically, expect mild pupil dilation, warmth, tremor or jaw tension at higher doses, and a gradual shift from entactogenic glow to more psychedelic headspace. Several field reports describe a delayed intensification late in the day; avoid stacking doses based on an early, gentle come-up. Keep the environment cool, hydrate with electrolytes, and avoid vigorous exercise or hot environments. If symptoms suggest serotonin toxicity (agitation, clonus, hyperthermia, severe headache, rapidly rising heart rate/BP), do not take more, cool down, and seek medical care; do not self-medicate with additional serotonergics. Drug-checking is important: 5-Cl-AMT has appeared in small niche markets and could be misrepresented; use multi-reagent testing and, where available, FT-IR/GC-MS. Because reports show long wakefulness and an afterglow that can flip to lethargy, protect sleep the following night and avoid consecutive-day use. Cross-tolerance with other serotonergic psychedelics is expected; spacing sessions by 10-14 days reduces tolerance and carries a margin for MAO-related interactions.",

Strong vasoconstriction is common and can cause painful leg cramping; avoid repeated use over short periods as vasoconstriction builds up while psychoactive effects diminish. Set and setting strongly influence the experience. Individuals with personal or family histories of psychotic disorders should avoid use. The psychedelic effects of LSA are inconsistent and primarily bodily and cognitive with less prominent visual effects compared to classical psychedelics like LSD.",

The substance is hygroscopic and degrades quickly when exposed to moisture or improper storage; it should be kept in an inert atmosphere in a freezer. The material can develop a sticky, goop-like consistency when exposed to air. Accurate weighing with a precise milligram scale is essential, as the substance is potent and can appear deceptively small. It is theorized to act as a prodrug for 4-HO-MiPT, though debate continues about whether it possesses innate activity. Set and setting are critical factors for the experience.",

      "notes": "25D-NBOMe is a highly potent research chemical with an extremely narrow margin between active and potentially lethal doses. The compound is not orally active and must be administered sublingually or via other mucosal routes. Insufflation is strongly discouraged as this route has been associated with numerous fatalities across the NBOMe series. Blotter paper doses are notoriously inconsistent due to hotspots of concentrated material. Use only with an analytical balance for weighing; never eyeball doses. Those with personal or family history of psychotic disorders, cardiovascular conditions, or seizure disorders should avoid this substance entirely. The compound produces dose-dependent vasoconstriction and cardiovascular strain, including cardiotoxicity through downregulation of PAK1 and hERG potassium channel inhibition. Set and setting are critical; always have a sober trip sitter present. Many deaths have occurred from individuals believing they consumed LSD when they actually ingested an NBOMe compound.",

Traditional brews vary widely in potency depending on plant sources, preparation methods, and regional practices. The purgative effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) are considered an integral part of the traditional experience and can be intense. Due to the MAOI component, numerous dangerous drug interactions exist, particularly with SSRIs, other antidepressants, stimulants, and certain foods when using irreversible MAOIs. Harmala alkaloids from Syrian rue or B. caapi are reversible MAOIs (RIMAs), posing less dietary restriction risk than pharmaceutical MAOIs, though caution is still advised. Set and setting are crucial, and the substance should ideally be used with an experienced facilitator. Individuals with personal or family history of psychotic disorders should avoid use.",

Datura causes severe anticholinergic syndrome, prolonged delirium lasting days, realistic and terrifying hallucinations, hyperthermia, seizures, and has resulted in numerous deaths and permanent injuries.

Datura causes severe anticholinergic syndrome, prolonged delirium lasting days, realistic and terrifying hallucinations, hyperthermia, seizures, and has resulted in numerous deaths and permanent injuries.

The naphthalene group may be toxic or carcinogenic with chronic use. Unlike cannabis, synthetic cannabinoids have been associated with multiple deaths and dangerous side effects. Individuals with personal or family history of psychotic disorders should avoid use, as prolonged usage may increase disposition to psychosis.

The sudden discontinuation after prolonged use can be dangerous or life-threatening and requires medical supervision with gradual tapering. Midazolam causes anterograde amnesia, meaning users will not remember events during peak effects. Paradoxical reactions including agitation, aggression, and hallucinations can occur. Never operate vehicles or machinery after use.",

Metizolam is illegal or controlled in many jurisdictions including Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.

It has largely been replaced by benzodiazepines for medical use due to its narrow therapeutic window and high addiction potential. The drug is currently used primarily in veterinary medicine for euthanasia and in some jurisdictions for physician-assisted suicide. Users should be aware that pentobarbital carries significantly higher risks of serious adverse effects when combined with other depressants compared to other sedative classes. Barbiturate overdose is a medical emergency requiring immediate hospitalization. Due to high protein binding and lipid solubility, treatments like forced diuresis and hemodialysis are largely ineffective. Individuals with liver or kidney impairment, cardiovascular disease, respiratory conditions, or porphyria should avoid pentobarbital entirely. Never use pentobarbital during pregnancy as it poses severe risks to fetal development.",

Barbiturate withdrawal requires medical supervision and often involves substitution with phenobarbital or long-acting benzodiazepines. Individuals with respiratory conditions, liver disease, porphyria, or history of substance abuse should not use this medication. Secobarbital drastically reduces the effectiveness of hormonal birth control and many other medications through enzyme induction. Daily doses exceeding 400 mg for 90 days or 600-800 mg for 35 days can produce physical dependence with potentially life-threatening withdrawal.",

The metabolite norpropoxyphene accumulates with repeated use and contributes to cardiotoxicity. Contraindicated in individuals with suicidal ideation, substance abuse history, or cardiac conditions. Should not be used during benzodiazepine withdrawal as it lowers the seizure threshold. Use a precise milligram scale for dosing if obtained, though this substance is rarely encountered today.",

The drug has a particularly high risk of serotonin syndrome compared to other opioids and should never be combined with MAOIs, SSRIs, or other serotonergic drugs. Intravenous administration carries extreme risks and should only be done in medical settings with naloxone and respiratory support immediately available.

Always use precise scales for measurement. Naloxone should be available in case of overdose. The drug is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and caution is required in renal impairment.

A laboratory-grade milligram scale is absolutely essential as sub-milligram differences can mean the difference between an active dose and fatal overdose. Respiratory depression is reportedly more severe than with traditional opioids at equivalent doses. U-47700 is now illegal in most jurisdictions worldwide following numerous overdose deaths. The substance should never be vaporized as it severely damages lung tissue, and nasal administration requires diligent saline rinses to prevent permanent nasal damage.",

Insufflation is strongly discouraged as the substance has low water solubility, is extremely caustic to nasal tissues, and has poor absorption leading to delayed onset that increases overdose risk. Users must use precise milligram scales due to the extremely low active doses.

Unlike typical methylphenidate analogs, it displays notable serotonin reuptake inhibition, giving it subjective effects more similar to cocaine or amphetamine. Use precise weighing equipment and start with low doses. Some users report nasal irritation and throat discomfort when insufflated. The naphthalene structure has raised theoretical toxicity concerns, though metabolic pathways likely produce readily excreted acid metabolites. Exercise extreme caution and employ comprehensive harm reduction practices.",

Individuals with cardiovascular conditions, personal or family histories of psychotic disorders, or those taking psychiatric medications (especially lithium or MAOIs) should avoid use. Prolonged residual stimulation can make sleep difficult; plan accordingly. Oily meals may delay onset significantly (up to 2 hours). Adequate hydration is essential, but avoid overdrinking.

Due to structural similarity to cocaine, it may carry similar cardiovascular risks including potential for sudden cardiac death at high doses and long-term cardiomyopathy. Regular insufflation can severely damage nasal tissue, causing loss of smell, nosebleeds, and chronic nasal problems. The substance is notably harsh on nasal passages and has a longer, more difficult comedown than cocaine. Always use precise milligram scales, as dosages are in the low milligram range. Start with threshold doses due to individual variation and limited safety data.",

Propylhexedrine produces more pronounced peripheral effects (vasoconstriction, cardiovascular strain) compared to amphetamines due to reduced blood-brain barrier permeability. Use extreme caution with dosing and avoid use if you have cardiovascular conditions or personal/family history of psychotic disorders. Always use harm reduction practices including accurate weighing, avoiding combinations with other stimulants, staying hydrated, and monitoring vital signs.",

Even moderate doses can result in life-threatening side effects including seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, extreme hyperthermia, and death. The substance has minimal euphoric effects and is not recreationally desirable. ALWAYS test pills with reagent kits (Marquis, Mecke, Mandelin) before consumption. If PMMA is suspected or confirmed, the substance should be completely avoided. Seek immediate medical attention if symptoms of severe hyperthermia, rapid heartbeat, difficulty breathing, or seizures occur. This substance is Schedule I in the United States as of July 2021.",

Use precise measurement scales for dosing, and consider supplementing with a choline source to enhance effects and reduce the likelihood of headaches. Long-term safety data in healthy individuals is limited.",
