**2,5-Dimethoxy-4-ethylfluorothiophenethylamine** (also known as **2C-T-21** , or colloquially as **Aurora** ) is a [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) chemical class that produces [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Administered) . It is a member of the [2C-x family](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x_family) of psychedelic phenethylamines, all of which were derived from the systematic modification of the [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) molecule.

2C-T-21 was first synthesized by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) and documented in his book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) ("Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved"). The dosage range is listed as 8–12 mg. It is described in various reports as being generally relaxed and clear-headed with mild visual effects. In *Thanatos To Eros, 35 Years of Psychedelic Exploration* , Myron Stolaroff describes it as "not psychedelic, but a wonderful energizer", along with displaying a notable lack of [appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression) typically observed with members of its class. However he also mentions concerns regarding toxicity.

In March 2004, a 22-year-old American male died after ingesting an unknown amount of 2C-T-21. This death became part of a two-year DEA investigation called "Operation Web Tryp" which ended with the arrests of 10 persons involved in the online distribution of [research chemicals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemicals) . 2C-T-21 remains unscheduled in the United States.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 2C-T-21, although a paper by Daniel Trachsel hypothesizes that one of its metabolites is the poison [fluoroacetate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoroacetate) . It has little history of human usage. It is strongly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

2C-T-21, or 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylfluorothiophenethylamine, is a [substituted phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_phenethylamine) featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain. 2C-T-21 contain methoxy functional groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 of the benzene ring as well as an ethylfluoro thioether group attached to carbon R 4 of the phenyl ring.

2C-T-21 belongs to the 2C family of phenethylamines, all of which contain methoxy groups on the 2 and 5 positions of the benzene ring.

## Pharmacology

2C-T-21's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

This compound, being similar in structure to [2C-T-2](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-2) and [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) is also believed to potentially have [MAOI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) properties.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, 2C-T-21 is generally considered to be energetic and stimulating in a fashion is comparable to that of other [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) such as [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) and [2C-P](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-P) . However, at certain doses and contexts, it may produce periods of notable [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) .
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of 2C-T-21 is intense, but in comparison to [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , it can be considered mild though is still capable of becoming very powerful and highly physically euphoric. The sensation itself can be described as intense and will manifest itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves.

### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

## Toxicity and harm potential

On March 9, 2004, a 22-year-old American male consumed an unknown dose of 2C-T-21 by sticking his tongue into a vial of powder he had purchased online. He developed a temperature of 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius), had a tonic-clonic seizure, and slipped into a coma before dying four days later. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] These symptoms are consistent with those seen in fluoroacetate poisoning, for which there is no known effective antidote.

Fluoroacetate is hypothesized to be a metabolite of 2C-T-21. Sub-lethal doses of fluoroacetate take up to four days to clear from the body. As such, it is likely dangerous to take 2C-T-21 multiple days in a row as this poisonous metabolite will accumulate. Furthermore, sub-lethal doses may cause damage to tissue with high energy needs (e.g. the brain, gonads, heart, lungs, and fetus). This may account for the experience of a couple who became "convinced that it is toxic" in Stolaroff's book.

There is no anecdotal evidence to suggest that a single, moderate dose of 2C-T-21 can cause negative health effects, although nothing can be guaranteed.

It is strongly discouraged to administer 2C-T-21 non-orally because this may cause vomiting, numerous negative side effects, or death at high doses.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) , such as [volumetric dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_dosing) , when using this substance to ensure the accurate administration of the intended dose.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

2C-T-21 is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 2C-T-21 is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 2C-T-21 presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 2C-T-21 all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

If 2C-T-21 does have [MAOI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) effects as commonly speculated, this could indicate that 2C-T-21 is more likely to induce [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) or general [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) overload (especially at high dosages) than other [serotonergic psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelic) . This may make it dangerous to combine it with other [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) , [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) and certain substances which releases neurotransmitters such as [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) or [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) . These substances include but are not limited to:

## Legal status

- **Austria** : 2C-T-21 is illegal to possess, produce and sell under the NPSG (Neue-Psychoaktive-Substanzen-Gesetz Österreich). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Canada** : As of October 31st, 2016; 2C-T-21 is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada.
- **Germany** : 2C-T-21 is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of November 26, 2016. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person, placing it on the market and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not punishable. The legislator considers it possible that orders of 2C-T-21 are punishable as an incitement to place it on the market.
- **Switzerland** : 2C-T-21 can be considered a controlled substance as a defined derivative of Phenethylamine under Verzeichnis E point 130. It is legal when used for scientific or industrial use.
- **United Kingdom** : 2C-T-21 is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom as a result of the phenethylamine catch-all clause.
- **United States** : 2C-T-21 is technically not scheduled in the United States, but could be considered an analogue of 2C-T or 2C-T-7 and may therefore be considered a Schedule I drug under the Federal Analogue Act. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
