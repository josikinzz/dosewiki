**4-Hydroxy-N,N-diethyltryptamine** (also known as **4-HO-DET** , **CZ-74** , and **Ethocin** ) is a lesser-known synthetic [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) chemical class that produces [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) -like [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects when [adminstered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . 4-HO-DET is a close structural and functional analog of [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) (4-HO-DMT), the principal psychoactive component in [magic mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Magic_mushrooms) . It is notable for sharing many of its core features while retaining subtle variations in its duration, visual, cognitive and bodily effects.

This compound was first discovered in the late 1950s by [Albert Hofmann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Hofmann) and Franz Troxler in their investigation of various [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) compounds that were structurally and chemically related to the principle active components he isolated from [magic mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Magic_mushrooms) , [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) ( **4-PO-DMT** ) and [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) ( **4-HO-DMT** ). The substance was used together with its phosphoryloxy-analog [4-PO-DET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-PO-DET) in human clinical trials in the 1960s by the German researchers Hanscarl Leuner and G. Baer.

Since its inception, 4-HO-DET has remained relatively uncommon and has very little documentation of human usage, with the majority of [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) users preferring more traditional [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) like the [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) and [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) in [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) , or more recently, [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) . Today, it is either used as a recreational substance or an [entheogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogen) , has no documentation of being sold on the streets and is primarily acquired through the use of online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) vendors.

## Chemistry

4-HO-DET, or 4-hydroxy-N,N-diethyltryptamine, is a synthetic indole alkaloid molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) chemical class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicyclic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. 4-HO-DET is substituted at R 4 of its indole heterocycle with a hydroxyl functional group OH−. It also contains two ethyl chains bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone ( [DET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DET) ).

4-HO-DET is the lower homolog of [4-AcO-DET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DET) , the N-substituted diethyl homolog of [4-HO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DMT) ( **psilocin** ) and the 4-hydroxy analog of [DET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DET) .

## Pharmacology

As with its structurally related tryptamines, 4-HO-DET principally acts as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) , through which it exerts its psychedelic effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain an object of scientific elucidation.

## Subjective effects

In comparison to other isolated synthetic [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) compounds such as [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) and [4-HO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DMT) , 4-HO-DET has been reported as being similar in terms of its visual, cognitive and physical effects, albeit with a slightly longer duration, less in the way of bodily effects, and more "synthetic" or "algorithmic"-style visuals.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) and [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) than [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, mostly synthetic in style, unstructured in organization, dimly lit and monotone in scheme, glossy in shading, sharp in edges, large in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, equally rounded and angular in corners, non-immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity. They have a notably "synthetic" feel to them and at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) visual geometry over [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 4-HO-DET use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 4-HO-DET is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people within the psychonaut community who have tried 4-HO-DET suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

4-HO-DET is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 4-HO-DET is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 4-HO-DET presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 4-HO-DET all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 4-HO-DET. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Legal status
