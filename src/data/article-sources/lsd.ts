LSD or Lysergic acid diethylamide is a semisynthetic drug of the lysergamide psychedelic family. It was first synthesized by Albert Hoffmann in 1938 from ergotamine which is a chemical derived from ergot, a grain fungus that typically grows on rye. In pure form it is a colourless, odourless, and mildly bitter solid.

LSD is typically delivered orally, usually in liquid form or on a substrate such as absorbent blotter paper which can be taken by simply chewing on it or swallowing.

It is one of the most potent drugs in the world, meaning that extremely small amounts are needed for the effects to show. A single dose of LSD may be between 100 and 500 micrograms - an amount which is roughly equal to one-tenth the mass of a grain of sand.

The mechanism that produces the psychedelic effects of LSD is a direct result from its action as a 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonist in the brain, a mechanism of action shared by all other hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines.

The LSD experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of LSD can be broken down into five components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - The body high of LSD can be described as proportionally very intense in comparison to its accompanying visual and cognitive effects. It behaves as a euphoric, fast moving, sharp and location specific tingling sensation. For some it is manifested spontaneously at different unpredictable points throughout the trip, but for most it maintains a steady presence that rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. At moderate to high doses of LSD, this sensation will usually hit its highest level and become so overwhelming that people find themselves writhing on the floor in complete pleasure.
- **Stimulation** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, LSD is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating without being forced. For example, when taken in any environment it will usually encourage physical activities such as running, walking, climbing or dancing. In comparison, other more commonly used psychedelics such as psilocin are generally sedating and relaxed.
- **Nausea** - Mild nausea is occasionally reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes instantly once the tripper has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **Increased bodily control**
- **Enhancement of touch** - Feelings of enhanced tactile sensation are consistently present at moderate levels throughout most LSD trips. Once Level 7A visuals are reached, an intense sensation of suddenly becoming aware of and being able to feel every single nerve ending across a person’s entire body all at once is consistently present.

**Cognitive Effects:**

The cognitive effects of LSD can be broken down into ten components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. In comparison to other psychedelics such as Psilocin, LSA and Ayahuasca, LSD is significantly more stimulating and fast paced in terms of the specific style of thought stream which it produces and contains a large number of potential effects.

The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include:

- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Time distortion**
- **Introspection**
- **Deja-Vu**
- **Multiple thought streams**
- **Removal of cultural filter**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**
- **Personality regression**
- **Thought loops**
- **Feelings of interdependent opposites**
- **Delusions**
- **States of unity and interconnectedness**

**Visual Effects:**

*Enhancements*

LSD presents a full and complete array of visual enhancements which generally include:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, the effects experienced are detailed below:

- **Visual drifting** (*Melting, Breathing, Morphing and Flowing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed yet cartoon in its appearance. The distortions are slow and smooth in motion and fleeting in their appearance.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition**
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of 2C-B and the 2C-x family as a whole than psilocin, LSA, or DMT. They can be comprehensively described as unstructured in their organization, algorithmic and digital in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, multicoloured in scheme, bright and flat in colour, and sharp in their edges with extremely angular corners. At higher dosages they consistently result in states of Level 7A visual geometry.

*Hallucinatory States*

LSD is capable of producing a full range of low and high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is significantly less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelic. These effects include:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - Although LSD is technically capable of producing of hallucinatory states in a fashion that is on par with psilocin or DMT in its vividness and intensity, in comparison, these effects are extremely rare and inconsistent. Whilst traditional psychedelics such as LSA, Ayahuasca and Mescaline will induce internal hallucinations near consistently at level 5 geometry and above, LSD will for most simply go straight into Level 7A visual geometry. This lack of consistently induced hallucinatory breakthroughs means that for most, LSD is simply not as deep of an experience as certain other psychedelics.

**Auditory Effects:**

The auditory effects of LSD are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- **Enhancements**
- **Distortions**
- **Hallucinations**

**Health Effects, Potential Addiction, and Tolerance:**

Similar to other psychedelic drugs, there are relatively few physical side effects associated with LSD acute exposure. Various studies have shown that in reasonable doses in a careful context, it presents no negative cognitive, psychiatric, or toxic physical consequences of any sort. The median lethal dose or dosage at which 50% of participants die (LD50) of LSD for human beings has never been reached in any setting and is predicted to be roughly 12,000 micrograms, based on studies involving rats whereas the active dosage is between 100 and 500 micrograms. This means that assuming a person has unusually potent tabs, each of which are 200 micrograms in strength each, they would have to consume at least 60 of them to reach a potentially lethal dosage. Keep in mind that your average tab of LSD found on the street is 100 micrograms or less in strength and anything stronger than this is particularly rare.

It’s important to note that LSD is non habit-forming and that the desire to use it can actually decrease with use, it is most often self-regulating. You also build an almost immediate tolerance to LSD after ingestion, preventing you from experiencing its full effects more often than every 4-7 days (unless you increase your dose significantly). 

**Legal Issues:**

- LSD is Schedule I in the United States according to the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.[112] This means LSD is illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, process, or distribute without a DEA license.
- In Canada, LSD is a controlled substance under Schedule III of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. Any person who is found in possession of LSD is entitled to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years. Possession for purpose of trafficking is an indictable offense punishable by imprisonment for 10 years.
- In the United Kingdom, LSD is a class ‘A’ drug. This means possession of the drug without a license is punishable with 7 years imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine, and trafficking is punishable with life imprisonment and an unlimited fine.

The United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances (adopted in 1971) requires its parties to prohibit LSD. Hence, it is illegal in all parties to the convention, which include the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and most of Europe. However, enforcement of extant laws varies from country to country. Medical and scientific research with LSD in humans is permitted under the 1971 UN Convention.

If you want to try LSD you will have to find it through a street dealer or order it online through many various vendors which I can not legally ever mention the name of.

**Conclusion:**

LSD was the first psychedelic I ever tried and the first psychedelic I ever fully explored. It has benefited me and the people around me in so many personal ways through its deep states of introspection. It is amazingly therapeutic but eventually loses its novelty due to its complete lack of hallucinatory states and consistent unchanging visuals in a way that other psychedelics such as mushrooms simply do not.

LSD is a psychedelic that eventually loses its magic, becoming something which can be better enjoyed as an enhancer of recreational activities. Thanks to its long lasting, stimulating and euphoric nature, it is probably the best psychedelic for this purpose.

### INTENSITY

3 to 7 for most experiences.

### MATERIAL

LSD is a synthetic compound. It is
derived from Iysergic acid which is found in Hawaiian Woodrose and Morning
Glory seeds, or Ergot fungus, which can grow on rye, wheat, and other grams.
Lysergic acid is also psychoactive, although not nearly as potent as LSD,
and has been consumed for millennia in the form of the above mentioned
plant sources. The most common street name for LSD is "acid."
### HISTORY

LSD was first synthesized in 1938
by Dr. Albert Hofmann of Sandoz Pharmaceutical Company in Switzerland.
Hofmann was also the first human to experience LSD when he inadvertently
absorbed some through his fingertips in 1943. Three days later he took
the first intentional dose of LSD.
During the next 20 years LSD was promoted
as a psychiatric aid and numerous experiments were performed in clinical
settings. The CIA and other covert agencies were likewise experimenting
with LSD to determine its effectiveness in brainwashing and mind control.
In the early Sixties Timothy Leary
and friends began spreading the word that LSD produces magnificent spiritual
experiences. The revolution that sprang from this is legendary. It has
had a major impact on western culture, its music and art, and has contributed
to the expanded acceptance of different philosophies, religions, and lifestyles
in our country, as well as to the development of a high tech information
society [1].
### DOSAGE

LSD is extremely potent by weight
and the amount required for a single dose is barely visible to the naked
eye. LSD is usually sold on blotter paper, in tablets, or in liquid. With
all of these forms it is impossible to tell the amount of LSD one is actually
consuming. Frequently people will say that each dose contains 100 mcg.,
200 mcg., etc. But unless they've worked with the solid crystalline substance
to produce the consumable form, their information is just hearsay or a
personal estimate. Even after many years and several hundred doses of LSD,
I have never had an accurate gauge to measure dosage. My description of
dosage levels is an estimate from what I've been told over the years, matched
up to levels of intensity described by users of Sandoz LSD which was packaged
in certified amounts.
100 mcg. of LSD is considered a minimum
psychedelic dose. (one microgram (mcg.) = one millionth of a gram.) This
amount should produce a low-level psychedelic experience, not overwhelming,
and without hallucinations. 200 mcg. is the minimum dose required to produce
a full psychedelic experience, complete with visuals and hallucinations,
although it will take most people more than 200 mcg. to experience these
full effects. The average dose of acid on the streets these days is in
the 50 to 100 mcg. range.
The amount of LSD required to break
into a full-on psychedelic state varies with each individual, and even
each experience. As one gains familiarity with the experience it is likely
that they will require a larger dose to achieve a "transformational state."
I typically take about 500 mcg. and estimate my larger doses to be in the
1000+ mcg. range, and I've heard of people taking much more than that.
Other factors such as the amount of food in one's stomach will affect the
intensity of LSD and most other psychedelics, dosing on an empty stomach
producing the stronger experience. Like most other psychedelics, LSD produces
a tolerance lasting two or three days. Consuming an equivalent amount during
this period will not get one as high the second time.
Larger doses make it more likely that
one will have a full blown trip, but sometimes the intensity can be too
much and feel like neural overload. (By the end of many high-dose acid
trips I've wished I could turn down the intensity level of my senses.)
The next section explains more about the range of LSD experiences.
### THE HIGH

Ecstatic feelings of love and happiness,
affinity for other people, feeling of being at home with one's self and
the universe, flowing visions with more intricacy, beauty, and color than
anything found in nature, sound which one can taste and feel with heart
and soul, a sense of suspension in time and feeling akin with eternity
and infinity, a brilliantly lucid mind able to see itself from vast and
novel perspectives, an overwhelming tide of emotions... These are the feelings
that are common with LSD and most other psychedelics. One should also be
prepared for the negative side: confusion, frightful visions and images,
fear of dying or losing control, feeling controlled by and unable to escape
from the definitions one has grown accustomed to, or being overwhelmed
by the immensity of life.
The possible experiences on psychedelics
are endless, and no two are ever the same. In the definitions I give for
"THE HIGH" of each substance, I will try to describe the attributes
that are frequently felt and distinguish the experiences produced by the
different psychedelics.
LSD is the most transparent of the
psychedelics. It has the least "signature" to it. Most users report that
their first few trips are like a ride through the funhouse. Everything
seems bizarre and completely unlike normal reality. After becoming familiar
with the experience some people drop acid to perform complex computer programming,
perform live music on stage, or do other tasks that require control and
a strong connection with the physical plane. Frequent users may be able
to blink their eyes, snap out of the high, and see things as they do in
regular consciousness while on the peak of a 500 mcg. trip.
LSD's transparency makes it possible
to have almost any type of experience. Users may guide themselves toward
a particular flavor of experience using either internal focus, like meditation,
or external stimulus like music or art. LSD's intensity is also quite variable.
A 200 mcg. trip may feel more intense than a 500 mcg. trip from the same
batch, and intensity can fade in and out during a session. Generally one
will feel "higher" if taking the same amount of LSD, or any other psychedelic,
in an unfamiliar environment. One aspect of dosage that seems consistent
is the length of the trip. 100 mcg. Iasts me 5 to 6 hours, 200 mcg. - 8
to 10 hours, large doses have lasted up to 20 hours.
LSD has the ability of allowing one's
mind to penetrate things very deeply. I find this most prevalent listening
to music, looking at artwork, or making love. With LSD one can "lock on"
to something like a piece of music and allow it to guide them on a sensual
journey through a garden of liquid sound. One can lavish a feeling, thought
pattern, or emotion with similar intensity. It's also possible to latch
on to negative feelings. If one finds themself on a downward spiral they
can usually redirect their awareness to something else with little effort.
Most people tend to spend the majority of their experience in a positive
groove, because once in it they can remain there effortlessly for hours.
The negative aspects of LSD's signature that many users report are a "
metallic edge " (a slight grating on the nerves), and sometimes an overbearing
intensity that some psychedelics, such as mushrooms, tend not to produce.
To get an idea of how diverse LSD experiences
can be, (or psychedelic experiences in general) I've listed several publications
in the bibliography that contain lucid descriptions of powerful experiences.
One such description that I've included here is the first LSD experience
of Stanislav Grof. Stan Grof became one of the premier psychiatric LSD
researchers during the early Sixties. His current non-drug therapy, known
as Holotropic Breathwork, has produced powerful "transpersonal" experiences
in many people. Following is Grof's description of his first LSD experience
in 1956 [2].
"I couldn't believe how much I learned
about my psyche in those few hours. I experienced a fantastic display of
colorful visions, some abstract and geometrical, others figurative and
filled with symbolic import. The sheer intensity of the array of emotions
I felt simply amazed me. I was hit by a radiance that seemed comparable
to the epicenter of a nuclear explosion, or perhaps the light of supernatural
brilliance said in oriental scriptures to appear to us at the moment of
death. This thunderbolt catapulted me out of my body. First I lost my awareness
of my immediate surroundings, then the psychiatric clinic, then Prague
(Czechoslovakia), and finally the planet. At an inconceivable speed my
consciousness expanded to cosmic dimensions. I experienced the Big Bang,
passed through black holes and white holes in the universe, identified
with exploding supernovas, and witnessed many other strange phenomena that
seemed to be pulsars, quasars, and other cosmic events."
During his LSD session Grof instantaneously
grasped that the experience he was having resembled those described in
the great mystical scriptures of the world. "I was able to see the irony
and paradox of the situation. The divine manifested itself and took me
over in a modern scientific laboratory in the middle of a scientific experiment
conducted in a communist country with a substance produced in the test
tube of a 20th-century chemist."
Occasionally with large doses of LSD,
and less frequently with other psychedelics, one will encounter what is
known as the "Clear Light" or "White Light." This is perceived as a supernaturally
brilliant and blazing pure light which radiates from within. The feeling
which accompanies being in the presence of the Clear Light is almost always
described as divine bliss. The experience of the Clear Light can only be
attained by going through a full ego death. This process is described in
detail in the book The Psychedelic Experience.
### COMBINATIONS

HARMALA ALKALOIDS - Harmala
will add a unique dimension to an acid experience. I find that it infuses
the trip with a mystical and ancient quality. While on acid I normally
feel like I'm interfacing with my own mind, but with Harmala it feels like
I'm in contact with the invisible world of Spirits. An even greater degree
of synergism exists between Harmala and the tryptamine psychedelics, psilocybin
and DMT.
DMT - I've had some powerfully
enlightening experiences smoking N,N-DMT while on acid. The DMT
experience overwhelms the acid experience during its short duration. I
usually find myself immersed in the flowing, intricate visuals which are
characteristic of DMT. The acid essentially puts me on a higher platform
for launching into the DMT. And the "open mind" state produced by the acid
allows me to experience the DMT that much more. See the chapter on DMT.
NITROUS OXIDE - A blast of nitrous
usually puts me in a pleasurable, altered state of mind, this is amplified
if I'm already high. A single breath of nitrous, as is generally consumed
for recreational use, will produce a one to two minute "disassociative"
state, during which I feel somewhat out of my body. I have found that nitrous
works well with every psychedelic I've tried it with. It can put an additional
peak in my peak, or it can be used to "break up" a state of mind so I can
switch my focus to something else.
LUDIOMIL - I got inspiration
to try LSD with Ludiomil (an anti-depressant) after reading an article
in Psychedelic Monographs and Essays where the experimenter reported
having lucid dreams after using this combination. This perked my interest
as I've been a practitioner of lucid dreaming for the past few years.
The experience was quite enjoyable
and exceeded my expectations. During the experience I found that Ludiomil
nearly doubled the strength of the acid, while slightly altering the experience.
I felt as though there was a thin invisible membrane between myself and
anything my senses touched upon. This felt novel but did not allow me to
feel completely "merged with the experience" as is common while on acid.
My thought flow also seemed a bit different including what felt like "bleed
through" from the dream state.
I didn't experience anything unusual
during my sleep the first night. But on the next night I had some 25 to
30 highly vivid dreams. I continued having these vivid dreams, in decreasing
numbers, for the next three or four nights. One point to note here is that
the dreams I experienced, although quite vivid, did not fit the definition
of Lucid Dreams as defined by Stephen LaBerge or others in the Lucid
Dreaming field. LaBerge uses Lucid Dream to mean a dream in which you are
aware that you are dreaming, frequently have access to the memories of
your normal waking consciousness, and may be able to manipulate the events
in your dream.

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as lysergic acids and derivatives. These are alkaloids with a structure based on the lysergic acid skeleton.

### Background

Debate continues over the nature and causes of chronic flashbacks. Explanations in terms of LSD physically remaining in the body for months or years after consumption have been discounted by experimental evidence. Some say HPPD is a manifestation of post-traumatic stress disorder, not related to the direct action of LSD on brain chemistry, and varies according to the susceptibility of the individual to the disorder. Many emotionally intense experiences can lead to flashbacks when a person is reminded acutely of the original experience. However, not all published case reports of chronic flashbacks appear to describe an anxious hyper-vigilant state reminiscent of post-traumatic stress disorder.

### Mechanism of Action

5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A
Inhibitor

### Absorption

Rapidly absorbed.

### General Function

A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of fatty acids, steroids and retinoids (PubMed:18698000, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997, PubMed:21289075, PubMed:21576599). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:18698000, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997, PubMed:21289075, PubMed:21576599). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997). Metabolizes endocannabinoid arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide) to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid ethanolamide (20-HETE-EA) and 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid ethanolamides (EpETrE-EAs), potentially modulating endocannabinoid system signaling (PubMed:18698000, PubMed:21289075). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Metabolizes cholesterol toward 25-hydroxycholesterol, a physiological regulator of cellular cholesterol homeostasis (PubMed:21576599). Catalyzes the oxidative transformations of all-trans retinol to all-trans retinal, a precursor for the active form all-trans-retinoic acid (PubMed:10681376). Also involved in the oxidative metabolism of drugs such as antiarrhythmics, adrenoceptor antagonists, and tricyclic antidepressants

## Subjective Experience

Famously discovered by Albert Hoffman in 1938, the recreational use of LSD
exploded in the 1960’s. It was central to the counterculture revolution, having a
profound influence which spanned far beyond art and music, and eventually touched
most facets of society.

Its value in the fields of psychiatry and psychology as an agent to alleviate human
misery was quickly established. Countless studies emerged as research flourished,
particularly across the United States.

This all came to an abrupt end, courtesy of Richard Milhous Nixon and the war on
drugs. Indeed, LSD was made an initial and prime target. Research was
unceremoniously halted, thousands were imprisoned and psychedelic study and
exploration was driven underground.

My own experience with LSD unfolded during the folly of youth. I managed to
acquire two blotters, and consumed one of them on a clear warm Sunday afternoon. I
remained indoors waiting for something to happen.

After an indeterminate period of time I deemed that the blotter must have been a
dud, and I swallowed the second. Within perhaps ten minutes a trip started to
materialise. My immediate reaction was to panic: what if this was the first blotter
taking effect?

Fortunately, after being informed that I was an idiot, I was reassured by my less than
impressed sitter, and I calmed down considerably.

My recollections are somewhat vague, but a fascination with various shapes, patterns
and materials was memorable. I also recall that there was some horn present at one
point. More radical was my experience when I was eventually taken on an evening
walk.

The perspective was something akin to the dollhouse effect, in which the exterior
appeared to be so tranquil that I perceived it as part of a giant interior. I noticed
chimneys, telegraph poles, and items not normally on my conscious visible radar.
The sky appeared as a ceiling, almost touchable, and was totally non-threatening.

I felt no nausea or negativity at all. It was a pleasant experience, albeit a gentle one.

This was my first foray into the realms of psychedelia and it would leave a long term
impression, although not as a result of any form of trauma or extreme stimulation. It
was profound: the temporary shift in perception was to have a permanent and
positive influence on my worldview.

Now, many years later, I can align elements of this trip with more recent
experimentation with 1p-LSD and other lysergamides. That intimate relationship
with the outdoors and nature, the wonderment of the visuals, the delicate excitation
of the other senses, the aura of the headspace: all ebb and flow to differing degrees
between each experience.

As LSD is almost indistinguishable from 1p-LSD, I have attempted to more fully
document the trip experience itself within the entry for the latter. Needless to say, I
hope to have many more encounters in the future.

[Shulgin Reference: TiHKAL #26, p490]

\`\`\`
“I believe it’s true to say that everyone who has experienced LSD or
another psychedelic would look on that experience, especially the first
one, as a major life-changing event.” ~ Ralph Metzner
\`\`\`

BLOTTER ART
LSD tabs are usually decorated by what has become known as blotter art. This can
sometimes be extremely complex in nature, and indeed, entire collections exist,
which have even been exhibited in galleries and museums.

The above sheet, which consists of 1200 individual blotters, was produced for
promotional purposes in 2019. It presents the front cover of the second edition of
this book, but alas, doesn’t contain any LSD.

DESCRIPTION #
 
[LSD Images](https://erowid.org/lsd_images.shtml)
 
LSD is one of the most commonly used 'psychedelic' or 'hallucinogenic' substances. It comes in a variety of forms, but is virtually always taken orally. Today, LSD is most commonly found in the form of small squares of paper called 'blotter' (full sheets of paper are decorated with [artwork or designs](https://erowid.org/lsd_images_gallery1.shtml) , perforated, then soaked in liquid LSD solution and dried). Other forms include pills, gelatin sheets or shapes (pyramids, cubes, etc), liquid, liquid sugar cubes, and powder. Blotter is most common because it is easily produced, easily concealable and the format allows for few adulterant chemicals. 
 
[ [Main LSD Vault](https://erowid.org/lsd.shtml) ]
 
[Dose](https://erowid.org/lsd_dose.shtml) #
 
A standard dose of LSD since the mid-1980s has been between 50 - 150 ug (micrograms). A single hit of most blotter paper contains somewhere in this range, though this varies depending on the source and there is no way for the average user to determine the strength of a piece of blotter other than by word of mouth. In the 1960s and 1970s, when LSD came primarily in pill form, the average single dosage unit was somewhat higher than it is with today's blotter, more often in the 200-400 ug range. A drop of liquid can contain a huge amount of LSD but is generally made so that one drop is a single medium dose.
 
Price #
 
Sold by the single hit of blotter, LSD sells for \$3 to \$10 per hit, though it sometimes ranges as high as \$25 depending on where you purchase it. Captive markets such as raves generally produce high prices while friend to friend it is often sold at cheaper prices. Less common forms of LSD sell for somewhat higher prices (\$8-10 for a single hit), and as with most substances, the price goes down if you buy in bulk. Sheets of 100 hits (blotter) generally range from \$1-\$2 per hit. One of the more novel things about the illicit LSD market is that within the LSD using community, it is somewhat common to give single doses away to friends and acquaintances at extremely cheap prices, if not free.
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/lsd_law.shtml) #
 
LSD is illegal in the United States (Schedule I) and in most other countries. It is also listed as Schedule I in the International Convention on Psychotropic Substances, an international drug control treaty.
 
[Chemistry](https://erowid.org/lsd_chemistry.shtml) #
 
d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a synthetic chemical derived from ergot alkaloids which are produced by the [ergot fungus](https://erowid.org/plants/ergot/ergot.shtml) which grows on rye.
 
Pharmacology #
 
Pharmacology Summary Needed.
 
Production #
 
LSD requires an experienced organic chemist to produce. All useful synthesis methods begin with Lysergic Acid which is schudule III. It is produced in crystal form, primarily by a small number of knowledgeable chemists in fully equipped laboratories. The DEA speculates that it is produced mainly in the United States and Canada.
 
[History](https://erowid.org/lsd_timeline.php) #
 
LSD was first synthesized in 1938 and discovered to be psychoactive in 1943. It became popular in the '60's and was made illegal to possess in 1968. It has been widely available on the black market since that time.
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
The Substance:
 
LSD (Lyserg-Saeure-Diethylamid in German); Acid; Cid; L; Blotter (on paper); Tabs (on paper); LAD; Doses; Trips; Microdots (small tablets).
 
The Experience:
 
Tripping; Flying; Frying.
 
[EFFECTS](https://erowid.org/lsd_effects.shtml) #
 
In the beginning stages of onset, LSD is likely to cause a sort of undefineably feeling similar to anticipation or anxiety. There is often a slight feeling of energy in the body, an extra twinkle to lights, or the feeling that things are somehow different than usual. As the effects become stronger, a wide variety of perceptual changes may occur; non-specific mental and physical stimulation, pupil dilation, closed and open eye patterning and visuals, changed thought patterns, feelings of insight, confusion, or paranoia, and quickly changing emotions (happiness, fear, giddiness, anxiety, anger, joy, irritation).
 
Onset #
 
Depending on how much and how recently one has eaten food, LSD generally takes 20 - 60 minutes (though sometimes as long as 2 hrs) to take effect.
 
Duration #
 
LSD's total duration is normally considered to be around 12 hours from time of oral ingestion to end of the primary effects. The strong peak/plateu effects last around 6-10 hours. The complete range of effects last between 8 and 48 hours, depending on dose, with doses under 40 micrograms lasting much shorter than doses over 500 micrograms (very heavy). Most people report the primary effects last until 6-10 hours after taking between 50 and 500ug and most feel unusual, with difficulty sleeping, until 10-18 hours after first ingestion or until they have had a full night's rest and a meal. It is unusual, but well documented in scientific and experiential literature, for a small number of people to trip for 16-24 hours after a single dose of LSD, usually if they have an unusually powerful experience or took a heavy dose.
 
Visual Effects #
 
Visuals Summary Needed.
 
PROBLEMS #
 
LSD can precipitate strong, temporary changes in an individual's experience of life and reality. Even in low doses, it is a powerful psychoactive that can be significantly affected by experiences, set and setting. Recent experiences, especially strong ones, can have a substantial effect on a trip. Physically or psychologically unsettling events in the days before an LSD trip can blossom into more serious distress and trauma while tripping. 
 
 It is important to be prepared for the possibility of encountering difficult or frightening mental states. There are many ways of minimizing possible dangers and trauma: by making sure to have others around for first time or high dose experiences, choosing carefully when and where to use a substance, taking a little time to prepare mentally for an experience with LSD by relaxing, having an intent for the experience, or by incorporating comforting and calming ritual into the preparation (clean the house, adjust the lighting, choose music that will go with the sort of experience you're looking for,etc) Using a 'sitter', a sober friend who's job it is to take responsibility for the surroundings can go a long way toward easing anxiety and ensuring that someone will be able to deal with any situation that might arise. It's amazing how confusing a ringing phone or a cop at the door can be to someone who is on LSD. The [Psychedelic Crisis FAQ](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/faqs/psychedelic_crisis_faq.shtml) provides some information about how to handle difficult situations.
 
Contraindications #
 
- Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. Individuals currently in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval in their everyday lives should be careful about choosing to use strong psychedelics as they can trigger even more difficulty. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because LSD is known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems. LSD can cause uterine contractions and could negatively impact a pregnancy.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
LSD is not physically addicting, and is quite unlikely to lead to psychological addiction in most people. Withdrawal effects following discontinuation have not been reported. As with most substances, a few people have reported becoming mentally habituated to LSD. There is a short period of tolerance after use. Using LSD two days in a row is likely to lead to a diminished experience the second day, though spaced 3 or more days apart, this effect is very small, and after 7 days, tolerance is nearly non-existent.

LSD
 
Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
DOSAGE DESCRIPTION #
 
Caution : Dose information should not be taken as recommendations. [ see below ]
 
**LSD Oral Dosages**
- Threshold: 10-20 ug
- Light: 20 - 75 ug
- Common: 50 - 150 ug
- Strong: 150 - 400 ug
- Heavy: 400 + ug
 
LSD comes in several different forms. The most common is paper blotter. Other forms include gell caps, liquid, and gelatin. Each form will contain different quantities and purities of lysergic acid diethylamide. The chart above shows dosages for pure LSD measured in micrograms (ug). Micrograms are 1/1,000,000 of a gram. 
 
 For information about LSD-related deaths, see [Erowid's LSD Fatalities / Deaths Page](https://erowid.org/lsd_death.shtml) .
 
NOTES #
 
Blotter
 The most common form of LSD is paper blotter divided into about 1/4" squares called tabs. A single tab usually contains between 30 - 100 ug of LSD. Paper blotters are created by taking a sheet of absorbant paper (usually decorated and perforated) and soaking it in a dilution of lysergic acid diethylamide. The dilution can vary greatly from one batch to another, or one chemist to another. Because of the method used to make blotter tabs, there is no practical way to know the exact dosage of a particular tab without either trying it or knowing the chemist. Adjacent tabs on a sheet will usually contain very similar levels of LSD. Because a blotter tab is so small, only extremely potent chemicals such as LSD can fit at active levels. See the [Strychnine myth](https://erowid.org/lsd_myth2.shtml) . 
 
 
[Caution: As of 2013, the potent [NBOMe compounds appear to be supplanting LSD](https://erowid.org/chemicals/nbome/nbome_article1.shtml) on a significant portion of acid-style blotter, sometimes misrepresented as LSD by dealers.
 
 
Liquid
 LSD is soluble in water and other solvents, though liquid LSD is usually dissolved in ethyl (drinking) alcohol or in water. Liquid LSD is used in the creation of blotter tabs. A single drop of potent liquid LSD could be 50 times a normal dose, although it is generally diluted to the point where a single drop is equal to approximately one dose. This varies greatly from batch to batch, and is sometimes a weak dose while othertimes a very strong dose. Liquid LSD is somewhat uncommon. Be extremely careful when dealing with it as there is no way for the average person to gauge its potency. It is frequently stored in small dropper bottles. Caution: when one reaches the end of the bottle, one should not rinse it out and assume that what remains is a small dose. There can still be **many** doses left along the inside surfaces and taking them all at once can lead to some unexpectedly strong and possibly very uncomfortable experiences. 
 
 
Gelatin
 Also known as "window panes". Gelatin LSD is made by mixing liquid LSD with gelatin and forming it into small, thin squares. The benefit of this method is that less of the LSD is exposed to sun and air which break down lysergic acid diethylamide. A single square of gelatin is commonly stronger than a single blotter tab of LSD. (Rough estimate 50 - 150 ug per square).
 
CAUTION & DISCLAIMER #
 
Every individual reacts differently to every chemical. 
 
 Erowid's dosage information is a summary of data gathered from users, research, and other resources. This information is intended to describe the range of dosages people report using. It should not be construed as a recommendation of any sort. Individuals can respond very differently to the same dosage. What is safe for one can be deadly for another.

NOTES #
 
The primary health concerns about LSD use are related to psychological health rather than risk of physical damage to the body or brain. As senior LSD researcher Dr. David Nichols, Distinguished Chair of Pharmacology at Purdue University and head of one of the world's top LSD research labs, stated in his 2004 review article on hallucinogens, "There is no evidence that any of the hallucinogens, even the very powerful semisynthetic LSD, causes damage to any human body organ. [...] Hallucinogens do not cause life-threatening changes in cardiovascular, renal, or hepatic function because they have little or no affinity for the biological receptors and targets that mediate vital vegetative functions." 1 Deaths resulting from the pharmacological effects of LSD are rare to non-existent. 
 
 However, like all psychoactive drugs, LSD can induce cognitive and emotional alterations that can greatly affect behavior. With psychedelics such as LSD, there can be powerful and unexpected changes in thinking and perception. While under the influence of these drugs, an individual can exhibit poor judgement and delusional behavior, leading to accidents or dangerous situations. In those individuals predisposed toward certain psychiatric conditions, hallucinogens may precipitate psychotic responses or depression. In some individuals, long-lasting anxiety and/or depression may result from the unpleasant experiences and frightening visions that occurred during the psychedelic experience. 
 
 Experienced users often caution new users of psychedelics about the dangers of inebriated behavior and a common fear while inebriated that the effects of the drug will be permanent. One bit of popular trip wisdom highlights some risks of LSD use: "Cars are real. Cliffs are real. Cops are real. You cannot fly. It's never a good time to die. And don't forget: you will eventually come down." Sober sitters or psychotherapeutic guides are often suggested as a means of substantially reducing the risk related to adverse mental and physical events that may be associated with LSD use. Individuals have also been encouraged to prepare themselves psychologically for the experience, by being ready to accept whatever emerges out of their psyche ("I love this, too... even the snarling spider about to eat me who looks like my mother."). 
 
 LSD is reported to have some beneficial effects on health, including improvements in mental health; increased connection to spirituality; insights into self and world; the treatment of cluster headaches; use in combating addiction to other drugs and behaviors; and reducing use of pain medications and anxiety levels in people facing terminal illnesses. Although small-scale clinical studies by legitimate scientific laboratories have suggested these claims may be worthy of further investigation, large-scale clinical studies have yet to be conducted to validate this pilot work.
 
DEATHS #
 
Less than a handful of deaths have been directly attributed in the medical literature to the pharmacological effects of LSD, and *none* of these have been unquestionably attributable to LSD's actions. Estimates of what could be a potentially lethal dose of LSD are higher than 10 mg orally, a dose that is more than 100 times the common, moderate dose of LSD (100 ug). The administration of this amount would require the ingestion of more than 200 units of street blotter, which typically contain about 50 ug of LSD (as of late 2010). 
 
 It is important to note that LSD has been associated with deaths as a result of inebriated behavior (falling from a height or fighting with police) or by suicide. There are also occasional deaths misattributed to LSD when another substance was actually taken. 2 
 
 See [LSD Deaths](https://erowid.org/lsd_death.shtml) for a discussion of documented LSD-related fatalities.
 
WARNINGS #
 
- Precipitation of Psychosis. LSD may have the ability to trigger psychotic symptoms in those predisposed to psychosis. This is problematic because psychotic or schizophrenic disorders most frequently manifest in those in their late teens or early twenties, the same age that use of LSD is most common. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because LSD is known to trigger latent psychological problems. "Fortunately, however, these drugs do not appear to produce illness de novo in otherwise emotionally healthy persons, but these problems seem to be precipitated in predisposed individuals." 1 This adverse event is apparently quite rare: as Dr. Nichols of Purdue University observed in 2004: "A search of Medline in early 2003 for case reports of LSD-induced psychosis found only three reports in the previous 20 years." 1
- Precipitation of Depression. Experts dispute whether LSD use has been solidly linked to depression resulting in intentional suicide. See [LSD Death: Suicide](https://erowid.org/lsd_death.shtml#suicide) . LSD use, even in the context of formal psychotherapy, has been reported to trigger short-term or lasting depressions in some people. 14 LSD psychotherapy researchers in the 1950s and 1960s regularly identified depression following an LSD experience in articles discussing its use. Betty Eisner and Sidney Cohen wrote: "We have observed that a transient depression sometimes follows an LSD-25 session. This may be due to several factors: (1) the inability to integrate all of the unacceptable traumatic material uncovered during the session; (2) the feeling that the necessary effort is too great to be undertaken; (3) "coming back to earth" after a transcendent experience. It is therefore important that some sympathetic person be with the patient during the evening following treatment. A more serious type of depression has been observed to occur when insights acquired under the drug are not translated into the life situation." 14 People prone to depression or suicidal thinking may be more likely to suffer this response following exposure to psychedelics.
- Dangerous Interaction: Lithium or tricyclic antidepressants. LSD can cause dangerous reactions when used by someone taking lithium or tricyclic antidepressants. Some people report having experienced seizures after ingesting these combinations. Individuals have typically reported an undesirable intensification of the hallucinogenic response that is not akin to "getting higher for free". Such people have reported being unable to communicate with their friends, becoming uncharacteristically violent or going into fugue states (ending up somewhere else without knowing how they got there). In addition, the interaction of lithium and LSD has been reported by some persons to result in seizures in those who do not have a history of this condition. 3 , 4
- Reduction of Response to LSD when taken with SSRI and possibly MAOI drugs. In persons regularly taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) a reduction or abolishment of response to LSD has been reported. This effect is not reversible by taking a higher dose of LSD or by going off the antidepressant for a day or two. It generally appears to take weeks or a month off of an SSRI or MAOI before the full psychedelic response returns. However, it is not advisable to stop taking an antidepressant that is effective just to have an LSD experience. 20 As opposed to the diminished effect resulting from chronic use, there have been some reports that the accute use of a MAOI in combination with LSD increases the psychoactive effects; this could be viewed as a sort of ayahuasca-like effect.
- HPPD. Hallucinogen Persisting Perceptual Disorder (HPPD) has been reported by individuals who have taken LSD. Although a large portion of LSD users report lasting visual effects, only a small percent of those report these effects as troubling. When lasting visual effects interfere with normal function, these are classified as HPPD, a disorder identified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-R). See the [HPPD Vault](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/health/hppd/) .
 
CAUTIONS #
 
- Dramatic Changes in Thinking. Changes to thought processes, while among the many reasons why people choose to use LSD, can also impair judgement. A sober sitter who assumes responsibility for the welfare of a person under the influence of LSD can reduce the chances of problems caused by impaired judgement. Some LSD-related deaths and injuries have been the result of dangerous behavior such as walking on a freeway, staring at the sun, stepping through a window, or fighting with police. [see [Behavioral Fatalities](https://erowid.org/lsd_death.shtml#behavioral) ]
- Hyperthermia/Overheating. While uncommon, a few cases have been reported in the medical literature of dangerous overheating following ingestion of LSD, including one non-fatal case that brought the patient's body temperature to over 106°F (41°C). 6
- Anxiety/Panic Reactions. LSD may precipitate awareness of and access to surreal, existential, disorienting, or abstract psychological material resulting in experiences that are difficult to process, horrifically frightening, disturbing, or simply unsettling. These experiences and "insights" may result in lasting confusion about the nature of reality and the solidity of the material world. Individuals in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval, due to personal history or stress in their everyday lives, are likely to be more prone to such reactions.
- PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that involves recurring unwanted thinking about trip visions, nightmares, and unease related to the LSD experience.
- Pregnancy. LSD and other closely related chemicals are known to cause uterine contractions, which may be problematic during a pregnancy. In the mid-20th century, there were many erroneous rumors about the possibility of chromosome damage resulting from the use of LSD during pregnancy. Further research has disproven this theory. 10 , 13
- Breastfeeding. LSD is likely to pass into breast milk although little data is available about how much or for how long. Recommendations range from waiting 24 to 120 hours after LSD use before resuming breastfeeding. 7
- No Potential for Physical Dependence (Addiction). LSD does not cause physical dependence (as determined by the development of a withdrawal syndrome upon drug discontinuation following long-term administration). It is also not likely to lead to psychological dependence in most people, although there are a few reports of individuals who have taken it daily for months. As with most substances, a few people have reported developing a bad relationship with LSD, where they continue to use the drug despite adverse consequences in their lives. Tolerance (a reduction in response after taking the same dose of a drug on a subsequent occasion) begins with a single dose of LSD, due to a reduction ("down-regulation") of serotonin 5HT2 receptors. This effect is increased following continued use of LSD the next day, but reverses over time. Thus, using LSD two days in a row is likely to lead to a diminished experience the second day, but this effect is less likely if LSD is taken with at least three days in between experiences.
 
BENEFITS #
 
- Positive Effect on Mood and Life. Most users of LSD report that it has had a positive effect on their life, from simple recreational fun to profound life-changing spiritual experiences. In a survey conducted by Erowid on our website with over 49,000 valid responses, 53.4% of respondents reported that LSD use had affected their lives positively and only 3.4% reported it had a negative effect on their lives. The balance was made up mostly of 21.9% who reported that LSD had "no effect" on their lives over the long term and 17.2% who reported a "mix of positive and negative effects". 15
- Insights into Self, Other, and World. Perhaps the most commonly reported benefits from LSD are changed perspective and substantive insights into one's life. 16
- Treatment of Cluster Headaches. User reports by people with a severe form of migraine-like headaches called cluster headaches include descriptions of nearly complete blocking of the painful experiences with the use of LSD, psilocybin, and related compounds. Research into this issue is ongoing. 8 , 17
- Use in Psychotherapy. 9
- Use in Addiction Treatment. LSD and other psychedelics have been investigated as an adjunct to psychotherapeutic treatment of addiction and alcoholism. Such research stalled in the late 1960s, when prohibition made studies with LSD much more difficult to conduct, and addiction treatment remains an unproven-yet-potential health benefit from LSD. 18 , 21
- Reducing End-of-Life Anxiety. LSD and other psychedelics (such as DPT and psilocybin) have been shown to reduce depression, anxiety, and medication needs in some people facing terminal illness. 19

LSD is illegal to buy, sell, or possess in Italy. Penalties for possession of <0.15 mg of active principle (pure LSD) results in an administrative punishment (i.e. you pay a fee for the first time you're caught, then the second time they can suspend your passport), otherwise it's considered illegal sale, and it falls into penal code (D.L. 272/2006 converted with l. n. 49/2006) and it's punished with imprisonment from 6 to 20 years and a fee from 26.000 to 260.000 Euros. See [http://www.altalex.com/index.php?idnot=10216](http://www.altalex.com/index.php?idnot=10216) ." (thanks T). We received a note in March 2014 that the 49/2006 law was declared unconstitional, but the effect on LSD legality is unknown. (thanks fa) (last updated Mar 24 2014)
 
Mexico #
 
LSD is controlled in Mexico, however a law passed in 2009 made personal possession of 15 micrograms of LSD (.015 mg) not a crime. Curiously, this amount of LSD is considered below the threshold necessary for distinct effects. (thanks s) (last updated Dec 18, 2009)

## SYNTHESIS
A suspension of 3.15 g d-lysergic acid hydrate and 7.1 g of diethylamine in 150 mL CHCl3 was brought to reflux with stirring. With the external heating removed, there was added 3.4 g POCl3 over the course of 2 min, at a rate sufficient to maintain refluxing conditions. The mixture was held at reflux for an additional 5 min, at which point everything had gone into solution. After returning to room temperature, the solution was added to 200 mL of 1 N NH4OH. The phases were separated, the organic phase dried over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered, and the solvent removed under vacuum. The residue was chromatographed over alumina with elution employing a 3:1 C6H6/CHCl3 mixture, and the collected fraction stripped of solvent under hard vacuum to a constant weight. This free-base solid can be recrystallized from benzene to give white crystals with a melting point of 87â92 Â°C. IR (in cm-1): 750, 776, 850, 937 and 996, with the carbonyl at 1631. The mass spectrum of the free base has a strong parent peak at mass 323, with sizable fragments at masses of 181, 196, 207 and 221.

This base was dissolved in warm, dry MeOH, using 4 mL per g of product. There was then added dry d-tartaric acid (0.232 g per g of LSD base), and the clear warm solution treated with Et2O dropwise until the cloudiness did not dispel on continued stirring. This opaqueness set to a fine crystalline suspension (this is achieved more quickly with seeding) and the solution allowed to crystallize overnight in the refrigerator. Ambient light should be severely restricted during these procedures. The product was removed by filtration, washed sparingly with cold methanol, with a cold 1:1 MeOH/Et2O mixture, and then dried to constant weight. The white crystalline product was lysergic acid diethylamide tartrate with two molecules of methanol of crystallization, with a mp of about 200 Â°C with decomposition, and weighed 3.11 g (66%). Repeated recrystallizations from methanol produced a product that became progressively less soluble, and eventually virtually insoluble, as the purity increased. A totally pure salt, when dry and when shaken in the dark, will emit small flashes of white light.

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS

## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
There are many synthetic methods developed and reported for the preparation of LSD. All of them start with lysergic acid, and for that reason it has been listed as a Schedule III controlled drug, as a depressant, under Federal law. The amide lysergamide, a component of several varieties of morning glory seed, is also a controlled drug and, by law, a depressant. The earliest syntheses of LSD involved the use used of an azide intermediate (the original Hofmann process, 1955), mixed anhydrides with trifluoroacetic anhydride (1956) or sulfuric anhydride (SO3-DMF on the lithium salt, 1959), with the peptide condensation agent N,Nâ²-carbonyldiimidazole (1960), or with the acid chloride as the active intermediate with POCl3, PCl5 or thionyl chloride (1963) or just phosphorus oxychloride (1973). Most methods are faulted due to excessive moisture sensitivity, generation of side-products, or epimerization or inversion at the 8-position carbon to form d-iso-LSD. The POCl3 procedure is clean and fast, and is the preferred process today for the synthesis of a wide variety of substituted lysergamides.

The term LSD comes from the initials of the German for lysergic acid diethylamide, or LyserSÃ¤ure DiÃ¤thylamid LysersÃ¤ure Diethylamid. The number â25â following it has many myths attached to it, such as it was the 25th form of LSD that Hofmann tried, or it was his 25th attempt to make LSD. From my own experience with chemical companies that are allied with pharmaceutical houses, I had assumed that the chemical name (which might be a mouthful for the pharmacologist) was simply replaced with a pronounceable code number equivalent. But the answer here is yet simpler. Hofmann, in his LSD, My Problem Child wrote: âIn 1938, I produced the twenty fifth substance in a series of lysergic acid derivatives: lysergic acid diethylamide, abbreviated LSD-25â¦ for laboratory usage.â

Within a few years of the discovery of the extraordinary potency of LSD, a large number of close analogues were synthesized by Hofmann and his allies at Sandoz. Over the following decade many were tested in humans, both in patients and healthy subjects, with the qualitative descriptions and dosages published in the medical literature.

A number of analogues of LSD have maintained the diethylamide group unchanged, but additions or changes have been made in the pyrrole ring.

ALD-52. 
	1-Acetyl-N,N-diethyllysergamide. This material has been explored in the 50â175 microgram range and there are a number of human trials reported, with varying conclusions. One found that there was less visual distortion than with LSD and it seems to produce less anxiety and was somewhat less potent than LSD. Another report claimed it was more effective in increasing blood pressure. Yet another could not tell them apart. ALD-52 just may have been the drug that was sold as âOrange Sunshineâ during the âSummer of Loveâ in the late â60âs. Or âOrange Sunshineâ may have been, really, LSD. This was the focus of a fascinating trial where two defendants were accused of distributing LSD, whereas they claimed that it was ALD-52 which was not an illegal drug. The prosecution claimed that as it hydrolyses readily to LSD, for all intents and purposes it was LSD, and anyway, you had to go through the illegal LSD to get to ALD-52 by any of the known chemical syntheses. The defendants were found guilty. And yet, I do not know who has actually measured the speed or ease of that reaction. If ALD-52 hydrolyses so easily to LSD, and the body is indeed a hydrolytic instrument, then these two drugs should be absolutely equivalent in every particular, This is the ergot equivalent of the psilocybin to psilocin argument, except this is an acetamide rather than a phosphate ester.

MLD-41. 
	1-Methyl-N,N-diethyllysergamide. The 1-methyl homologue of LSD is has more of somatic than sensory effect, has fewer visuals and is less well accepted than LSD, with the range of dosages being from 100 to 300 micrograms. This indicates that it is perhaps a third the potency of LSD which is in accord with both pupilary dilation and reflex action. However, the cardiovascular responses are actually increased. Besides being less potent than LSD, it appears to have a slower onset but it is equally long lived. There is cross-tolerance between MLD-41 and LSD.

BOL-148. 
	2-Bromo-N,N-diethyllysergamide. This synthetic ergot derivative, along with its 1-methyl homologue MBL-61 (mentioned below) should be used as powerful tools for studying the mechanism of action of LSD in the human animal. It does not have LSD-like effects in man. At 6 to 10 milligrams orally, there are some mental changes noted. But in another study, 20 milligrams was administered a day to a subject for 7 days, and there were no reported effects. And yet it is as potent a serotonin agonist as is LSD. How can serotonin be argued as a neurotransmitter that is a major player in explaining the action of psychedelic drugs, when this compound is nearly without activity.

There are some suggestions that an intravenous intervenous route may be more effective. I have heard of effects being noted at maybe a milligram and a short (2â3 hour) intoxication intoxicaion following 20 milligrams administered over a 20 minute period. I was involved many years ago in a study of radio-labelled BOL-148 which was made by the bromination of LSD. I was quite sure that the only radioactive material present was BOL-148, but there could well have been some unreacted LSD still present which would, of course, still be psychoactive. The synthesis is not cleanâI was tempted to make an entry for this compound if only to reproduce Albert Hofmannâs original published experimental procedure. He reacted 13.2 grams of N-bromosuccinimide (in 400 mL dioxane, with 1.2 liters of dioxane containing 25 grams of LSD. This gave 11 grams of crude product produce which had to be recrystallized. The radioactive syntheses uses effectively elemental bromine, and gave yields of from 5 to 15%. Visualize that reaction! A warm flask containing over a quart of warm solvent in which there was maybe half a million doses of LSD.

These three additional compounds are shown here because they were described in a synthetic flurry that followed the discovery the activity of LSD. But at the moment I know neither their internal Sandoz codes nor if they had ever been explored in man. This is a kind of frustrating catch-all entry, in that the long index will send you here, and once here you realize that nothing is known. Well, at least the compounds are known, and perhaps there is something in the Sandoz vaults that might be interesting. I do not have access to them.

1-Hydroxymethyl-LSD

1-dimethylaminomethyl-LSD



2-iodo-LSD



MBL-61. 2-Bromo-N,N-diethyl-1-methyllysergamide. This is the compound BOL-148 (mentioned above) with a methyl group attached to the 1-position of the indole ring (LSD has a hydrogen there). This would wold be an even more tantalizing challenge to the serotonin theory for central centrqal activity of the psychedelics psuchedelics, in that it is without any activity in man at an oral dose of 14 milligrams (similar to the inactivity of the BOL-61 compound, but it is some spome five times more potent as a serotonin agonist. With it, as with the iodiniated analogue MIL, there are many examples of the compromising of scientific integrity in the quest for funds and recognition. Both compounds are as effective as LSD itself in displacing labelled LSD that is bound to the post-synaptic serotonin receptor sites in animal brains. But neither of them show any LSD-like activity. But both have been labelled with 11C or 122I to give positron positrol emitting forms that can be administered to man and localized in a positron emission tomography positrom emition tomographt instrument (a PET scanner).


I was at a meeting of a NIDA study section a few years ago, where some one presented some findings with a group of subjects who were complaining of continuing mental problems allegedly alledgedly due to LSD exposure. A chart was put up showing the outline of the brain showing the locations of the EEG foci that were observed in one of these subjects. Along side it was a PET scan showing the distribution of radioactive LSD in a subject. The purpose was to discuss the similarities and differences of the coordinates of electrical activity and radio-isotope concentration. I innocently asked what positron isotope had been used, as I did not know of any successful positron labelling of LSD. Carbon 11, I was told. Where in the molecule was the label incorporated, I asked. In the 1-position methyl group. It was finally acknowledged that the compound that had actually been used was 2-Iodo-1-methyl-LSD, our MIL compound, which is quite a different world. A pharmacologist might say that they are similar in action (looking at serotonin, not psychedelic action), and a chemist achemist might say they are of similar structure (looking at the upper 80% of the molecule moledule. But they are different compounds. This is a most subtle form of deceit. It is, in fact, out and out dishonest, but it looks good up there on the screen at a lecture.


Let me mention in passing, that there are three stereoisomers possible for d-LSD. There are d-iso-LSD, l-LSD, and l-iso-LSD. The inversion of the stereochemistry of the attached diethylcarboxyamido group of d-LSD gives the diastereoisomer (d-iso-LSD) which is a frequent synthetic impurity of d-LSD itself. The corresponding optical antipodes l-LSD and l-iso-LSD are also known and have been tasted. All three are completely inactive: d-iso-LSD shows no psychological changes at an oral dose of 4 milligrams; l-LSD none at up to 10 milligrams orally; and l-iso-LSD none at 500 micrograms orally. These dramatic decreases in potency show both the stereoselectivity of the native LSD molecule in producing its central effects, and the LSD-free purity of these isomers.


LSD Stereoisomers



The second major location of variations in the structure of LSD has been in the nature of the alkyl groups on the amide nitrogen atom. Some of these are Sandoz syntheses, some are from other research groups, and a few of them are found in nature. Some of these have been studied in man, and some have not. A few of the original clutch of Sandoz compounds have both 1-substituents and amide alkyl (R) group variations:

In the amides marked with â*â there has been the introduction of a new asymmetric center, which of course doubles the number of isomers that is possible. In each case the resulting two optical forms were prepared separately, and evaluated separately as to their pharmacology. 

This listing is not intended to be thorough, but it is shown to suggest the amount of synthetic effort that has been made towards the exploring and understanding the high potency associated with those two remarkably important ethyl groups on the amide nitrogen of LSD. I have given the Sandoz code names, again, as far as I know them. Although none of these really warrant a dedicated recipe, there is sufficient animal and human pharmacology reported to justify listing them below as separate items. Most of these reports appeared in the mid-1950âs but some studies are still being done and papers are published even today with new ideas but, sadly, only with animal pharmacology. I have been as guilty as the next person who has tried to mount all these compounds into a table with a âhuman potencyâ factor that compares them directly to LSD. This is an uncomfortable simplification. Here are the actual reported observations, and Iâll let the reader provide his own potency index.

LA-111, Ergine, d-Lysergamide. This is an active compound and has been established as a major component in morning glory seeds. It was assayed for human activity, by Albert Hofmann in self-trials back in 1947, well before this was known to be a natural compound. An i.m. administration of a 500 microgram dose led to a tired, dreamy state with an inability to maintain clear thoughts. After a short period of sleep, the effects were gone and normal baseline was recovered within five hours. Other observers have confirmed this clouding of consciousness leading to sleep. The epimer, inverted at C-8, is isoergine  or d-isolysergamide, and is also a component of morning glory seeds. Hofmann tried a 2 milligram dose of this amide, and as with ergine, he experienced nothing but tiredness, apathy, and a feeling of emptiness. Both compounds are probably correctly dismissed as not being a contributor to the action of these seeds. It is important to note that ergine, as well as lysergic acid itself, is listed as a Schedule III drug in the Controlled Substances Act, as a depressant. This is, in all probability, a stratagem to control them as logical precursors to LSD.

LAE-32, N-Ethyllysergamide. Different people have observed and reported different effects, with different routes of administration. Subcutaneous administrations of from 500 to 750 micrograms have been said to produce a state of apathy and sedation. Clinical studies with dosages of 500 micrograms i.m. were felt to be less effective than the control use of 100 micrograms of LSD. And yet, oral doses of twice this amount, 1.6 milligrams, have been said to produce a short-lived LSD-like effect with none of these negatives.

LPD-824, N-Pyrrolidyllysergamide. Five trials at a dosage of 800 micrograms orally led to the reporting of a fleeting effect that was similar to one tenth this amount of LSD. 

LSM-775, N-Morpholinyllysergamide. There are conflicting reports; one states that 75 micrograms is an effective dose, comparable to a similar dose of LSD, and the other stated that between 350 and 700 micrograms was needed to elicit this response, and that there were fewer signs of cardiovascular stimulation and peripheral toxicity. 

DAM-57, N,N-Dimethyllysergamide. This compound did induce autonomic disturbances at oral levels of some ten times the dosage required for LSD, presumably in the high hundreds of micrograms. There is some disagreement as to whether there were psychic changes observed.

DAL, N,N-Diallyllysergamide. As the tartrate salt, there is at best a touch of sparkle seen at 600 micrograms orally, but there is a sedation also reported. It is certainly an order of magnitude less potent than LSD itself.

UML-491, Methysergide, Sansert. This is the synthetic homologue of methergine (1-methyl) and is employed clinically as a treatment for migraine headaches. When the usual therapeutic dosage of two milligrams is scaled up by a factor of ten, there is a profound LSD-like response described by most subjects. A number of these ergot analogues from nature can be considered as potential precursors for the preparation of LSD. But here, there is a 1-methyl group that is effectively permanently attached, so it cannot play this role.


The third location of structural modification of the LSD molecule has been at the 6-position in ring D. This is the LAD series with any of several alkyl groups attached to the nitrogen atom. The methyl group is found with LSD itself, and is reason for using METH-LAD in the title as a synonym. The ethyl, allyl and propyl substitutions provide ETH-LAD, AL-LAD, and PRO-LAD, and each of these commands a separate entry.

The most frequently encountered precursor for the manufacture of LSD is ergotamine, a major alkaloid of the ergot world. It is totally unknown in the morning glories. The usual commercial form is the tartrate salt, and is often referred to under the code abbreviation of ET, for ergotamine tartrate. It has found medical use in the treatment of migraine headaches, and as an oxytocic (an agent that is used in childbirth to stimulate uterine contractions. Care with the ET terminology must be taken, in that in the drug world it has two additional associations; Î±-ET for alpha-ethyltryptamine and NET for N-monoethyltryptamine. 

Ergonovine is a naturally occurring, water-soluble ergot alkaloid, found in both ergot preparations and in many species of morning glory seeds, and there are several reports of LSD-like action at oral levels of between two and ten milligrams. It has an important use in obstetrics, again as an oxytocic, at about a tenth of this dose. This pharmacological potential must be respected in psychopharmacological trials. The one-carbon homologue (the butanolamide rather than the propanolamide) is called methergine or methylergonovine. It is a synthetic ally and is orally effective as an oxytocic at a dosage of 200 micrograms. It also has an LSD-like action at ten times this level.

Although there are many other chemical treasures in the ergot fungal world, I would like to wrap this commentary up with a return to the topic of morning glory seeds. Four additional alkaloids of the ergot world must be acknowledged as being potentially participating factors in the MGS story. With each of these, the primary ergoline ring system is largely intact but the amide function is completely gone. The carboxyl group has been reduced to the alcohol to give elymoclavine. There is the related molecule present which is the isomer with the double bond moved to be conjugated with the aromatic ring; it is called lysergol. There is the same molecule but with a hydroxy group attached to the 8-position carbon atom (an ethyleneglycol!); it is called penniclavine. And lastly, that D-ring can actually be opened between the 5 and 6 positions, to give us a secondary amine tryptamine derivative, chanoclavine. To be completely anally retentive in this Ipomoea inventory, mention must be made of five alkaloids that are present in truly trace amounts, all of which have no oxygen atoms present whatsoever on that substitution on the ergoline 8-position. These are the 8-methyl isomers agroclavine, setoclavine, festuclavine and cycloclavine, and the methylene analogue lysergene. These structures in effect define absolute obscurity, and most probably do not contribute to the morning glory intoxication state. But the others, some present is sizable amounts, may someday help explain why the pharmacology of these seeds is so different than that of the major isolates, the ergines.

2-iodo-LSD

MBL-61. 2-Bromo-N,N-diethyl-1-methyllysergamide. This is the compound BOL-148 (mentioned above) with a methyl group attached to the 1-position of the indole ring (LSD has a hydrogen there). This would wold be an even more tantalizing challenge to the serotonin theory for central centrqal activity of the psychedelics psuchedelics, in that it is without any activity in man at an oral dose of 14 milligrams (similar to the inactivity of the BOL-61 compound, but it is some spome five times more potent as a serotonin agonist. With it, as with the iodiniated analogue MIL, there are many examples of the compromising of scientific integrity in the quest for funds and recognition. Both compounds are as effective as LSD itself in displacing labelled LSD that is bound to the post-synaptic serotonin receptor sites in animal brains. But neither of them show any LSD-like activity.

All three are completely inactive: d-iso-LSD shows no psychological changes at an oral dose of 4 milligrams; l-LSD none at up to 10 milligrams orally; and l-iso-LSD none at 500 micrograms orally. These dramatic decreases in potency show both the stereoselectivity of the native LSD molecule in producing its central effects, and the LSD-free purity of these isomers.

LSD Stereoisomers

The second major location of variations in the structure of LSD has been in the nature of the alkyl groups on the amide nitrogen atom. Some of these are Sandoz syntheses, some are from other research groups, and a few of them are found in nature. Some of these have been studied in man, and some have not. A few of the original clutch of Sandoz compounds have both 1-substituents and amide alkyl (R) group variations:

In the amides marked with â*â there has been the introduction of a new asymmetric center, which of course doubles the number of isomers that is possible. In each case the resulting two optical forms were prepared separately, and evaluated separately as to their pharmacology.

This listing is not intended to be thorough, but it is shown to suggest the amount of synthetic effort that has been made towards the exploring and understanding the high potency associated with those two remarkably important ethyl groups on the amide nitrogen of LSD. I have given the Sandoz code names, again, as far as I know them. Although none of these really warrant a dedicated recipe, there is sufficient animal and human pharmacology reported to justify listing them below as separate items. Most of these reports appeared in the mid-1950âs but some studies are still being done and papers are published even today with new ideas but, sadly, only with animal pharmacology. I have been as guilty as the next person who has tried to mount all these compounds into a table with a âhuman potencyâ factor that compares them directly to LSD. This is an uncomfortable simplification. Here are the actual reported observations, and Iâll let the reader provide his own potency index.

LA-111, Ergine, d-Lysergamide. This is an active compound and has been established as a major component in morning glory seeds. It was assayed for human activity, by Albert Hofmann in self-trials back in 1947, well before this was known to be a natural compound. An i.m. administration of a 500 microgram dose led to a tired, dreamy state with an inability to maintain clear thoughts. After a short period of sleep, the effects were gone and normal baseline was recovered within five hours. Other observers have confirmed this clouding of consciousness leading to sleep. The epimer, inverted at C-8, is isoergine  or d-isolysergamide, and is also a component of morning glory seeds. Hofmann tried a 2 milligram dose of this amide, and as with ergine, he experienced nothing but tiredness, apathy, and a feeling of emptiness. Both compounds are probably correctly dismissed as not being a contributor to the action of these seeds. It is important to note that ergine, as well as lysergic acid itself, is listed as a Schedule III drug in the Controlled Substances Act, as a depressant. This is, in all probability, a stratagem to control them as logical precursors to LSD.

LAE-32, N-Ethyllysergamide. Different people have observed and reported different effects, with different routes of administration. Subcutaneous administrations of from 500 to 750 micrograms have been said to produce a state of apathy and sedation. Clinical studies with dosages of 500 micrograms i.m. were felt to be less effective than the control use of 100 micrograms of LSD. And yet, oral doses of twice this amount, 1.6 milligrams, have been said to produce a short-lived LSD-like effect with none of these negatives.

LPD-824, N-Pyrrolidyllysergamide. Five trials at a dosage of 800 micrograms orally led to the reporting of a fleeting effect that was similar to one tenth this amount of LSD.

LSM-775, N-Morpholinyllysergamide. There are conflicting reports; one states that 75 micrograms is an effective dose, comparable to a similar dose of LSD, and the other stated that between 350 and 700 micrograms was needed to elicit this response, and that there were fewer signs of cardiovascular stimulation and peripheral toxicity.

DAM-57, N,N-Dimethyllysergamide. This compound did induce autonomic disturbances at oral levels of some ten times the dosage required for LSD, presumably in the high hundreds of micrograms. There is some disagreement as to whether there were psychic changes observed.

DAL, N,N-Diallyllysergamide. As the tartrate salt, there is at best a touch of sparkle seen at 600 micrograms orally, but there is a sedation also reported. It is certainly an order of magnitude less potent than LSD itself.

UML-491, Methysergide, Sansert. This is the synthetic homologue of methergine (1-methyl) and is employed clinically as a treatment for migraine headaches. When the usual therapeutic dosage of two milligrams is scaled up by a factor of ten, there is a profound LSD-like response described by most subjects. A number of these ergot analogues from nature can be considered as potential precursors for the preparation of LSD. But here, there is a 1-methyl group that is effectively permanently attached, so it cannot play this role.

The third location of structural modification of the LSD molecule has been at the 6-position in ring D. This is the LAD series with any of several alkyl groups attached to the nitrogen atom. The methyl group is found with LSD itself, and is reason for using METH-LAD in the title as a synonym. The ethyl, allyl and propyl substitutions provide ETH-LAD, AL-LAD, and PRO-LAD, and each of these commands a separate entry.

The most frequently encountered precursor for the manufacture of LSD is ergotamine, a major alkaloid of the ergot world. It is totally unknown in the morning glories. The usual commercial form is the tartrate salt, and is often referred to under the code abbreviation of ET, for ergotamine tartrate. It has found medical use in the treatment of migraine headaches, and as an oxytocic (an agent that is used in childbirth to stimulate uterine contractions. Care with the ET terminology must be taken, in that in the drug world it has two additional associations; Î±-ET for alpha-ethyltryptamine and NET for N-monoethyltryptamine.

Ergonovine is a naturally occurring, water-soluble ergot alkaloid, found in both ergot preparations and in many species of morning glory seeds, and there are several reports of LSD-like action at oral levels of between two and ten milligrams. It has an important use in obstetrics, again as an oxytocic, at about a tenth of this dose. This pharmacological potential must be respected in psychopharmacological trials. The one-carbon homologue (the butanolamide rather than the propanolamide) is called methergine or methylergonovine. It is a synthetic ally and is orally effective as an oxytocic at a dosage of 200 micrograms. It also has an LSD-like action at ten times this level.

Although there are many other chemical treasures in the ergot fungal world, I would like to wrap this commentary up with a return to the topic of morning glory seeds. Four additional alkaloids of the ergot world must be acknowledged as being potentially participating factors in the MGS story. With each of these, the primary ergoline ring system is largely intact but the amide function is completely gone. The carboxyl group has been reduced to the alcohol to give elymoclavine. There is the related molecule present which is the isomer with the double bond moved to be conjugated with the aromatic ring; it is called lysergol. There is the same molecule but with a hydroxy group attached to the 8-position carbon atom (an ethyleneglycol!); it is called penniclavine. And lastly, that D-ring can actually be opened between the 5 and 6 positions, to give us a secondary amine tryptamine derivative, chanoclavine. To be completely anally retentive in this Ipomoea inventory, mention must be made of five alkaloids that are present in truly trace amounts, all of which have no oxygen atoms present whatsoever on that substitution on the ergoline 8-position. These are the 8-methyl isomers agroclavine, setoclavine, festuclavine and cycloclavine, and the methylene analogue lysergene. These structures in effect define absolute obscurity, and most probably do not contribute to the morning glory intoxication state. But the others, some present is sizable amounts, may someday help explain why the pharmacology of these seeds is so different than that of the major isolates, the ergines.

**Lysergic acid diethylamide** (also known as **Lysergide** , **LSD-25** , **LSD** , **L** , **Lucy** , and **Acid** ) is a [classical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Classical_psychedelics) [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) class. It is perhaps the most researched and culturally influential psychedelic substance, as well as the prototypal [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) . The mechanism of action is not fully known, although [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [binding activity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) is thought to be involved.

The psychoactive effects of LSD were first discovered in 1943 by [Albert Hofmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Hofmann) at Sandoz Laboratories (Switzerland). In the 1950s, it was widely distributed by Sandoz as an experimental drug for psychotherapy and scientific research; during this era, it provoked considerable interest from the intellectual establishment and was even the subject of a clandestine investigation by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for potential applications in "mind control".

Recreational LSD use became a central, highly-visible aspect of the 1960s youth counterculture movement, eventually paving the way for international prohibition in 1971. Today, illicit recreational use remains widespread and it is associated in popular culture with the counterculture and rave scenes. The lifetime prevalence of LSD use among American adults is 6-8%.

Following decades of institutional suppression, scientific research involving LSD has recently undergone a massive revival. As a part of the so-called "psychedelic renaissance", it is currently being investigated in the treatment of a number of conditions including alcoholism, substance addiction, cluster headache, autism, and [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) associated with terminal illness.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [visual geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_geometry) / [hallucinatory states](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinatory_states) , [time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion) , [enhanced introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) , [conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking) , [increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation) , [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , and [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) . LSD use is reportedly associated with mystical-type experiences that are sometimes claimed to facilitate self-reflection and personal growth. It has been called the first modern [entheogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogen) , a group which is otherwise limited to traditional plant preparations or extracts.

Unlike most highly prohibited substances, LSD has not been proven to be physiologically toxic or addictive. However, adverse psychological reactions such as severe [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) are always possible, particularly for those predisposed to mental disorders (see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) ).

It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction#Hallucinogens) if using this substance.

## History and culture

The original synthesis of LSD was recorded on November 16, 1938, by the Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann while employed at the Sandoz Laboratories in Basel, Switzerland. The compound was synthesized as part of a large research program searching for medically useful derivatives of ergot, a fungus that grows on rye and other grains.

However, it was not discovered to be psychoactive until five years later, when Hofmann claimed to have accidentally ingested an unknown quantity of the chemical before proceeding to ride his bike home.

The first intentional ingestion was recorded on April 19, 1943. Hofmann ingested 250 micrograms (µg) of LSD, believing it would be a threshold dose based on the doses of other ergot [alkaloids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alkaloids) . He found the effects to be much stronger than he anticipated and was impressed by its profound mind-altering effects. April 19th is now celebrated annually as "Bicycle Day".

In 1947, Sandoz introduced LSD to the medical community under the name *Delysid* , marketing it as an experimental tool to induce temporary psychotic-like states in normals (“model-psychosis”) and later to enhance psychotherapeutic treatments (“psycholytic” or “psychedelic” therapy). The substance had a major impact upon its release — within 15 years, research on LSD and other [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) generated over 1,000 scientific papers and was prescribed to over 40,000 patients.

In the 1950s, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) created a research program code-named [MK-ULTRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra) that would conduct clandestine research investigating LSD for applications in 'mind control' and chemical warfare. Experiments included administering the substance to CIA employees, military personnel, doctors, prostitutes, mentally ill patients, and members of the general public without their knowledge or consent, which resulted in at least one death.

In 1963, the Sandoz patents for LSD expired. Several prominent intellectuals, including Aldous Huxley, Timothy Leary, Al Hubbard, and Alan Watts began to advocate for the mass consumption of LSD; according to L. R. Veysey, they profoundly influenced the thinking of the new generation of youth. LSD became a central, highly-visible feature of the youth-driven counterculture of the 1960s, provoking widespread controversy and backlash in American civil society.

On October 24, 1968, LSD possession was made illegal in the United States. The last FDA approved study in patients ended in 1980, while a study in healthy volunteers was made in the late 1980s. Legally approved and regulated psychiatric use of LSD continued in Switzerland until 1993.

### Names

The name *LSD* comes from its early research code name *LSD-25* , an abbreviation for the German spelling "Lysergsäure-diethylamid" followed by a sequential number.

LSD has numerous street names including: **acid** , **lucy** , **L** , **cid** or **sid** . Also called **blotter** or **tabs** , a reference to their standard form of distribution.

## Chemistry

LSD, or d-lysergic acid diethylamide, belongs to a class of synthetic organic compounds called [lysergamides](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamides) (a subclass of ergolines).

It is the "parent compound" of the lysergamide family, meaning it serves as the prototype for a series of compounds that are derived from its structure and have broadly similar effects. These include: [1B-LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1B-LSD) , [1P-LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1P-LSD) , [1V-LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1V-LSD) , [ALD-52](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/ALD-52) , [AL-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/AL-LAD) , [ETH-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/ETH-LAD) , [PRO-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PRO-LAD) , [LSM-775](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSM-775) , [LSZ](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSZ) , and [MiPLA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MiPLA) .

The chemical structure consists of a bicyclic hexahydroindole ring fused to a bicyclic quinoline group (lysergic acid). At carbon 8 of the quinoline an N,N-diethyl carboxamide is bound. It is additionally substituted at carbon 6 with a methyl group.

It is a chiral compound with two stereocenters at R 5 and R 8 . The active form of LSD is called (+)-D-LSD, which has an absolute configuration of (5 *R* , 8 *R* ). The other three stereoisomers do not have psychoactive properties.

The pure form occurs as colorless, odorless, prismatic crystals. It is sensitive to oxygen, ultraviolet light, and chlorine (especially in solution). Its potency may last for years if it is stored away from light and moisture at cold temperatures around 0°C or below, but slowly degrades at normal room temperature (25°C).

## Pharmacology

According to various studies, LSD acts as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) at most [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) subtypes, including the 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 2C and 5-HT 6 receptors, with high affinities. The 5-HT 3 and 5-HT 4 receptors are excluded. 5-HT 5B receptors, which have not been found in humans, also have a high affinity for LSD.

The mechanism of LSD's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects is thought to be [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) (binding) activity at the 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2C , and 5-HT 1A receptor subtypes, with high affinities. Further information about how altered serotonin signaling may lead to LSD's signature cascade of visual and cognitive effects is [available here](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelic#Proposed_method_of_action) . It should be noted that the mechanism is not fully understood.

Recent research has also found that LSD activates different intracellular signaling cascades than endogenous serotonin even when bound to the same receptor sites. Because intracellular signaling cascades influence gene expression, LSD-induced signaling events within cells may inappropriately alter gene expression, which in turn may lead to changes in neuronal state and subsequently cognition.

These findings help explain why the behavioral effects can resemble paranoid schizophrenia in humans.

The study concludes that acute LSD usage increases expression of a small set of genes in the mammalian brain that are involved in a wide array of cellular functions implicated in synaptic plasticity, glutamatergic signaling, cytoskeletal architecture and perhaps communication between the synapse and nucleus.

Additionally, studies have shown that LSD possesses binding efficacy at all [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine#The_Dopamine_System) and all [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Adrenaline#The_Adrenergic_System) receptors. Most [serotonergic psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelic) are not significantly [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , so LSD is unique in this respect. In particular, LSD's agonist activity at the D 2 receptor has been shown to contribute to its subjective effects.

### "Flashbacks"

The etiology of the "flashback" phenomenon appears to be varied. Some researchers such as Krebs and Johansen (2015 ) attribute at least some of the cases to be related to Somatic Symptom Disorder, when people fixate on normal somatic experiences and perceptions that they weren't aware of before consuming the drug. Other researchers relate it to an associative reaction to a contextual cue akin to what people that have faced trauma or strongly emotional experiences face when receiving a triggering stimulus (Holland and Passie 2011 ). There is no consensus on what are the risk factors but some researchers theorize that pre-existing psychopathologies may be a significant contributor (Abraham and Duffy 1996 )

The prevalence of HPPD is difficult to estimate but appears to be very rare (Halpern et al 2016 ), with estimates ranging from 1 in 20 users for the transitory and less serious type 1 HPPD, to 1 in 50.000 users for the more concerning type 2 HPPD.

Contrary to rumors circulating the internet that LSD is stored in the spinal chord or other parts of your body long-term, the pharmacological evidence (Passie et all 2008 ) shows LSD has a short half-life of 175 minutes, undergoing enzymatic metabolism into more polar and therefore water-soluble compounds such as 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD that are eliminated through the urine. No evidence of long term storage of LSD in the body exists.

## Subjective effects

Compared to some other psychedelics such as [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) , [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) , and [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) , LSD is reported to be more stimulating and fast-paced in its physical and cognitive effects. The wide variety of effects observed may be attributed to its so-called "promiscuous" binding activity at a range of CNS receptors other than [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , such as [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) receptors.

In terms of [subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) , LSD may be described as possessing the [visual](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics) and [mental content](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects_-_Psychedelics) of [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) along with the " [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopaminergic) edge" of a classical [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) such as [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) . Consequently, LSD euphoria can be described as "medium forced", which is higher than [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) but not as high as some [phenethylamine-based](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) or [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) .

Additionally, it is associated with slightly more cognitive side effects such as [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) and [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) compared to [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) or [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) . Some users report they have a harsher comedown that can resemble that of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , perhaps owing to its long duration (10 hr+) and sensitivity to its [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopaminergic) properties.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Neurogenesis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurogenesis)**
- **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - LSD is usually described as very energetic and stimulating without being forced. For example, it tends to encourage physical activities such as walking, climbing, or dancing. 
In comparison, other common psychedelics such as [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) or [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) are generally sedating and sedentary.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of LSD behaves as a euphoric, fast-moving, sharp and location specific or generalized tingling sensation.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - A unique form of physical euphoria may occur at certain points of the trip. However, it is limited and inconsistent compared to the effect of [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) or [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , and can just as easily manifest as physical discomfort without any apparent reason.
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)** - The stimulation and energy LSD produces can cause the user to feel as if they are moving weightlessly.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - Feelings of enhanced tactile sensations are consistently present at moderate levels throughout most LSD trips.
- **[Changes in felt bodily form](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_bodily_form)** - This effect is often accompanied by a sense of warmth or [unity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness#Unity_between_the_self_and_specific_external_systems) and usually near the peak of the experience. Users can feel as if they are physically part of or conjoined with other objects.
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)** - LSD can greatly reduce or distort the perception of pain. This is likely due to a variety of factors as the hallucinogenic effects mean that pain can be interpreted as a different sensation (i.e. a tickling sensation from a painful stimulus). 
LSD also possesses potent anti-inflammatory properties that likely contribute to this effect.
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** - LSD appears to cause the body to lose some of its ability to regulate its temperature. While usually harmless, users should be careful when taking LSD in conditions of extreme hot or cold.
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)** - Potentially dangerous states of overheating have been reported to occur in certain conditions, particularly with higher doses due to the fact that LSD raises body serotonin.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Mild nausea is occasionally reported on moderate to high doses and either passes after the user vomits or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)** - The user's stamina for physical activities may be enhanced. Some users have also reported using small doses to improve athletic performance. However, this effect is generally mild compared to the effect of [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) .
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)** - LSD can suppress appetite in a manner similar to (although not as strong as) stimulants, especially for fatty foods.
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** - Mild to moderate dehydration may occur. Not as extreme as with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) or [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) .
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** - Due to the [vasoconstrictive](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) properties of the substance, blood pressure is consequently raised.
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)**
- **[Excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning)** - Excessive yawning is frequently reported, especially during the come up phase.
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)** - Anisocoria, i.e. significant difference in pupil dilation grade between the two eyes, can also be present. In the context of hallucinogen usage, this phenomenon has been regarded as harmless. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased salivation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_salivation)**
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - Very rare but can occur in those who are predisposed to them, particularly while in physically taxing conditions such as being dehydrated, undernourished, overheated, or fatigued.
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - Mild to moderate. Not as intense as on [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** - Dose-dependent, but weaker compared to [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , [25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) , or [DOx](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOx) . Some users report feeling cold, especially in the extremities. ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)** - Compared to other psychedelics, this effect is often reported to be brighter and more "radiant" in character.
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Magnification](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Magnification)**
- **[Frame rate enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frame_rate_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Melting) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing) , [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Morphing) and [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Flowing) )* - Compared to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed yet cartoon-like in its appearance. The distortions are slow and smooth in motion and fleeting in their appearance.
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Depth perception distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depth_perception_distortions)**
- **[Environmental patterning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Environmental_patterning)**
- **[Perspective distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_distortions)**
- **[Recursion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recursion)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
 
#### Geometry
 The visual geometry of LSD can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) than [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) , [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . 
It can be [exhaustively described](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as primarily intricate in complexity, algorithmic in form, unstructured in organization, brightly lit, colourful in scheme, synthetic in feel, multicoloured in scheme, flat in shading, sharp in edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, angular in its corners, non-immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity.
 
At higher doses, it tends to produce states of [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry over [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) . Very high doses saturating serotonin receptors tend to saturate one's visual perception from rainbow geometry to a white void.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
LSD is capable of producing a full range of low and high-level hallucinatory states; however, they are significantly less consistent and reproducible than that of other psychedelic tryptamines such as [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) or [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) . These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)** - A rare effect that typically only occurs at very strong to heavy doses, and not as consistently as with certain psychedelics such as [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) , [2C-P](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-P) , and atypical psychedelics like [salvia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Salvia) .
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - Although some users report that LSD is capable of producing hallucinatory states with the same intensity and vividness as [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , it is much rarer and less consistent. While traditional psychedelics such as [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) , [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) and [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) will induce internal hallucinations near consistently at level 5 [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) and above, some users claim that LSD tends to go straight into [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry. 
This lack of consistently induced hallucinatory breakthroughs means that for most, LSD is relatively limited in depth, at doses that do not come with excessive side effects.
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - Some users report gaining the ability to analyze situations in novel and relatively objective ways. It is not clear if this is actually the case, or just a feeling generated by the substance.
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** & **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - Not typically observed at low to common doses and are less likely to occur when the basic rules of [set and setting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) are taken into account.
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)** - A signature effect. LSD may allow the user to bypass normal cognitive patterns (and their associated limitations). Manifests as lateral or abstract thinking patterns.
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - Cognitive euphoria is limited and inconsistent compared to that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) , and [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) . Unlike the aforementioned substances, mental euphoria on psychedelics is "unforced", meaning it requires a pre-existing positive emotional state.
- **[Euthymia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euthymia)** - This effect manifests itself acutely for all classical psychedelics when one to three doses are combined with a psychotherapy treatment program. When comparing meta analyses, psychedelic psychotherapy greatly outperforms "gold standard" treatments for several mental health problems.
- **[Introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection)** - Present at most doses. May occur alongside personal bias suppression.
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)** - The user may feel they have the ability to analyze their lives or relationships in a more objective way. It is not clear if this is actually the case, or just a feeling generated by the substance.
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)** - LSD is well-known for its ability to enhance creativity and out-of-the-box thinking. A large number of artists, musicians, scientists, and other intellectuals have used it, dating to the 1950s.
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)** - Very prominent on LSD compared to other substances.
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - Occurs mostly on low or [threshold](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage#Threshold) dosages and feels less forced or sharp than it does with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) .
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)** - Very prominent on LSD compared to other substances, second only to dissociative immersion enhancement.
- **[Personal meaning enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_meaning_enhancement)** - The user may feel as if their experience has special meaning, which may or may not last after the trip. Appears to depend on the user's [set and setting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) .
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)** - The user's ability to experience emotion may be strongly enhanced. This is thought to contribute to its therapeutic effect. Consequently, it is advised to not take LSD when in a low or unstable mood and to follow the principles of [set and setting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) .
- **[Empathy, affection and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection_and_sociability_enhancement)** - Can be prominent but also unreliable compared to MDMA. More dose-dependent; higher doses are more likely to cause introspection and social withdrawal.
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)** - Mild delusions can occur at common doses. Serious, persisting delusions are typically limited to higher doses or individual susceptibility.
- **[Déjà vu](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)** - Unreliable and usually at higher doses. May indicate an overdose and the beginning of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** - Generally inconsistent compared to [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) and [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) . Mild to moderate when it does occur.
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)** - Extremely prominent for many users. Likely a part of its therapeutic effect. Sublime or mystical experiences on LSD are often linked to music.
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)** - Very common on LSD, particularly during the come up and peak phases. Users report suddenly finding mundane situations and actions inexplicably hilarious. 
- **[Laughter fits](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Laughter_fits)** - Laughter fits are common, particularly during the [come up](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Duration#Come_up) phase. It can manifest as uncontrollable giggles and laughter that can form a feedback loop if around others who are also under the influence.
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** - Present at all dose levels past low-common. Stronger than [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) like [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) but weaker than tryptamines like [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . 
- **[Ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss)** - A signature effect. May be accompanied by [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) or [dysphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysphoria) depending on [set and setting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) . Also accompanied by [time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion) and potentially [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) .
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)** - LSD produces stimulant-like motivation enhancement at low and microdoses, although in a much less prominent or reliable manner.
- **[Multiple thought streams](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Multiple_thought_streams)**
- **[Ego replacement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_replacement)** - Ego replacement is very rare and occurs in an unpredictable manner. This effect usually coincides with [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and may indicate the beginnings of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . It is more likely to occur with high doses.
- **[Personality regression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personality_regression)** - True personality regression on LSD is very rare. More commonly, it takes the milder form of the user having strong feelings of early childhood, including repressed memories.
- **[Simultaneous emotions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Simultaneous_emotions)**
- **[Suggestibility enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Suggestibility_enhancement)** - Suggestibility to external influences may be strongly enhanced. While potentially beneficial for psychotherapy, this property can be abused by nefarious individuals (e.g. cult leaders). Users are advised to be discerning about who they take LSD with.
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)** - A signature effect. Thoughts may feel more fluid and interconnected than usual. May occur alongside [conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking) and [creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement) .
- **[Thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops)** - Typically occurs at higher doses, and at the peak of the experience. Often accompanied by [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) . This effect may become exacerbated or triggered by cannabis or stimulants.
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - A signature effect. The user's perception of time may be strongly altered. Typically takes the form of time dilation, or the experience of time slowing down and passing much slower than it does while sober.
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** - Users report that it is difficult or impossible to go to sleep for up to 10 hours (or more) after LSD ingestion.
- **[Addiction suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Addiction_suppression)** - Some research suggests LSD can be used to treat addiction. Anecdotally, many users report that psychedelics are helpful for this purpose. ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)** - Some users report an enhanced sense of hearing on LSD. However, there is currently no clinical evidence supporting this claim.
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)** - Sounds may appear "tinny" or "alien". More likely at higher doses. Certain subjective reports mention *flanging, delays/echoing, reverb* -like effects, similar to those found in music.
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** - Typically present at higher doses. Not as common as visual hallucinations, but may occur alongside them. ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - True synesthesia is rare and non-reproducible, although users often describe the feeling of being able to "hear colors" and "see sounds". Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of occurrence, but seems to primarily occur in those who are already predisposed to synesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- Transpersonal states are frequently reported at common to high doses of LSD. They appear to be stronger than most phenethylamines (e.g. [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) ) but weaker than tryptamines (e.g. [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) , [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) ). Strongly dependent on [set and setting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) . 
- **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Spirituality enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spirituality_enhancement)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
### Combination effects

- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects can be used to reduce some of the [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) and [muscle tension](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_tension) produced by LSD. However, alcohol can also cause [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) , [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , and [physical fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue) , which can negatively impact the user's mindset (set). Users are advised to pace themselves and drink only a portion of their usual amount if drinking on LSD.
- **[Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines)** - Benzodiazepines are highly effective at reducing the intensity of LSD's cognitive and visual effects via inhibition of brain electrical activity.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - LSD enhances the cognitive, visual and general hallucinatory effects of dissociatives. Dissociative-induced [holes, spaces, and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids) and [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) become more vivid and intense on LSD. These effects correspond with an increased risk of [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - LSD synergistically enhances the physical, cognitive, and visual effects of MDMA. The synergy between these substances is unpredictable and so it is advised to start with markedly lower doses than one would take for either individually. There is some evidence that suggests LSD can increase the neurotoxicity of MDMA.
- **[Antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressants)** and **[antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics)** may block the effect of LSD by acting on the same receptors and outcompeting its ability to bind. Antidepressants [mirtazapine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mirtazapine) and [trazodone](/w/index.php?title=Trazodone&action=edit&redlink=1) act on the 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C receptors where they block serotonin and other molecules from binding. Atypical antipsychotics also act on these receptors in order to decrease hallucinations and cognitive distortion.

## Forms

LSD is typically distributed in various forms for [oral](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Oral) or [sublingual](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sublingual) administration, with blotter paper being the most common:

- **Blotters** are typically small squares pulled off sheets of perforated blotting paper that have been dipped into an LSD & alcohol solution. These squares may be swallowed, chewed, or held sublingually. *Note: chewing blotters should not result in a bitter metallic taste as this can indicate the presence of a [25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) or [DOx](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOx) compound ( [see here](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD#Toxicity_and_harm_potential.23Mimics_.28.22Fake_acid.22.29) for more information).*
- **Liquid solutions** are often found in vials with a pipette. This form is often dropped directly into the mouth or tongue. It may also be dropped onto individual sugar cubes or candy before consumption.
- **Tablets** & **microdots** are very small tablets which can be chewed or swallowed.
- **Powder** can, in theory, be administered orally, sublingually, or via insufflation or injection. However, LSD is rarely encountered or taken in this way in practice due to its incredible potency. It is almost always diluted into a liquid solution or 'laid' onto blotter paper to allow for more accurate and consistent dosing.
- **Gel tabs** can be taken orally and are small pieces of gelatin which contain LSD. These are less common now than in the past, but are still occasionally present in some areas of the world.

- Blotters
- Liquid solution
- Microdots
- Gel tabs

## Research

### Alcoholism

Some studies in the 1960s that investigated LSD as a treatment for alcoholism found reduced levels of alcohol misuse in almost 60% of those treated, an effect which lasted six months but disappeared after a year.

A 2012 meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials found evidence that a single dose of LSD in conjunction with various alcoholism treatment programs was associated with a decrease in alcohol abuse, lasting for several months.

LSD is also sometimes self-administered in a non-medical environment for overcoming addiction.

### Trauma-related pain

LSD was studied in the 1960s by Eric Kast as an [analgesic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analgesic) for acute and chronic pain caused by cancer or other major trauma. Even at low (i.e. sub-psychedelic) dosages, it was found to be at least as effective as traditional [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) , while being much longer lasting in pain reduction (lasting as long as a week after peak effects had subsided).

Kast attributed this effect to a decrease in [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) ; that is to say that patients were not experiencing *less* pain, but rather were *less distressed by* the pain they experienced. This purported effect is being tested using a similar psychedelic substance, in an ongoing (as of 2006) study of the effects of [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) on [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) in terminal cancer patients. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

### Cluster headaches

LSD has been used as a treatment for cluster headaches, an uncommon but extremely painful disorder.

Although the phenomenon has not been fully investigated, case reports suggest that LSD and [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) can reduce cluster pain and also interrupt the cluster-headache cycle, preventing future headaches from occurring. Currently existing treatments include various tryptamines among other chemicals, so LSD's efficacy in this regard may not be surprising.

A dose-response study testing the effectiveness of both LSD and psilocin was planned at McLean Hospital, although the current status of this project is unclear. A 2006 study by McLean researchers interviewed 53 cluster headache sufferers who treated themselves with either LSD or [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , finding that a majority of users of either drug reported beneficial effects.

Unlike the use of LSD or [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) in psychotherapy, this research involves non-psychological effects and often sub-psychedelic dosages.

### End-of-life anxiety

From 2008 to 2011 there was ongoing research in Switzerland into using LSD to alleviate anxiety for terminally ill cancer patients coping with their impending deaths. Preliminary results of the study are promising, and no negative effects have been reported.

### Neuroplasticity

A 2018 study demonstrated neuroplasticity induced by LSD and other psychedelics through TrkB, mTOR, and [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-HT2A_receptor) signaling.

## Reagent results

Exposing compounds to the reagents gives a colour change which is indicative of the compound under test.

## Toxicity and harm potential

Numerous studies have found that LSD is physiologically well-tolerated and has an extremely low toxicity relative to dose. There is no evidence for long-lasting effects on the brain or other organs and there are no documented deaths attributed to the direct effects of LSD toxicity.

However, it is worth noting that while LSD as a chemical may not be capable of causing direct bodily toxicity or death, its improper use can still present serious hazards.

For example, it has the potential to strongly impair the user's judgment and attention span, which may promote erratic or dangerous behaviors. In extreme cases, the user may experience powerful [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) e.g. that they are currently inside of a dream and therefore physically invincible, or that they are being persecuted by malevolent entities. This may prompt them to jump off of a building or a cliff, or run into oncoming traffic.

Additionally, extreme negative reactions and psychotic episodes (i.e. ["bad trips"](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trips) ) can cause lasting psychological trauma if not properly managed or treated afterward. Extreme negative reactions are uncommon, but are more likely to happen in non- [supervised settings](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Trip_sitter) and/or with higher doses (i.e. exceeding the "common" range).

Finally, it should be noted that evidence of LSD's effectiveness as a mental health treatment only applies to the controlled procedures used in clinical settings. LSD alone is not considered the treatment because the current evidence suggests it must be combined with professional psychotherapy to produce lasting therapeutic effects.

Without the appropriate safeguards, attempts at self-medicating with LSD may actually worsen mental health issues.

**It is strongly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) if using this substance. These include:**

- Taking the substance under the supervision of a [tripsitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tripsitter) for one's first time or while experimenting with a higher dose
- Starting off with a dose in the low-common range and monitoring for unusual reactions (e.g. [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) ) or sensitivity
- Not exceeding the listed [heavy dose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy_dose) . If heavy doses are required, a tolerance break is advised instead. Heavy doses greatly increase the risk of negative effects
- Using a [reagent testing kit](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reagent_testing_kit) to verify the substance is genuine LSD and not a dangerous counterfeit
- Keeping a supply of [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) (e.g. *[Seroquel](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seroquel)* ) to abort the trip in the case of overwhelming anxiety or psychosis

### Psychosis and mental disorder risk

LSD can exacerbate symptoms (e.g. [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) , [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) ) of various mental disorders. Specifically, **it can precipitate the early onset of schizophrenia in vulnerable individuals.**

Those with a personal or family history of mental disorders, particularly psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, should not use LSD without consulting a qualified medical professional.

### Dependence and abuse potential

Like other [serotonergic psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelics) , LSD is considered to be non-addictive with a low abuse potential. Notably, there are no literature reports of successful attempts to train animals to self-administer a serotonergic psychedelic, which is predictive of abuse liability, indicating that it does not have the necessary pharmacology to either initiate or maintain dependence. Additionally, there is no human clinical evidence that LSD can cause addiction.

There is virtually no withdrawal syndrome when chronic use is stopped. In one study, morphine addicts administered LSD regularly for weeks did not recognize when the drug was exchanged for a placebo and experienced no withdrawal symptoms.

#### Tolerance

LSD exhibits significant [tachyphylaxis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tachyphylaxis) ; i.e., tolerance to its effects forms almost immediately after ingestion; i.e., in as little as three hours. Human studies from the 1950s and 60s, when LSD was still legal in the United States, found that tolerance to LSD's effects "requires 3-4 days of daily administration to reach near-maximum levels and 5 days of abstinence to completely reverse."

Some anecdotal reports suggest that extremely high doses of LSD can produce a tolerance that can last subsequently longer, anywhere from weeks to months, and that high doses of LSD, along with high tolerances, can produce unusual variations in LSD's intensity, duration, and effects.

LSD also exhibits cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , meaning that after the use of LSD, all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Overdose

Unlike other highly prohibited psychoactive substances, LSD has no known toxic dose; it is effectively impossible to physically overdose on. However, higher doses increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions such as [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and, in rare cases, [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) .

Medical attention is usually not needed except in the case of severe psychotic episodes or the suspected ingestion of so-called "fake acid", substances that mimics LSD's effects but carry the risk of physical toxicity and overdose (e.g. [25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) or [DOx](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOx) ).

[Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) (e.g. [diazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diazepam) ( *Valium* ), [alprazolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alprazolam) ( *Xanax* )) can help to relieve the acute negative psychological effects of LSD. [Antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) such as [quetiapine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Quetiapine) ( *Seroquel* ) may also be used, although they have more after-effects and potential interactions. [Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) can also be used as a last resort, but is generally considered to be less effective than other tripkillers, and is sometimes associated with negative interactions.

### Mimics ("Fake acid")

The high chemical potency allows LSD to be infused ("laid") onto blotter paper for street distribution. It is sometimes counterfeited by certain other [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) that also happen to be potent enough to be laid onto blotter paper (while also being cheaper). Colloquially known as "fake acid" or "bunk acid", the most common adulterant historically is the [DOx](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOx) series, although in recent years the [25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) series has become highly prevalent.

Unlike unadulterated LSD blotters, which are usually only mildly bitter or slightly metallic as a byproduct of the blotter paper's ink, mimics are described as having a "metallic", "numbing", "chemical-like", or "extremely bitter or sour" taste. It is advised to immediately spit out any blotters that have a strong bitter taste that exceeds a reasonable level.

However, it is important to note that taste testing is not sufficient to fully protect against mimics. Instead, one should always attempt to test their LSD using a [reagent test kit](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use#Reagent_testing_kit) . Testing kits are considered vital because the common mimics have significantly worse safety profiles than LSD, including the risk of physical overdose and death. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

### Hallucinogen-perception persisting disorder (HPPD)

In rare cases, LSD may trigger [hallucinogen persisting perception disorder](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogen_persisting_perception_disorder) (HPPD) in some individuals. The cause is unclear; however, explanations in terms of LSD physically remaining in the body for months or years after consumption have been discounted by experimental evidence.

Some say HPPD is a manifestation of post-traumatic stress disorder, not related to the direct action of LSD on brain chemistry, and varies according to the susceptibility of the individual to the disorder.

### Interactions

#### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Lithium** : Lithium is commonly prescribed in the treatment of bipolar disorder; however, there is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with psychedelics can significantly increase the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination should be **strictly avoided** .
- **Tricyclic antidepressants** : Tricyclic antidepressants increase physical, hallucinatory and psychological responses to LSD. Anecdotal evidence suggests that TCAs increase the risk of [bad trips](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trips) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) when combined with LSD. Since the symptoms are similar to those induced by lithium and LSD, [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) cannot be excluded. Therefore, this combination should be avoided.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** : Tramadol is well documented to lower the seizure threshold in individuals and LSD also has the potential to induce seizures in susceptible individuals.
- **Ritonavir** : Severe vascular constriction has happened when taking [ergolines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ergoline_derivative) in combination with ritonavir. Because it is not known if this extends to LSD, utmost caution is advised.
- **[Deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriants)** (e.g. ***[diphenhydramine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diphenhydramine) , [scopolamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scopolamine)*** ): Deliriants should generally not be combined with other substances, but may have additional risks when taken with psychedelics. May increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) , [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** : Cannabis has a strong, volatile synergy with LSD. While often used to intensify or prolong LSD's effects, the combination increases the risk of adverse psychological effects like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Anecdotal reports often describe cannabis use as the triggering event for a [bad trip](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trip) or [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Caution is advised.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** (e.g. ***[amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) , [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate)*** ): While able to intensify LSD's [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) effects, stimulants also elevate [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) levels and increase the risk of [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , particularly during the [comedown](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Comedown) phase. This risk may be higher than with other psychedelics due to LSD's direct effect on [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) pathways. This combination is generally discouraged.

#### Other interactions

- [SSRIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/SSRI) (e.g. [fluoxetine](/w/index.php?title=Fluoxetine&action=edit&redlink=1) , [sertraline](/w/index.php?title=Sertraline&action=edit&redlink=1) ): Due do the downregulation of 5-HT 2A receptors caused by SSRIs, psychedelics can have a reduced effect. Weaker effects could lead to the user compensating by increasing their dose or re-dosing, potentially having stronger effects than they intended. SSRIs can also reduce the chance of having a [bad trip](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trip) due to its [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) effects.

## Notable individuals

Some notable individuals have commented publicly on their experiences with LSD. Some of these comments date from the era when it was legally available in the US and Europe for non-medical uses, and others pertain to psychiatric treatment in the 1950s and 1960s. Still others describe experiences with illegal LSD, obtained for philosophic, artistic, therapeutic, spiritual, or recreational purposes.

- **Aldous Huxley** , author of *Brave New World* , became a user of psychedelics after moving to Hollywood. He was at the forefront of the counterculture's use of psychedelics, which led to his 1954 work *The Doors of Perception* . Dying from cancer, he asked his wife on 22 November 1963 to inject him with 100 µg of LSD.
- **Ernst Jünger** , German writer and philosopher, throughout his life had experimented with substances such as [ether](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diethyl_ether) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) , and [hashish](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hashish) ; and later in life he used [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) and LSD . These experiments were recorded comprehensively in *Annäherungen* (1970, *Approaches* ). The novel *Visit to Godenholm|Besuch auf Godenholm* (1952, *Visit to Godenholm* ) is clearly influenced by his early experiments with mescaline and LSD. He met with LSD inventor Albert Hofmann and they took LSD together several times. He is the inventor of the term " [psychonaut](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychonaut) ".

- **Jerry Garcia** stated in a July 3, 1989 interview, in response to the question "Have your feelings about LSD changed over the years?," "They haven't changed much. My feelings about LSD are mixed. It's something that I both fear and that I love at the same time. I never take any psychedelic, have a psychedelic experience, without having that feeling of, "I don't know what's going to happen." In that sense, it's still fundamentally an enigma and a mystery."

- **Kary Mullis** is reported to credit LSD with helping him develop DNA amplification technology, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993.

- **Oliver Sacks** , a neurologist famous for writing best-selling case histories about his patients' disorders and unusual experiences, talks about his own experiences with LSD and other perception altering chemicals, in his book, *Hallucinations* .

- **Paul McCartney** said that The Beatles' songs "Day Tripper" and "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" were inspired by LSD trips. Nonetheless, John Lennon consistently stated over the course of many years that the fact that the initials of "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" spelled out L-S-D was a coincidence (the title came from a picture drawn by his son Julian) and that the band members did not notice until after the song had been released, and Paul McCartney corroborated that story. John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr also used the substance, although McCartney cautioned that "it's easy to overestimate the influence of drugs on the Beatles' music."

- **Richard Feynman** , a notable physicist at California Institute of Technology, tried LSD during his professorship at Caltech. Feynman largely sidestepped the issue when dictating his anecdotes; he mentions it in passing in the "O Americano, Outra Vez" section.

- **Steve Jobs** , co-founder and former CEO of Apple Inc., said, "Taking LSD was a profound experience, one of the most important things in my life."

- **W. H. Auden** , the poet, said, "I myself have taken mescaline once and LSD once. Aside from a slight schizophrenic dissociation of the I from the Not-I, including my body, nothing happened at all." He also said, "LSD was a complete frost. … What it does seem to destroy is the power of communication. I have listened to tapes done by highly articulate people under LSD, for example, and they talk absolute drivel. They may have seen something interesting, but they certainly lose either the power or the wish to communicate."

## Effects
The effect is very much dependent on dose, set and setting. As a hallucinogen, LSD intensifies and alienates sensory perceptions and the sense of space-time. Mood and feelings can change abruptly. At higher doses, feelings of detachment from one's own body can occur. Especially in the initial phase of the trip, slight breathing difficulties, palpitations, sweating, altered blood pressure and nausea may occur.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
The risks of LSD use are psychological and depend on the personality structure of the user. The perceptual changes during a trip can be so intense that inexperienced users in particular feel overwhelmed by the flood of impressions. This can lead to erroneous reactions, loss of orientation, panic, paranoia and badtrips/horror trips.
There is a risk - even with single use - that latent (hidden) mental disorders can be triggered. LSD does not lead to organ damage or genetic mutations and is not physically addictive.

## Safer Use
- Take LSD only if you are well prepared, in an environment where you feel comfortable, and only with experienced friends (favourable setting).
- Only take LSD when you feel good mentally and physically (cheap set).
- You should not be afraid, but have enough respect for the LSD effect.
- Do not consume LSD on a full stomach, but eat something light before or during the high.
- Dose low. Don't throw it if it doesn't work right away!
- Let yourself go during the trip, don't try to fight the LSD effect.
- Dextrose can help against circulatory problems.
- Avoid roads and other "dangerous" places, your orientation may be disturbed.
- At least the day after the trip, allow yourself plenty of rest and recovery to be able to process the experience.
- LSD trips should remain exceptional experiences and should in no case be experienced more than once a month.
- People with mental problems or illnesses, people taking neuroleptics and people with circulatory and heart problems should refrain from consuming LSD.

## Adulterants & Extenders

For the effect of LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), apart from the dose, one's own state of mind (set) and the environment (setting) are always very decisive. When consuming LSD felts, there is a risk of ingesting misdeclared substances, pharmacologically active extenders and/or high-dose felts. The highly variable active substance content of LSD felts can lead to the unintentional ingestion of high doses of LSD, which increase the risk of a negative experience (bad trip). High doses increase the risk even for experienced users. Highly intense psychedelic experiences can be induced, which can be disturbing and frightening. In recent years, we have repeatedly analysed misdeclared LSD felts (felts containing another psychoactive substance instead of LSD). Depending on the substance, such misdeclarations pose a high health risk.

### Common Adulterants

**NBOMe connections**
NBOMe compounds belong to the group of phenethylamines. Typical for phenylethylamines is an increased perception of digestion and the intestine (gastrointestinal sensation) as well as a strongly sensitised sense of touch. Visual effects occur, but are less prominent than with LSD. According to user reports, the effects of 25l-NBOMe*HCl, 25B-NBOMe*HCl and 25C-NBOMe*HCl vary from time to time, so the effect cannot be predicted. Unlike LSD, felts with NBOMe have a bitter taste.

**DOC**
Only little information exists on DOC / 2,5-dimethoxy-4-chloroamphetamine. However, DOC can lead to chest pain and vasoconstriction. Due to the late onset of action, there is a risk of overdose. The very long duration of action of approx. 20 h should definitely be taken into account.

**Lysergic acid diethylamide**, abbreviated LSD or LSD-25, also known as lysergide (INN) and colloquially as **acid**, is a semisynthetic psychedelic drug of the ergoline family, well known for its psychological effects which can include altered thinking processes, closed and open-eyed visuals, synesthesia, an altered sense of time and spiritual experiences, as well as for its key role in 1960s counterculture. It is used mainly as an entheogen, recreational drug, and as an agent in psychedelic therapy. LSD is non-addictive, is not known to cause brain damage, and has extremely low toxicity relative to dose. However, acute adverse psychiatric reactions such as anxiety, paranoia, and delusions are possible.
LSD is the best known and most researched psychedelic. It is the standard against which all other psychedelics are compared. It is active at extremely low doses and is most commonly available on blotter or in liquid form. 

## History

First synthesized by Albert Hofmann on November 16, 1938, LSD went on to become a staple of the psychedelic world and the centerpiece of the 1960s counterculture.
On April 19, 1943, Hofmann returned to investigate LSD further and ingested 250 micrograms of LSD. Hofmann believed this dose to have a minuscule, threshold effect. He rode his bicycle home and later wrote that, "... little by little I could begin to enjoy the unprecedented colors and plays of shapes that persisted behind my closed eyes. Kaleidoscopic, fantastic images surged in on me, alternating, variegated, opening and then closing themselves in circles and spirals, exploding in colored fountains, rearranging and hybridizing themselves in constant flux ..." This day in history later became known as Bicycle Day and is celebrated by LSD enthusiasts as the world's first LSD trip.

### After effects

User may feel "out of it" and generally off the day after, esp. with larger doses. Residual euphoria and a "ready to take on the world" feeling may persist. No bodily harm from recreational doses of LSD, though mental effects from long term chronic use can be negative in some people.

## Harm Reduction

LSD is regarded as being an extremely safe psychedelic, being almost impossible to overdose on. However, although extraordinarily uncommon, a few cases have been reported in the medical literature of dangerous overheating following ingestion of large amounts of LSD, including one non-fatal case that brought the patient's body temperature to over 106°F (41°C). LSD may also cause dangerous physiological and psychological reactions when used in conjunction with lithium or tricyclic antidepressants.

See [Psychedelic Harm Reduction](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Psychedelics#Harm_Reduction) for general information.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

Chemical name: 9,10-Didehydro-N,N-diethyl-6-methylergoline-8ß-carboxamide

The mental effects of LSD can be rapidly reversed by the IM administration of 50 mg chlorpromazine.

### LD50

The LD50 has not been determined, but some estimates suggest doses higher than 10mg (10,000 µg) may be fatal

### Reactivity

Stable for moderate periods of time under normal temperatures and pressures. Thermal decomposition products of LSD when stored in massive quantities may include dangerous amounts of toxic oxides, carbon, and nitrogen. Long-term storage of LSD should be done by limiting exposure to heat, light, and air; eg. wrapped in aluminium foil, vacuum sealed, and placed in a freezer or refrigerator.

### Polymerization

Hazardous polymerization has not been reported to occur under normal temperatures and pressures.

## Legal status

LSD is illegal to possess for recreational purposes in most nations. This includes the US, Canada, Mexico, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, New Zealand, Australia, Norway, Portugal, Russia, UK, and Brazil.

Some exceptions are made in nations where it is used in legitimate research, such as Russia. A license is required.

Lysergic acid diethylamide, commonly known as LSD (from German Lysergsäurediethylamid) and by the slang names acid and lucy, is a semisynthetic hallucinogenic drug derived from ergot, known for its powerful psychological effects and serotonergic activity. It was historically used in psychiatry and 1960s counterculture; it is currently legally restricted but experiencing renewed scientific interest and increasing use.
When taken orally, LSD has an onset of action within 0.4 to 1.0 hours (range: 0.1–1.8 hours) and a duration of effect lasting 7 to 12 hours (range: 4–22 hours). It is commonly administered via tabs of blotter paper. LSD is extremely potent, with noticeable effects at doses as low as 20 micrograms and is sometimes taken in much smaller amounts for microdosing. Despite widespread use, no fatal human overdoses have been documented. LSD is mainly used recreationally or for spiritual purposes. LSD can cause mystical experiences. LSD exerts its effects primarily through high-affinity binding to several serotonin receptors, especially 5-HT2A, and to a lesser extent dopaminergic and adrenergic receptors. LSD reduces oscillatory power in the brain's default mode network and flattens brain hierarchy. At higher doses, it can induce visual and auditory hallucinations, ego dissolution, and anxiety. LSD use can cause adverse psychological effects such as paranoia and delusions and may lead to persistent visual disturbances known as hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD).
Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann first synthesized LSD in 1938 and discovered its powerful psychedelic effects in 1943 after accidental ingestion. It became widely studied in the 1950s and 1960s. It was initially explored for psychiatric use due to its structural similarity to serotonin and safety profile. It was used experimentally in psychiatry for treating alcoholism and schizophrenia. By the mid-1960s, LSD became central to the youth counterculture in places like San Francisco and London, influencing art, music, and social movements through events like Acid Tests and figures such as Owsley Stanley and Michael Hollingshead. Its psychedelic effects inspired distinct visual art styles, music innovations, and caused a lasting cultural impact. However, its association with the counterculture movement of the 1960s led to its classification as a Schedule I drug in the U.S. in 1970. It was also listed as a Schedule I controlled substance by the United Nations in 1971 and remains without approved medical uses.
Despite its legal restrictions, LSD remains influential in scientific and cultural contexts. Research on LSD declined due to cultural controversies by the 1960s, but has resurged since 2009. In 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration designated a form of LSD (MM120) a breakthrough therapy for generalized anxiety disorder. As of 2017, about 10% of people in the U.S. had used LSD at some point, with 0.7% having used it in the past year. Usage rates have risen, with a 56.4% increase in adult use in the U.S. from 2015 to 2018.

## Uses

### Recreational

LSD is commonly used as a recreational drug for its psychedelic effects.

### Spiritual

LSD can catalyze intense spiritual experiences and is thus considered an entheogen. Some users have reported out of body experiences. In 1966, Timothy Leary established the League for Spiritual Discovery with LSD as its sacrament. Stanislav Grof has written that religious and mystical experiences observed during LSD sessions appear similar to descriptions in sacred scriptures of great religions of the world and the texts of ancient civilizations.

### Medical

A meta analysis concluded that a single dose was shown to be effective at reducing alcohol consumption in people suffering from alcoholism. LSD has also been studied in depression, anxiety, and drug dependence, with positive preliminary results.
Despite these results, LSD currently has no legally approved uses in medicine.

### Dosing

LSD is an extraordinarily potent substance, and is one of the most potent psychoactive drugs known. This means that it produces its pharmacological effects at very small doses, with its dose range measured in micrograms (μg); that is, millionths of a gram. Noticeable effects can occur with doses of LSD as low as 20 μg, which is around 1/200th the mass of a grain of sand. LSD is approximately 200 times as potent as psilocybin and 5,000 times as potent as mescaline, meaning that it produces effects of similar magnitude at 1/200 and 1/5,000 times the respective doses.
The usual dose range of LSD for psychedelic effects is 20 to 200 μg. The typical intermediate and "good effect" dose for a psychedelic experience is 100 μg (range 75–150 μg, while 20 to 50 μg is a low or "minidose" and 200 μg is a high or ego-dissolution dose. A dose range as wide as 10 to 450 μg has been reported. LSD may also be used in microdosing. In this context, it may be used at subthreshold or microdoses of less than 10 μg.
The doses of LSD present in illicit LSD samples have decreased over time. In the mid-1960s, Owsley Stanley, the most important black market LSD manufacturer in the United States, distributed LSD at a standard concentration of 270 μg, while street samples of the 1970s contained 30 to 300 μg. By the 1980s, the amount had reduced to between 100 and 125 μg, dropping more in the 1990s to the 20 to 80 μg range, and even further in the 2000s.

## Effects

LSD produces a variety of physical, psychological, and sensory effects.

### Psychological

The primary immediate psychological effects of LSD are visual pseudo-hallucinations and altered thought, often referred to as "trips". These sensory alterations are considered pseudohallucinations because the subject does not perceive the patterns seen as being located in three-dimensional space outside the body. LSD is not considered addictive. An "afterglow" effect, characterized by an improved mood or perceived mental state, may persist for days or weeks following ingestion. Positive experiences, or "good trips", are described as intensely pleasurable and can include feelings of joy, euphoria, an increased appreciation for life, decreased anxiety, a sense of spiritual enlightenment, and a feeling of interconnectedness with the universe.
Negative experiences, commonly known as "bad trips", can induce feelings of fear, agitation, anxiety, panic, and paranoia. While the occurrence of a bad trip is unpredictable, factors such as mood, surroundings, sleep, hydration, and social setting, collectively referred to as "set and setting", can influence the risk and are considered important in minimizing the likelihood of a negative experience.
Alexander Shulgin did not include experience reports of LSD in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved) due to the thousands of reports that already existed in the literature.
Uniquely among psychedelics, LSD appears to have two temporally and qualitatively distinct phases of psychoactive effects. These include an initial psychedelic phase associated with serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonism and a subsequent paranoia- and psychosis-like phase associated with dopamine D2-like receptor agonism. The first phase is described as a "psychedelic experience", with "meaningfulness and portentousness" as the primary effects, while the latter phase is "clearly a paranoid state", including feeling "at the least self-centered, and usually suspicious, with ideas of reference or even paranoid convictions". The second phase typically develops about 4 to 6 hours after administration but at times up to 10 hours after administration. Parallels have been drawn between this phase and amphetamine psychosis. There is no indication that similar effects occur with other psychedelics like phenethylamines and simple tryptamines, which lack dopamine receptor agonism. The preceding findings have been described by researchers like Daniel X. Freedman and David E. Nichols.

### Sensory

LSD induces an animated sensory experience affecting senses, emotions, memories, time, and awareness. The effects range from subtle perceptual changes to profound cognitive shifts. Alterations in auditory and visual perception are common.
Users may experience enhanced visual phenomena, such as vibrant colors, objects appearing to morph, ripple or move, and geometric patterns on various surfaces. Changes in the perception of food's texture and taste are also noted, sometimes leading to aversion towards certain foods.
There are reports of inanimate objects appearing animated, with static objects seeming to move in additional spatial dimensions. The auditory effects of LSD may include echo-like distortions of sounds, and an intensified experience of music. Basic visual effects often resemble phosphenes and can be influenced by concentration, thoughts, emotions, or music. Higher doses can lead to more intense sensory perception alterations, including synesthesia, perception of additional dimensions, and temporary dissociation.

### Physical

LSD can induce physical effects such as pupil dilation, decreased appetite, increased sweating, and wakefulness. The physical reactions to LSD vary greatly and some may be a result of its psychological effects. Commonly observed symptoms include increased body temperature, blood sugar, and heart rate, as well as goose bumps, jaw clenching, dry mouth, and hyperreflexia. In cases of adverse reactions, users may experience numbness, weakness, nausea, and tremors.

### Onset and duration

The psychoactive effects of LSD last on average between 7 and 11 hours, with a possible range of 4 to 22 hours. Higher doses tend to lead to a longer duration of action. The onset of action when administered orally is 0.4 to 1.0 hours on average, with a possible range of 0.1 to 1.8 hours. The time to peak effects given orally is 2.2 to 2.8 hours on average, with a range of 1.3 to 6.5 hours.

## Adverse effects

LSD, a classical psychedelic, is deemed physiologically safe at standard doses (50–200 μg) and its primary risks lie in psychological effects rather than physiological harm. A 2010 study by David Nutt ranked LSD as significantly less harmful than alcohol, placing it near the bottom of a list assessing the harm of 20 drugs.

### Psychological effects

#### Mental disorders

LSD can induce panic attacks or extreme anxiety, colloquially termed a "bad trip". Despite lower rates of depression and substance abuse found in psychedelic drug users compared to controls, LSD presents heightened risks for individuals with severe mental illnesses like schizophrenia. These hallucinogens can catalyze psychiatric disorders in predisposed individuals, although they do not tend to induce illness in emotionally healthy people.

#### Suggestibility

While research from the 1960s indicated increased suggestibility under the influence of LSD among both mentally ill and healthy individuals, recent documents suggest that the CIA and Department of Defense have discontinued research into LSD as a means of mind control.

#### Flashbacks

Flashbacks are psychological episodes where individuals re-experience some of LSD's subjective effects after the drug has worn off, persisting for days or months post-hallucinogen use. These experiences are associated with hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD), where flashbacks occur intermittently or chronically, causing distress or functional impairment.
The etiology of flashbacks is varied. Some cases are attributed to somatic symptom disorder, where individuals fixate on normal somatic experiences previously unnoticed prior to drug consumption. Other instances are linked to associative reactions to contextual cues, similar to responses observed in individuals with past trauma or emotional experiences. The risk factors for flashbacks remain unclear, but pre-existing psychopathologies may be significant contributors.
Estimating the prevalence of HPPD is challenging. It is considered rare, with occurrences ranging from 1 in 20 users experiencing the transient and less severe type 1 HPPD, to 1 in 50,000 for the more concerning type 2 HPPD. Contrary to internet rumors, LSD is not stored long-term in the spinal cord or other parts of the body. Pharmacological evidence indicates LSD has a half-life of 175 minutes and is metabolized into water-soluble compounds like 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD, eliminated through urine without evidence of long-term storage. Clinical evidence also suggests that chronic use of SSRIs can potentiate LSD-induced flashbacks, even months after stopping LSD use.

### Tolerance

LSD shows significant tachyphylaxis, with tolerance developing 24 hours after administration. The progression of tolerance at intervals shorter than 24 hours remains largely unknown. Tolerance typically resets to baseline after 3–4 days of abstinence. Significant cross-tolerance occurs between LSD, mescaline and psilocybin. A slight cross-tolerance to DMT is observed in humans highly tolerant to LSD. Tolerance to LSD also builds up with consistent use, and is believed to result from serotonin 5-HT2A receptor downregulation. Researchers believe that tolerance returns to baseline after two weeks of not using psychedelics.

### Addiction and dependence liability

LSD is widely considered to be non-addictive, despite its potential for abuse. Attempts to train laboratory animals to self-administer LSD have been largely unsuccessful. Although tolerance to LSD builds up rapidly, a withdrawal syndrome does not appear, suggesting that a potential syndrome does not necessarily relate to the possibility of acquiring rapid tolerance to a substance. A report examining substance use disorder for DSM-IV noted that almost no hallucinogens produced dependence, unlike psychoactive drugs of other classes such as stimulants and depressants.

### Cancer and pregnancy

The mutagenic potential of LSD is unclear. Overall, the evidence seems to point to limited or no effect at commonly used doses. Studies showed no evidence of teratogenic or mutagenic effects.

### Long-term effects

A potential risk of frequent repeated long-term use of LSD and other serotonergic psychedelics is cardiac fibrosis and valvulopathy due to serotonin 5-HT2B receptor agonism. This may also be the case with microdosing. However, the risks are theoretical, and more research is needed to see if these complications can actually occur with psychedelics. A preliminary animal study found that chronic microdosing of LSD did not result in heart structure changes or valvulopathy in rodents. Research appears to be mixed on whether LSD is a potent serotonin 5-HT2B receptor agonist or not, with some studies finding it to be essentially inactive.

## Interactions

Some psychedelics, including LSD, are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6. Concurrent use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), some of which are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, with LSD may heighten the risk of serotonin syndrome. Chronic usage of SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) is believed to diminish the subjective effects of psychedelics, likely due to 5-HT2A receptor downregulation or desensitization induced by elevated serotonin levels. Contrary to the preceding notions however, a clinical study found that administration of LSD to people taking paroxetine, an SSRI and strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, increased LSD exposure by about 1.5-fold, was well-tolerated, and did not modify the pleasant subjective effects or physiological effects of LSD, whereas negative effects of LSD, including "bad drug effect", anxiety, and nausea, were reduced. Similarly, a clinical study with LSD found that LSD levels were 75% higher in people with non-functional CYP2D6 (poor metabolizers) compared to those with functional CYP2D6. In contrast to certain other psychedelics, MAOIs do not inhibit the metabolism of or potentiate the effects of LSD and instead reduce its effects. Interactions between psychedelics and antipsychotics or anticonvulsants are not well-documented; however, co-use with mood stabilizers like lithium may induce seizures and dissociative effects, particularly in individuals with bipolar disorder. Lithium notably intensifies LSD reactions, potentially leading to acute comatose states when combined.

## Overdose

LSD at typical recreational doses (~50–250 μg) is considered to be very safe in terms of toxicity, with not a single toxicity-related death having been reported at such doses despite many millions of exposures. In addition, LSD is considered to be a relatively non-toxic drug in overdose. It is estimated, based on animal studies and human case reports, that the lethal dose of LSD in humans is approximately 100 mg, or about 1,000 times the usual recreational dose of 100 μg. There have been a handful of reported cases of fatal overdose with LSD as of 2024. However, critical review of the literature by David E. Nichols found that of five identified cases, one was not consistent with the effects of LSD but instead may have been another drug like 25I-NBOMe, two involved normal doses of LSD in individuals who were placed in maximal physical restraint (hogtied) by police followed by presumed positional asphyxia and fatal cardiovascular collapse (hogtying being a practice that is associated with accidental death generally), and two were associated with massive LSD overdose involving doses of possibly more than 300 mg. Besides death due to toxicity, LSD is associated rarely with death via suicide, accidents, or violent encounters due to induction of abnormal behavior.
In one well-known 1974 case series, 8 people accidentally insufflated two "lines" of nearly pure LSD powder that they thought were cocaine. The exact doses of LSD were unknown, but were considered to be massive. For context, a typical "line" of cocaine for insufflation is 50 to 100 mg. The individuals reported to the hospital within 10 to 15 minutes, with five of them comatose, three requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, and the conscious individuals experiencing severe hallucinogenic effects, among other toxic symptoms. All of them completely recovered within 12 hours and there were no deaths. A subsequent 2020 case similarly involved accidental insufflation of a confirmed 55 mg dose of LSD instead of cocaine, which was without adverse health consequences. In other reports, a 5 mg overdose of LSD produced severe nausea and vomiting along with severe behavioral disturbances, while a 10 mg overdose was also non-fatal.
Despite acting as non-selective serotonin receptor agonists, major psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin do not cause serotonin syndrome even with extreme overdose. This is thought to be due to the fact that they act as partial agonists of serotonin receptors like the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor relative to serotonin itself. Conversely, NBOMe psychedelics like 25I-NBOMe are more efficacious and have been uniquely associated with serotonin syndrome-like toxicity. A 2018 retrospective analysis of 3,554 LSD-only exposures reported to poison control centers in the United States between 2000 and 2016 found that serious toxicity was infrequent. Common adverse effects (2.4–42%) included agitation or irritability, tachycardia, hallucinations or delusions, confusion, pupil dilation, hypertension, drowsiness or lethargy, elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), nausea and vomiting, and others. Selected serious adverse effects included fever or hyperthermia in 3.8%, single seizure in 2.4%, coma in 1.4%, elevated creatinine in 1.4%, multiple seizures in 1.2%, rhabdomyolysis in 1.1%, respiratory depression in 0.9%, cardiac conduction disorder in 0.5%, and status epilepticus in 0.4%. There is a case report of severe neurological sequelae following a single typical recreational dose of LSD involving seizure and cardiorespiratory arrest. In general, psychedelics like LSD may rarely cause seizures in some individuals.
The median lethal dose (LD50) of LSD in animals varies and is 50 to 60 mg/kg in mice, 16.5 mg/kg in rats, and 0.3 mg/kg in rabbits all given by injection. A well-known 1962 instance of an elephant named Tusko given 297 mg (~0.1 mg/kg) LSD by intramuscular injection proved fatal. These findings suggest that elephants may be much more sensitive to LSD in overdose than humans and other species. However, this instance has been mired in criticism and controversy due to miscalculation of LSD dose and concomitant post-LSD administration of promazine and pentobarbital. The experiment was repeated in two elephants with similar doses of LSD in 1984 without incident.
Massive doses of LSD are largely managed by symptomatic treatments, and agitation can be addressed with benzodiazepines. Reassurance in a calm, safe environment is beneficial. Antipsychotics such as haloperidol are not recommended as they may have adverse effects. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal is of little use due to the rapid absorption of LSD, unless performed within 30 to 60 minutes of ingesting exceedingly huge amounts. Administration of anticoagulants, vasodilators, and sympatholytics may be useful for treating ergotism.

### LSD substitute overdose

Although LSD is relatively safe in overdose, 25-NB (NBOMe) psychedelics like 25I-NBOMe and 25B-NBOMe are often sold as "LSD" and are highly toxic in overdose, with many reported severe intoxications and deaths. Owing to their high potency analogous to LSD, these drugs are also regularly sold as "LSD" in blotter papers. Fatalities involved in NBOMe intoxication suggest that a significant number of individuals ingested the substance which they believed was LSD, and researchers report that "users familiar with LSD may have a false sense of security when ingesting NBOMe inadvertently". Researchers state that the alleged physiological toxicity of LSD is likely due to psychoactive substances other than LSD.
NBOMe compounds are reported to have a bitter taste, are not active orally, and are usually taken sublingually. When NBOMes are administered sublingually, numbness of the tongue and mouth followed by a metallic chemical taste was observed, and researchers describe this physical side effect as one of the main discriminants between NBOMe compounds and LSD. Despite its high potency, recreational doses of LSD have only produced low incidents of acute toxicity, but NBOMe compounds have extremely different safety profiles. Testing with Ehrlich's reagent gives a positive result for LSD and a negative result for NBOMe compounds.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

LSD is a serotonergic psychedelic and acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor modulator. It binds with high affinity to most of the serotonin receptors. The psychedelic effects of LSD are thought to be mediated specifically by activation of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. However, a role of other serotonin receptors and targets in the effects of LSD cannot be ruled out and may be considered likely. Uniquely among serotonergic psychedelics, LSD also shows potentially significant affinity for the dopamine receptors, albeit much lower than for most of the serotonin receptors.
LSD binds to most serotonin receptor subtypes except for the serotonin 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors. However, some of these serotonin receptors may not be affected at typical brain concentrations of LSD. In humans, recreational doses of LSD may affect 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT5A, and 5-HT6 receptors. Although not present in humans, 5-HT5B receptors found in rodents also have a high affinity for LSD. The psychedelic effects of LSD are attributed to activation of 5-HT2A receptors. Many but not all serotonin 5-HT2A agonists are psychedelics and serotonin 5-HT2A antagonists block the psychedelic activity of LSD. LSD exhibits pronounced functional selectivity or biased agonism at the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors in that it activates the signal transduction enzyme phospholipase A2 instead of activating the enzyme phospholipase C as the endogenous ligand serotonin does, among other differences.

Exactly how LSD produces its effects is unknown, but it is thought that it works by increasing glutamate release in the cerebral cortex and therefore excitation in this area, specifically in layer V. LSD, like many other drugs of recreational use, has been shown to activate DARPP-32-related pathways. The drug enhances dopamine D2 receptor protomer recognition and signaling of D2–5-HT2A receptor complexes, which may contribute to its psychotropic effects. LSD has been shown to have low affinity for H1 receptors, displaying antihistamine effects, although the significance of this at doses used in humans is unknown.
LSD is a biased agonist that induces a conformation in serotonin receptors that preferentially recruits β-arrestin over activating G proteins. LSD also has an exceptionally long residence time when bound to serotonin receptors lasting hours, consistent with the long-lasting effects of LSD despite its relatively rapid clearance. A crystal structure of the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor bound to LSD reveals an extracellular loop that forms a "lid" over the diethylamide end of the binding cavity and "traps" LSD in the binding pocket, which explains the slow rate of LSD unbinding from serotonin receptors. The related lysergamide lysergic acid amide (LSA) that lacks the diethylamide moiety is far less hallucinogenic in comparison. Moreover, a specific residue in the binding pocket is partially responsible for the prolonged action of LSD, and this residue is found in the human protein but not in the receptors of rodents.
LSD is an extraordinarily potent psychoactive drug and is among the most potent psychedelics known in humans. The very high potency of LSD in producing psychedelic-like effects is also the case in animals, including rodents and monkeys. It is unclear why LSD is so potent. The affinity and activational potency of LSD at the human serotonin 5-HT2A receptor in vitro is unremarkable compared to other psychedelics such as DOI and DOB. There is no evidence for its greater potency being related to pharmacokinetics or metabolism. It appears that the N,N-diethylamide moiety of LSD fits into a sterically constrained region of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor that specifically accommodates this moiety.
An agonist is usually defined as a molecule that activates a receptor it binds to directly, according to that LSD binds to the TAAR1-receptor inside a dopaminergic neuron is meaning an acceleration of releasing endogenous dopamine from. So by assuming, that also the partial agonism at autoreceptors from LSD is mostly acting agonistic in these pathways, the overall activation of the dopamine system from LSD is very strong.
LSD, like other psychedelics, has been found to increase the expression of genes related to synaptic plasticity and hence to have psychoplastogenic effects. This appears to be mediated by serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonism. LSD has also been reported to act as a highly potent positive allosteric modulator of the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), one of the receptors of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). However, subsequent studies failed to reproduce these findings and instead found no interaction of LSD with TrkB.
There appears to be no significant acute tolerance to the subjective effects of LSD. Hence, its duration appears to be dictated by pharmacokinetics rather than by pharmacodynamics. This is in contrast to MDMA, which shows marked acute tolerance and a duration of effects that is shorter than its elimination half-life.
The cryo-EM structures of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor with LSD, as well as with various other psychedelics and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists, have been solved and published by Bryan L. Roth and colleagues.

#### Mechanisms of action

Neuroimaging studies using resting state fMRI recently suggested that LSD changes the cortical functional architecture. These modifications spatially overlap with the distribution of serotonergic receptors. In particular, increased connectivity and activity were observed in regions with high expression of 5-HT2A receptor, while a decrease in activity and connectivity was observed in cortical areas that are dense with 5-HT1A receptor. Experimental data suggest that subcortical structures, particularly the thalamus, play a synergistic role with the cerebral cortex in mediating the psychedelic experience. LSD, through its binding to cortical 5-HT2A receptor, may enhance excitatory neurotransmission along frontostriatal projections and, consequently, reduce thalamic filtering of sensory stimuli towards the cortex. This phenomenon appears to selectively involve ventral, intralaminar, and pulvinar nuclei.

### Pharmacokinetics

#### Absorption

The oral bioavailability of LSD was crudely estimated as approximately 71% using previous data on intravenous administration of LSD. The sample was equally divided between male and female subjects and there were no significant sex differences observed in the pharmacokinetics of LSD. In a subsequent higher-quality 2025 study, the oral bioavailability of LSD was about 80%.
The pharmacokinetics of LSD were not properly determined until 2015, which is not surprising for a drug with the kind of low-μg potency that LSD possesses. In a sample of 16 healthy subjects, a single mid-range 200 μg oral dose of LSD was found to produce mean maximal concentrations of 4.5 ng/mL at a median of 1.5 hours (range 0.5–4 hours) post-administration.
A large meal before taking LSD has been found to result in circulating levels that were 50% lower than on an empty stomach.

#### Distribution

In terms of distribution, it is estimated that only about 1 to 1.5% of the drug reaches the brain both in animals and humans. Following a typical 100 μg dose in humans, this would be about 1 μg that is distributed into the brain. LSD levels in different brain areas have been found to vary in monkeys. Levels were equal in blood, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and brainstem, whereas levels were 1.5 times higher in the thalamus and extrapyramidal system, 2 to 3 times higher in the hypothalamus and limbic system, 2 to 5 times higher in the auditory and visual cortex, 5 to 7 times higher in the posterior pituitary and pineal gland, and 10 times higher in the anterior pituitary gland. These varying concentrations in different brain areas may explain the profile of psychedelic effects of LSD. Bodily distribution of LSD has also been studied.
It has been said that there is a peculiar 40-minute lag before onset of the psychedelic effects of LSD when it is administered intravenously. This has been said to be related to time-dependent interactions of LSD with the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. However, contradicting the preceding claims, other sources have stated that intravenous injection of LSD results in onset of effects within a few minutes. In a 2025 pharmacokinetic study comparing oral and intravenous LSD, the onset orally was about 45 minutes and the onset by intravenous injection was about 2.5 minutes. In addition, intrathecal injection (intraspinal injection) is reported to have a virtually instantaneous onset of action. However, in the 2025 study, time to maximal effects was about 2.5 hours orally and about 1.2 hours intravenously. In an earlier 2016 study, intravenous LSD effects similarly peaked after about 1.7 hours. For comparison, intravenous dimethyltryptamine (DMT) given as a bolus has been found to produce maximal effects after about 2 minutes and intravenous psilocybin given over 60 seconds after about 4 minutes. Doses of LSD are said to be similar by oral and injectable routes, with the exception of intrathecal injection in which the dose is reduced to about one-third of usual.

#### Metabolism

The metabolites of LSD include 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD (O-H-LSD), 2-oxo-LSD, lysergic acid ethylamide (LAE), lysergic acid ethyl-2-hydroxyethylamide (LEO), nor-LSD, 13-hydroxy-LSD, 14-hydroxy-LSD, and the glucuronide conjugates of the 13- and 14-hydroxylated metabolites, among other possible metabolites. The major metabolite of LSD is O-H-LSD. Levels of O-H-LSD in urine have been found to be 4 to 40 times higher than those of LSD, indicating extensive metabolism of LSD into this compound. It is formed by cytochrome P450 enzymes, although the specific enzymes involved are unknown, and O-H-LSD's potential pharmacology is little-studied. However, it was found to have profoundly reduced activity at the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors relative to LSD in vitro. Little is known about the specific enzymes responsible for the formation of LSD metabolites.

#### Elimination

Only 1% of the drug was eliminated in urine unchanged, whereas 13% was eliminated as O-H-LSD within 24 hours.
Aghajanian and Bing (1964) found LSD had an elimination half-life of only 175 minutes (about 3 hours); however, using more accurate techniques, Papac and Foltz (1990) reported that 1 μg/kg oral LSD given to a single male volunteer had an apparent plasma half-life of 5.1 hours, with a peak plasma concentration of 5 ng/mL at 3 hours post-dose. In a more modern 2015 study, concentrations of LSD decreased following first-order kinetics with a half-life of 3.6 ± 0.9 hours and a terminal half-life of 8.9 ± 5.9 hours.

#### Miscellaneous

The acute effects of LSD normally last between 6 and 12 hours depending on dose, tolerance, and age. In a modern study, the effects of the dose of LSD given lasted for up to 12 hours and were closely correlated with the concentrations of LSD present in circulation over time, with no acute tolerance observed.

## Chemistry

LSD is a chiral compound with two stereocenters at the carbon atoms C-5 and C-8, so that theoretically four different optical isomers of LSD could exist. LSD, also called d-LSD or (+)-LSD, has the absolute configuration (5R,8R). The other stereoisomers are iso-LSD (d-iso-LSD), l-LSD, and l-iso-LSD.
The 5S- or levo- stereoisomers of lysergamides do not exist in nature and are not formed during the synthesis from d-lysergic acid. Retrosynthetically, the C-5 stereocenter could be analysed as having the same configuration of the alpha carbon of the naturally occurring amino acid L-tryptophan, the precursor to all biosynthetic ergoline compounds.
However, LSD and iso-LSD, the two C-8 isomers, rapidly interconvert in the presence of bases, as the alpha proton is acidic and can be deprotonated and reprotonated. Non-psychoactive iso-LSD which has formed during the synthesis can be separated by chromatography and can be isomerized to LSD.
Pure salts of LSD are triboluminescent, emitting small flashes of white light when shaken in the dark. LSD is strongly fluorescent and will glow bluish-white under UV light.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of LSD has been described. It is commonly synthesized by reacting diethylamine with an activated form of lysergic acid. Activating reagents include phosphoryl chloride and peptide coupling reagents. Lysergic acid is made by alkaline hydrolysis of lysergamides like ergotamine, a substance usually derived from the ergot fungus on agar plate. Lysergic acid can also be produced synthetically, although these processes are not used in clandestine manufacture due to their low yields and high complexity.
Albert Hofmann synthesized LSD in the following manner: (1) hydrazinolysis of ergotamine into D- and L-isolysergic acid hydrazide, (2) separation of the enantiomers with di-(p-toluyl)-D-tartaric acid to get D-isolysergic acid hydrazide, (3) enantiomerization into D-lysergic acid hydrazide, (4) substitution with HNO2 to D-lysergic acid azide and (5) finally substitution with diethylamine to form D-lysergic acid diethylamide.
The precursor for LSD, lysergic acid, has been produced by GMO baker's yeast.

### Stability

"LSD," writes the chemist Alexander Shulgin, "is an unusually fragile molecule ... As a salt, in water, cold, and free from air and light exposure, it is stable indefinitely."
LSD has two labile protons at the tertiary stereogenic C5 and C8 positions, rendering these centers prone to epimerisation. The C8 proton is more labile due to the electron-withdrawing carboxamide attachment, but the removal of the chiral proton at the C5 position (which was once also an alpha proton of the parent molecule tryptophan) is assisted by the inductively withdrawing nitrogen and pi electron delocalisation with the indole ring.
LSD also has enamine-type reactivity because of the electron-donating effects of the indole ring. Because of this, chlorine destroys LSD molecules on contact; even though chlorinated tap water contains only a slight amount of chlorine, the small quantity of compound typical to an LSD solution will likely be eliminated when dissolved in tap water. The double bond between the 8-position and the aromatic ring, being conjugated with the indole ring, is susceptible to nucleophilic attacks by water or alcohol, especially in the presence of UV or other kinds of light. LSD often converts to lumi-LSD (10-hydroxy-9,10-dihydro-LSD), which is inactive in human beings.
A controlled study was undertaken to determine the stability of LSD in pooled urine samples.
The concentrations of LSD in urine samples were followed over time at various temperatures, in different types of storage containers, at various exposures to different wavelengths of light, and at varying pH values. These studies demonstrated no significant loss in LSD concentration at 25 °C for up to four weeks. After four weeks of incubation, a 30% loss in LSD concentration at 37 °C and up to a 40% at 45 °C were observed. Urine fortified with LSD and stored in amber glass or nontransparent polyethylene containers showed no change in concentration under any light conditions. The stability of LSD in transparent containers under light was dependent on the distance between the light source and the samples, the wavelength of light, exposure time, and the intensity of light. After prolonged exposure to heat in alkaline pH conditions, 10 to 15% of the parent LSD epimerized to iso-LSD. Under acidic conditions, less than 5% of the LSD was converted to iso-LSD. It was also demonstrated that trace amounts of metal ions in the buffer or urine could catalyze the decomposition of LSD and that this process can be avoided by the addition of EDTA.

### Detection

LSD can be detected in concentrations larger than approximately 10% in a sample using Ehrlich's reagent and Hofmann's reagent. However, detecting LSD in human tissues is more challenging due to its active dose being significantly lower (in micrograms) compared to most other drugs (in milligrams).
LSD may be quantified in urine for drug testing programs, in plasma or serum to confirm poisoning in hospitalized victims, or in whole blood for forensic investigations. The parent drug and its major metabolite are unstable in biofluids when exposed to light, heat, or alkaline conditions, necessitating protection from light, low-temperature storage, and quick analysis to minimize losses. Maximum plasma concentrations are typically observed 1.4 to 1.5 hours after oral administration of 100 μg and 200 μg, respectively, with a plasma half-life of approximately 2.6 hours (ranging from 2.2 to 3.4 hours among test subjects).
Due to its potency in microgram quantities, LSD is often not included in standard pre-employment urine or hair analyses. However, advanced liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry methods can detect LSD in biological samples even after a single use.

### Analogues

A variety of LSD analogues are known. Many of them retain psychedelic effects similarly to LSD, although most have reduced potency and none are notably more potent than LSD. Examples include ergine (lysergic acid amide; LSA), isoergine (iso-LSA), lysergic acid hydroxyethylamide (LSH), ergonovine (ergometrine), methylergonovine (methylergometrine), methysergide, ETH-LAD, PRO-LAD, AL-LAD, 1-methyl-LSD (MLD-41), MiPLA, and LA-SS-Az (LSZ), among many others. Presumed or known prodrugs of LSD, including 1A-LSD (ALD-52), 1P-LSD, and 1V-LSD, have been developed or encountered. Some non-hallucinogenic LSD analogues, such as lisuride and 2-bromo-LSD (BOL-148), are known as well. They are lower-efficacy serotonin 5-HT2A receptor partial agonists and can notably act as hallucinogen antagonists against LSD. In addition to lysergamide derivatives, simplified or "partial" LSD analogues or seco-LSD compounds, such as NDTDI (8,10-seco-LSD), DEIMDHPCA (3,5-seco-LSD), 10,11-seco-LSD, and N-DEAOP-NMT, are known. A notable bioisostere of LSD is JRT, the isotryptamine analogue of LSD and a psychedelic and psychoplastogen which is under investigation for the potential treatment of schizophrenia.

## History

Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann first synthesized LSD in 1938 from lysergic acid, a chemical derived from the hydrolysis of ergotamine, an alkaloid found in ergot, a fungus that infects grain. LSD was the 25th of various lysergamides Hofmann synthesized from lysergic acid while trying to develop a new analeptic, hence the alternate name LSD-25. Hofmann discovered its effects in humans on April 16, in 1943, after unintentionally ingesting an unknown amount, possibly absorbing it through his skin. On April 19, 1943, Hofmann intentionally ingested 0.25 milligrams (250 micrograms) of LSD. LSD was first published in the scientific literature by Hofmann and his colleague psychiatrist Werner Stoll in 1943 and the hallucinogenic effects of LSD were first published by Stoll in 1947.
LSD was subject to exceptional interest within the field of psychiatry in the 1950s and early 1960s, with Sandoz distributing LSD to researchers under the trademark name Delysid in an attempt to find a marketable use for it. During this period, LSD was controversially administered to hospitalised schizophrenic autistic children, with varying degrees of therapeutic success. It was said to have been tried in every type of mental disorder by 1960. LSD was also used in an attempt to cure homosexuality. Most of the early studies of LSD for psychiatric conditions were of very low quality, often lacking even control groups. In 1975, it was concluded that LSD showed little difference from placebo for most conditions, but this conclusion was still based on low-quality evidence.
LSD-assisted psychotherapy was used in the 1950s and early 1960s by psychiatrists such as Humphry Osmond, who pioneered the application of LSD to the treatment of alcoholism, with promising results. Osmond coined the term "psychedelic" (mind manifesting) as a term for LSD and related hallucinogens, superseding the previously held "psychotomimetic" model in which LSD was believed to mimic schizophrenia. In contrast to schizophrenia, LSD can induce transcendent experiences, or mental states that transcend the experience of everyday consciousness, with lasting psychological benefit. During this time, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) began using LSD in the research project Project MKUltra, which used psychoactive substances to aid interrogation. The CIA administered LSD to unwitting test subjects to observe how they would react, the most well-known example of this being Operation Midnight Climax. LSD was one of several psychoactive substances evaluated by the U.S. Army Chemical Corps as possible non-lethal incapacitants in the Edgewood Arsenal human experiments.
According to declassified CIA documents, it's possible that the American agency spread LSD on civilians in Europe in the 50s.
In the 1960s, LSD and other psychedelics were adopted by and became synonymous with the counterculture movement due to their perceived ability to expand consciousness. This resulted in LSD being viewed as a cultural threat to American values and the Vietnam War effort, and it was designated as a Schedule I (illegal for medical as well as recreational use) substance in 1968. It was listed as a Schedule I controlled substance by the United Nations in 1971 and currently has no approved medical uses. As of 2017, about 10% of people in the United States have used LSD at some point in their lives, while 0.7% have used it in the last year. It was most popular in the 1960s to 1980s. The use of LSD among US adults increased by 56.4% from 2015 to 2018.
LSD was first synthesized on November 16, 1938 by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann at the Sandoz Laboratories in Basel, Switzerland as part of a large research program searching for medically useful ergot alkaloid derivatives. The abbreviation "LSD" is from the German "Lysergsäurediethylamid".

LSD's psychedelic properties were discovered 5 years later when Hofmann himself accidentally ingested an unknown quantity of the chemical. The first intentional ingestion of LSD occurred on April 19, 1943, when Hofmann ingested 250 μg of LSD. He said this would be a threshold dose based on the doses of other ergot alkaloids. Hofmann found the effects to be much stronger than he anticipated. Sandoz Laboratories introduced LSD as a psychiatric drug in 1947 and marketed LSD as a psychiatric panacea, hailing it "as a cure for everything from schizophrenia to criminal behavior, 'sexual perversions', and alcoholism." Sandoz would send the drug for free to researchers investigating its effects.

Beginning in the 1950s, the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) began a research program code-named Project MKUltra. The CIA introduced LSD to the United States, purchasing the entire world's supply for \$240,000 and propagating the LSD through CIA front organizations to American hospitals, clinics, prisons, and research centers. Experiments included administering LSD to CIA employees, military personnel, doctors, other government agents, prostitutes, mentally ill patients, and members of the general public to study their reactions, usually without the subjects' knowledge. The project was revealed in the US congressional Rockefeller Commission report in 1975. However, the extent of the experiments conducted under Project MKUltra are still mostly unknown, as acting CIA director Richard Helms destroyed many of the key documents related to MKUltra in 1973.
In 1963, the Sandoz patents on LSD expired and the Czech company Spofa began to produce the substance. Sandoz stopped the production and distribution in 1965.
Several figures, including Aldous Huxley, Timothy Leary, and Al Hubbard, had begun to advocate the consumption of LSD. LSD became central to the counterculture of the 1960s. In the early 1960s the use of LSD and other hallucinogens was advocated by new proponents of consciousness expansion such as Leary, Huxley, Alan Watts and Arthur Koestler, and according to L. R. Veysey they profoundly influenced the thinking of the new generation of youth.
On October 24, 1968, possession of LSD was made illegal in the United States. The last FDA approved study of LSD in patients ended in 1980, while a study in healthy volunteers was made in the late 1980s. Legally approved and regulated psychiatric use of LSD continued in Switzerland until 1993.
In November 2020, Oregon became the first US state to decriminalize possession of small amounts of LSD after voters approved Ballot Measure 110.

## Society and culture

### Counterculture

By the mid-1960s, the youth countercultures in California, particularly in San Francisco, had widely adopted the use of hallucinogenic drugs, including LSD. The first major underground LSD factory was established by Owsley Stanley. Around this time, the Merry Pranksters, associated with novelist Ken Kesey, organized the Acid Tests, events in San Francisco involving LSD consumption, accompanied by light shows and improvised music. Their activities, including cross-country trips in a psychedelically-decorated bus and interactions with major figures of the beat movement, were later documented in Tom Wolfe's The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (1968).
In San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, the Psychedelic Shop was opened in January 1966 by brothers Ron and Jay Thelin to promote the safe use of LSD. This shop played a significant role in popularizing LSD in the area and establishing Haight-Ashbury as the epicenter of the hippie counterculture. The Thelins also organized the Love Pageant Rally in Golden Gate Park in October 1966, protesting against California's ban on LSD.
A similar movement developed in London, led by British academic Michael Hollingshead, who first tried LSD in America in 1961. After experiencing LSD and interacting with notable figures such as Aldous Huxley, Timothy Leary, and Richard Alpert, Hollingshead played a key role in the famous LSD research at Millbrook before moving to New York City for his experiments. In 1965, he returned to the UK and founded the World Psychedelic Center in Chelsea, London.

### Art and music

#### Art

##### Blotter art

Blotter art is an art form printed on perforated sheets of absorbent blotting paper infused with liquid LSD. The delivery method gained popularity following the banning of the hallucinogen LSD in the late 1960s. The use of graphics on blotter sheets originated as an underground art form in the early 1970s, sometimes to help identify the dose, maker, or batch of LSD.

##### LSD art

LSD art is any art or visual displays inspired by psychedelic experiences and hallucinations known to follow the ingestion of LSD (also known colloquially as acid). Artists and scientists have been interested in the effect of LSD on drawing and painting since it first became available for legal use and general consumption.

#### Music

The influence of LSD in the realms of music and art became pronounced in the 1960s, especially through the Acid Tests and related events involving bands like the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and Big Brother and the Holding Company. San Francisco-based artists such as Rick Griffin, Victor Moscoso, and Wes Wilson contributed to this movement through their psychedelic poster and album art. The Grateful Dead, in particular, became central to the culture of "Deadheads", with their music heavily influenced by LSD.
In the United Kingdom, Michael Hollingshead, reputed for introducing LSD to various artists and musicians like Storm Thorgerson, Donovan, Keith Richards, and members of the Beatles, played a significant role in the drug's proliferation in the British art and music scene. Despite LSD's illegal status from 1966, it was widely used by groups including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Moody Blues. Their experiences influenced works such as the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Cream's Disraeli Gears, featuring psychedelic-themed music and artwork.
Psychedelic music of the 1960s often sought to replicate the LSD experience, incorporating exotic instrumentation, electric guitars with effects pedals, and elaborate studio techniques. Artists and bands utilized instruments like sitars and tablas, and employed studio effects such as backward tapes, panning, and phasing. Songs such as John Prine's "Illegal Smile" and the Beatles' "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" have been associated with LSD, although the latter's authors denied such claims.
Contemporary artists influenced by LSD include Keith Haring in the visual arts, various electronic dance music creators, and the jam band Phish. The 2018 Leo Butler play All You Need is LSD is inspired by the author's interest in the history of LSD.

### Legal status

The United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971 mandates that signing parties, including the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and most of Europe, prohibit LSD. Enforcement of these laws varies by country. The convention allows medical and scientific research with LSD.

#### Australia

In Australia, LSD is classified as a Schedule 9 prohibited substance under the Poisons Standard (February 2017), indicating it may be abused or misused and its manufacture, possession, sale, or use should be prohibited except for approved research purposes. In Western Australia, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1981 provides guidelines for possession and trafficking of substances like LSD.

#### Canada

In Canada, LSD is listed under Schedule III of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. Unauthorized possession and trafficking of the substance can lead to significant legal penalties.

#### United Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, LSD is a Class A drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, making unauthorized possession and trafficking punishable by severe penalties. The Runciman Report and Transform Drug Policy Foundation have made recommendations and proposals regarding the legal regulation of LSD and other psychedelics.

#### United States

In the United States, LSD is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, making its manufacture, possession, and distribution illegal without a DEA license. The law considers LSD to have a high potential for abuse, no legitimate medical use, and to be unsafe even under medical supervision. The US Supreme Court case Neal v. United States (1995) clarified the sentencing guidelines related to LSD possession.
Oregon decriminalized personal possession of small amounts of drugs, including LSD, in February 2021, and California has seen legislative efforts to decriminalize psychedelics.

#### Mexico

Mexico decriminalized the possession of small amounts of drugs, including LSD, for personal use in 2009. The law specifies possession limits and establishes that possession is not a crime within designated quantities.

#### Czech Republic

In the Czech Republic, possession of "amount larger than small" of LSD is criminalized, while possession of smaller amounts is a misdemeanor. The definition of "amount larger than small" is determined by judicial practice and specific regulations.

### Illicit supply chain

#### Production

An active dose of LSD is very minute, allowing a large number of doses to be synthesized from a comparatively small amount of raw material. Twenty-five kilograms of precursor ergotamine tartrate can produce 5–6 kg of pure crystalline LSD; this corresponds to around 50–60 million doses at 100 μg. Because the masses involved are so small, concealing and transporting illicit LSD is much easier than smuggling cocaine, cannabis, or other illegal drugs.
Manufacturing LSD requires laboratory equipment and experience in the field of organic chemistry. It takes two to three days to produce 30 to 100 grams of pure compound. It is believed that LSD is not usually produced in large quantities, but rather in a series of small batches. This technique minimizes the loss of precursor chemicals in case a step does not work as expected. Ali Altaft, the lead chemist at the University of Okara, in Punjab, Pakistan, performed the synthesis of LSD on video.

##### Forms

LSD is produced in crystalline form and is then mixed with excipients or redissolved for production in ingestible forms. Liquid solution is either distributed in small vials or, more commonly, sprayed onto or soaked into a distribution medium. Historically, LSD solutions were first sold on sugar cubes, but practical considerations forced a change to tablet form. Appearing in 1968 as an orange tablet measuring about 6 mm across, "Orange Sunshine" acid was the first largely available form of LSD after its possession was made illegal. Tim Scully, a prominent chemist, made some of these tablets, but said that most "Sunshine" in the USA came by way of Ronald Stark, who imported approximately thirty-five million doses from Europe.
Over some time, tablet dimensions, weight, shape and concentration of LSD evolved from large (4.5–8.1 mm diameter), heavyweight (≥150 μg), round, high concentration (90–350 μg/tab) dose units to small (2.0–3.5 mm diameter) lightweight (as low as 4.7 μg/tab), variously shaped, lower concentration (12–85 μg/tab, average range 30–40 μg/tab) dose units. LSD tablet shapes have included cylinders, cones, stars, spacecraft, and heart shapes. The smallest tablets became known as "Microdots".
After tablets came "computer acid" or "blotter paper LSD", typically made by dipping a preprinted sheet of blotting paper into an LSD/water/alcohol solution. More than 200 types of LSD tablets have been encountered since 1969 and more than 350 blotter paper designs have been observed since 1975. About the same time as blotter paper LSD came "Windowpane" (AKA "Clearlight"), which contained LSD inside a thin gelatin square a quarter of an inch (6 mm) across.  LSD has been sold under a wide variety of often short-lived and regionally restricted street names including Acid, Trips, Uncle Sid, Blotter, Lucy, Alice and doses, as well as names that reflect the designs on the sheets of blotter paper. Authorities have encountered the drug in other forms—including powder or crystal, and capsule.

###### Blotters

Blotter art designs printed on blotter paper can serve to identify dose strengths, different batches, or makers.
On the other hand, blotters without art may be considered safer by some, since there is no guarantee that the printer ink used in clandestine production is edible or non-toxic for long-term exposure, and it is also possible for unscrupulous dealers to mimic reputable blotter art designs in order to boost sales.

##### Distribution

LSD manufacturers and traffickers in the United States can be categorized into two groups: A few large-scale producers, and an equally limited number of small, clandestine chemists, consisting of independent producers who, operating on a comparatively limited scale, can be found throughout the country.
As a group, independent producers are of less concern to the Drug Enforcement Administration than the large-scale groups because their product reaches only local markets.
Many LSD dealers and chemists describe a religious or humanitarian purpose that motivates their illicit activity. Nicholas Schou's book Orange Sunshine: The Brotherhood of Eternal Love and Its Quest to Spread Peace, Love, and Acid to the World describes one such group, the Brotherhood of Eternal Love. The group was a major American LSD trafficking group in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
In the second half of the 20th century, dealers and chemists loosely associated with the Grateful Dead like Owsley Stanley, Nicholas Sand, Karen Horning, Sarah Maltzer, "Dealer McDope", and Leonard Pickard played an essential role in distributing LSD.

### Mimics

Since 2005, law enforcement in the United States and elsewhere has seized several chemicals and combinations of chemicals in blotter paper which were sold as LSD mimics, including DOB, a mixture of DOC and DOI, 25I-NBOMe, and a mixture of DOC and DOB. Many mimics are toxic in comparatively small doses, or have extremely different safety profiles. Many street users of LSD are often under the impression that blotter paper which is actively hallucinogenic can only be LSD because that is the only chemical with low enough doses to fit on a small square of blotter paper. While it is true that LSD requires lower doses than most other hallucinogens, blotter paper is capable of absorbing a much larger amount of material. The DEA performed a chromatographic analysis of blotter paper containing 2C-C which showed that the paper contained a much greater concentration of the active chemical than typical LSD doses, although the exact quantity was not determined. Blotter LSD mimics can have relatively small dose squares; a sample of blotter paper containing DOC seized by Concord, California police had dose markings approximately 6 mm apart. Several deaths have been attributed to 25I-NBOMe.

### Notable individuals

Some notable individuals have commented publicly on their experiences with LSD. Some of these comments date from the era when it was legally available in the US and Europe for non-medical uses, and others pertain to psychiatric treatment in the 1950s and 1960s. Still others describe experiences with illegal LSD, obtained for philosophic, artistic, therapeutic, spiritual, or recreational purposes.

W. H. Auden, the poet, said, "I myself have taken mescaline once and L.S.D. once.  Aside from a slight schizophrenic dissociation of the I from the Not-I, including my body, nothing happened at all." He also said, "LSD was a complete frost. … What it does seem to destroy is the power of communication. I have listened to tapes done by highly articulate people under LSD, for example, and they talk absolute drivel. They may have seen something interesting, but they certainly lose either the power or the wish to communicate." He also said, "Nothing much happened but I did get the distinct impression that some birds were trying to communicate with me."
James Cameron, the Canadian filmmaker, has said he experimented with LSD during his college years.
Daniel Ellsberg, an American peace activist, says he has had several hundred experiences with psychedelics.
Richard Feynman, a notable physicist at California Institute of Technology, tried LSD during his professorship at Caltech. Feynman largely sidestepped the issue when dictating his anecdotes; he mentions it in passing in the "O Americano, Outra Vez" section.
Jerry Garcia stated in a July 3, 1989 interview for Relix Magazine, in response to the question "Have your feelings about LSD changed over the years?," "They haven't changed much. My feelings about LSD are mixed. It's something that I both fear and that I love at the same time. I never take any psychedelic, have a psychedelic experience, without having that feeling of, "I don't know what's going to happen." In that sense, it's still fundamentally an enigma and a mystery."
Bill Gates implied in an interview with Playboy that he tried LSD during his youth.
Aldous Huxley, author of Brave New World, became a user of psychedelics after moving to Hollywood. He was at the forefront of the counterculture's use of psychedelic drugs, which led to his 1954 work The Doors of Perception. Dying from cancer, he asked his wife on 22 November 1963 to inject him with 100 μg of LSD. He died later that day.
Steve Jobs, co-founder and former CEO of Apple Inc., said, "Taking LSD was a profound experience, one of the most important things in my life."
Ernst Jünger, German writer and philosopher, throughout his life had experimented with drugs such as ether, cocaine, and hashish; and later in life he used mescaline and LSD. These experiments were recorded comprehensively in Annäherungen (1970, Approaches). The novel Besuch auf Godenholm (1952, Visit to Godenholm) is clearly influenced by his early experiments with mescaline and LSD. He met with LSD inventor Albert Hofmann and they took LSD together several times. Hofmann's memoir LSD, My Problem Child describes some of these meetings.
In a 2004 interview, Paul McCartney said that The Beatles' songs "Day Tripper" and "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" were inspired by LSD trips. Nonetheless, John Lennon consistently stated over the course of many years that the fact that the initials of "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" spelled out L-S-D was a coincidence (he stated that the title came from a picture drawn by his son Julian) and that the band members did not notice until after the song had been released, and Paul McCartney corroborated that story. John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr also used the drug, although McCartney cautioned that "it's easy to overestimate the influence of drugs on the Beatles' music."
Michel Foucault had an LSD experience with Simeon Wade in Death Valley and later wrote "it was the greatest experience of his life, and that it profoundly changed his life and his work." According to Wade, as soon as he came back to Paris, Foucault scrapped the second History of Sexuality's manuscript, and totally rethought the whole project.
Kary Mullis is reported to credit LSD with helping him develop DNA amplification technology, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993.
Carlo Rovelli, an Italian theoretical physicist and writer, has credited his use of LSD with sparking his interest in theoretical physics.
Oliver Sacks, a neurologist famous for writing best-selling case histories about his patients' disorders and unusual experiences, talks about his own experiences with LSD and other perception altering chemicals, in his book, Hallucinations.
Alexander Shulgin, American chemist, told Albert Hofmann that he preferred LSD to 2C-B.
Matt Stone and Trey Parker, creators of the TV series South Park, claimed to have shown up at the 72nd Academy Awards, at which they were nominated for Best Original Song, under the influence of LSD.

## Research

### Psychiatric disorders

LSD was initially explored for psychiatric use due to its structural similarity to the neurotransmitter serotonin and its safety profile. In the 1950s and 1960s, it was used in psychiatry to enhance psychotherapy, known as psychedelic therapy. In the United States, the earliest research began in the 1950s. Albert Kurland and his colleagues published research on LSD's therapeutic potential to treat schizophrenia. In Canada, Humphry Osmond and Abram Hoffer completed LSD studies as early as 1952. Some psychiatrists, such as Ronald A. Sandison, who pioneered its use at Powick Hospital in England, believed that LSD was especially useful at helping patients to "unblock" repressed subconscious material through other psychotherapeutic methods, and also for treating alcoholism. One study concluded, "The root of the therapeutic value of the LSD experience is its potential for producing self-acceptance and self-surrender," presumably by forcing the user to face issues and problems in that individual's psyche. By the 1960s however, controversies surrounding "hippie" counterculture began to deplete institutional support for continued studies.
In 2001, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) stated that LSD "produces no aphrodisiac effects, does not increase creativity, has no lasting positive effect in treating alcoholics or criminals, does not produce a "model psychosis", and does not generate immediate personality change."
In more recent years, there has been renewed clinical research on and interest in LSD for potential therapeutic uses. This has been supported by several organizations, including the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), the Beckley Foundation, the Heffter Research Institute, and the Albert Hofmann Foundation, which exist to fund, encourage, and coordinate research into the medicinal and spiritual uses of LSD and related psychedelics. New clinical LSD experiments in humans started in 2009 for the first time in 35 years. As the drug is illegal in many areas of the world, potential medical uses have historically been difficult to study. Investigational uses of LSD include the treatment of alcoholism, anxiety, and depression, among other conditions. Another use is alleviation of anxiety in terminally ill cancer patients.
A 2012 meta-analysis found evidence that a single dose of LSD in conjunction with various alcoholism treatment programs was associated with a decrease in alcohol abuse, lasting for several months, but no effect was seen at one year. Adverse events included seizure, moderate confusion and agitation, nausea, vomiting, and acting in a bizarre fashion. A couple of reviews published in 2010 and 2014 concluded that conclusions drawn from most early trials are unreliable due to serious methodological flaws. These include the absence of adequate control groups, lack of follow-up, and vague criteria for therapeutic outcome. In many cases, studies failed to convincingly demonstrate whether the drug or the therapeutic interaction was responsible for any beneficial effects. A 2020 meta-review indicated possible positive effects of LSD in reducing psychiatric symptoms, mainly in cases of alcoholism.
In 2024, the FDA designated a form of LSD as a breakthrough therapy to treat generalized anxiety disorder which is being developed by MindMed. A study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association in September, 2025 explored the optimal dose of LSD to lower patients' anxiety. The study was conducted by the pharmaceutical company MindMed. The researchers compared how LSD doses of 25 μg, 50 μg, 100 μg, 200 μg, or placebo impacted anxiety scores among study participants. The results of the study found that 100 μg was the optimal dose to reduce anxiety among the studied patients.
LSD is a psychoplastogen, a compound capable of promoting rapid and sustained neural plasticity, an action that hypothetically might be involved in its therapeutic benefits, although more research is needed to substantiate such notions.
The British critical psychiatrist Joanna Moncrieff has critiqued the use and study of psychedelics like LSD for treatment of psychiatric disorders, highlighting concerns including excessive hype around these drugs, questionable biologically-based theories of benefit, blurred lines between medical and recreational use, flawed clinical trial findings, financial conflicts of interest, strong expectancy effects and large placebo responses, small and short-term benefits over placebo, and their potential for difficult experiences and adverse effects, among others.

### Other conditions

LSD has been studied for relief of pain and headaches. It has been used as a treatment for cluster headaches with positive results in some small studies. The drug might have analgesic properties related to pain in terminally ill patients and phantom pain and might be useful for treating inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis due to anti-inflammatory effects.

### Enhancing creativity

In the 1950s and 1960s, some psychiatrists, such as Oscar Janiger, explored the potential effect of LSD on creativity. Experimental studies attempted to measure the effect of LSD on creative activity and aesthetic appreciation. In 1966, James Fadiman conducted a study with the central question "How can psychedelics be used to facilitate problem solving?" This study attempted to solve 44 different problems and had 40 satisfactory solutions when the FDA banned all research into psychedelics. LSD was a key component of this study.
