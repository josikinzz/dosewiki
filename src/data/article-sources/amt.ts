**AMT** (**a-Methyltryptamine**) is a psychedelic, stimulant, and entactogen drug of the tryptamine class. It was originally developed in Russia as an antidepressant in1963. Similar in mechanism to LSD and Mushrooms, AMT acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist but also acts as relatively balanced releasing agent of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Alongside this, it been shown to be a very weak, non-selective, and reversible inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAOI), similar to harmine. MAOI is an enzyme that degrades amine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. AMT therefore increases the amount of these neurotransmitters in the brain.

The mechanism that produces the psychedelic effects of AMT is a direct result from its action as a 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonist in the brain (a mechanism of action shared by all other hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines).

It is because of this that AMT cannot be safely used in combination with antidepressants, painkillers, stimulants, SSRIs, MDMA, dextromethorphan, and a number of other drugs as certain combinations can cause deadly reactions.

The AMT experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of AMT can be broken down into five components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - AMT’s body high can be described as an intense and constant all-encompassing sensation. In comparison to other psychedelics, this sensation does not manifest itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body spontaneously, instead being felt as an extended unchanging activation of every nerve ending on the body that lasts throughout the entire duration of the trip. This everlasting droning is immensely pleasurable but can become overwhelmingly intense and almost a burden at higher levels
- **Stimulation** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, AMT is very stimulating, resulting in jaw clenching and a shakiness and unsteadiness of the hands but encouraging trippers to move around, run, dance, climb and generally engage in physical activities. In comparison, other more commonly used psychedelics such as psilocybin are generally sedating and relaxed.
- **Nausea** - In terms of the physical discomfort experienced on this substance, moderate to extreme nausea is almost consistently reported when consumed at any dosage. This either passes once the tripper has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **Difficulty urinating** - A slight difficulty urinating is occasionally present.
- **Headaches** - Many people report headaches towards the end of the experience
- **Loss of temperature regulation**

**Cognitive Effects:**

In comparison to more traditional psychedelics such as LSD, DMT and Psilocin, the AMT head space is described as not nearly as deep, insightful or profound.

The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes:

- **Introspection** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of a non social setting in which the user is alone.
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Connectivity of thought**
- **Increased empathy, love and sociability**
- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Euphoria**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**
- **Time distortion**
- **Increased empathy, love and sociability** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as MDMA and 2C-B but still prove strong enough to provide long lasting therapeutic effects.

**Visual Effects:**

*Enhancements*

AMT presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally include:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, the effects experienced are detailed below:

- **Visual drifting** (*melting, flowing, breathing and morphing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in their appearance, and unrealistic/cartoon like in style.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition** - In comparison to more commonly used psychedelics such as LSD and Psilocybin, this effect is significantly less intricate and complex although still very distinct in its presence.
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of psilocin and 2C-E than LSD. At lower levels, they appear to be bland and simplistic but become equal in terms of intricacy and depth to that of any of the classical psychedelics. They can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, blurred in their edges and rounded in their corners. They have a “natural” feel to them and at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of Level 7B visual geometry over Level 7A.

*Hallucinatory States*

At high dosages AMT can produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelic. These effects include:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.

**Auditory Effects:**

The auditory effects of AMT are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- **enhancements**
- **distortions**
- **hallucinations**

**Smoking vs Oral Ingestion:**

One of the practical things about AMT is that there are two methods of consumption that result in two alternate trips which differ in terms of their duration, body high, and visuals. If smoked, AMT has a quicker onset and a much shorter duration that is far less likely to keep tripper’s up all night and completely unable to sleep. It is also devoid of the nauseating effects found with oral ingestion, but is less visually intense while more physically stimulating. If you are going to try and smoke AMT, it is essential that it is purchased in freebase and not salt form.

**Health Effects, Potential Addiction, and Tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational AMT use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried AMT within the psychedelic community suggest that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly but nothing can be completely guaranteed.

In rats, the median lethal dose or dosage at which 50% of participants die (LD50) of AMT for mice when administered orally is 22 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) and in mice it is 38 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg). This means that for a 60-kilogram (130 lb) human to reach the LD50 value of rats they would have to take 1320 mg or 2280 mg to reach the LD50 of mice. This is between 44 and 76 times the active dosage of 30 mg.

AMT is non-habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. They are most often self-regulating so addiction to this substance is essentially unheard of. It can be prevented by manually limiting your usage of the drug.

There is an immediate tolerance to AMT after ingestion, preventing you from experiencing its full effects more often than every 4-7 days (unless you increase your dose significantly). This also produces a cross tolerance between AMT and LSD, psilocin and various other tryptamine psychedelics.

MAOIs have highly dangerous interactions when combined with almost any antidepressant (particularly SSRIs such as Prozac) or stimulants (such as MDMA and amphetamines), common migraine medications, certain herbs (such as St John’s Wort), or even most cold medicines (including decongestants, antihistamines, and cough syrup) as it can cause serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crisis. In short, do not mix this drug with anything other than the classic psychedelic tryptamines like LSD and mushrooms unless you have done your research and are absolutely sure it isn’t going to kill you or cause serotonin syndrome. 

**Legal Issues:**

- As of April 4, 2003 AMT is classed as a schedule I substance in the Controlled Substances Act of the United States.
- It is legal in the United Kingdom, however, and does not fall under the tryptamine clause, as its substituent is not on the nitrogen position. See “2001 Misuse of Drugs Act: Schedule 1, Regulation 3” for more information.
- The 5-Methoxy cousin, 5-MeO-AMT, is schedule 9 in Australia and AMT would be controlled as an analogue of this.
- Similarly, Canada has no mention of this substance in the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

If you want to try this substance, it is extremely cheap and easy to obtain with a quick google search of the term “buy amt” resulting in the first page becoming full of links to legitimate vendors. For those who are lucky enough to have a local head shop in their town, many of us can simply buy this substance in the form of perfectly legal, prepackaged, over the counter pills and skip the delivery process all together.

**Conclusion:**

Although this drug may not be as visually intricate or transcendental as more commonly used psychedelics, this is a substance that still holds its place in the psychedelic world.

## Subjective Experience

This is one that almost got away. It was a freebie; a single pill in a packet, given to
me by a head shop in Manchester after I had purchased a number of other items, and
engaged in a chat about the market. It was months later that I decided to try it, albeit
with a little trepidation, given multiple online reports of high body load.

I experienced relatively little in terms of nausea or general malaise, but equally, not
an all firing or visual psychedelic trip either. Yes, I was psychoactively aware, with a
vague psychedelic headspace, but it was not a particularly strong or exciting one.

Unable to have a second spin of the wheel, with AMT no longer available, I could only
speculate three reasons: I didn’t take enough (despite reference dose sources
indicating otherwise), the AMT had degraded by the time I consumed it or the set
and setting was wrong for the context of the trip.

If it was still accessible I would probably sample this again, but under significantly
different conditions.

DESCRIPTION #
 
AMT is a psychedelic amphetamine-tryptamine first developed in the 1960's for anti-depressant research , although it was never very successful as a prescription antidepressant. Its effects usually last 8-14 hours when swallowed and 3-6 hours when insufflated. Its effects are often characterized as a cross between a psychedelic and an MDMA, with empathogenesis and strong physical stimulation common. One common side effect with both insufflated and oral ingestion of AMT is powerful nausea and associated vomiting. 
 
[ [Main AMT Vault](https://erowid.org/amt.shtml) ]
 
[Dose](https://erowid.org/amt_dose.shtml) #
 
A standard oral dose of AMT is between 15 - 60 mg.
 
Price #
 
Rare, but sometimes sold at events for 5-20\$ per dose, available from exotic chemical suppliers for 100-150\$ per gram, aproximately the same from underground sources. (August 2000)
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/amt_law.shtml) #
 
AMT was placed in Schedule I in the United States on April 4th, 2003 through the emergency scheduling procedure. This makes it illegal to buy, sell, or possess without a license.

History #
 
AMT was first developed in the 1960s as an antidepressant and MAOI with its cousin alpha-Ethyl-Tryptamine which was sold for a short while by Upjohn before being placed in Schedule I in 1971. AMT was available in the Soviet Union in the 1960s as an antidepressant under the commercial name Indopan in 5 and 10 mg tablets. It remained a very obscure chemical until the late 1990s when began being sold commercially around the world as a research chemical and found its way into recreational use circles. It became illegal in the United States in April 2003.

United Kingdom (U.K., UK, England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Britain) #
 
AMT was added to Scheule 1 as of January 15th, 2015, by changing the definition of tryptamine substitions. See [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/3277/introduction/made](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/3277/introduction/made) . Previously AMT was not controlled in Britain and does not fall under the substituted tryptamine rule because its 'substitution' is not on the nitrogen. See the [2001 Misuse of Drugs Act : Schedule 1, regulation 3](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/uk/uk_law_misuse_2001_1.shtml) (as of Mar 2004). AMT is still (2015) not listed in the UK laws, but is now controlled as a substituted tryptamine under Schedule 1 (not the same as USA Schedule I). (last updated Jan 3, 2015)

## SYNTHESIS
A solution of 4.35 g indole-3-carboxaldehyde in 17.2 mL nitroethane was treated with 0.77 g ammonium acetate and heated, with occasional swirling, on the steam bath for 2.5 h. The excess reagent was removed under vacuum and the resulting yellow solids washed with H2O and air dried. Trituration under 25 mL dry MeOH, filtration, and air-drying gave 5.22 g (86%) 1-(3-indolyl)-2-nitropropene-1 as a yellow powder with mp 190â192 Â°C.

A suspension of 10.7 g LAH in 100 mL anhydrous THF was placed under an inert atmosphere, stirred, and treated dropwise with a solution of 10 g 1-(3-indolyl)-2-nitropropene-1 in anhydrous THF over the course of 2.5 h. The reaction mixture was brought to reflux temperature, held there for 2 h, and then returned to room temperature. The excess hydride was destroyed with an aqueous THF solution (80 mL of 25% solution) and there was then added 10 mL of 50% NaOH. There was added 150 mL Et2O, and the stirring was continued until no more solids formed. The reaction mixture was filtered and the filter cake washed with 150 mL Et2O. The filtrates and washings were combined, dried over K2CO3, and the solvent removed under vacuum. The residue weighed 9.2 g and was distilled at 130â140 Â°C at 1 mm/Hg to give a white oil that crystallized and had a mp of 96â98 Â°C. This was recrystallized from an ethyl acetate/petroleum ether mixture, and had a mp of 97â100 Â°C. The yield was 6.3 g (73%). IR (in cm-1): 750, 818, 911, 933, 1093, 1111. MS (in m/z): C2H6N+ 44 (100%); indolemethylene+ 130, 131 (44%, 43%); parent ion 174 (2%). A sample dissolved in 10 volumes of methanol, treated with one equivalent of glacial acetic acid, and taken to dryness under vacuum gave the acetate salt which, on recrystallization from ethyl acetate and air drying to constant weight yielded the product Î±-methyltryptamine (Î±-MT) as fine white crystals with a mp of 143â144 Â°C. The fumarate salt, formed by the addition of ethyl acetate to a hot solution of free base Î±-MT in methanol which had been neutralized with fumaric acid, was isolated as fine white needles with a mp of 200â203 Â°C.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 20 mg, orally) âNothing happened for three hoursâI thought I had drawn a blank. Then I became a little uncomfortable, restless, this delayed action is new to me. I feel completely washed out, exhausted. And I had a hang-over the next morning.â

(with 30 mg, orally) âIt felt a little like speed, strong speed. Yet I found myself yawning and in sort of a dreaminess state and quite lethargic. It lasted a long time.â

(with 30 mg, orally) âEffects were first noted in just over an hour, a general numbness and a mild loss of motor coordination. This all became more pronounced over the next half hour, but my thoughts remained clear. A hand tremor and jaw tightness persisted throughout the experience. Music was OK but I didnât really connect with it. There were no open or closed-eye visuals, but there was a moderate light sensitivity that lasted the day, and the visual field was altered such as the outside world did indeed appear unreal and alien. Were there any positive aspects to the day? I talked with a friend for two hours on the telephone, with ease. And I had no appetite. But there seems little else to recommend this compound. I slept well at the 12th hour.â

(with 80 mg, orally) âI shot up in an hour, and by another hour I was vomiting worse than with mescaline. Absolutely no visuals, no hallucinations, but extreme depersonalization. Thirteen hours into this and it is still go, go, go. Out with a bit of pot.â

(with 100 mg, orally) âThere was pupillary dilation, jaw clenching, tachycardia and vomiting. Too much. But I really liked this compound at lower dosages.â

(with 4 mg, smoked) âIt burns and smells bad. It took quite a while to come on. After a half hour, BINGO, there was a very slow building of a definite psychedelic. It builds slowly but strongly for another few hours to a plateau at maybe four hours after which a very slow decline sets in. But even after 18 hours following input, and after 7 hours of sleep, I awoke still feeling the effects.â

(with 5 mg, smoked) âQualitatively it was milder and less intense than mushrooms, but much longer lived. Not complex, but just a lot of very good spirit, energetic feeling, enhanced colors, attractive rhythms in music. Party stuff.â

(with 6 mg, smoked) âOnset was immediate, with heart racing, enhancement of surroundings. Taste? Pee-yew!â

(with 10 mg, smoked) âWhile there are no true visuals to speak of, the overall picture of things seemed grainyâas if filmed on low quality color 16mm film. There is an energized eeriness about inanimate objects. This lasted three hours.â

(with 20 mg, smoked) âI inhaled several hits from my vaporizer and sat back. I felt head-pressure and uneasiness, then suddenly I became very fast. My mind was moving fast, and my body was speeding along with it in an unconscious way. Several hours into it, I began to notice more of a psychedelic effect beginning to manifest. It seemed as if the speedy part was becoming less predominant and the psychedelic visual effects were starting to kick in. I went back to my room to watch the distinctive waves of a soft red/orange visuals They were similar to colors of LSD. It gradually increased to a level of intensity similar to perhaps 0.5â1.0 g P. cubensis, and after several more hours it was clear that I had reached the plateau. Feeling fairly tired and ready for bed, I decided to call it a night. Quite to my surprise, when I awoke four hours later I was at the same level as when I went to sleep. Gradually over the next day I returned to baseline and I was left feeling quite euphoric with a pleasant afterglow.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
There is quite obviously a wide range of reported effect described for Î±-MT, indicating much individual variability. For some it has a fast onset, for others a slow one. Some find it a good psychedelic, others are disturbed by the negative physical side-effects. This is all a bit reminiscent of harmaline, where the spectrum of responses also range from 1 to 10 on a scale of 1 to 10. Perhaps this is a reflection of the monoamineoxidase inhibition property, and if so, perhaps low levels of Î±-MT might serve the harmaline role of inhibiting the metabolic destruction of DMT in some form of a pharmahuasca.

I have always been intrigued by a fascinating bit of speculation. Ken Kesey, of âOne Flew over the Cuckooâs Nestâ fame, had his own nest in a log cabin down in La Honda, back in the â60âs. This was given fame mostly by Tom Wolfeâs The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test âThe Electric Kool-Aid Acid Testâ where it was well described. At that time, Kesey served as an experimental subject for a number of studies involving psilocybin, Ditran, and Î±-MT. Shortly after these were completed, he left and took the role of âThe Chiefâ of his band of âMerry Prankstersâ who traveled far and wide around the U.S. country in the now famous bus, the âFurther.â The stories of their broad and well advertised use of LSD are legion. I had heard as a rumor that the research supply of Î±-MT had disappeared at about the same time, and the thought occurred to me that maybe the drug consumed in the tour was not LSD but Î±-MT. Or maybe today one, and tomorrow the other. I made gentle inquiry of the research director there, whom I knew personally, if this might be so, and his opinion was that the material used by Kesey and the pranksters was probably LSD, as it was so widely available at that time.

There is another parallel to the ethyl homologue, Î±-ET. In the commentary under Î±-ET, I had mentioned how industry was benefiting economically in the War on Drugs, by charging inflated prices for reference and research samples. Here, there just might be political counterpart. There are several commercial sources for Î±-MT, with catalog prices ranging from \$50 to \$150 per gram. I bought a gram from Acros Organics and it was delivered with dispatch. I also received the MSDS sheet (Material Safety Data Sheet, a listing of physical hazard information now required to accompany all chemicals purchased) and it not surprisingly had no mention of any known hazard. Imagine my surprise when I received the invoice only to find that there as a \$6 surcharge as a hazardous shipping charge. Some three 800-number phone calls later, I got to a person at Fisher Scientific who told me that this was a result of the State of California placing this compound on a Classification #110 listing. I had previously received solvents from Acros, that were inflammable, volatile, bad smelling and rather toxic, and had never before had to pay a hazard fee. I suspect that someone in Sacramento has discovered that this compound has a wide acceptance as a stimulant and somewhat psychedelic, and is effectively capitalizing capatalizing on it before it becomes illegal. One of the commercial suppliers, a mail-order operation called CRSB, provides drug precursors (not illegal) and actual drugs (not illegal) as long as no illegal use will be made of them. The demand for Î±-MT is very high, second only to gamma-butyrolactone which can be converted to GHB with sodium hydroxide (the #3 item in their sales volume listing).

There is some interesting biochemistry and pharmacology all around the edges of Î±-MT. The 4-hydroxy analogue of Î±-MT has been looked at in human subjects. It is reported to be markedly visual in its effects, with some subjects reporting dizziness and a depressed feeling. There were, however, several toxic signs at doses of 15 to 20 milligrams orally, including abdominal pain, tachycardia, increased blood pressure and, with several people, headache and diarrhea. The 5-hydroxy analogue of Î±-MT is also a well-studied compound, but not to my knowledge in man. It can be called Î±-methylserotonin (Î±-M-5-HT or Î±-MS), and it is an effective inhibitor of 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase which is the immediate precursor to serotonin (5-HT). The amino acid tryptophan, without the 5-hydroxy group but with an Î±-methyl group, is Î±-methyltryptophan, and it is readily metabolized by the rat to Î±-MS. In the pineal, it mimics serotonin rather than melatonin, and there is no evidence that it is acetylated on to a melatonin analogue. This Î±-methyl blocking of the amine group from metabolic deamination represents a half-way step in the modification of serotonin to allow it to enter into the central nervous system, i.e., the protection of the amine group from deamination because of its alpha-methyl substituent. The rest of the needed modification is the methylation of the 5-hydroxy group as well. This yields alpha,O-dimethylserotonin which allows the entry of this serotonin-like product (Î±,O-DMS) directly into the brain. In all this casual use of the Greek letter alpha to indicate the carbon atom next to the nitrogen atom of the tryptamine side-chain, readers of the very old literature should remember that the letter alpha used to be used to indicate the 2-position of the pyrrole ring.

A few more compounds can be considered as part of this territory. The addition of a methyl group to the indolic 1-position gives rise to 1,Î±-DMT. This has been prepared in the conventional way from the 1-methylindole-3-carboxyaldehyde via the intermediate nitrostyrene reduced, in turn, with LAH. It represents the MLD-41 to LSD relationship, where there was some three fold drop in potency. The Î±,Î±-dimethyl tryptamine homologue (Î±,Î±-DMT) is also known. It represents the phentermine to amphetamine relationship where, again there is a three fold drop in potency. It would be a fair hypothesis to expect either of these âDMTâsâ to be active stimulants at reasonable dosages, but neither have been explored in man. The analogue with the methyl group relocated to the indolic 4-position (4,Î±-DMT) has been looked at in man. At an oral dose of 20 milligrams, there are reports of feelings of unreality. External body signs include flushing, muscle tightness, and eye dilation.

And there are five possible chain relocation, from the normal 3-position to the 2, the 4, the 5, the 6 or the 7-positions. All five âalpha-methyltryptamineâ isomers are known, but only one is known to be active in man as a CNS active material. This is the 5-isomer, 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole or 5-IT, which, at 20 milligrams orally, is a long-lived stimulant producing increased heart-rate, anorexia, diuresis, and slight hyperthermia for about twelve hours.

## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: 5 mg
- Light: 10 - 25 mg
- Common: 25 - 40 mg
- Strong: 40 - 60 mg
- Heavy: 60 - 80 mg

**Duration:**
- Total: 13 - 15 hours
- Onset: 60 - 180 minutes
- Peak: 4 - 6 hours
- After effects: 1 - 5 hours

**a-Methyltryptamine** (also known as **Indopan** and commonly as **aMT** or **aMT** ) is a lesser-known [entactogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class.

aMT was originally developed by Upjohn in the 1960s. It was briefly used in the Soviet Union as an [antidepressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressant) under the trade name **Indopan** . Indopan was prescribed in 5-10 mg doses, which is significantly lower than the dose used for recreational effects.

Erowid has received "a handful of unverifiable reports of hospitalization after high-dose (over 60 mg oral) aMT ingestion." There were 22 deaths linked to aMT in England and Wales where the drug became popular as a legal high from 2012 until it was banned in early 2015.

Limited data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of aMT, and it has a limited history of non-medical human use. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

aMT, or a-Methyltryptamine is a synthetic indole alkaloid molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicyclic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. AMT is substituted at the alpha carbon R a of its tryptamine backbone with a methyl group.

AMT is found in freebase form as a racemate of its (R-) and (S-) enantiomers.

## Pharmacology

aMT acts as a relatively balanced reuptake inhibitor and releasing agent of the main three monoamines; serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, and as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist.

aMT's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) .

aMT also acts as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [noradrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) , and [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) . It also acts as a very weak, non-selective [RIMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/RIMA) in-vitro and in-vivo. , but this is unlikely to be very significant (if at all) with common doses.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - Regarding its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, AMT tends to be very stimulating, resulting in jaw clenching and a shakiness and unsteadiness of the hands. The stimulation encourages the user to move around, run, dance, climb or engage in physical activities. In comparison, other common psychedelics such as [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) are sedating and relaxed.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - AMT's "body high" can be described as an intense and constant all-encompassing sensation. In comparison to other psychedelics, this sensation does not manifest itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body spontaneously; it is instead felt like an extended, unchanging activation of every nerve ending on the body that lasts throughout the entire duration of the experience. This continuous sensation is immensely pleasurable but can become overwhelmingly intense and almost a burden at higher levels.
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)** - A slight difficulty urinating is occasionally present.
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)**
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)** - Many people report headaches towards the end of the experience.
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Moderate to extreme nausea is commonly reported. This either passes once the user has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)** ### Visual effects
 
- The visual effects of AMT are mostly present only when large doses have been consumed and are proportionally mild in comparison to the intensity of its accompanying cognitive and physical effects when compared to substances such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) . 
#### Enhancements
 
- **[Acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#morphing) )* - In comparison to other [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)** - In comparison to more commonly used psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , this effect is significantly less intricate and complex although it is still very distinct in its presence.

#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry produced by aMT can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [Psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , and [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) than [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . At lower levels it can appear to be bland and simplistic in complexity but becomes equal regarding intricacy and depth to that of any of the classical [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) at higher doses. It can be comprehensively described with its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity (at heavy dosages), abstract in form, organic in feel, structured in organization, brightly lit, multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, equal in soft and sharp edges, small in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, equal in round and angular corners, non-immersive in depth, and consistent in intensity. At higher dosages, the visual geometry is significantly more likely to result in states of [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) geometry over [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - This particular effect is uncommon during the first half of the trip but capable of manifesting itself towards the end of the experience, particularly if sleep deprivation starts to take its toll due to the abnormally long duration. The internal hallucinations are more common within dark environments and can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, fixed in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, geometry-based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- In comparison to more traditional psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) and [Psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , the AMT head space is described as not nearly as deep, insightful or profound. The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes: 
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This effect is consistently manifested mainly in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than with [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This component is [introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) dominant and consistently manifested only in the context of a non-social setting in which the user is alone.
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational aMT use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because AMT is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

As a [monoamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) , aMT can be dangerous when taken in excessive doses or when combined with [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs) , [RIMAs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/RIMAs) , [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) and any substance which act as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) or [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) . There is one reported death from AMT, but it is not known how much of the substance was taken. Erowid states that they have received "a handful of unverifiable reports of hospitalization after high-dose (over 60 mg oral) AMT ingestion."

It is worth noting that aMT's analog [aET](/w/index.php?title=%CE%91ET&action=edit&redlink=1) has been shown to produce long-lasting serotonergic neurotoxicity at very high doses. It is possible that AMT could cause the same neurotoxicity at high dosages or with repeated long-term use.

Anecdotal reports suggest that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying aMT by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

AMT is considered to be moderately habit-forming.

Tolerance to the effects of aMT is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 14 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 month to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). AMT presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , meaning that after the consumption of aMT all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

Deaths from aMT are rare but, as a powerful [monoamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) (MRI), injury could occur when excessive doses are taken or when it is taken with substances such as [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs) , [RIMAs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/RIMAs) , [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) and any substance which act as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) or [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) of [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) such as [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) .

- **Alcohol** - aMT has a broad mechanism of action in the brain and so does alcohol so the combination can be unpredictable
- **Caffeine** - High doses of caffeine may cause anxiety which is less manageable when tripping, and since both are stimulating the combination may cause some physical discomfort.
- **Cannabis**
- **2C-T-x**
- **2C-x**
- **5-MeO-xxT**
- **Amphetamines**
- **Cocaine**
- **DOx**
- **DXM**
- **MAOIs** - aMT is an MAOI on its own. Using enzyme inhibitors can greatly reduce predictability of effects.
- **MDMA**
- **Mescaline**
- **MXE**
- **25x-NBOMe**
- **PCP**
- **SSRIs**
- **Tramadol**

**a-Methyltryptamine** is a long-lasting euphoric stimulant and a psychedelic, a research chemical which was first discovered in the 60s.

## History

It was originally developed in the USA in the 60s by the Upjohn company during research into anti-depressants, and the alpha-ethylated homologue became available as a commercial anti-depressant in the US (under the name Monase). However, aMT itself was available during the 60s for use as an anti-depressant in 5 and 10mg doses in the Soviet Union, sold under the brand name Indopan.

As with many research chemicals, it was examined by Alexander Shulgin and details of its effects and synthesis were described in the book TiHKAL. Both during his own experiences noted in the entry, and in his further notes drawing from the experiences of others he concludes that the chemical seems to have a wide variation in many of its properties between users and even individual experiences - particularly in effects and onset.

It was one of the first 'research chemicals' which became widely available on the Internet during the 1990s, and as a result became illegal in the USA in 2003. The drug remained relatively obscure up until this point, though it was used in certain psychotherapeutic studies during the 60s, and there are some reports which suspect recreational use took place as early as the 1960s, as a result of the chemical supply for these studies being diverged.

With the rising popularity of research chemical use on the Internet during the 21st century, it has seen increasing levels of use - and while it remains legal in most countries in the world recent efforts have been made by certain governments to illegalize it.

## Harm Reduction

As a [stimulating](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Stimulants) psychedelic, it carries a heavy body load, and care must be taken to observe physical side-effects such as vasoconstriction, which increase rapidly with dose. Toxic effects have been described at larger doses, so care must be taken to dose accurately.

Many users report experiencing particular nausea when ingesting the drug, which is abated after vomiting. If you feel the need to vomit, do not fight it.

Avoid other [MAOIs](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/maois/maois_info3.shtml).

See [Psychedelic Harm Reduction](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Psychedelics#Harm_Reduction) for general information.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

aMT acts as a relatively balanced reuptake inhibitor and releasing agent of the main three monoamines; serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, and as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist.

aMT is a reversible MAOI in higher doses (the danger rises exponentially as aMT doses approach 150 mg due to increased monoamine release and increased MAO inhibition), can cause Serotonin Syndrome when combined with monoamine releasers, [SSRIs](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Antidepressants#SSRIs) or other MAO inhibitors.

## Legal Status

aMT is scheduled in the US, Australia, Austria, Denmark, Germany, Greece,

Hungary, Japan, Lithuania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and soon in the UK as well.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%91-Methyltryptamine*

a-Methyltryptamine (aMT, AMT) is a psychedelic, stimulant, and entactogen drug of the tryptamine and a-alkyltryptamine families. It was originally developed as an antidepressant at Upjohn in the 1960s, and was used briefly as an antidepressant in the Soviet Union under the brand name Indopan or Indopane before being discontinued.
Side effects of aMT include agitation, restlessness, confusion, lethargy, pupil dilation, jaw clenching, and rapid heart rate, among others. aMT acts as a releasing agent of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, as a serotonin receptor agonist, and as a weak monoamine oxidase inhibitor. aMT is a substituted tryptamine and is closely related to a-ethyltryptamine (aET) and other a-alkylated tryptamines.
aMT appears to have first been described by at least 1929. It started being more studied in the late 1950s and was briefly used as an antidepressant in the Soviet Union in the 1960s. The drug started being used recreationally in the 1960s, with use increasing in the 1990s, and cases of death have been reported. aMT is a controlled substance in various countries, including the United States.

## Use and effects

Under the brand name Indopan or Indopane, aMT at doses of 5 to 10 mg was used for an antidepressant effect.
At a dose of 20 mg, it produces euphoria, while doses above 30 mg result in strong hallucinogenic effects. At doses over 30 mg, the compound may cause several side effects, including anxiety, muscle tightness, vomiting, and hyperthermia. A dose exceeding 40 mg is generally considered strong. In rare cases or extreme doses, the duration of effects might exceed 24 hours. Users report that aMT in freebase form is smoked, with doses between and 2 and 5 mg.
A dose of 20 mg of aMT is said to be equivalent to 50 μg of LSD. However, its onset of action is delayed, with effects appearing after only 3 to 4 hours, and it is longer-lasting. In addition, aMT is described as unpleasant compared to LSD, with symptoms of nervousness, irritability, restlessness, and inability to relax. It is also said to not have prominent visual effects.

## Side effects

Neurologic side effects of aMT include agitation, restlessness, confusion, and lethargy. Physical manifestations including vomiting, mydriasis (pupillary dilation), jaw clenching, tachycardia, salivation, diaphoresis (sweating), and elevations in blood pressure, temperature, and respiratory rate.
Side effects self-reported by recreational users include anxiety, muscle tension, jaw tightness, pupil dilation, tachycardia, headaches, nausea, and vomiting, as well as psychedelic effects including visual hallucinations and an altered state of mind.
aMT is capable of causing life-threatening side effects including hyperthermia, hypertension, and tachycardia. Fatalities have been reported in association with high doses or concomitant use of other drugs. 
Fatalities verified with toxicology and autopsy include those of a 22-year-old man in Miami-Dade County, Florida and a British teenager, both of whom died after consuming 1 g of aMT.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

aMT acts as a relatively balanced reuptake inhibitor and releasing agent of the main three monoamines; serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, and as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist. It has relatively weak psychedelic-like effects in animals compared to other psychedelic substituted tryptamines, for instance in terms of the head-twitch response in rodents.

#### Monoamine oxidase inhibition

aMT has been shown as a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) in vitro and in vivo. In rats, the potency of aMT as an MAO-A inhibitor in the brain was approximately equal to that of harmaline at equimolar doses. Dextroamphetamine did not enhance the 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced rise of serotonin at any level. The IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration of aMT for inhibition of MAO-A has been found to be 380 nM. This is similar to that of agents like para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA) and 4-methylthioamphetamine (4-MTA).

#### Serotonergic neurotoxicity

A close analogue of aMT, a-ethyltryptamine (aET), is known to be a serotonergic neurotoxin similarly to MDMA and para-chloroamphetamine (PCA).

### Pharmacokinetics

2-Oxo-aMT, 6-hydroxy-aMT, 7-hydroxy-aMT, and 1′-hydroxy-aMT were detected as metabolites of aMT in male Wistar rats.

## Chemistry

aMT is a synthetic substituted tryptamine with a methyl substituent at the alpha carbon. This alpha substitution makes it a relatively poor substrate for monoamine oxidase A, thereby prolonging aMT's half-life, allowing it to reach the brain and enter the central nervous system. Its chemical relation to tryptamine is analogous to that of amphetamine to phenethylamine, amphetamine being a-methylphenethylamine. aMT is closely related to the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) which partially explains its mechanism of action.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of aMT has been described. Its synthesis can be accomplished through several different routes, there's two "common" routes mainly via the Henry reaction aka Nitroadol condensation between indole-3-carboxaldehyde and nitroethane under amine salt or ionic liquid catalysis which produces 1-(3-indolyl)-2-nitropropene-1, 1-(3-indolyl)-2-nitropropene-1  can subsequently be reduced via a reducing agent such as lithium aluminum hydride The alternative synthesis is the condensation between indole-3-acetone and hydroxylamine, followed by reduction of the obtained ketoxime with lithium aluminum hydride.

### Analogues

Many analogues of aMT are known, including a-ethyltryptamine (aET), a-propyltryptamine (aPT), 4-methyl-aMT, 5-chloro-aMT (PAL-542), 5-fluoro-aMT (PAL-544), 5-fluoro-aET (PAL-545), 5-methoxy-aMT (5-MeO-aMT), a,N-dimethyltryptamine (a,N-DMT; N-methyl-aMT), a,N,N-trimethyltryptamine (a,N,N-TMT; N-dimethyl-aMT), a-methylserotonin (a-methyl-5-HT; 5-hydroxy-aMT), and indolylpropylaminopentane (IPAP; a,N-dipropyltryptamine or a,N-DPT), among others. Another analogue of aMT is the β-keto and N-methylated derivative BK-NM-AMT.
a-Methyltryptophan, a prodrug of a-methylserotonin, also metabolizes into aMT, but only in small amounts.
There are seven possible positional isomers of aminopropylindole (API; IT), wherein the side chain is located at different positions of the indole ring system. These positional isomers include 1-API (a-methylisotryptamine; isoAMT; PAL-569), 2-API, 3-API (3-IT; a-methyltryptamine; AMT; PAL-17), 4-API, 5-API (5-IT; 3,4-pyrrolo[b]amphetamine; PAL-571), 6-API, and 7-API. 3-API or AMT is an a-alkyltryptamine, 1-API or isoAMT is an isotryptamine, and 4-API, 5-API, 6-API, and 7-API are all amphetamines.
The analogue of AMT without the benzene part of the indole ring is 3-pyrrolylpropylamine.

## History

aMT has been said to have been first synthesized in 1947, alongside a-ethyltryptamine (aET). However, other sources suggest that aMT was first described in the scientific literature by at least 1929. It was specifically described as an antagonist of ergotamine at this time.
aMT started to be more intensively studied, along with aET, in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It was researched by Upjohn (code name U-14,164E) and Sandoz (code name IT-290) as a possible pharmaceutical drug and was simultaneously marketed in the Soviet Union as an antidepressant under the brand name Indopan or Indopane in the 1960s. However, the drug was used clinically for only a short period of time before being withdrawn.
aMT started being used as a recreational drug in the 1960s and use as a designer drug increased in the 1990s. It became a controlled substance in the United States in 2003.

## Society and culture

### Names

aMT never received a formal generic name. In the scientific literature, it has been referred to as a-methyltryptamine or alpha-methyltryptamine (abbreviated as a-MT, aMT, or AMT). aMT has also been referred to by developmental code names including IT-290 (Sandoz), NSC-97069, PAL-17, Ro 3-0926, and U-14,164E (Upjohn). In the Soviet Union, the drug was merely referred to by its brand name Indopan or Indopane. Other synonyms of aMT include 3-(2-aminopropyl)indole and 3-IT. (+)-aMT has been referred to by the code name IT-403.
