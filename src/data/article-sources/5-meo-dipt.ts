5-MeO-DiPT
 
Basics
 
by Erowid
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
5-MeO-DiPT is a pschoactive tryptamine, developed by Alexander Shulgin around 1980, now often known by its recently coined name "foxy". It was widely available on the research chemical market for several years prior to its scheduling in 2003. Reactions to 5-MeO-DIPT vary dramatically from those who find it compelling, sexy, exhilerating, interesting, & joyful to those who find it nauseating, irritating, diarrhea-inducing, and generally un-fun. It is available primarily in powder form--though it is also found in liquid and pressed tablets--and is almost always taken orally, though sometimes snorted. 
 
[ [Main 5-MeO-DiPT Vault](https://erowid.org/5meo_dipt.shtml) ]
 
[Dose](https://erowid.org/5meo_dipt_dose.shtml) #
 
A standard oral dose of 5-MeO-DiPT is between 5-30 mg.
 
Price #
 
Rare but sometimes sold at events for 5-20 USD per dose. Prior to being placed in Schedule I, 5-MeO-DIPT was available from exotic chemical suppliers for 225-300 USD per gram. Around the same from underground sources. (August 2000)
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/5meo_dipt_law.shtml) #
 
5-MeO-DiPT was placed into Schedule I through the emergency scheduling procedure on April 4, 2003. This makes it illegal to buy, sell, or possess without a DEA license. Germany is the only other country we are aware of where 5-MeO-DiPT is specifically listed as illegal.
 
[Chemistry](https://erowid.org/5meo_dipt_chemistry.shtml) #
 
N,N-diisopropyl-5-methoxy-tryptamine (5-MeO-DiPT) is a synthetic chemical tryptamine and thus is structurally related to other tryptamines (natural and synthetic), such as 5-MeO-DMT, N,N-DMT, psiloc(yb)in and serotonin.

History #
 
The first publication of the synthesis and pharmacology of this compound was in 1980 by Alexander Shulgin in Communications in Psychopharmacology. It remained an extremely obscure chemical until the late 1990s when it started being produced commercially as a research chemical.
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
The Substance:
 
5-MeO-DiPT; Foxy Methoxy; Foxy.
 
The Experience:
 
Tripping.
 
[EFFECTS](https://erowid.org/5meo_dipt_effects.shtml) #
 
5-MeO-DiPT is often characterized by a strong feeling in the body, sometimes described as buzzing or energy, which some users enjoy and others hate. The effects sought by users include moderate mood lift, euphoria, a sense of well-being, intensification of tactile sensations, visual effects, physcial and mental stimulation, occasional auditory distortions/shifts, and for some users, a significant erotic component. Visual effects may include open and closed eye patterning, movement trails, and brightening or shifting of colors. We have received no reports of completely engrossing visions or hallucinations, or of powerful entheogenic voyages with 5-MeO-DiPT.
 
Onset #
 
Depending on how much and how recently the user has eaten, oral 5-MeO-DiPT takes between 20-60 minutes to take effect. With smoked or inhaled vapors, effects begin within a few minutes.
 
Duration #
 
Due to the small number of reports and a wide variation in reported durations for this chemical, it is difficult to give reliable estimates of length of action. Some users have reported effects completely abating within 3-5 hours, with a short 1-2 hour peak, while others have reported strong residual stimulation and inability to sleep until 10-14 hours.
 
Visual Effects #
 
Visuals Summary Needed.
 
PROBLEMS #
 
Many users report disliking 5-MeO-DiPT. The most common reported reasons are : nausea, diarrhea & frequent bowel movements, unsettling / anxious stimulation, muscle tension, long tail duration and restless sleep the night after use. In the few accidental overdose reports we've received involving between 30 and 100 mg, the subjects have reported merely stronger effects and increased time on the toilet.
 
Contraindications #
 
- 5-MeO-DiPT and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination. It is likely that MAOIs could increase the effects of 5MeO-DIPT unpredictably. Taking this chemical while on prescription MAOIs is strongly discouraged. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorex or Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI. Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. Individuals currently in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval in their everyday lives should be careful about choosing to use psychedelics such as 5-MeO-DiPT as they can trigger even more difficulty. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because psychedelics have been known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
Not enough data exists to make reliable statements about the addiction potential of 5-MeO-DiPT, however, tryptamines of this class are not known for their addictiveness or tendency for compulsive use. As with most substances, some people may use it more frequently than they or their friends are comfortable with, but we have received no reports of this. As with many psychedelics, there is a short period of tolerance after use. Using 5-MeO-DiPT two days in a row is likely to lead to a diminished experience the second day, though spaced 5-7 or more days apart, this effect is nearly non-existent.

DESCRIPTION #
 
5-MeO-DIPT can be quite stimulating and is known for causing sweating. It gained a reputation for being a sex-drug after an early report described a sensual experience and a lurid article described it in PlayBoy. It is also well known for causing diarrhea and gas, although not in all users. 
 
 Though the peak effects are not exceedingly long, the lingering stimulation that can last for up to 12 hours (or more) after the peak has given it a reputation for being quite long. The after effects often include tense muscles and can sometimes include feelings of anxiety or inability to relax.

## SYNTHESIS

## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 6 mg, orally) âTalking wasnât really interesting, music wasnât interesting, nothing was very interesting. One hour in and I felt turned on as if a wave passed over my body, and then the wave went back to the ocean, or wherever waves go. I was getting hungry but I didnât want to go to the kitchen, as I didnât want to interact with anyone I might encounter. What remains with me the longest was the awareness of vibrations, and what felt best was the stillness. Was back to baseline in 4 hours.â

(with 7 mg, orally) âIn one hour I was in a marvelous, sexy place. Everything was shaded with eroticism. Sex was explosive, and in another three hours I was completely ready for the outside, public world. As a short term aphrodisiac, this leaves 2C-B in the dust.â

(with 10 mg, orally) âColors on the edges of the wiggles of the eye, a sort of Jessie Allen running design with color contrasts and sparkle. People's Peoples' faces were interesting, quite serious, and not completely friendly. Well after everything had cleared, later in the evening, there was a residual good clean feeling. This is a definite sense-distorter. I am not completely sure I like it.â

(with 10 mg, orally) âWe found it to be outstandingâcombining the best characteristics of two other like products while contributing a penetrating efficaciousness of its own.â

(with 12 mg, orally) âHad prepared for this experience during the day, and was looking forward to the time with my partner. Flowers, candles, fluffy pillows, arranged for food, etc. Large pillar type candles and the glow was nice and warm. Warm was comfort and comfort was good. Warm led into a wonderful sexual turn on, where my entire body was alive and alert. This was one hour into the trip. This wonderful sexual turn on was the feeling of a bud about to unfold into a full-blown beautiful flower, which happened during love making. The flower continued to fill out fuller and fuller for a couple of hours, and then just remained a full-blown beautiful wonderful flower, and I fell asleep with this feeling.â

(with 12 mg, orally) âRemembering how hungry I got during my last 6 mg experience and without any dietary restriction I ate a vegetarian burrito four hours earlier. It took an hour for me to turn on. I have never experienced such an increase of the peristalsis process in moving the burrito through my colon and with each defecation I would become a little more turned on. As I became more turned on the greater I felt the sense of hypertension. A mind/body load became uncomfortable. It was never psychedelic in the way of acid or psilocybe. My muscles, gluteus maximus, the lateral rotators that connect to the trochanter and the large muscles that connect to the hamstrings, all contracted and spasmed. Psychologically it was as though my conservative instinct, my sense of Being, became extremely agitated. I felt completely unnerved, with the only relief offered was by having sex. As the effects of this material were rather extreme, I never felt as though I was having a psychedelic experience. Maybe because it was all about dealing with body load and discomfort.â

(with 12 mg, orally) âThere was a very strange, almost paranoid session of listening to music, about an hour and a half into it. The program was a program of Irish music called âThe Thistle and Shamrockâ but I had paid no attention to the announcement. What was being played were three nativity pieces with song and words, from strange places. What I heard were three distant, fraudulent selections with generically meaningless words, mumbled so as to sound authentic. Everything was faked. It was âHearts of Spaceâ âhearts of spaceâ music in the worst possible taste. My neutral observer was completely taken in by it all, and quite enjoyed it. It turned out that I was wrong, the music was strange but of good quality. It was my interpretation that was screwed up.â

(with 12 mg, orally) âMy experience with this material was different in its action than anything I had tried in the pastâit came on quicker but with much less intensity. I really enjoyed the mellowness, and it sort of waved in and out. I came down after almost an hour, smoked a little marijuana, and went back up to where I had been previously. I could do this around my children, and they would know I was happy but I doubt doubted they would realize just exactly what was up. I liked it and would consider a public event (craft fair, street fair, window shopping) very adventurous. No hangover; sleep excellent.â

(with 12 mg, orally) âAwful, awful taste. Quickly aware and in the second half hour I rapidly shot up to a +++ in a very LSD-like manner, without the visuals. Time was quite slowed down during this come-on. Erotic world was fantastic, explosive, almost scary. Rapid drop-off, and by the fourth hour I am clear of any effects.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
But there are points that are neutral or actually negative, and they must be considered. A fair number of people who have explored 5-MeO-DIPT have said that there are some uncomfortable aspects with the experience. Not only are there few if any visual enhancements, but the altered state they entered was one that they simply couldnât use. They couldnât make intuitive leaps. That they were wasting their time.

On the neutral, but scientifically exciting, edge there is again some musical sound distortions that remind one of the actions of the analogue without the 5-methoxy group, DIPT. With DIPT, there was a physical harmonic distortion of the sounds that were heard. With 5-MeO-DIPT (again, two isopropyl groups on the basic nitrogen) these perversions involved musical character and interpretation. None of the comments suggested harmonic structure. I do believe that these two drugs, having such an intimate structural resemblance but with their different distortions of music interpretation, would be rewarding to explore more fully with the view of objectively defining these changes. 5-MeO-DIPT is a mixed bag. But it is a bag that I predict will demand a great deal of interest sometime in the future, especially if the erotic enhancement at a low dose proves to be a consistent property.

There is an interesting story associated with the first publication of the chemistry and pharmacology of this compound, in 1981. My co-author was a Michael Carter, in England. We had discussed a number of potentially interesting tryptamines and agreed upon making a small handful to make and evaluate. We had, some six years earlier, co-published a paper describing a new and exciting phenethylamine which we called 2C-B, and we expected to work together, in our separate labs, on a number of research projects. And indeed, I heard from Michael, from a new address, and he sent me his samples and reports of the new compounds we had decided to make, including 5-MeO-DIPT. Our synthetic materials were spectroscopically identical and the human trials had shown that they were very similar. Along with the samples and a letter there came the draft of a possible paper. I wrote back to Michael my own version of the paper, to his new address, and the letter was returned as undeliverableâno forwarding address available! Again I sent it back, with full first class postage and a clear request to forward it if necessaryâand this time it simply never came back at all.

The issue sat there for a year or two, and I hoped that something would occur. Nothing. I finally wrote to the telephone company in London (Michael had said something about eventually moving up to London) and asked if they could possibly send me the addresses of all the Michael F. Carter that had telephone service in the greater London area. Bless their hearts, they sent back a list of twenty names. And a statement that they were appreciative of having the middle initial, as without that the list would have been in the hundreds.

I wrote to each and every one of these Michael F. Carter the same letter phrased in a way that required no answer if it was the wrong person, but which would inspire immediate answer from the right Michael F. Carter. No answer. Was he alive? Could some unthinkable thing have happened to him associated with his drug experimentation, either personally or legally? There was absolutely no way to tell, so Michael, somewhere out there, if you read this please drop me a note if you wish to and are able to.

So I left the paper pretty much with his ideas in it, crossed my fingers as I used my address for both authors, and sent it off for publication. The paper appeared and I sincerely hope that I did the right thing.

**5-Methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine** (also known as **5-MeO-DiPT** , **Foxy** , and **Foxy Methoxy** ) is a novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class that produces [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Administered) . It is related in structure to [DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DiPT) and [5-MeO-MiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-MiPT) .

The first human trials of 5-MeO-DiPT were undertaken by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) in 1975. who would co-author and publish a paper detailing its synthesis and human psychopharmacology in 1981. A summary of the synthesis and reports of human use is included in Shulgin's 1997 book *[TiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TiHKAL)* ("Tryptamines I Have Known And Loved").

Anecdotal reports characterize the effects of this compound as highly [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulating) and mildly [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) , lacking in typical psychedelic visual distortions. Many users report strong physical and tactile effects that serve to [enhance libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido) and sexual pleasure. Many users note an unpleasant body load accompanies higher dosages. Some users also report sound distortion, which is also noted with the related compound, [DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DiPT) .

Very little is known about the pharmacological properties, metabolism and toxicity of 5-MeO-DiPT. It is relatively obscure and has a limited history of human use. It has been sold online as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) . It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

5-MeO-DiPT, or 5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine, is a synthetic indole alkaloid molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicylic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. 5-MeO-DiPT is substituted at R 5 of its indole heterocycle with a methoxy (MeO) functional group CH 3 O−; it also contains two isopropyl chains bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone (DiPT).

5-MeO-DiPT is the N-substituted diisopropyl homolog of [5-MeO-MiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-MiPT) .

## Pharmacology

The mechanism that produces the purported hallucinogenic and entheogenic effects of 5-MeO-DiPT is thought to result primarily from 5-HT 2A receptor agonism, although additional mechanisms of action such as monoamine oxidase inhibition (MAOI) may be involved also. The strongest receptor binding affinity for 5-MeO-DiPT is at the 5-HT 1A receptor. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

5-MeO-DiPT is neurotoxic in rats. </ref>

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: 5-MeO-DiPT](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_5MeODiPT.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

The long-term health effects of recreational 5-MeO-DiPT use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 5-MeO-DiPT is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage. The neurotoxic effects has been studies in rats.

Anecdotal reports suggest that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying it by itself at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Overdose

Excessive doses have caused [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , vomiting, agitation, [decreased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_blood_pressure) , [pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation) , [increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) , and hallucinations in a number of young adults. Rhabdomyolysis and renal failure occurred in one young man and another one died 3–4 hours after an apparent rectal overdose. A 24-year-old man also died of this compound being administered into the colon.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Like other [serotonergic psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelic) , 5-MeO-DiPT is not habit-forming.

Tolerance to the effects of 5-MeO-DiPT builds almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 5-MeO-DiPT presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 5-MeO-DiPT all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **2C-T-X** - Both classes of compounds can be unpredictable alone.
- **2C-X** - The 5-MeO psychedelics can interact unpredictably to potentiate other psychedelics.
- **Cannabis** - May increase the risk of negative psychological effects such as [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **DOx** - The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions, particularly increasing the risk of unpleasant physical side effects.
- **MDMA** - Some of the 5-MeO tryptamines are a bit unpredictable and should be mixed with MDMA with care.
- **Mescaline** - The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions.
- **NBOMe** - The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions and the NBOMes are known to be unpredictable even alone. This combination is best avoided.
- **Amphetamines** - The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants increase the chance of unpleasant thought loops. The combination is generally unnecessary because of the stimulating effects of psychedelics.
- **Cocaine** - The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants increase the chance of unpleasant thought loops. The combination is generally unnecessary because of the stimulating effects of psychedelics.
- **DXM** - Little information exists about this combination.
- **Tramadol** - Increased risk of [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .
- **aMT** - Increased risk of [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .
- **MAOIs** - Increased risk of [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .
- **PCP** - Little information exists about this combination. May increase risk of psychosis and excessive stimulation.

5-MeO-DiPT is a monoaminergic reuptake inhibitor (MRI). 5-MeO-DiPT and [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs) are a potentially dangerous combination. It is likely that MAOIs could increase the effects of 5-MeO-DiPT unpredictably. Taking this chemical while on prescription MAOIs is strongly discouraged.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-MeO-DiPT*

5-MeO-DiPT, also known as 5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine and sometimes as foxy methoxy or simply foxy, is an atypical psychedelic drug of the tryptamine and 5-methoxytryptamine families. It has unique and distinct effects from other serotonergic tryptamines, including some stimulant- and entactogen-like effects, robust tactile and sexual enhancement, and only light hallucinogenic effects. The drug is usually taken orally, but may also be used by other routes.
It acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors among others. Uniquely among most tryptamines, the drug has been found to produce serotonergic neurotoxicity and associated cognitive deficits in rodents reminiscent of but distinct from those observed with MDMA. Various severe and/or fatal intoxications associated with 5-MeO-DiPT have been reported in humans. It is the 5-methoxy derivative of diisopropyltryptamine (DiPT) and is an analogue of other psychedelic tryptamines like 4-HO-DiPT, 5-MeO-DMT, and 5-MeO-MiPT. 
5-MeO-DiPT was first described in the literature by Alexander Shulgin and colleagues in 1980. Subsequently, Shulgin described 5-MeO-DiPT in further detail in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved). The drug was first encountered as a novel designer drug in 1999. It is used recreationally as a "party drug" and sexual enhancer, with notable use among gay men and transgender women as part of "chemsex", although its use in general has declined over time and is rare. 5-MeO-DiPT became a controlled substance in the United States in 2003. The closely related drug 5-MeO-MiPT (moxy) has similar effects as 5-MeO-DiPT, remains legal in the United States and many other countries, and is often used as a substitute for 5-MeO-DiPT.

## Use and effects

In his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved) and other publications, Alexander Shulgin reported the dose of 5-MeO-DiPT to be 6 to 12 mg orally, its onset to be 20 to 30 minutes or within 1 hour, its time to peak effects to be 1 to 1.5 hours, and its duration to be 4 to 8 hours. However, in other publications besides TiHKAL he gave a dose range of 6 to 10 mg or a dose range of 8 to 12 mg. According to Shulgin, testing of 5-MeO-DiPT started at a dose of 0.1 mg and gradually titrated up in 10 human volunteers, with threshold effects occurring at a dose of 4 mg orally and full effects occurring at doses of 6 mg or more. The drug's has been described as "fast-acting" and its duration has also been reported to be "short-lived" and as brief as 3 to 6 hours. In addition to oral administration, 5-MeO-DiPT has been reported to be used less commonly by smoking, insufflation, or intravenous injection. Forms known to be used include powder, tablets, and capsules.
The psychedelic or perceptual effects of 5-MeO-DiPT have been reported to include colors on edges of eyesight, color contrasts and sparkle, altered facial perception, sensory distortion, few if any visual enhancements, some closed-eye imagery but only at high doses, feelings of strangeness, objects having special significance, some musical sound distortions reminiscent of those of DiPT, music sounding strange and fake, time dilation, having only mild hallucinogenic effects, outgoing rather than inwardly reflective intellectual activation, lack of intuitive leaps, and a wave-like experience wherein the effects "waved in and out". Affective and behavioral effects have included stimulation, some entactogen-like effects, talkativeness, disinhibition, emotional enhancement, opening of affect, easy emotional expression, easy communication with others, reduced guards and reservations, relaxation, feeling happy, mild euphoria, and mellowness. In addition, the drug has been reported to produce tactile or sensual enhancement, one's body feeling alive and alert, feeling like waves are passing back and forth over one's body, awareness of vibrations, feeling sexually aroused, and "dramatic" erotic or sexual enhancement.
Negative emotional and behavioral effects have included uncomfortableness, agitation, feeling unnerved, paranoia, and social avoidance, but no hangover. 5-MeO-DiPT has been described as having minimal physical side effects and as being relatively free of autonomic side effects and indicators of toxicity. Reported physical side effects have included body load and discomfort, slight pupil dilation, mild nausea, some muscular hyperreflexia, muscle contractions and spasms, gastrointestinal disturbances, hypertension, and little change in appetite or sleep disruption. The effects of 5-MeO-DiPT have been described as either being "positive" or a "mixed bag". User responses are said to vary dramatically, with some people finding it appealing, sexual, invigorating, interesting, and enjoyable, and others finding it nauseating, annoying, diarrhea-inducing, and generally unpleasant.
5-MeO-DiPT has been described as LSD-like in some ways but as being quite different from other psychedelics. Descriptions have included the drug never being psychedelic in the way of classical psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin, there being an absence of intense sensory disturbances or hallucinogenic effects as with other psychedelics like dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and psilocybin, never feeling as though one was having a psychedelic experience, and being able to function normally on a social level including at public events even at high doses. However, one user who took a high dose described reaching a "plus-three" on the Shulgin Rating Scale in a very LSD-like manner but without the visuals. Higher doses may produce more psychedelic effects, but the drug is still described as not that psychedelic even at such doses. Despite its lack of robust hallucinogenic effects at typical doses, 5-MeO-DiPT is described as nonetheless producing quite profound emotional and intellectual modifications.
5-MeO-DiPT is reported to differ in its subjective effects from the structurally related DiPT in most respects but to share some auditory effects with this drug. In terms of these effects, whereas DiPT caused harmonic distortion of heard sounds, 5-MeO-DiPT caused changes in musical character and interpretation without apparent changes in harmonic structure. As such, while both produced auditory effects, DiPT and 5-MeO-DiPT caused different distortions of musical interpretation. 5-MeO-DiPT has been described as a "psychedelic stimulant" and has a reputation as a "sexual enhancer" or "aphrodisiac". Among its effects, the pro-sexual effects of 5-MeO-DiPT have been especially highlighted, with these effects being present at low doses. Users have remarked that it took them to a "marvelous sexy place", that "everything [was] shaded with eroticism", that the "erotic world was fantastic, explosive, almost scary", and that the drug may vie with 2C-B as a sexual enhancer or that it left 2C-B "in the dust" in this regard.
5-MeO-DiPT has been described as having effects similar to those of 5-MeO-MiPT and these drugs as having unique and distinct effects from those of other psychedelic tryptamines. They are reported to be very pro-sexual, much more stimulant, and more like party drugs than other tryptamines. While 5-MeO-DiPT and 5-MeO-MiPT are described as pro-sexual, they may not be innately aphrodisiac but instead may produce tactile enhancement in a way that lends itself to sex. The tactile enhancement and "body high" with 5-MeO-DiPT and 5-MeO-MiPT may in part be why they have been compared to entactogens like MDMA. 5-MeO-DiPT has been described as being closer to MDMA in its effects than to psychedelic tryptamines and that the effects are a "body high kind of thing". The drug is also known to be combined with other drugs such as MDMA.

## Side effects

Flashbacks have been reported with 5-MeO-DiPT. There is a report of a prolonged delusional state associated with 5-MeO-DiPT.

## Overdose

Excessive doses or overdose have caused clinical intoxication, characterized by nausea, vomiting, agitation, hypotension, mydriasis, tachycardia, and hallucinations, in a number of young adults. A number of these overdoses are attributed to the drug's delayed onset of action, where first time users, who were unfamiliar with the drug, administered a second dose after initially feeling no effects. Rhabdomyolysis and renal failure occurred in one young man and another one died 3 to 4 hours after an apparent rectal overdose. There have been a number of published cases of severe and/or fatal intoxication with 5-MeO-DiPT.

## Interactions

The effects of 5-MeO-DiPT may be potentiated when used in combination with cannabis.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

5-MeO-DiPT acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors, among others. It has shown variably strong preference for the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor in terms of binding affinity, with 2-fold, 25-fold, >76-fold, and 161-fold higher for this receptor over the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor in different studies. However, in terms of receptor activation, 5-MeO-DiPT showed similar potency at the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor and the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and had several-fold preference for these receptors over the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor.
In addition to its direct serotonin receptor interactions, 5-MeO-DiPT is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor with potency ranging from similar to its serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonism to very low in different studies. Conversely, it does not significantly affect dopamine or norepinephrine reuptake and shows no activity as a monoamine releasing agent. The drug can block the serotonin release induced by methamphetamine in vitro. 5-MeO-DiPT can elevate brain serotonin levels in rodents, presumably via its serotonin reuptake inhibition. The elevations in serotonin levels caused by 5-MeO-DiPT may be limited by its concomitant serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonism, as serotonin 5-HT1A receptors serve as inhibitory autoreceptors that limit serotonin release. By an unknown mechanism, but possibly serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonism, 5-MeO-DiPT may also elevate brain dopamine levels in rodents, including in the prefrontal cortex, striatum, and/or nucleus accumbens, although findings are mixed. The mechanism of action of the psychedelic effects of 5-MeO-DiPT is thought to be serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonism, but its full mechanism of action is unclear and additional mechanisms may also be involved.
5-MeO-DiPT produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic-like effects, in rodents. As with many other psychedelics, this follows an inverted U-shaped dose–response curve. The head-twitch response induced by 5-MeO-DiPT is blocked by serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists such as volinanserin. 5-MeO-DiPT's head-twitch response is described as robust but also weak and much lower in magnitude than that produced by other serotonergic psychedelics such as 5-MeO-DMT or DOM. The serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonism of 5-MeO-DiPT may inhibit its serotonin 5-HT2A receptor-mediated head-twitch response. 5-MeO-DiPT partially substitutes for LSD in rodent drug discrimination tests, with 52% responding at 1 mg/kg, 75% responding at 3 mg/kg, and behavioral disruption at higher doses. In addition, it substitutes for DOM in rodent drug discrimination tests. The stimulus properties of 5-MeO-DiPT in LSD substitution tests are completely and insurmountably blocked by the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist volinanserin. Conversely, they are partially and surmountably blocked by the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635. Besides psychedelic-like effects, 5-MeO-DiPT also produces hypolocomotion and hypothermia in rodents and potentiates the forepaw treading induced by the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT.
5-MeO-DiPT has been reported to produce neurotoxicity in rodents. Administration of 5-MeO-DiPT to adolescent rodents produced marked decreases in spatial navigation performance in adulthood that were suggestive of deficits in cognitive flexibility, attention, and/or perseveration as well as other cognitive deficits. This was associated with serotonergic neurotoxicity and substantial 26 to 49% reductions in cortical and hippocampal serotonin levels that were analogous to those occurring with MDMA. However, the neurotoxic effects of 5-MeO-DiPT are described as less severe than and distinct from those of MDMA. The drug has also been reported to produce cytotoxicity as well as neurotoxic effects on serotonergic neurons ex vivo. The mechanisms underlying the serotonergic neurotoxicity of 5-MeO-DiPT are unknown. The drug might also produce prolonged dopaminergic adaptations or dopaminergic neurotoxicity in rodents as evidenced by long-lasting decreases in dopamine levels. In addition, it has been associated with marked genotoxicity or oxidative DNA damage, which has also been seen with MDMA and methamphetamine. It is said to be the first known tryptamine to be associated with such toxicity.

#### Positional isomers

4-MeO-DiPT, 6-MeO-DiPT, and 7-MeO-DiPT are known positional isomers of 5-MeO-DiPT. 6-MeO-DiPT and 7-MeO-DiPT have been described by Alexander Shulgin as being inactive at doses of up to 50 mg and 70 mg orally, respectively, whereas 4-MeO-DiPT was not assessed.

## History

5-MeO-DiPT was discovered in the 1970s and was first described by Alexander Shulgin and Michael Carter in 1980. Shulgin tested it and discovered its effects starting in 1975. The drug started to be encountered as a novel recreational and designer drug in 1999. 5-MeO-DiPT became a temporarily controlled substance in the United States in 2003 and a permanently controlled substance in 2004. The recreational use of 5-MeO-DiPT appears to have declined over time and its use is described as being not very prevalent.

## Society and culture

### Recreational use

Use of 5-MeO-DiPT has been found to be particularly prevalent among gay men who use drugs as part of chemsex. It is also seen in transgender women. The drug is described as a stimulant, sexual enhancer, party drug, and light psychedelic. 5-MeO-DiPT has been associated with increased risk of HIV diagnosis in multiple studies in Asia, perhaps due to risky sexual behavior involving the drug.

Sveriges riksdags health ministry Statens folkhälsoinstitut classified 5-MeO-DiPT as "health hazard" under the act Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor (translated Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) as of Oct 1, 2004,  in their regulation SFS 2004:696 listed as 5-metoxi-N,N-diisopropyltryptamin (5-MeO-DIPT), making it illegal to sell or possess.

#### United States

On April 4, 2003, the United States DEA added both 5-MeO-DiPT and α-methyltryptamine (AMT) to Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act under "emergency scheduling" procedures. The drugs were officially placed into Schedule I on September 29, 2004. Prior to its prohibition in the U.S., 5-MeO-DiPT was sold online alongside psychoactive analogues such as diisopropyltryptamine (DiPT), and dipropyltryptamine (DPT), neither of which have yet been expressly outlawed.
