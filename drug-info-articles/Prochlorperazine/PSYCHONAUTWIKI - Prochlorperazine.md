**Prochlorperazine** ( **Compazine** , **Stemzine** , **Buccastem M** , **Stemetil** , **Phenotil** ) is a [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) D2 [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) [antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antagonist) that belongs to the [phenothiazine](/w/index.php?title=Phenothiazine&action=edit&redlink=1) class of [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) agents that are used for the treatment of nausea and vertigo. It is also a highly potent typical antipsychotic and is 10–20× more potent than chlorpromazine. It is also used to treat migraine headaches.

## Chemistry

Prochlorperazine is a piperazine derivative of the phenothiazine class of organic compounds. Prochlorperazine contains a thiazine ring, a six-member ring which includes one nitrogen and one sulfur atom. The thiazine ring is fused to two benzene rings, creating a tricyclic phenothiazine. Prochlorperazine contains a chlorine atom bound to R 2 of the phenothiazine group.

Additionally, there is a three carbon propyl chain bound at R 10 to the nitrogen atom of the structure. The propyl chain is bound at its terminal carbon to a piperazine ring at R 1 . Piperazine is a six-membered saturated ring with two nitrogen atoms at positions 1 and 4. The piperazine ring of prochlorperazine is also substituted at R 4 with a methyl group. Prochlorperazine is found in pills as a maleate. It is analogous to [chlorpromazine](/w/index.php?title=Chlorpromazine&action=edit&redlink=1) , another antipsychotic phenothiazine.

## Pharmacology

Prochlorperazine is thought to exert its [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) effects by blocking [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) receptors.

Prochlorperazine is analogous to [chlorpromazine](/w/index.php?title=Chlorpromazine&action=edit&redlink=1) ; both of these agents [antagonize](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antagonist) [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) D2 receptors in various pathways of the central nervous system. This D2 blockade results in antipsychotic, antiemetic and other effects.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

- The general head space of prochlorperazine is often described as one of sleepiness, emptiness, apathy, stupor and catatonia. The specific cognitive effects can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include: 
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)**
- **[Creativity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_suppression)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

Nervous system side effects have been associated with the use of prochlorperazine. [Extrapyramidal side effects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrapyramidal_symptoms) such as acute [dystonic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystonia) reactions, [pseudoparkinsonism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinsonism) (not to be confused with Parkinson's disease), or akathisia can affect 2% of patients at low doses, whereas higher doses may affect as many as 40% of patients.

Prochlorperazine can also cause a life-threatening condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Some symptoms of NMS include a high fever, stiff muscles, confusion, irregular pulse or blood pressure, a fast heart rate (tachycardia), sweating, or irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias).

### Lethal dosage

The lethal dosage of this compound is unknown. Symptoms of overdose, however, may include agitation, coma, confusion, difficulty breathing, fainting, irregular heartbeat, loss of consciousness, muscle spasms, uncontrolled muscle movements, restlessness, seizures, severe constipation, stomach pain, severe drowsiness, dizziness, tremors, or trouble urinating.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other antipsychotics, dependence can be present with long-term use and is both physical and psychological dependence. When physical dependence has developed, withdrawal symptoms may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.
