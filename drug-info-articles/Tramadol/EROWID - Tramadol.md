Tramadol
 
Dose
 
by Erowid
 
DOSAGE DESCRIPTION #
 
Caution : Dose information should not be taken as recommendations. [ see below ]
 
**Tramadol Dosages**
**Oral**
- Threshold: 25 mg
- Light: 50-100 mg
- Common: 75 - 200 mg
- Strong: 250+ mg
 
Tramadol is considered a relatively mild opioid: causing analgesia (pain reduction), lethargy, and mild euphoria. Tramadol has a distinct pharmacology from morphine-type opioids. At doses over 200mg, Tramadol is known to interact differently with stimulants. There are deaths associated with high dose tramadol caused by seizure-type effects rather than opioid-type breathing suppression. Therapeutic ("common") dose tramadol is one of the World Health Organization's "Essential Medicines", but recreational doses, especially when combined with stimulants, poses complex health risks to some people. Naloxone does not reverse the seizure-type effects of high dose tramadol plus stimulant.
 
NOTES #
 
**HIGH DOSE DANGER** : Doses over 300 mg can be physically dangerous in non-tolerated or smaller users.
 **TRAMADOL** : Ultram is produced by Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical. Ultram comes in 50 mg tablets and is taken orally. It is prescribed at 50-100 mg every 4 to 6 hours, not to exceed 400 mg per day. 
 
 **ULTRACET** : Ultracet is produced by Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical. It comes in tablet form and is taken orally. Each tablet contains both 37.5 mg tramadol and 325 mg acetaminophen/paracetamol. Acetaminophen can cause liver problems at high doses. It may not be safe for heavy alcohol drinkers or those with liver problems to take even moderately high levels of acetaminophen.
 
CAUTION & DISCLAIMER #
 
Every individual reacts differently to every chemical. 
 
 Erowid's dosage information is a summary of data gathered from users, research, and other resources. This information is intended to describe the range of dosages people report using. It should not be construed as a recommendation of any sort. Individuals can respond very differently to the same dosage. What is safe for one can be deadly for another.

*** Every individual reacts differently to every substance. * Be mindful at every step. * Know your body. Know your mind. Know your source.** **Drug Interactions:** 
 There are case reports of people having bad reactions when mixing tramadol with [SSRIs](https://erowid.org/chemicals/ssris/ssris.shtml) . This may include potentially life-threatening adverse reactions such as serotonin syndrome. (Australian Adverse Drug Reactions Bulletin 20:4 Dec 2001) 
 
 **Seizures:** 
 Tramadol has been associated with seizure activity, especially when taken at high doses, when taken for multiple days in a row, and in combination with other pharmaceuticals.

Tramadol (Ultram) is unscheduled in the United States, but is available by prescription only. This means that sales and distribution are allowed only by those with a license and only to those with a prescription (according to FDA regulations). Possession is not illegal even without a prescription.

Tramadol is available as 'Tramacet' and Zytram (XL). Tramacet is a combination pill containing tramadol (37.5 mg) and acetaminophen (325 mg). (Perhaps identical to the 'Ultracet' combo pill available in the US.).

Iran #
 
A visitor writes that: Tramadol was widely available over-the-counter in Iran without a prescription (particulary major cities) until late 2009, but its sale was prohibited by the Ministery of Health. Tramadol is widely available with prescription in pharmacies. Tramadol is manufactured in Iran under a range of different brand names by up to 10 Iranian pharmaceutical companies, and is also imported from one or two foreign companies, mainly from Germany, the UK, and India. Most common now are 100 mg/50 mg tablets, 100 mg Extended release tablets and 50 mg/100 mg capsules. Sometimes 50 mg and 100 mg ampules are also available (all with a prescription).

Japan #
 
A visitor described that Tramadol is likely to be reclassified as controlled in Japan in 2012, though as of May 2012, it is legal to import up to a 60 day supply for personal use as long as one has a simplified license to import: "I have recently imported tramadol for the treatment of Migraines to Japan and it got stopped at customs. I was forced to apply for a license in order to continue to delivery. In previous years I was able to receive the delivery normally. It's only now that it has been put up for review that it has become difficult. The license is easy enough to acquire , it consists of a few questions about your health and an agreement that the medicine is for personal use only. Also, if you import under 2 months worth of medicine. In the case of Tramadol this is 19,200mg (in other words 50mg caps x 384) in total then you can avoid the additional paperwork and signatures of qualified medical personnel." (unconfirmed) (thanks r) (last updated May 12, 2012)

Mexico #
 
We have received conflicting reports, one saying that tramadol (50 mg units) are available in Mexico without a prescription (thanks Peter, DME,jf) as Velodrol and Tramal, but another writer says that the bottles are clearly marked for prescription-sale only. Although many Mexican pharmacies will sell it without a prescription, one can be detained, arrested, or forced to pay a bribe if found in possession of tramadol without a proper prescription. (unconfirmed) (thanks WVR) 
 
 Bluestem writes in Mar 2007: "I have been using tramadol for years for chronic pain & depression. It is easy & cheap to obtain in Tiajuana, and I even showed it to customs & they said my 4 bottles of 50 mg tramadol tablets were perfectly legal to bring back into the U.S. I found the cheapest prices in the tourist areas, with 'real' pharmacies being quite a bit more expensive. A generic, very effective, is known as Citra 50 Tramadol. 100 ct 50 mg tablets run $40-$45." 
 
 In Nov 2007 VH adds: "No prescription needed - I did take bottle for the border just in case. There were no problems. This was Tijuana." 
 
 In August, 2009, jf writes: "I've found most local pharmacies (not large chain stores) will sell tramadol without even throwing the customer a weary eye. These pharmacies sell 10 packs of 50 mg a pill for the equivalent of around 3.50 US dollars per pack. I only ever travel to southern Mexico."

United Arab Emirates (UAE) #
 
One visitor reminds us that countries like the UAE have EXTREMELY harsh penalties for violating their drug laws, especially around opioids. Googling UAE and opium or poppy will find news stories documenting years of prison for trivial amounts of accidentally "imported" opioids by visitors. They write : "Tramadolt is prescription only and regulated by the government. This means that only specialists in medicine (surgeons) can prescribe a 4 week supply (only 4 weeks at a time) and the government reviews each and every prescription (as in, count every capsule) as well as the patient and doctor prescribing it. Non-surgeons such as internists, can only prescribe for 2 weeks (nurses cannot) and at A&E, only 2 days can be given when discharged. Tramadol is regulated highly and is the strongest opiate available (morphine and codeine are banned and treated as illegal). Having tramadol without prescription or giving it to someone can result in 4 years in prison. Quite likely the same for importing for personal use but I didn't dare to buy some from overseas. Also, acquiring tramadol via a doctor is very difficult, you must have a serious pain condition to get even 200mgs/day prescribed. Not worth the effort and there are a lot of horror stories surrounding this country and expats bringing in controlled drugs."
