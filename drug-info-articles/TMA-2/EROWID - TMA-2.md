TMA-2
 
Basics
 
by Erowid
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
TMA-2, or 2,4,5-TrimethoxyAmphetamine, is a synthetic chemical that is related to, but more potent than mescaline. It has both stimulant and psychedelic effects. It's qualitative effects on mood alteration and sensory enhancement are similar to mescaline. 
 
[ [Main TMA-2 Vault](https://erowid.org/tma2.shtml) ]
 
[Dose](https://erowid.org/tma2_dose.shtml) #
 
10-50 mg. Dr. Shulgin suggests that there is only a small margin between the dose needed to produce psychoactive effects and a toxic dose (Shulgin, 1976). Toxic dose in humans is not known.
 
Price #
 
Price Summary Needed.
 
Law #
 
TMA is a schedule I substance in the United States, making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess. TMA-2 - TMA-6 are all positional isomers of TMA, making them schedule I substances as well. TMA-2 has been placed in Schedule I by the U.N. Narcotics Commission.
 
Chemistry #
 
2,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine (TMA-2) is a synthetic chemical which can be derived from the Calamus root's active ingredient Asarone.
 
Pharmacology #
 
TMA-2 is known to be a 5-HT2 agonist.

History #
 
TMA-2 was first synthesized in 1933 and it's psychoactive properties were recognized by A. Shulgin in 1962.

No common terms known.

PROBLEMS #
 
Although TMA-2 has some stimulant effects, one researcher found high doses of TMA-2 caused bradycardia (slow heart) and hypothermia (low temperature) in rats (Mallaret 2003, Ho 1970). There are too few reports to sanity-check whether these findings hold true for humans. 
 
 Because of its psychedelic properties, mental health risks are assumed to be similar to those of other hallucinogens and psychedelic-crisis management is appropriate for acute handling of anxiety and panic reactions. More severe schizophrenic or psychotic reactions would be handled as with other hallucinogen precipitated mental crises.
 
Contraindications #
 
- Do not take TMA-2 if you are currently taking an MAOI. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorex or Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). 2C-B and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination. Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI. Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. If you have a seizure or convulsive disorder or heart problems, you may be at higher risk for health problems when taking TMA-2. Diabetics should monitor their blood sugar closely as there have been some reports of problems. Individuals currently in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval in their everyday lives should be careful about choosing to use psychedelics such as TMA-2 as they can trigger even more difficulty. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because psychedelics have been known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
direct data about this exists, but the addiction potential of TMA-2 is considered to be extremely low due to its psychedelic effects. Summary Needed.
