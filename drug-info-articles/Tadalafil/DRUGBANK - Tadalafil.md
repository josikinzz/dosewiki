*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00820*

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as beta carbolines. These are compounds containing a 9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole moiety.

### Background

Tadalafil is a selective phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor that is used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and benign prostatic hypertrophy.
8
,
9
It was first approved in 2003 by the FDA for use in ED and later in 2009 for PAH. In contrast to other PDE5 inhibitors like
sildenafil
, tadalafil has greater selectivity for PDE5 and a longer half-life which has made it a more suitable option for chronic once-daily dosing in the treatment of PAH.
2

### Indication

Tadalafil is indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) and either alone or in combination with
finasteride
for the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH).
7
,
11
It is also indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) both alone and in combination with
macitentan
or other endothelin-1 antagonists.
8
,
9
,
12

### Pharmacodynamics

Tadalafil exerts a therapeutic effect in ED by increasing sexual stimulation-dependant smooth muscle relaxation in the penis, allowing the corpus cavernosum to fill with blood to produce an erection.
2
,
3
Smooth muscle relaxation in the pulmonary vasculature helps to produce vasodilation in PAH which reduces blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries.
3
In BPH, tadalafil may contribute to decreased smooth muscle cell proliferation which may reduce the size of the prostate and relieve the anatomical obstruction which produces urinary symptoms of BPH.
4
The decreased affinity of tadalafil for PDE6 compared to other PDE5 inhibitors may explain the reduced incidence of visual side effects.

### Mechanism of Action

cGMP-specific 3',5'-cyclic phosphodiesterase
Inhibitor

### Absorption

Tadalafil has a tmax of 0.5-6h with a median of 2h in healthy adults.
1
,
7
The tmax in adults with PAH is reported as 2-8h with a median of 4h.
8
There does not appear to be a significant effect on absorption when tadalafil is taken with food.
1

### Metabolism

Tadalafil undergoes hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4 to a catechol metabolite.
1
,
5
,
7
,
8
This catechol metabolite undergoes subsequent methylation and glucuronidation with the methyl-glucuronide metabolite becoming the primary metabolite in circulation. None of the known metabolites are considered to be active.

### Toxicity

Symptoms of overdose are expected to be similar to typical adverse effects which may include headache, dyspepsia, back pain, myalgia, nasopharyngitis, and dizziness.
7
,
8
Standard supportive care is recommended. Hemodialysis is not expected to contribute significantly to tadalafil clearance.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

Abacavir
Tadalafil may decrease the excretion rate of Abacavir which could result in a higher serum level.
Abaloparatide
Abaloparatide may increase the hypotensive activities of Tadalafil.
Abametapir
The serum concentration of Tadalafil can be increased when it is combined with Abametapir.
Acebutolol
Tadalafil may increase the hypotensive activities of Acebutolol.
Aceclofenac
The therapeutic efficacy of Tadalafil can be decreased when used in combination with Aceclofenac.

### Food Interactions

Avoid excessive or chronic alcohol consumption. Ingesting excess amounts of alcohol (more than four drinks in a short time) may potentiate the hypotension and dizziness caused by tadalafil.
Avoid grapefruit products. Tadalafil is metabolized by CYP3A4, and grapefruit products are CYP3A4 inhibitors; therefore, coadministration may increase serum levels of tadalafil and result in increased hypotension.
Take with or without food.

### Mechanism of action

Tadalafil is a selective phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor that produces several downstream effects with the most common therapeutic effect being smooth muscle relaxation.
7
Patients may experience ED due to a variety of causes including psychogenic, neurogenic, vasculogenic, iatrogenic, or endocrine.
6
These causes result in dysfunction of penile smooth muscle relaxation through either disrupted neuronal signaling or direct influence on smooth muscle cells. During sexual arousal, non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) neurons release nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide stimulates guanylate cyclase which converts guanosine triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).
2
,
3
cGMP activates the cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG) in a signal cascade which activates K+ channels leading to inhibition of Ca2+ channels, inhibits platelet activation, and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation while inducing apoptosis. This signal cascade is attenuated by PDE5 which breaks the phosphodiester bond of cGMP, converting it to GMP. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil increases signaling via the PKG cascade which supports penile smooth muscle relaxation during sexual arousal by decreasing Ca2+ entry into smooth muscle cells. This smooth muscle relaxation allows blood to fill the corpus cavernosum thereby producing an erection.
In PAH, blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries is raised due to a variety of mechanisms stemming from endothelial dysfunction.
3
Decreased production of NO and prostacyclin reduce vasodilatory signaling while overproduction of endothelin-1 and thromboxane increase vasoconstriction. Inflammation, thromboses, and hypoxia later contribute to vascular remodeling which further reduces luminal size. The resultant increase in blood pressure reduces the capacity for gas exchange and increases afterload at the right ventricle, producing symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and dizziness as well as leading to right-sided heart failure. Tadalafil exerts its therapeutic effect in PAH through boosting NO-cGMP signaling to contribute to smooth muscle relaxation as with ED.
Lastly, tadalafil is used to treat BPH.
7
BPH produces urinary dysfunction through hyperproliferation of the epithelial and smooth muscle layers of the prostate.
4
The increased size of the prostate blocks urine flow through the urethra resulting in higher residual volumes due to incomplete emptying. Tadalafil does not appear to exert its benefit via smooth muscle relaxation of the prostate. It may instead exert its effect through a mix of increased oxygenation and decreased inflammation, which decreases tissue remodeling, and inhibition of cell proliferation through the cGMP cascade.
The decreased affinity for PDE6 compared to other PDE5 inhibitors may explain the decreased incidence of visual side effects as PDE6 is present in the eye and contributes to color vision.

### General Function

A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of sterols, steroid hormones, retinoids and fatty acids (PubMed:10681376, PubMed:11093772, PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317, PubMed:14559847, PubMed:15373842, PubMed:15764715, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20702771, PubMed:21490593, PubMed:21576599). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds (PubMed:12865317, PubMed:14559847, PubMed:15373842, PubMed:15764715, PubMed:21490593, PubMed:21576599, PubMed:2732228). Exhibits high catalytic activity for the formation of hydroxyestrogens from estrone (E1) and 17beta-estradiol (E2), namely 2-hydroxy E1 and E2, as well as D-ring hydroxylated E1 and E2 at the C-16 position (PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317, PubMed:14559847). Plays a role in the metabolism of androgens, particularly in oxidative deactivation of testosterone (PubMed:15373842, PubMed:15764715, PubMed:22773874, PubMed:2732228). Metabolizes testosterone to less biologically active 2beta- and 6beta-hydroxytestosterones (PubMed:15373842, PubMed:15764715, PubMed:2732228). Contributes to the formation of hydroxycholesterols (oxysterols), particularly A-ring hydroxylated cholesterol at the C-4beta position, and side chain hydroxylated cholesterol at the C-25 position, likely contributing to cholesterol degradation and bile acid biosynthesis (PubMed:21576599). Catalyzes bisallylic hydroxylation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (PubMed:9435160). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of PUFA with a preference for the last double bond (PubMed:19965576). Metabolizes endocannabinoid arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide) to 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid ethanolamides (EpETrE-EAs), potentially modulating endocannabinoid system signaling (PubMed:20702771). Plays a role in the metabolism of retinoids. Displays high catalytic activity for oxidation of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinal, a rate-limiting step for the biosynthesis of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) (PubMed:10681376). Further metabolizes atRA toward 4-hydroxyretinoate and may play a role in hepatic atRA clearance (PubMed:11093772). Responsible for oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics. Acts as a 2-exo-monooxygenase for plant lipid 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol) (PubMed:11159812). Metabolizes the majority of the administered drugs. Catalyzes sulfoxidation of the anthelmintics albendazole and fenbendazole (PubMed:10759686). Hydroxylates antimalarial drug quinine (PubMed:8968357). Acts as a 1,4-cineole 2-exo-monooxygenase (PubMed:11695850). Also involved in vitamin D catabolism and calcium homeostasis. Catalyzes the inactivation of the active hormone calcitriol (1-alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3)) (PubMed:29461981)
