## Subjective Experience

This is one that almost got away. It was a freebie; a single pill in a packet, given to
me by a head shop in Manchester after I had purchased a number of other items, and
engaged in a chat about the market. It was months later that I decided to try it, albeit
with a little trepidation, given multiple online reports of high body load.

I experienced relatively little in terms of nausea or general malaise, but equally, not
an all firing or visual psychedelic trip either. Yes, I was psychoactively aware, with a
vague psychedelic headspace, but it was not a particularly strong or exciting one.

Unable to have a second spin of the wheel, with AMT no longer available, I could only
speculate three reasons: I didn’t take enough (despite reference dose sources
indicating otherwise), the AMT had degraded by the time I consumed it or the set
and setting was wrong for the context of the trip.

If it was still accessible I would probably sample this again, but under significantly
different conditions.
