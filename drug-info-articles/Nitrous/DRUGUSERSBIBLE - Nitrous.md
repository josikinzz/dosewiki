## Subjective Experience

At time of writing (2017) this is extremely popular, particularly on the club scene.

For my own experiment, I elected to use the balloon method, which is commonly
considered to provide one of the safer forms of inhalation. Using a device known as
an N2O Cracker, two canisters were blown into a balloon. The content of this was
then inhaled and held. This had an immediate effect, in that my headspace dissipated
and appeared to distance from my physical being, but it was quick; too quick. It was a
wham bam type of hit, with little fulfilment or pleasure.

During the aftermath I felt strangely calm and was almost sedated for a period, at
least to a small degree. Perhaps this is part of the attraction, but for me, it wasn't a
particularly rewarding experience.

I have an inkling that starting from a different state of mind might provide a more
positive outcome, and in some cases, act as a reset button in terms of mood. I should
add, however, that this is largely speculation.
