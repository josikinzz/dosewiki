Hydroxetamine (3'-hydroxy-2-oxo-PCE, O-desmethylmethoxetamine, HXE) is a recreational designer drug from the arylcyclohexylamine family, with dissociative effects. It is known as an active metabolite of the dissociative designer drug methoxetamine, but has also been sold in its own right since late 2019.
