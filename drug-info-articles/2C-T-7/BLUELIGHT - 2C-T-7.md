Original post:


A little more insight into why you need to be careful with 2CT7 dosages. What can be intense for one person can do nothing for another.

3 of us tried 2CT7, 2 for the 2nd time, 1 for the first.  We all had eaten very lightly during the previous 24 hours.

I upped my previous dose from 12.5mg (threshold effects only) to 22.5 (more later). R went from 15 (full blown effects) to 17.5mg. K tried 20mg. I am 190lbs, R is 230, K is 140?. Our absolute measuring accuracy is probably good to within 15%. Relatively, we're probably good to 5%. 

Alerts started about T+1:00. Had very slight nausea  at about T+2:00. (Less than, for instance, I would expect from 5-meo-dipt). I helped things along with a couple tokes at about 2 hours, and immediately ended up in a really interesting place. Lots of colors, patterns, and odd visualizations. Time quite warped. Time-sense fairly off. No loss of coordination. Come down started at about T+6:00. A high +2 experience. Probably try 30mg next time.

R had a good experience with no naseau or problems. 

K had only threshold effects at 20mg... never really got going, despite the fact that K weighs 30-50% less than R and I. 

Just an example of how differently people can react to a given dosage of this one.

why don't you look on 

[www.erowid.org](http://www.erowid.org) 

in the 2c-t-7 section...

there they have plenty of info about the deaths that have occured whilst combining 2c-t-7 with MDMA...

I doesn't happen to everyone but is it really worth the risk?

**2ct7 - 15mg or 20mg?**


i have 20mg of 2ct7 left out of 30mg.  first time i took 10mg and got nothing.  i dont want a heavy trip but want to be sure of getting something noticable out of it.  will 20mg be too much?  

also, is it the sort of drug that is mild (in low/moderate dose) and so ok to do by yourself?

How are you taking it?  I can see how 10mg orally would do nothing for you, but if 10mg snorted did nothing I'd be surprised.  I don't think doing it alone is a good idea, unless you're very used to the effects of it. For about the first dozen times I took T7, it seemed like a different drug EVERY TIME. It's a tough one to notice consistancy with. 

If you ate 10mg the first time, my advice is to put about 10-12mg in a capsule and plug it.  That way you'll have 2 trips remaining. But there aren't many T7 pluggers here, so I'm pretty sure I'll be the only one advising you to do that.

20mg ORALY would be in line with a low level trip. But obviously ct7 has huge variations in different people.  but since you did the right thing and started with 10mg I would think 20 would be fine.

You could always start with 15 and see where you were after 2.5 hours and decide whether to bump the remaining 5 or even 2.5 mg if you needed a boost.

I don't think anyone knows the conversion of oral/anal for certain on these substances.  I would expect it to be at least 50% stronger.  10mg snorted is going to be a huge dose compared to oral and will hit you hard.  This is a weird drug and snorting is the only way I do it because I get very little effect from ingestion (THOUGH I'M NOT RECOMMENDING ANYONE SNORT IT).  If you only have 20mg left, then its gonna be a crapshoot.

Peace

I don't know what the conversion would be since I've never eaten it.  I plug around 7-10mg and trip hard on it.  But I'm fairly small (100#) and I'm sure that plays a factor in it.  I've given friends that weigh 170# around 10-12mg and they've gotten pretty decent effects off of it. It can take 1 to 1 1/2 hours to fully kick in though, just like when you eat it. If I was you, here's what I'd do. Divide the 20mgs you've got into 3 capsules- 10mg, 5, and 5.  Plug the 10 and wait 90minutes.  If you're not where you'd like to be, plug a 5mg and wait another hour. I'm pretty sure that you won't need more after that, but you'll still have some if you do. And if after the first 10mg dose you're doing fine, then you've got another full trip left for another time.

last time i did t7 i put 22mg in a container with some 80proof alcohol, im sure water would have worked, and drank it.  effects were felt by 1 hour and 15 minutes.  this method cut onset time at least in half and i felt i experienced less nausea.  definitely my way to go from now on.

I honestly don't think it is the snorting of the 2-ct-7 that is killing the folks.  Its just that it has aproximately 3 times the effects of oraly (at least to me) 

I'd be willing to bet that if they took 3 times their issulfated dose, they would be just as dead.

but, of course thats just my opinion!

and unfortunately there are 3 good reasons to bump it.  It hits 90minutes sooner, it is more economical, and it doesn't matter what you ate (but it still produces naseau)

BUT STILL PLEASE DON'T SNORT MORE THAN 5MG AT A TIME!!! 

actually, what the hell am I saying. Don't snort it at all!  my bad.

Insuffated 2-ct-7 is definitley not the way to go anymore, BUT...

Don't become overly paranoid about this method of administration.

The main reason not to do it is due to it's differential nature, 5mg snorted to you feels like 20 to me, that sort of thing.

Personally I have snorted 15mg of 2-ct-7 with no real side effects at all, no nausea, no real burning, and just one MAJOR fucking trip on my hands...

I wouldn't be so quick to shrug off insuffated 2-ct-7 but no where NEAR what the kids who died did (reportedly upwards of 30mg, which is an oral dose in itself)...

If you can definitley try 2-ct-7 ORALLY, but if it boild down to having just a few mg, insuffated will not kill you...

Just research, reseach, reserach...

With the 15 or 20 mg you have, personally I would snort 5mg, and incrementally go from there, peaking at 15mg before jumping over to oral administration...

There are plenty of ways to go, just be prepared for a great trip.

for most people snorting is not recommended at all (3 deaths and countless fuck ups). however, if you're educated, have a accurate scale down to 1mg, and are smart about it.. its the most effective to take it since its almost a guarntee that you'll trip nicely. start with 2mg, and every 10 minutes continue to snort 2mg until you reach 10mg or whatever dose you're looking for.

Everybody has their own taste, but I find it hard to equate tripping nicely with snorting 2C-T-7.  Everything I love about orally-consumed 2C-T-7 is gone when I snort it.  Beside the fact that its gentle and rich nature is replaced with something a bit more sinister and harsh, the physical side-effetcs are greatly enhanced and nothing magical or profound ever happens.  It is just a meaningless, though intense, trip.

Eating 2C-T-7 is definatly the way to go if you ask me.  It just does not feel like it was "meant" to be snorted.  I won't ever do it again.  As far as I am concerned, if it is too expensive to eat you should look to use something a bit cheaper.  I will get effects with as little as 10 mg orally, but I need at least 30 to trip hard.  For really getting at my core I will take up to 50 mg.

I've done the 2CT7 / MDMA cobo a couple a times before death reports rolled in and it was A W E S O M E ! Fortunately nothing bad happened to me and i live to tell it, but I stopped doing that.

However a more safe combo that equals a lot of fun is: 2ct7 and GHB

Yup pure bliss

**DMSO and 2CT-7...**


Does anyone out there have any experience with this sort of combination? The idea has been floating around my social group to try this, but we are unsure if it would be practical. Also, any ideas for dosage and safty precautions?

Thanks

Hmmm... I like how you think, but I would really not recommend it.  

DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide) is an industrial solvent, and to those who are wondering why someone would use it in conjunction with a psychedelic, DMSO has the fantastic ability to transport even larger molecules (I believe up to 500,000 daltons in size)directly across the skin.  So essentially by combining the 2 and applying to an area of relatively thin skin you'd be creating one hell of a "psychedelic hand cream".

Sounds like a great idea, huh?  Well, I thought so as well a few years back when I was working in an organic chem lab (At the time I wanted to do so with anabolic agents, or even MDMA) - but there are a few VERY serious risks that you need to bare in mind.

First, as I stated DMSO is a super solvent.  Not only would it take your 2-ct-7 across the skin, but it would take just about anything else across as well.  Mercury, benzene, lead and all other kinds of nasty things that you might have on your hands, or that might already be in your DMSO preparation - things that could very easily fuck you up.  You DO NOT want this to happen.  Also, the dosing curve with 2-CT-7 is extremely steep.  With there being practically no information available on what the appropriate dose would be for transdermal administration of 2-ct-7, it makes it extremely difficult and dangerous to guess where to start.  

To add insult to injury, DMSO itself is also condsidered to be a toxic substance. 

So, in a nutshell, I STRONGLY urge you not to go fucking with DMSO as a transport mechanism for research chemicals (Or any otherchemicals for that matter) I myself would never risk it, and besides 2-ct-7 has fantastic oral absorption already.

there are books on DMSO praising its effects on joints, muscles etc.. so it is not exactly a nerve agent.

I know several body builders who use it so they don't have to inject their steroids.

It would obviously be a good idea to wash the site well, but its PROBABLY not a huge health risk, or more problems would have shown up by now from the tens of thousands of users. BTW you can usually find DMSO in health food stores.

That said, I still wouldnt us it with 2CT7, K or other drugs that are better when injected, maybe, but not 2CT7.

**Legality of 2CT7**


We all heard the rumors, we all read the Rolling Stone Article, but do any of us really know the truth? Is 2CT7 heading down the path Illegalization? Or are we all just getting Paranoid? Is there any evidence at all suggesting that 2CT7 is getting schedualed? If so, would anyone mind sharring this evidence?

The feds are charging a former source of 2CT7 under the analog laws claiming it is an analog of 2CB. If they win their case, then that eliminates the 'grey area' on the chemicals legality.

Getting Charged with Analog distrobution and possesion is diffrent then getting charged for a direct violation of drug laws. My question is not wether I can be prosecuted for possesing 2ct7, Im wondering if the DEA is spicificly gonna target 2ct7, making it an illict drug, striping it of its RC statues, and making it no diffrent then MDMA, or LSD, or GHB, or THC, 100% illegal chem. Is this gonna happen to 2ct7?

It is for sure a high dose. One night I took 150mg of 2ct2 and it was one of the most amazing experiences of my life, though this was with redosing not a single dose.

I have talked to someone who found they enjoyed 2ct7 best at the 100mg level and tripped at that dose every time, however.

I don't condone these sorts of doses of course, or these research chemicals at all really, but yes there are always people pushing the limits.

Lots of people have been operating under the assumption that since the analog laws haven't really been enforced so far, they never will be. This is ignoring the fact that for most of the time since the analog laws were passed, there weren't multimillion dollar internet companies selling analogs. That changed everything. People seemed to interpret the slow pace of government bureaucracy to mean they weren't doing anything. The supplier being prosecuted now has been under investigation for years. I'd bet anything he gets convicted. Once that precedent is set, I think we'll see the analog laws being enforced much more seriously. These people are not joking around, they didn't pass these laws out of boredom.

I don't necessarily agree here, Murple.  The Analog Act is so vague and biased that it may well be repealed or amended in the course of court proceedings. 

It may actually be to our benefit for them to use it some, so people can get a good look at just how slanted it really is..  I think they may well be hesitant to use it for just this reason...

For those of you who haven't go to erowid and read through the Analog Act itself, it's a gross injustice...

I tend to agree with you, ntgn, because the Analog Act doesn't give fair warning of what is and is not a crime, which is a fundamental component of the U.S. criminal justice system.  Thus, it I think lawyers could successfully argue it violates the 5th Amendment of the Constitution.

Additionally, the substances offed by this particular supplier weren't marketed for human consumption.  One thing going for them is that they marketed products which had no recreational value in addition to those that did.  I think this lends legitimacy to their claims that it wasn't just a front to hide the intent for human comsumption.

My guess is that the DEA, FBI & FDA will pass on a list of the various substances being sold by research chemical suppliers and Congress will ban them.  We shall see...

My understanding of the way these things happen, K9, is that they just Schedule a substance. They don't announce that they are going to schedule it, they just go right ahead and do it. Then if someone wants to make the case that it should be scheduled, they can take it to a judge and if the judge says different the DEA can just ignore the judge anyway.

T7 is in a similar position to 2CB just before it got scheduled. The only difference is that there was quite a bit of 2CB on the streets. With the on-line suppliers out of action for T7, the DEA might not bother. If some loney decides to synth it an sell it to candy-ravers, then kiss it bye-bye.

**Note from 2007**: 2C-T-7 was emergency scheduled in 2001, making it illegal.  It remains so today and most likely will until prohibition ends.  In other words, probably forever. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

**found some 2ct7...**


I got some foxy and 2ct7 over a year ago (250mg); never tried the 2ct7 and offered it to a friend, who then claimed to have lost it.  Last week while cleaning, I found it behind a desk.  Score!

I've done foxy and shrooms before, but no other psychedelics.  I've been wanting to try acid sometime, but haven't had the opportunity.

My question... on the ladder of psychedelics, is 2ct7 comparable to acid, higher or lower?  Do most people consider 2ct7 more or less enjoyable than acid?  Is the chance of a bad trip similar, less than or greater than with acid?  Is this a drug that you can enjoy at a club, rave, music festival (ala Phish) or something you want to do at home or maybe while camping?

Many people will tell you that LSD has more mind-fuck that 2-CT-7.  This is true in that LSD makes you have really fast looping thoughts.  However, it's not true in that 2-CT-7 can take you just as far away from reality at LSD.

One major problem with 2-CT-7 = NASEAU.  It's really miserable to start a trip puking.  So, try taking a little dramamine, it will help.

Also, obviously start with a low dose.  And EAT it!!! Do NOT snort it!  This is very dangerous.  It has lead to death and delirium in many cases.

Also, measure very accurately.

Have fun!

I've found that t7 is extremely visual, while the mind fuck is greatly decreased. Don't get me wrong, you can still lose yourself in anything, but with t7, you do have an on/off switch. The visuals are intense, but you can make sense of reality. I recommend **AGAINST** trying this drug in the public eye. There is a 90% chance you **WILL** get sick. Also, the dosage is very tough to determine for each individual. I suggest eating 15mg, or snorting 5-7mg. And **PLEASE DO NOT SNORT UNLESS YOU HAVE A DIGITAL SCALE.** There is no margin for error with this drug. Someone has died from snorting 35 mg before.

Sensitivity varies widely among individuals. Margin between 'good' dose and 'unpleasant' dose and 'oh shit what have I done' dose can be fairly small. It is often slow to take effect. So you must be cautious and sensible in choosing your amount and resist the temptation to bump the level before you are sure it has all 'arrived'. 

About 30% of users experience nausea, sometimes at a very uncomfortable level with vomiting.

It is different from LSD. CEVs have their own characteristics, ego loss and self-suggestibility are less intrusive. OEVs can be very powerful. Body feel is not pleasant. Sulferous taste in the mouth. No 'wow' when eating acidic fruit. Good energy, especially after the peak, can be danced on! 

Congratulations. You have what may soon be a rare collectors item.

The irony here lies in the fact that the harder 2ct7 is to find, the more value there will be in snorting the drug, thereby saving doses.

The *main* thing you have to worry about in public is not any mind-blowing psychedelic effects, but the nausea.  My ex-gf took her first dose at a party, and spent most of the time not dancing/moving/smoking for fear she'd puke.  I don't really have that much of a problem with nausea, or anything.  YMMV.

I agree, I do not not recommend to use T7 at a party, but AFTER the peak you have very good energy like a good hippyflipping, I used to go with some close friends to one of their houses to chill all night on T7 (we bought a bunch of delicious foods as T7 gives you extreeemmme munching delight) . After the strongest peaks subsided we than usually drop a cap of G and go to an afterparty while the T7 still gave mild mdma tingly feelings and mild visuals that danced along with the music at the party and actually provided a very decent roll ( i am sure the ghb has some contribution in that 2).

If somebody still has a 2ct7 2ct-I source i would very much apriciate it.

**Need info on Foxy and 2CT7 potency after over a year.**


I've had much of this stuff hanging around for quite some time now. It's been well over a year I'd say, since I last used either of these two chemicals. 

I'm definately interested in doing it again, but I wanted to check here first to see if anyone has had the experience of them laying around for a long time and then dosing.

I'm sure not many if anyone has done this, but if you have, would you please provide me with any information on whether or not they lost potency, or became somehow 'bad' by sitting around for a long time?

Thank you in advance for any information....

2CT7 seems to be fully potent after a year.  For the first six months it was stored in a box in a cool closet, for the last six months it has been stored in an amber bottle in the bottom of a refrigerator.  It is still in powder form, but was weighed out into capsules for personal consumption soon after purchase.  The variance in 2CT7 potency during five experiences over the course of a year has been much less than what one would experience with other psychedelics.

Then there is this information from an [Ask Erowid](http://www.erowid.org/ask/ask.cgi?ID=1768):


> Regarding 2C-T-7, I asked Dr. Shulgin about its shelf life and he remarked that he once analyzed a 15 year old sample of the chemical and found that it had degraded very little, if any.

A bit of 2C-T-7 that is at least two years old was recently sampled.  Zero loss of potency.  It has, however, been kept in a freezer sealed in a glass vial with silica gel to absorb moisture.  If I ever choose to sample 5-MeO-DiPT again, I'll report in this post how well the potency has held up with that one.

**2ct-7 shelflife**


just wonderin if 2ct-7 powder inside a capsule is subject to potency loss and or chemical breakdown over time.  If so, how long before the powder suffers noticable loss in potency.

Shulgin specifically said he had stored some 2C-T-7 in a jar on a shelf fully exposed to light and heat for fifteen years and it showed no signs of degrading at all.  I can't recall if he said he ate it, or tested it with GC/MS, or both.  But he did say that some 15 year old 2C-T-7 he had did not degrade.  I can't remember if it was from a private email, or something from "Ask Dr. Shulgin", but it was definetly said.  I know we talked about it here before, so if it was discussed after the purge a search using *Shulgin* and *2C-T-7* should turn it up.


Though obviously not the same chemical, mescaline found peyote buried in Native American tombs with the dead still had the "average" amount of mescaline found in peyote.  So if mescaline lasts that long, it may be that all PEAs can too.

2C-T-7 is very variable in its effects.  Some find 10mg orally plenty for a +3, other need up to 30mg, or more.  For me, 20mg orally would produce a nice, gentle +2.  But I seem to have an insane tolerance.


I'd eat what you have (or less to be safe) and enjoy it for what it is.  I highly advise you not to snort it.  I've done it (insufflated T-7) a few times and the effects were very unpleasant.


As far as comparing it to LSD or mushrooms, there is no comparison.  2C-T-7 is nothing like indole psychedelics.  As far as potency to other 2Cs, 2C-B is a little stronger (for me) than 2C-T-7.  20mg of 2C-T-7 would be similar to perhaps 24mg or 25mg of 2C-B for me.  But again, the effects of 2C-T-7 vary greatly from person to person.  You may get a lot more from 20mg of 2C-T-7 than I do.  Proceed carefully.

Damn, U got ahold of t7 nowadays?


I did some in 2001. I wrote up a report in TR.


Snorted something like 15, dont remember exacly.


It was really really , REALLY, nice. I think its a complete experience. Very submersive, i was navigating colorful landscapes flyingin the sky like mario64. No side effects at all. Mild to moderate visuals. Mostly patterned kaleidoscopic blossoming effect of surfaces.


The name : beautiful, perfectly put. It kinda puts you in a beautiful place knd of like the hallucination of mdma when the world feels perfect, its only a hallucination of the mdma (mdma being similar to mescaline, so is t7)

Gave me a tight feeling in my throat every time.  I usually went no higher than 15 mg, as higher doses merely clouded the experience.  It's possible my body doesn't process 2ct7 well which is funny because I have to take twice as much of most other things to get anywhere.  2ct7 and amt are the exception.  Take it orally, btw.  Don't snort it.

**Plugging 2CT7**


Anybody have any experience with this method of consumption? As much as I enjoy 2CT7s visual aspects I'm looking at trying to minimise the nausea associated with this drug and insufflation seems too dangerous at the 50-60mg range.

I don't have any personal experience with 2ct7, but I have plugged a few phens including 2cd, 2ce, 2ct21 and 2ct2. I've never had nausea plugging any of them, but then again, I have never had nausea from any RC orally either. I guess I'm just lucky that way.


While it may help with the nausea, my experience is has been that the absorption and comeup using this route is much quicker than oral ingestion. But each of them is a little different. So just be aware you may come on really fast. Orally 2ct2 takes a good 2-2.5 hours for me to get going really well, but rectally, it's like being strapped to a rocket once it starts to climb. :D 


The first time I did 2cd plugged, I got kind of scared how quickly it started to climb and was actually glad when it stopped and I knew it had peaked. Since then I've almost doubled my plugged dose and it's been great, but that first time scared the shit out of me since I wasn't expecting it to climb like that. I was worried I had taken way too much for that route. ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)


Also, be VERY CAREFUL with your dose the first time or so you plug it and increase your doses graudually. My experience with the phens above would make me guess that most of them are around 2-3x as potent when plugged. So if you want to play it safe, I would recommend only starting at 1/3 of your oral dose when you plug it the first time and see how it goes. Also, the dose response curve seems to climb a bit more quickly than by the oral route. Even dosing at 1/3-1/2 of an oral dose, the effects seems to intensify with much smaller dose increases for me when plugged.


Good luck and be safe.

I'd be VERY careful about this. We don't know much about those 2C-T-7 deaths, but if snorting big doses is dangerous, then plugging could well be to, what with it passing the 1st pass metabolism and all.


50-60mg insufflated sounds like an insanse dose, when the report deaths were in the 30-40mg range. 


What oral dose do you usually take?

There's a thread in ADD where BilZ0r stated that at plasma levels encountered from normal dosing, several of the 2C-T-x's had MAOI activity. If that's the case (and I have no reason to doubt BilZ0r's info, he's usually very reliable), I'd be VERY careful about plugging/snorting/injecting any of the 4-alkylthio hallucinogens. The Jake Duroy death & others all sound a bit similar to serotonin syndrome

PLEASE PLEASE start with a VERY small dose. I took 25mg 2CT-7*orally* thinking it was a moderate dose for me and I was out of touch with reality (in a difficult way) for 7 hours! And to think I was considering taking that dose rectally *shudder*. It was bad enough that I decided I'm never taking this compound again. 


Plus I found T-7 to be the worst body-load ever, and I find that psychedelics, especially phenethylamines, increase body load when taken rectally/nasally. 


PLEASE be careful. As they say, you can always take more, but you can never take less.

Between half and a third of an oral dose. 20mg of 2C-D rectally is about on a par with 50mg orally. With 2C=E I'd sat between 5-10mg would be the most to start off with; then take it from there. I don't have eny experience with 2C-T-7, so I'll leave specifics to people who have.

I've plugged 2C-T-2 and I loved it.  One time I plugged 14mg and that was pretty great, didn't last as long as I would've liked, although I could feel the effects coming on in as little as 2-4 mins after putting it in my butt.  


The second time I plugged 20mg of it and that was AMAZING.  Although I tend to get sick on most hallucinogens I didn't really get nausea but I was dry heaving like a mother fucker.  The experience was great though, the visuals were INSANE and at one point I put the theme song to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly on and I watched it ripple and wave throughout my bedroom.  That was probably the greatest trip of my summer.

A friend who is very reliable in her information finds 10mg of 2C-T-7 to be plenty when 'plugged.'  As I recall, she generally needed 30mg or so to achieve the effects she was looking for with oral dosing.  This is one of the few psychedelics that I have enourmous interest in 'plugging' and will indeed try it that way one day.

I'm surprised no one has mentioned the INTENSE BURNING SENSATION that comes with plugging RCs.  I plugged 17mg of 2C-E once and I had to evacuate my bowels because it felt like my anus was IN AN INFERNO.  I've plugged many things, including rolls, 2C-B pills, speed, and opiates.  Nothing has compared to the rectal pain that occured when plugging that chemical.


I did, however, trip fucking balls.  When I felt bored with 2C-E at 35mg+ oral, plugging was a crazy, spectacular trip.  I learned the empathetic aspect of 2C-E through that particular trip.

Although some 2Cs do cause some burning (its 2C-D for me), using as much excess water to dissolve as you can is the best sollution for that problem.

**2CE & 2CT7 & K &Nitrous**


SWIM is getting these four and planning on taking them as a combination. 


It would be a medium dose of 2ce followed by a medium dose of t7 about an hour after taking the 2ce. Would then have lines of k and balloons throughout the trip. Got a perfect location, doing it with a close friend and am really excited. Anyone done this combo? Any tips? Dangerous?


any advice appreciated..


cheers!

Please tell me you have tried all of these on their own, and you know what to expect from each before doing this.


2C-E is one of the most intense drugs I've ever taken. If you fuck around with it and take too much, it will beat you down.


2C-T-7 has killed people before. I think it was all in combo with MDMA, but don't take that lightly either.

Jesus, man.  Personally, I'd take either the T-7 OR the 2C-E with the other two, and I'd wait until the later stages of the plateau to do the K, so you don't miss the beautiful main effects of the main substance you do.  2C-E is the most screamingly intense substance I've ever taken at the right dosage, and 2C-T-7 isn't too far behind.  Both of them  can cause body issues, although I think 2C-E's body issues are mainly psychosomatic.  However, T-7 can be pretty intense on the body as far as stimulation goes, so be careful.

im with everyone here, i think this sounds insane.


just do either 2c-e or t-7 and throw in a bit of nitrous here and there and u will have an amazing trip.


no need to waste all these drugs.


plus i can imagine the bodyload from 2c-e and t-7 mixed being pretty bad.

why would you want to blow all those in one go?

you could setup for a nice week of fun with all that.

do them in the weakest to the strongest type of trip.

if you go and kill yourself on all those, there's no doubt that the government and media will fidnout the cause of death, and then that will just give the republicans and government more shit to say why they think drugs are bad. that will just make the rest of responsible people look bad, and while you couldnt care less what assbackwards restrictions the goverment puts on chemical compounds since youre six feet under, we all have to suffer.

To me the only odd part of this trip is that you plan on using Ketamine and Nitrous Oxide; I hope that when you do this you don't use nitrous while on K.  Dissociative+Dissociative ontop of Psychedelic+Psychedelic might be a little scary. My advice: take the 2C-E, wait an hour or until you feel comfortable to take the -T7, throughout this time crack open some balloons until you get the -t7 buz real nice, then do the K. If while on the K you feel that you are ready to move to the next level try some nitrous. 


A combo I've done was 2c-e, cocaine, and nitrous and that was fucking intense shit.

I would really strongly recommend against mixing the 2C-E with the 2C-T-7.  2C-T-7 has considerable MAOI potential, and also raises your heart rate on its own by quite a bit.  Considering that 2C-E can also be a little hard on the body sometimes (even if it's psychosomatic), it just seems like a very dangerous idea.

Take heed... everyone seems to agree the two 2C's together would be risky.


On a side note, I'd recommend against mixing the K with the nitrous. I think someone already said that, too. Just use the nitrous, by itself, in short bursts throughout the trip (on just ONE of the 2C's), and then when it seems that you will be coming down shortly, do a good dose of the K.

I imagine you know what'll happen when you mix all of these- and if you don't, I'll tell you-


It'll be a period of craziness when you think you got the answer to the universe and "woah man yeah oh my god"  then you'll come down some time later a little more confused than you started, and possibly more content, possibly more depressed. 


The only imput I really wanna give you is that there is an optimal way to spend these drugs, and taking them all together at once is wasteful- of money and rare substance.  And in the case of ketamine and nitrous, having combined them both, I say that it is totally wasteful because the highs blend perfectly into each other and you waste drugs because you dont get any higher or anything.

I wouldn't do this combo, it's asking for trouble, imho.


I would instinctively avoid mixing a 2C with a 2C-T because of the "MAOI potential" of the 2C-T. Otherwise, mixing psychedelics may not be all bad, and some people swear by certain combos because the synergy works for them. I have yet to experience any successful synergy myself, to be honest.


Regarding the K - you could get yourself 3 or 4 20mg "bumps" ready and gradually dose up, not starting until you're well past the peak. Then watch for the effects as they gradually develop. You will have the wonderful psychedelic insight into how you slowly "die", as it were, on the dissociative... by spreading out the bumps you will be able to get a feel for the K and you will avoid doing too much too soon. If you haven't done K before, then I recommend not following typical 'proper dosage' advice but take it easy and watch the subtle effects of even a tiny bump of K (<20mg)  . . . I have yet to try this on a 2C, but on 4-subst. tryptamines I found this to be an amazing way to delve deeper into K's subtle realms.


Regarding nitrous - I have read elsewhere, and this has also been my experience a couple of times subsequently, that a whiff of nitrous will paradoxically bring you back into the material world while on K.


Be careful out there.

**2c-t-7?**


I tried searching, but there doesn't seem to be too much coverage of this on BL. (No B&D thread?)


I'm wondering what you guys think of the risk/reward tradeoff with this one. Exactly 22 mgs of the substance appeared in a seed a little bird carried to me. 


On the one hand, I'm intrigued by the description of it: If it's MGS's favorite psych, that's high praise indeed. I also get very elaborate OEV's when I take even a modest amount of LSD, and the concept of a more-visual LSD-like drug sounds fascinating. 


OTOH, Erowid has some pretty strong warnings about toxicity. (3 fatalities, one of which was via oral rt?) What irks me the most about the info there is that the oral death report has no dosage information (though it does note that MDMA was used in conjunction with 2c-t-7). 


For those with experience: How "toxic" do you find this? Assuming it's not fatal, are there any reports of it being physiologically traumatising to those who survive? 


(I will never repeat using MDMA; it honestly made my brain feel "fuzzy/stupid" for the next three days. I'm convinced it must've killed a couple brain cells.)


Do you think the risk of fatality is acceptably low if taken orally? What about the severity of any other after-effects?


(Particularly, at the dosage mentioned above..  For reference, I seem to get better mileage than most out of a slightly lower dose of LSD than my friends. Haven't tried any PEA's, can't comment about my sensitivity to them.)

I think 2c-t7 is fairly common is sold as E quite commonly. I once tested 5 differnt pills that I got at the same party and one of them turned out to have exclusively 2c-t7 in it. The dosage is unknown because it is a press tab. I have heard however that a few people did take the pill and while they had a bad experience with it they did not die or end up in the hospital.


Some of the same presses showed up in another town I was staying at. They were the same press and they were also reported as being 'trash' by those who tried it but it did get them really high. Im convinced that they were 2c-t7 as well.


People do take 2c-t7 sold as E and 2c-t7 cut with MDMA in pill form sold as E. 


I believe that the risk of taking 2c-t7 is fairly low. The risk is there - there were three reported deaths.


2c-t7 is not as researched as some chemicals. But on the flip side some people react badly to asprin too..

^ You sure it was 2c-t-7 and not some other 2c-x compund? 2c-t-7 is very rare nowadays, and I wouldn't think some chemist who is already looking to rip people off with trash E would go through the trouble to make it. It would seem much more likely that somebody put 2c-i in the pills or something along those lines.


Just curious, what did you use to test those pills? If it wasn't GC/MS, then you really will probably have no idea, as a few different compounds will turn the same color of those ecstasy test kits.

2C-T-7 is a MAO inhibitor and as such can be quite dangerous, but especially when one has taken MDMA with it, as serotonin syndrome can result..

If you tested it with marquis reagent, it was much more likely 2c-t-2 or 2c-t-4 as all three produce an orange to red reaction. Of the three, 2c-t-7 is the only one that's illegal and therefore much more difficult to obtain and as such demands a premium in price, which generally precludes its use in a pill sold as ecstasy. Also, if there was no change to red then there was nothing but (meth)amphetamine in the pill.


ecstasydata.org shows no 2c-x adulterated pills. Feel free to correct me if the 2c-x is neatly tucked in as a secondary component.

The identity of the material was confirmed by the chemist who made it. He's quite proficient. This was not purchased on the open market; it's not a pressed pill. I have not tested it with a marquis myself.

Wonderful material for me.  Nothing to suggest it is 'toxic' in any way, and I've gone up to 70mg.  I can name at least three or four psychedelics I've tried that truely felt toxic and poisonous and 2C-T-7 wasn't one of them.

+1.


Introspective, was not overwhelmingly visual for me. Great one for a dose before heading to bed for some reflection/meditation.


I used around 25/45mg in my doses.

^ MGS, out of curiosity, which are those three or four?


Thanks for all the reassurance, everyone. I think it might go down the hatch soon.


Given the MAOI-action, what other precautions do I need to take? I like going to a small open-air cafe near me and watching life's passing parade; can I drink espresso/caffeinated beverages? 


I've read [http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/maois/maois_info2.shtml](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/maois/maois_info2.shtml) -- the list is daunting... I think a better question than what can't I eat is, what **can** one eat? And for how long before and after dosing 2c-t-7 are these restrictions in effect?


Furthermore, on [http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/maois/maois_info1.shtml](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/maois/maois_info1.shtml), it says "Stop taking the MAO Inhibitor and get emergency help if you experience signs of very high blood pressure including: .... fast heartbeat".


I've found that my heart rate/blood pressure is often elevated on LSD, though I never timed my pulse. Does 2c-t-7 have a similar stimulant effect as well? At what pulse rate is it time to lay down the hammer and call a doctor? 100 bpm? 120? 150? (My resting heart rate is around 72.)


Thanks for all the info

All psychedelics have some MAOI properties.  There was no data to suggest 2C-T-7 had any significant MAO action one way or another until just recently so I've never abstained from any particular foods in preperation for 2C-T-7, other than to fast a few hours before to lessen nausea.  2C-T-7 is fairly stimulating, perhaps even more than LSD.  But it certainly isn't as bad as some of the others (2C-I comes to mind.)


The psychedelics I've tried that felt 'toxic' were 2C-T-2, 2C-N, and 5-MeO-DiPT.  I'm not suggesting any one of those is 'dangerous' though there are deaths associated with 5-MeO-DiPT.  In any case, the last two's unpleasant effects are significant enough that I will never ingest either of them again.

Tread carefully. I only tried 2C-T-7 once. And I do not intend to try it again. 


25mg orally was **amazing mentally**, and **digusting physically**. I am talking about **extreme whole-body pains** along with my **mind turning (quite visually) into a hive and my consciousness dividing into the millions of insectoids swirming in it.**. This lasted for at least 5 hours in which I was practically paralyzed by bodily pain and total mental incapacitation (try doing anything as a billion different insects!).


It is easily the most visual psychedelic, save for perhaps a high-dose of LSD. I normally don't get visuals at all from any psychedellic at any dose. 


22mg can be quite a large dose. Then again it can be avarage. I find with the 2C-T's, the only way to tell is to try for yourself.

There was a lot of anxiety, but that could have been due to the ego-shatter. I have to say there is a definite entactogenic component to this drug despite the horrendous physical effects it had on me. I did not feel extremely hot, no. If you're implying serotonin syndrome, then I am pretty sure that was not the case since I have experienced mild SS before. 


I think the pain was highly psychosomatic, perhaps the body "feeling" as fractured as the mind was. 


That being said, this one had more nausea with it than Ayahuasca or AMT. For the first time ever, I actually *wanted* to vomit. I tried, but not much was purged out. I definitely felt "poisoned" and yet the entactogenic aspect seemed to subdue some of the anxiety. It certainly wasn't a bad trip, but it also wasn't a trip that I learned much from (as in, too much to make any sense out of).

Although he had a sloid 10mgs on you I would reccomend you read Jaw_clenching's thread on 2C-T-7 before trying this for the first time. Most people do tend to enjoy this one more than other 2C-T's but its best to research as much as possible before making a decision. Good luck and be safe.

Im sure it was 2c-t-7


We used the dance safe ez test kit [http://www.dancesafe.org/testingkits/instructions.php](https://www.dancesafe.org/testingkits/instructions.php)


I tried putting a report on pill reports, but after I fill out all the fields it tells me "A pill that has not been consumed or reagent tested is useless and cannot be posted" or some shit like that - even after I did fill out the reagent tested part, and what reagent I tested with and what colours they turned etc.


Using the Mecke color chart we determined the substance was 2c-t-7 because it turned a bright red colour.


![2c-t-7.jpg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi107.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fm313%2FSheldonTheCoolest%2F2c-t-7.jpg&hash=dd9fd91325a884817e6560df475f81da)


The press was a pink heart. On this particular photo part of the heart was damaged.


Also it tested with simons and Marquis and it tested negative for MDx, methamphetamine, ketamine and 2c-b.

morninggloryseed: So what you are saying is that with the Mecke reagent test 2c-t-7 produces almost the same colour change as 2c-t-2 and/or 2c-t-4?

Thats why I never ate it. Who knows what the dose is in that press tab. I would guess anywhere from 5 to 50mg of 2c-t-something.

2C-T-7 seems to have  a WIDE range of effects with different people, so start low and work your way up. Just because you have a high tolerance for one 2C does NOT< NOT < NOOOOOOTTTTTTT, mean you have a high tolerance for another.


An example...


19mg of 2C-T-7 has me horrendously sick for 2 hours and then it is perfect... perfect euphoria. But that is just off of 19mg ORALLY, not snorted, or anything. 2C-E, on the other hand, takes about 30-40mg for me to feel the true effects. People just react differenctly to these substances. Start low with t-7 and work your way up... it has a repuation for causing ill effects, although,once you get over that, it is quite a wonderous substance.

I dont know if this has been posted already, but two of the deaths were from snorting t7 and one was due to orally taking a massive amount. A (quadra?)plegic man (no arms/legs) stuck his tongue into a bag of 2c-t-7 and overdosed that way... so I'd say unless you taks 50mg+ you should be safe. *[availability discussion removed]*

Orally seems to work best, based on all of the reports submitted to erowid, discussion here at BL, and private discussion from others.  This goes for all of the PEAs

I have found lowish doses of 2C-T-7 to be a wonderful antidepressant/enhancer.  A 12mg rectal dose (with some tolerance, especially to PEAs) once had me talking and smiling non-stop all night long.  It also provided a glowing body high that felt quite sexual.  Speaking of which, it was one of the best sexual enhancers I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing.


The other thing about rectal administration of it is that in my experience it totally eliminated any nausea of any kind.  The experience was extraordinarily comfortable.

Good to hear Xorkoth! Do you remember how long for first alerts and then how long til peak via the rectal route?


Can you compare what the 12mg rectal was like in intensity to an oral dose? 2X?

Hard to say, really... I hadn't used it in around 5 or 6 months when I took that rectal dose.  Also, I seem to have a naturally high tolerance to 2C-T-7, even before I had general phenethylamine tolerance, like MGS does.  I took 22mg the first time (orally), and the 12mg rectal dose was about like that, which is to say, for me, that it provided no visuals of any kind other than some brightening of colors, and it caused me to enter into a very jovial and talkative mood.  The rectal dose was definitely smoother, though, which made it better.  I think I will always take T-7 rectally in the future.  The body high of 2C-T-7, for me, is reminiscent of MDMA, except less pushy and more refined/clean-feeling.  The kind of talking I was compelled to do continually was not like that of MDMA or amphetamines, in that I was not proclaiming love for everything or out of control at all.  Instead, things were just flying out of my mouth, coherent, analytical things, with loads of humor mixed in.  Lots of wordplay and puns.  I was also talking at what felt like about 90 miles a minute (as if miles can be applied to speech).  I had lots of energy and didn't like to stay sitting for very long.  I also had a fragmented short-term memory to some extent; I kept finding myself walking back and forth between two or three places in my apartment, wondering what the hell I was walking around for.  My fiance and I did have a lot of very deep and spiritual conversation, and we spent some time watching TV.  On psychedelics when I watch TV, my mind races to analyze the social interactions and the state of American consumerism, and this was no exception, except that I felt perhaps more mentally sharp about it, except when my train of thought would get derailed temporarily or permanently.


First alerts were at around 15 or 20 minutes.  It built slowly (for rectal admin) and reached full effects around T+1:00, I'd say.  The absolute peak was maybe around T+2:00, which persisted until T+4:00 or T+5:00, when it began to very slowly taper down.  I can't remember exactly... I took some notes to write a trip report, but never wrote it, and my notes aren't handy right now.  The body high was fabulous, and it actually got more and more pleasurable as time went on.  Probably the best part of the body high was around T+6:00, where I was feeling a constant warm tingling in my solar plexus/groin.  It felt decided sexual, and I began to feel like an animal.  I proceeded to have sex, and it was in all honesty the most I've ever found a substance to enhance that activity.  


Man, I've got to try a low dose of 2C-T-7 again.  I just remembered how good it was!

Just goes to show you how different people react differently. 


The last thing I can associate 2C-T-7 with is sex! My one difficult experience with made my skin feel slimy and, as I mentioned before, my whole body ached. Not to mention, the nausea.


Although I am not fond of any of the available 2C-Ts, I will admit that 2C-T-21 has a weird sexual enhancement.

No!  She's my cat who almost died a few weeks ago.  In my avatar's picture, she's just laying on her back being snuggly.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I set it as my avatar on the night that she almost died, to try to get some support for her from the people here at Bluelight.  I mostly posted about it in TDS.  It may have worked, because the next day she was 100% healthy and even the problems they had found the day before were gone.  The doctor (vet) said he'd never seen anything like that recovery and that he considers it a medical miracle.  Then he said "She must have had a lot of people caring about her and sending good thoughts", which is exactly what people were doing!


I left the picture up in honor of her and of those who helped her to survive.  Thanks!  You know who you are.

I'm considering trying a combination of mdma+2c-t-7.  I'm aware its potentially dangerous and deaths have occurred, but not everyone acts safe!


How safe would i be if i was careful with the doses, its not something i want to attempt again due to the dangers inolved.  Lets say a trial run of 50mg mdma + 10mg 2c-t-7 ?

2C-T-7 is already reported to have MDMA-like qualities of it's own ... there is no need to test the limits and risk your life by combining it with MDMA.  Although I don't think such low doses would be life threatening, for obvious reasons I would highly recommend against any T-7/MDMA combo.  


Samadhi, I'd never heard that there was a risk of serotonin syndrome, but that could well be the cause of the deaths.  I'd be curious to find out if these people were on SSRIs.  


I'd also recommend against rectal admin with 2C-T-7 for higher doses.  I assume it carries the same risks as insufflation.

I've combined them (full dose of MDMA, 30mg of 2C-T-7 at T=3hr) and saw no real reason to do so, unlike 2C-B and MDMA where there is a special synergy.  2C-T-7 has (for me anyway) all of the warmth of MDMA and more.  But the combo together was rather chaotic.  If you do choose, use much less 2C-T-7 as months later I tried it again (with just 10mg of 2C-T-7) and it worked great.

Taking the 2CT7 at t+3 hours after the MDMA is very different from stacking the peaks, surely you know this MGS.

I doubt its worth the risk. I think a combination with another 2C-x could get you to the same place without the same risks that 2C-T-x carries.

Well of course.  The OP didn't indicate which way he intented to go, and I simply was sharing what experience I had.  And for accuracy, I should indicate that I just realized the second time (with the 10mg of T7) actually involved MDA.  Sorry for the mixup.

To be honest it was from reading this clippet from an experience report thats made me want to attempt the combination.  I've only candyflipped once and the pleasure I received from that combination had me practically moaning in parts... Incredible!

All memories seemed to become distant, all point of self became irrelevant, boundries disappeared. I was blown to the focus point of bliss. I could easily come to clear my head, but why, the bliss I felt was so intensely profound that I let myself roll beneath the waves of pleasure that continued to pound me with increasing intensity. I began to moan with pleasure quite loudly, and I couldn't help but go with the flow.

Soon after the two hours, the pleasure finally began to subside. Though my friends began to get worried after the first half-hour of my moaning so loudly that people curiously came to look over. At this point, a real world situation could be quite sustainable, with an ability to clear the head and deal with any situation. I do not want to encourage anyone to try this combination, though you will probably come to the conclusion that it is just too hard on the brain.

I recently researched a weiged out 25mg pile of 2c-t-7, with literally almost no effect. It was procured from a reliable supplier, which leads me to believe the scale I used is incredibely inaccurate.

^^ 25mg has very little effect on me, too (orally).  Your scale could be very inaccurate (does it measure in milligram increments?), or you could have a large tolerance naturally.  Morninggloryseed, for example, a longtime member here, takes 50+mg to trip when he uses it.  Personally, 35mg was rather weak for me as well, but then 42mg was somewhat negative due to its strength and nausea.


You could try taking it rectally.  The dose is about halved and the negative side effects that come with large doses are eliminated, or at least drastically reduced.


Or, perhaps your supply is weak?  It's hard to say.  Just keep trying, with appropriate intervals of time between.  Also, if you have built-up tolerance from using other chemicals too often, try to let that disappear first.

I have to be frank and say I don't encourage anyone to take 50mg.  That's a wopping dose.  I can get a +3 from 30-35mg of 2C-T-7...20mg would be a solid +2.  But also enjoyed taking 2C-T-7 higher, one of the few PEAs that I really like at that solid of a level (the other is 2C-E).


It also seems that as my life progresses, I have started to experience reverse tolerance to psychedelics.  A couple of recent 2C-B experiences were quite intense, and they were all under 25mg.  Usually I tend to go 30-36mg with that one.


Not sure when I will use 2C-T-7 again, haven't since summer 2005, but I would probably start out with 30mg or so.  I imagine next time will be when I introduce it to my lady.  Hopefully this summer!

Well, I'm not suggesting jumping to 50mg either.  But I think you're safe to jump to 30 or 35mg considering your response to 25.  I was just giving an example of how some people seem to require high doses.

**[?] 2C-T-7 Solubility & Stability**


I've searched and scanned and could find nothing on this subject.


what I need is some basic facts from anyone who's dealt with this chem before. Looking for info on what liquid to best dilute with, and specifically, info on the degradation of 2C-T-7 in that liquid. I'm aware T-7 is remarkably stable -- I believe I read something just recently on Shulgin having reported no potency drop after 15 years of poor storage -- but I'm also aware phens generally tend to degrade rapidly when diluted, soooo.......yeah. 


basically, I'm looking to find a way to store this stuff in liquid for a long period of time, or at least discover if it's possible before looking into other approaches. If you're knowledgeable in this field, I'd love to hear it.

2ct7 is a very stable chemical.

If for whatever reason you canot keep it in an air tight vial and decide to go through with keeping it in solution i would recomend you use everclear or bacardi 151 or any other high proof alcohol. It should last you quite a long time like that.

Also, it's soluble enough in distilled H2O that it can dissolve into 15mg/mL at room temperature with some minimal stirring.  I haven't tried higher concentrations.

Yeah, I have a small amount of T7 that has been in solution for seven years now, and all is well.  Very stable compound.  Shulgin actually mentioned that he tested some T4 and T7 that were sitting exposed on a shelf for 15 years and they did not degrade.

^^^ That was not in solution, just for clarification. And, I'm not sure if he meant in an airtight vial or not (this could still be exposed depending on your standards, i.e. to temp).

Delsyd: I'm using solution for measuring purposes. Is your method verified?


Xorkoth: does it preserve well in distilled H2O over long periods of time, i.e. months, perhaps many months?


MGS: question of the day -- *what solution? *You say all is well -- *how well? *


thanks for the info, all of you. Xorkoth, you may wish to move this or copy this to the stability & solubility thread, as that's where I initially intended it to end up.

Yeah, it will last a long time.  years, I'm sure.  Just make sure if you plan on storing it long-term to put it somewhere away from air, in the dark, and in a cool or cold place.  The fridge works very well.

I actually have two solutions, one water and one EtOH.  Both are *well* as in no degredation, no color change, looks the same as it does when I made it.  I tried some of the alcohol T7 solution over summer 2005 and no potency loss was noted.

If i dosed 20mg 2ct7 and there was little effect after several hours would it be wise to redose or would this add little effect?


I'm asking because 2cs are generally weak on me and i need to dose high! I don't feel safe jumping in at the deep-end with 2ct7 tho, best be safe ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Should be no problem. I can redose on 2cs all night (and in a rare case 2ce all week ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) )


wow I miss that t7 loved up warm fuzzy fealin.

I have the same problem with 2c's I need about 35mg 2ce for full effects while most people like around 16.

there seems to be a wide range of responses to t7 in the trip reports i've read.  would you guys say t7 is closer in overall effect to the other 2C's or to the MDxx family like MDA?

So what would you recommend would be a good oral dose for a first timer?  20-25mg?  Less?  Should i plug it, is it really that much better?  I've never plugged anything.

rectal is reportedly supposed to produce much less nausea/discomfort during the coming up period. It also cuts the coming up period in half about, from what I gather.


Somewhere in dosage of half what you'd take for oral (so its somewhere in between nasal and oral, nasal is supposedly 1/3 of an oral dose to produce similar effects).


I'm thinking about taking 12.5mg rectal for a first experience then 17.5mg rectal for a second one.


Or I was thinking about 15mg rectal for a first experience but I'm unsure if this may be 'too much.'

If one were to have some come from somewhere, theoretically, would it be worth doing or is it best to not go through the effort on this one and get something else that is available?

thanks for the feedback NBSP, so you plugged 12-13mg and found it plenty for a +3??? If one only has a small amount of this chemical one is careful to not underdose too many times and never reach a full +3 with what he has.


I'd be curious in a TR if you feel like writing one. That aren't many on rectal T7.

Indeed, whoever said that it should be fine, you shouldn't say that unless you know it. T7 is an MAO inhibitor and I think I read of a death from somewhere around 30mg oral.

The more I hear about deaths, the less I want to try it...


But I've heard its by far the best out of all the phens...

I'd imagine the possibility for death is there if mixing with a few other 2CTs (such as T2, T21, etc).


Be careful with those chemicals! I wouldn't mix 2CT7 with anything apart from a few tokes of marijuana.

50-60mg insufflated sounds like an insanse dose, when the report deaths were in the 30-40mg range.


What oral dose do you usually take?''

Yeah, I think whoever takes more than 40mg of any 2C-T-X is an idiot.


Hell I was a hardhead and 30mg of 2C-T-2 was a SHIT TON more than I bargained for!


Looking on Erowid though... it seems to have a fairly good track record... only three of the 26 reports marked as health problems were oral dosings without mixing with other drugs... out of 206 reports, that's awesome.

btw rectal does not fully pass the first pass metabolism, somebody correct me if I'm wrong. I think only a percent of the chemical fully passes. Regardless the dosage is somewhere between oral and nasal, suggesting there is more of a buffer for rectal than there is nasal. 30-40mg insufflated is going to be around 90-100mg where 30-40mg rectal would be 60-80 (both are HUGE and very dangerous dosages!).


This is just from what I gather comparing all available data.

So from what I'm reading, as long as you have a scale that can measure 10-14mg effectively, rectal is the way to go?


I refuse to put this stuff up my nose. Especially with the near-instant puke reaction. Not to mention the deaths.

I can't find someone who has both done oral and rectal 2CT7 that doesn't recommend rectal as the definite way to go with this chemical.


I put all 2Cs up my butt anyways, so this will definitely be squirted up there too when the time comes.


But, 14mg may be a very strong trip, depending on your sensitivity (remember, even if you've tried some non-sulfur 2Cs before, you will probably react with a different sensitivity to 2CT7 and its ilk).


Its generally considered to be twice as strong, rectally, but the peak is probably stronger than twice an oral dose, since the peak plasma levels probably go up higher (due to faster absorption, etc).

Personally I have found rectal to be more physically pleasurable and euphoric, and to have significantly less body load and no nausea whatsoever.  Plus, rectal cuts at least half the time off the come up, which can be overwhelming for many substances, but with T-7, it shortens it to just the right length to be easy, but not as annoyingly long as it can be orally.

comeup was fast as all hell, to the point of making me nervous. Was getting signals instantly, feeling full effects in maybe 10 mins maximum. I've plugged a few times before and I've never had a comeup this fast.


I quickly got off my toilet, where I initially administered it, and began pacing around my apartment. Wasn't speedy as much as I felt it was simply conducive to restlessness, if that makes any sense. Lost myself pretty easily, though, walking around. I wasn't in a full-blown state of nonphysical transcendence, but I'd forget I even existed, off and on, just by following the abstractions of my own thoughts. This is maybe T+ 00:15-00:20.


visuals had a somewhat synaesthesiac quality about them. I felt almost as though they were affecting me physically. I first noticed them in my peripheral vision perhaps 20 mins after dosing; massive distortion and melting of colors as if I were being sucked into a psychedelic wormhole that just happened to be behind me. This quickly transformed into my feeling like I actually *was *being pulled backwards somehow, providing the physical sensation of being in a wind tunnel, or something similar. I was still being almost uncomfortably overwhelmed by the rapid comeup at this point.


I levelled out a bit maybe T+ 00:25, when my girl called me on the telephone. I found I could concentrate on the telephone convo with relative ease and keep the more immersive sensory effects of the dose at bay, although it took some effort to get into the mindset. While on the phone I took a very observational standpoint in regards to how this chem was affecting me. I deduced it was quite plainly pushing my happy buttons -- i.e. somewhat euphoric, giddy -- and the visuals weren't so overwhelming; rather they'd come out in relatively majestic splendor when I made a point to observe them (or observe anything).


I also acknowledged I'd been afflicted by nausea since the comeup that'd spontaneously feel like it was creeping up my throat, although I never had any actual trouble keeping my food down. It wasn't really bad or intrusive at all, just noticeable. Additionally, there was a short instance of numbness in my lower legs, which struck me as a distinctly 2C-T-x symptom in my limited experience with the chemical family. There was a bit of difficulty regulating my body temperature as well. These were all things I was giving very serious consideration, as I was quite distinctly experimenting, trying to decide if I preferred the rectal route at all.


my thoughts were undeniably abstract, undeniably psychedelic while conversating on the telephone, but their direction was not particularly profound. I attribute this less to dose and more to my not making a conscious effort to cultivate the mindstate. In being on the telephone, I felt I was almost doing the opposite. Plus I was very tired, physically. I'd been up all day.


throughout the night, I kept amused by just being myself, thinking, and appreciating my own existence, in a very basic manner. There was certainly mental clarity; i.e. I was not cognitively handicapped or muddled much at all. I simply wasn't feeling up to any complicated mental undertakings. This means much of what went on in my head, while amazing in the way most psychedelic experiences are amazing, would likely have little impact on a sober person, as they didn't delve into much uncharted territory.


one defining characteristic of this experience was my excitement, for lack of a better word. I was very happy and very enthused to be doing whatever I was doing. Another, naturally, was the visuals. They were very unique. I kept myself entertained here and there by playing with them. The most interesting thing I saw that night by far was a subtle shadow on my carpet transform into a fractal image of all sorts of moving gears and pinwheels, eclipsing nearly my entire floor to the point of my feeling like I was sinking down inside it. Shit was beautiful, and almost DMT-like in its style, although not as colorful by any means.


speaking of DMT, I wish I smoked DMT while on this. But I didn't ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


the visuals weakened abruptly around the 2:30 mark, and became totally nonexistent by maybe 3:30 at the latest. The excitement waned, but persisted vaguely and slowly tapered off into an afterglow up to 7:00 or later.


I'm getting sick of writing. In short, the dose was *fast, *strong, but manageable. By far the *least *manageable part of it was how fucking fast it happened. I'm not sure if I'll even practice handling this rectal admin further or what. I'm considering just resorting to oral because it seems like many characteristics of this experience were out of balance. Who knows. Time will tell.


**edit:** btw, I only have experience taking oral T-7 two times, neither of which are particularly qualitative (one was low dose, one was unknown dose). So in a lot of ways I'm just taking stabs in the dark trying to figure out what the fuck this chem is doing to me; I can't say much about how it compares to oral full-on. Not yet. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

wow I would not of guessed that it comes on that fast. I haven't heard similar effects from others. I would have guessed it'd be more like 2CE (first alerts at 10-15 then begin the peak at 1 hour).


One thing you might try is staggering your rectal dose to slow down the peak plasma levels. LIke one 7mg dose at T+0 and another 6-7mg dose at T+20mins.

my comeups on 2C-E have been faster than that. I've peaked in perhaps 30-35 minutes rectally before, although I've only done it a few times. Still, I cannot believe this T-7 onset was so ridiculously fast.


I'm sure I'll try different things and get a feel for what happens in the future. I wouldn't dream of completely giving up on rectal admin unless there was really no upside to it. But in my limited experience taking it orally, I don't think I'm particularly succeptible to the unpleasant side effects, so it isn't much of an issue for me at all.

One question: people often combine 2CT7 with MDMA (and there are a few reports combined with methylone). Although this has in the past resulted in fatalities (due to the MAOI properties of 2CT7 resulting in serotonin syndrome).


**What about combining 2CT7 with amphetamine?**?

maybe a small dose of amphetamine (say 10-20mg) with like 14-18mg of 2C-T-7..


i would probably just use 25mg orally of 2C-T-7 , after a check for any reactions to the chemical ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I remember someone making a comment in the plugging thread, about evacuating your colon to make sure some lingering feces doesn't absorb your dose. This never occurred to me before. When I took this T-7, I gave myself a fair bit of enema with the syringe in an effort to help optimize my absorption. But now I am absolutely baffled at my absorption.


I've got a fair but not an exceptional tolerance to phens in general. I certainly don't have one for 2C-T-7. Even still, I could consider my dose recreational. It's just a matter of whether I'd want to have such a skewed experience recreationally, or if I can alter my approach and find better ways to do it.

Did you marquis test the material? It sounds a lot like the time profile of 2CB to me, but I guess if you peak that fast on 2CE, its possible you peak fast on 2CT7 as well. We all react different, etc etc.


anyways thanks for your report it was interesting to read!

Well, anyway, I would think that it would hard to NOT be able to easily tell 2C-T-7 and 2C-B apart, for someone experienced.


But yeah, the timeline does not fit 2C-T-7, that's for sure.

Also note the dosage (14mg rectal) matches what I imagine would be a very intense and visual 2CB trip.

I've never done 2C-B. This purported T-7 strikes me distinctly as a 2C-T-x, but I suppose I could be mistaken. It's also exceptionally fluffy like T-2 is. I'm too disenthused to marquis test; I'll know for sure once I do 2C-B myself. I dose by intuition, not by recommendation...I will not overdose in the meantime.


does B have a ridiculously fast comeup like that or something? I think this 10 mins is an anomaly regardless of how you look at it.

rectal 2CB (like rectal 2CD) has first alerts at 7-10mins and peaks by 15-20mins. It is VERY fast, a rocket ride (esp. 2CD, I've never taken a super high rectal dose of 2CB).


Why don't you buy a marquis test and find out for yourself? 2CB gives a VERY distinct test (beautiful lime green, the predominant color of 2CB visuals for me ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)).

The times of duration that you listed make it sound much more like a 2C-X than a 2C-T-X...... I haven't had 2C-T-7... but even just orally, 2C-T-2 didn't leave the plateau for a good 5 hours... 2 1/2 hours sounds much more like 2C-B from everything I've read but I've never done 2C-B. The peak duration just seems to match.

well when I say it felt like a 2C-T-x, I mean it just felt like a 2C-T-x in my body. Also, kat, this actually does somewhat correspond with how long phases of T-x doses last for me personally; taking into consideration the discrepancy between rectal and oral.


samadhi, I don't buy a marquis test because I'm lazy. Maybe if I saw a link for some shit right in front of me and it was cheap, I would. Until then, or until I do 2C-B for myself -- couple months max, I'd say -- all that matters to me is my personal relationship with this chemical, honestly...not what name it bears, and not what other people recommend I do with it. I've given consideration to the possibility I'm doing 2C-B based on what people've told me in this thread, but it isn't so pressing an emergency I feel the need to play detective before I continue. That's just how I roll, I guess.


I apologize to those who know where I got this T-7; I know you guys are out there. But if you're so concerned about your chems, you should test them yourself.

well, aside from this mystery bag, I've only done T-2. The comeup takes a while, but is comparable to the other 2C-x chems I've done. So is the peak. It's the T-x comedown that really stretches out in my experience, and sets it apart. That's consistent with my forays into this T-7 bag as well, both orally and rectally. Given my other experience with plugging, it just seems to add up, given my knowledge of how my body reacts to these chemicals. That's why I'm not insistent on testing this bag: it isn't a matter of my wanting to remain ignorant or my not giving a shit; I simply don't believe I'm doing 2C-B.

That sounds *very* similar to my rectal 2C-T-2 experience.  Alerts in about a minute, peak by 10, vomiting by 15!  There is no reduction in body load ... which makes sense because the nausea of 2C-T-x's seem highly correlated with the plasma concentration.  


YES, rectal dosing **increases** nausea!!!  And it shortens the trip ... to a nearly useless level.  I'll admit, for low dose recreational trips it could be great, but there are many more problems with rectal admin besides the fact that you have to stick a drug where the sun don't shine.  


Nobody listens when I mention the pharmacokinetics of rectal admin!!!  It seems so much shorter because of the abrupt peak and steep drop off.  It's meaningless to say 14 mg rectal = 40 mg oral or whatever.  A better comparision would be 14 mg rectal = intensity of 45 mg (oral) peak for 1 hr, then peak of 30 mg for 2 hr, then 20 mg and so on.  The pharmacokinetics is completely different.  I posted a graph in the rectal admin thread, but I'll repost (EV is similar to rectal or insufflation).  Once you're down to a trip that feels like 20 mg, you consider it pretty much over. 


With oral dosing, absorption continues to occur slowly as the drug is degraded creating a "plateau," whereas all of the drug is absorbed very quickly with rectal admin, so all you have left is a downhill slide.  


Read the above!!!  Rectal admin seems to be something of a "fad" on this board recently.  I have nothing against it, but people just seem to be doing it because everyone else is.  Consider the reasons your sticking things up your bum!  Is there really anything positive to come of it?  Again, if it is a low dose recreational trip, or some other recreational substances like cocaine or opiates, then it is probably optimal.  But for psychedelics, oral is superior.  Period.

to further clarify my point... if you do anything with 2C-T-7 other than take it by itself orally at 0-20mg you will possibly die. death is considered by some to be a highly undesirable side effect//.

this is most certainly a matter of opinion, considering different people like different things, and different routes of administration with different chems affect different people in different ways.

however I'm glad you've had similar experiences to mine; mine doesn't feel so out of place now.

And this is different from other drugs how, besides the dosage?


Whenever you take a substance, you kind of need to accept that as a "side effect", you may die. That does not mean, however, that you shouldn't do everything in your power to prevent it.


But I highly doubt that 21mg of 2C-T-7 orally will kill anyone

Politefully disagree! I like to blast myself out of the universe and return (somewhat quickly). Yes, rectal administration shortens the trip (a positive). No, the trip is not rendered useless because of this.


Rectal administration of fourth position tryptamines is especially useful. They come very close to a DMT experience.


Remember, we're not all looking for long plateaus to be in the psychedelic state. In a sense, we are all looking for something different with our psychedelic exploration.


I am looking to blast myself out of the universe with as high a dose as I feel is reasonably safe (to my body and mind).

Also...the timeline (according to my experience) of rectal admin of phens does not match your graph. The only difference is the comeup and comedown are abbreviated. The peak itself is as long as oral administration as far as I can tell (perhaps a tad shorter, but nothing drastic). Albeit this is only experience with 2CB, 2CE, and methylone.


fourth position tryptamines are certainly shorter, they seem to basically come on, peak for a few minutes, then drop away (although I've only experimented with 4-AcO-DMT and some 4-ho-DMT with this). I'd like to compare rectal admin of these chems with vaporizing them (I believe there will be a winner vaporizing 4-AcO-DMT for very short and very intense DMT-like experiences).


The greatest issue in length of peak seems to be the amount of drug one takes (more and this results in a longer peak).


peace!

I can't see how a shortened trip is good.  For me, the buildup to the peak...and the comedown are just as significant as the peak itself.  I agree that this rectal thing seems like a fad...and almost seems like some of you just like to put things in your butt...that's ok....I love it when my gal puts *her* fingers inside of me...but I see little use in taking away the best parts of a trip and calling that 'useful.'

Yes, it does give me a rush (shiver) of pleasure to insert chemicals into my rectum. I've honestly (and gladly) admitted this before. It didn't in the beginning. This only started after a really intense methylone trip and a VERY euphoric 2CD trip (trip report titled 'tent blanky shelter'). I have the feeling it is a conditioned response.


Of course, I have been accused of being gay on this board, which however is not true! Like you, I can admit that a certain amount of rectal stimulation feels good. This does not, ipso facto, make me homosexual (as you understand).


I also really like what happens 15 mins later after sticking the chem up there. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

It should be noted that the user who listed 125mg as their typical dose was a one time user who took this amount accidentally due to a weighing error.

It is true that 2C-T-7 carries more risk than many other psychedelics, but the risk of death is still minimal if you have no other drugs in your system and you use it responsibly.   You probably have more risk of dying from driving to your local supermarket than dying from a 30 mg oral dose of 2C-T-7 ... unless you drive to the supermarket after taking 30 mg 2C-T-7.  ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

My only experience is with 2C-T-2 (once) and oxycodone (twice), 

both of which had very rapid come ups (the drop off is more 

noticable with a psychedelic).  


The graph I posted is a comparison of intravenous (IV), extravascular 

(EV), and then oral, which is subject to large fluctuations.  

Extravascular is essentially intramuscular injection ... the drug just 

has to diffuse from the tissues into the bloodstream to get to the brain.  


Rectal and nasal mucous membranes constitute a very rapid 

absorption surface that can approach that of EV, but are also 

subject to some other factors.  Any extra mucous in your nose, 

or "stuff" in your rectum can significantly slow absorption.  So for 

these routes, the drug has to first get into the tissues, and then 

migrate to the bloodstream.  Also, rectal enema (fluid form) should 

be very close to EV, where as suppository is almost closer to oral.  


The bottom line is that the rate of absorption determines the 

comeup and the rate of both absorption and drug metabolism 

determine the full length.  When the absorption is very slow as with 

oral, the "plateau" increases significantly.  When it is very rapid, 

peak levels are reached quickly and drug metabolism becomes the 

determining factor, which results in a much earlier decline from the peak.  


To each his own I suppose.  All I know is that I've found rectal to be 

fairly useless since I like to have time to get comfortable with the 

psychedelic state before it becomes really interesting.

What would most of you guys say is the "sweet spot" dose with 2C-T-7?  I know it varies from person to person, but for example 4-aco-dmt's sweet spot is 25mg.  What would be the "sweet spot" for T7?  30mg?  35mg?  Less?  More?  I'm talking oral, btw.

35mg is nice for me...but 40mg is also awesome and 50mg is off-the-chart.  Please not that I seem to have a "natural tolerance" for 2C-T-7 and can take these higher dosages.  I'd recommend people use no more than 20mg or so until they know how T7 will affect them.

I've done this once at 23 mg. It was "pretty cool", but I think the sweet spot would be somewhere higher.

I'm thinking about trying this one, orally, for the first time and I can't really figure out how much to dose. I was thinking 15mg at first, but I don't want to be underwhelmed. I also don't want to be overwhelmed, so I won't take 30mg. Somewhere in between - maybe 22mg?


What about a small amount of 2CD (10mg oral?) as an adjunct to the t7 in case at 3 or so hours I'm not quite where I want to be?

15mg will underwhelm you, but it's still a cool compliment to your day. Consider doing it just to get a feel for the chemical if you're not quite in the mood to have a full experience. If you are in the mood for a full experience, but don't wanna delve too deep into unexplored territory, I'd say something like 25mg would do you fine without really compromising you in too serious a fashion.


I thought you did T-7 before? I could've sworn you said this.

So around 35 milligrams would probably be the dose I first want to take?  I have never taken 2C-T-7 before, so I'm not sure how my body will react to it.  But I gave 30mg to 4 different people and they all had a fun time.


I do know, however, how my body reacts to 2C-T-2, which I believe to be extremely similar.  With 2C-T-2, my ideal dose is like 25-27mg.


What do you guys think?  Should I start by taking 30mg and then boost it 5-10mg if it's not as far as I want to get?

Also, with rectal administration (which I have never tried), I have a question.  I receive 85mg of Methadone HCl every morning.  Therefore, being in a constant state of opiate fuzziness (though I barely feel the effect, it just keeps me from getting sick), I am *usually* constipated, at least somewhat.


I know that you are supposed to "clear your bowels" before rectal admin.  The worry that I have is that since I'm constipated most of the time, it may be hard to do this unless I use an enema (which is not worth it and i'd rather do oral)


Will my constipation affect attempted rectal administration of either 2c-t-7, mdma, 4-aco-dmt, or 4-ho-mipt?  Like, is it possible that it wouldn't work at all or very minimally? 


Should I start drinking lots of fiber (Citrucel) and try to become regular before attempting this?  Or should I just forget the entire idea and stick with oral?

Some people are very strongly effected by T7.  T2 is a different drug...don't base anything on that.  Start off with no more than 10mg...as Shulgin said many can reach a +3 at that level.

As an opiate addict (currently on suboxone)...I really recommend you start taking better care of your bowels.....you need to start taking in lots of fiber, and use flax seeds as a stool softener.  You really need to do this or you are going to have health problems down the line.  Don't fear enemas....cleans you out and makes one feel quite refreshed and 'clean' afterwards.  


Any feces will hinder absorption.

I dosed 30mg orally 2 days ago and it was an intense +3 for me.  Delerium, tryptamine like effects, i could barely see, it was the most intense 2C experience i have ever had.  but i loved it.  I think the oral dose depends on body weight.  I weigh like 110.  My friend who weighs like 135 or so did not get as intense of effects as me, but he still was tripping.  It is very long lasting.

I tried 5mg railed, 30mg eaten.. +3 for sure.. so many visuals i couldn't see infront of myself.. at the 3-4hr point things got scarry.. starting halucinating big time with things attacking me and i was freaking out big time.


20mg eaten tho, really nice, smooth on the body and ok visuals.. 35mg visuals was INSANE in comparison tho.. however i wouldn't recomend more than 30mg for most people.. keep in mind i'm only 63kg (138lb for you imperial old skool non metric people)


I would say start at 25mg.. if it isn't enough bump up another 5mg.. and so forth.. you can always have more... once its in, its in..


if you have any current mental issues, freak outs, bad experiances plauging you or something.. i would not recomend a high dosage..

So if your dose orally turns out not being enough to get "there", you can insufflate bumps to increase the intensity?  What size bumps would you recommend doing at a time?  3mg?  5mg?

**2C-T-7 a MAOI?**


Saw some comments in this thread that 2c-t-7 works as an maoi.  Does this mean that it's not safe to take while on ssri's?  I should be off the ADs soon and am willing to wait.


psilocybonaut - just from reading the thread snorting doesn't sound like a good idea, especially if you already have some in you.  A lot will depend on the accuracy of your scales.

i would say eaten is always the safest.. but if you were going to bump your way via railing (snorting/sniffing) i would say keep it low, say 3mg.. maybe less? if your scales can do it.. go 2mg bumps.. 


watch out tho, this is the most dangerous substance to sniff.... the safest way would be to just eat 25mg.. and next time eat more if it wasn't enough..


enjoy!

first time attempting anything other than a threshold dose of 2CTx (and first time doing any dose of t7).


sigh...14mg oral of the t7 produced....nothing...well maybe a + for a few minutes.


Now that I think about it I may have been tripping for a little while...since I stopped on the trail near a sandy part and played with some dirt for a long time, giggling and laughing and saying "dirt is good" over and over again. But, I'm also somewhat strange sober so who knows really?


I think I'll plug 16mg next time and hope for a +3 seeing as how this was barely threshold for me (little bit of phen tolerance latelyt hough).


ps although I think the DMT smoked at about T+6 hours was potentiated.

I will be trying this substance in the very near future, but I'm completely flaky deciding on a dosing plan. There are so much uncertainties to take into account, it seems wise to start off with no more than 10 mg. It's too bad there is a real chance I will barely feel anything at all, but what kind of effect can one expect from a substantial supplemental dose? Say it is hardly active at T+4:00, is it likely another 10 mg will produce a worthwhile increase in effect? Should I be wary of a sudden activation of the former dose? Would anyone care to speculate on a strategy that combines responsibility with maximizing the chance of getting a good feel of this compound? If real advice is deemed inappropriate, keep it general... much appreciated! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

There are more than a few reports that suggest redosing that late on phenethylamines is not worth it.


Why not go for 15mg for a first dose. You still might not feel much, but you have a better chance of feeling a ++. Just my advice though, don't let it be the end-all-be-all for you...use your own judgement.


I took 14mg, with very little phen tolerance, and felt nothing at all.


Of course, you should try a small dose (1 tenth the size of an active dose) to check for allergic reactions, especially with 2CT7.

About 2:20 ago I tried 3 mg to check for idiosyncratic responses...

Just now I could have sworn I felt a tiny bit of skincrawling sensation on top of my head, a hint to a body load buzz and maybe even a bit more visual anomalies than I normally experience due to some minimal HPPD effects I'm experiencing lately. I haven't tripped a lot the last months but I just ended a bout of near-daily GHB usage, it just seems I have heightened sensitivity or awareness in general. It's extremely mild and totally benevolent, but looking at mosaic-patterns for instance makes me feel like they could begin to swim around any second or kind of do sometimes... ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Anyway I'll post later if this is turning out to be a + or if I'm kidding myself, just curious though what this will mean for my plan to do around 13-17 mg on wednesday... will below-threshold doses have any kind of tolerance effect at all?

Thanks for the advice by the way S_S, I love your ideas, mentality and seemingly well- (and on experience) founded opinions.

Don't worry about me not using my own judgement tho, I have decent experience for myself, I'm a chem major and I've been developing my insights and knowledge on psychology, metaphysics and well you know... the stuff that really seems to matter these days ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif) 


Just now..... I found myself thinking: there is definitely a feeling of something I've never felt before and a few phen-type qualities to it like the way my mouth feels. I must be pretty sensitive to T-7, which probably makes excellent milage for this stuff! :D

I'm pretty sure 3mg orally would not produce any noticeable effects.  Unless you were a rat, maybe.

It has been said before: there are quite some people out there who can get a +++ from 10 mg, there's a freakout report on Erowid from 5 mg ; Murple is quoted saying he got strong visual effects from 5 mg orally - is it that hard to believe I got a + which I most definitely did? It may have been a weak experience but baseline is different nonetheless. Absolutely not to flame you but never take yourself as a standard model especially when it comes to mostly unresearched psychedelics and that goes double for T-7 it seems. You hear about people getting kicked in the balls by seemingly insignificant doses and people insufflating mountains of a substance and still not feeling it all the time... Is it an attentive mind, is it purity or is it receptor-count and biochemical affinity? Probably a mix of those which goes to show that you can never be too careful with this kind of stuff, even when the majority responds more or less consistently ... at least I'm glad I was.


The hard thing though, is to extrapolate such sensations to come up with a sensible dose to continue with. I feel that I could accomplish much with about 15 mgs, it may even be too much but probably not too much too much... ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


On top of that: the solution was 15 ml containing 20% alcohol, is it possible this compounded better absorption?

3mg would definiteny produce effects for some, as 10mg produces +++ for some.  2C-T-7 is quite variable in its effects.  10mg produces a + 1/2 for me...I doubt 3mg would do much but again, everyone is different.

Yeah, 2C-T-7 is one of the most variable psychedelics I've encountered.  In fact, perhaps the most.  2C-E also seems to be extraordinarily variable. 


For me, 35mg orally produced a relatively weak (but definitely +2) effect.  But 42mg orally produced a very strong, disconcerting effect with loads of vomiting and a bit of delusion of out-of-control violent acts.  And strangely, only very strong color amplification... it never got very visual for me for some reason.  This was before I had overused psychedelics and gained a lot of tolerance.


On the other hand, 15mg rectally, after I had gained a lot of tolerance, produced an intensely pleasurable and animated state for an entire day, with non-stop talking and loads of empathy and insight.  Still very little visual change though... it's only ever produced a very strong color saturation effect on me, stronger than even DOC (which makes everything positively glow with brilliance).


Finally, 5mg nasally produces a similar feeling as 15mg rectally for me,  but faster, shorter, and harsher.  And nasal burn like you wouldn't believe that lasts for 20-30 minutes. ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

I put a few little flakes in my nose not long ago...probably 1-2mg; not even enough to feel a burn of any sort. I definitely felt some jitters and mood boosting effects for the next half hour or so, which was kinda surprising. 


I know I read a report on erowid a while back about a guy vaporizing tiny-ass 2-3mg bumps and feeling +3 effects for the next 6 hours. I doubt it'll affect me that profoundly, but I'm considering saving some scrap at the bottom of my bag to experiment with this method. Has anyone tried smoking T-7 or know anything declarative about it?

The most positive reports come from oral dosing.  Almost without failure, the negative reports involve dosing via other methods.


Stick with oral dosing.

I only have 28mg of the substance and I was ideally wanting to try it more than once. My source for 2c-t-7 is now no longer around, I was wondering if anyone had any information on the risks of smoking it? It seems to require a much smaller dosage for the same effects (1-5mg range).

honestly, I know this is outside the bounds of safe dosing practices...but if you already know your body doesn't react adversely to the chemical itself, sniff two matchheads and see what happens. If you can gauge the experience after five or ten mins and it isn't looking satisfactory, bump a bit more. I just recently discovered the usefulness of insufflating this chemical...it is by far my favorite route of administration at this point. I don't know weights; I've only ever used liquid measurement...but my ideal dose looks something like five or six matchheads, by my subjective interpretation. Just make sure to keep the increments small to minimize the possibility of hazard, and try to be intuitive with your body before going in too deep, if you indeed choose to do this.


yeah, I know this is really irresponsible shit to tell a person, but the fact is, people are gonna do it anyway, and I might as well make my opinion on the matter public.

Just remember that most of the positive reports you read (and all of them in the literature) are from oral dosing.  Some people may find it enjoyable when snorted, smoked, etc...but consider that if you are looking for an experience like that in PIHKAL, those in the MAPS literature, etc...you aren't going to get it by smoking it or snorting it.


I've never smoked the material, but snorting it is VERY different than taking it orally.  Much of the difference is because of the rush of intense effects/speed of onset, etc.  I'm fairly certain based on my experience with smoking other compounds that 2C-T-7 is no different...ie smoking it is a 'whole other trip.'

isnt mixing other serotonergic drugs and SSRIs also a really unpleasant way to die? this would obviously include 2C-T-7.

Me and a friend tried 2ct7 for the first time together yesterday.  25mg each orally.  Interesting expirience. For 6 hours we both felt like coming up, but never actually got there.


A lot of stimulation, energy, talkativeness, significant positive mood push. And body temps defenatelly went up, I felt fairly warm, but never sweaty. Had to wash my face every few hours, as it felt/got greasy.


No visuals at all, if I stared at something with a pattern, without blinking, or focusing, I could make paterns flow/wave very slightly. Other than that, vision did seem enhanced, world looked really clear.


No nausia, or body aches at all really. Tummy did growl at bit at the end, but that is from not eating I think.  


I must say we both really liked the substance. What is the safe dosage increase we should move up at? From 25 to 35, would that be safe for next time? I dont mind a very strong trip, I just worry about 2ct7 deaths, still with no reported mechanism of death ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)

There is a steep dose/response curve.  20mg-25mg does not do much for me either...but 35mg is enough for a full +3.  If you stick with oral dosing, and move up slowly...you are being as 'safe' as one can be.  Almost all of the negative reports involving T7 were not with oral dosing.

has anybody here experienced anything that could possibly be a 2ct7 flashback?


a couple months ago I had a very strange thought induced +4 on insufflated T7 at a dose of around 15mg over a period of a couple hours.


after having extreme anxiety about the strength of my dose and worrying about my health after the last bump I took, I had calmed down enough to have conversation with the people that I was tripping with. our discussion twisted and turned and brought me to a point where I mentioned a salvia experience I had had years ago which I was never able to fully understand.


It had happened before I had any real experience with psychedelics at all and I didn't know at the time what to make of it. I was granted a very brief vision that my human experience and life was only but an arm or a leg of my entire transcendental existence. as I went into detail about this curious memory while on T7, something remarkable happened. I began repeating the experience just through conscious exploration.


I dawned upon an ineffable realization that I was existing in other dimensions simultaneously in ways I wasn't soberly aware of. The realization was very personal - one of being watched, observed, and taught and guided through my human perception of the world by a force beyond it that very well could be my higher dimensional self.


crazy talk, right? during this experience I began leaving behind my moment to moment reality and was ascending to a place where human life and perception was child's play. I felt other presences there, which recognized me and acknowledged my presence. this isn't a trip report so I won't go into crazy detail which is best anyway because I still don't know what to really make of this experience and I don't want to pollute it by hypothesizing a scenario which never actually happened.


anyway, I drifted further and further into this higher and separate reality and I felt absolutely convinced that because of the brevity of the transcendence, I could willfully leave behind my human body by my participation in this other existence. it was so epic that I believed the event could have real world implications such as even erasing my time line as a human being to convenience my arrival at this other plane of consciousness beyond the physical. or possibly death.


my entire body started convulsing with energy, I couldn't stop shaking and I was losing physical awareness of my body and having it replaced with a vibrational energy which almost felt like electricity coursing through my limbs. my heart rate was through the roof and I was scared that I wasn't ready for such an experience. I felt like I could've gone so much further but I couldn't trust that it wouldn't harm me. 


when my instincts had told me that I had had enough I realized the only way I could make this experience stop was to distract myself until the T7 had worn off enough that this transcendence wouldn't be involuntary. I managed to find a safe spot in my head to wait the trip out, knowing that my sense of reality had been changed forever. my body calmed down as it's excitement was directly correlated with my mental experience.


back to the point: I was intimidated against doing t7 again for a long period of time because this experience had left it's mark on me in a frighteningly potent way which for the first time in my life, had me face my unacknowledged and untouched fears of death. I only did it again maybe a month later at a purposefully small dose (for me) of about 15-20mg orally. it was an inconsequential trip that I enjoyed but nothing big came of it.


3 days later after that fact, I was in a car driving with a handful of people completely sober except for a 5 hour energy drink which is mostly just B vitamins and no caffeine. we smoked a surprisingly strong blunt and that's when the anomaly began. my entire body started convulsing and I began separating from the momentary fleetingness of time. I began moving to a place where I could look at the transitory nature of reality affectionately because I knew what was beyond it. this is usually a beautiful experience for me but I was disturbed by the feel of the psychedelic effects which were undeniably flavored by t7. This worried me and I was making my best efforts to remain calm through all of it. I had somebody in the car feel my heart beat to gage if it was really as fucked up as it felt, (just as it had on my first epic t7 experience), and they considerately lied to me and told me it felt fine to help me remain calm. later on, they told me it wasn't normal at all - my pulse was extremely hard and fast and all I was doing was sitting in a car.


obviously I won't repeat the combination again and I chalk it up to weed's ability to elevate your heart rate and the energy drinks stimulation which gave me the convulsions - but the t7 flavor is one that I won't forget and I know this wouldn't have happened to me had I not ingested it just a few days before. the similarities between what happened to me in that car and what happened to me a while ago on t7 are undeniable. I know what my head feels like on different kinds of psychedelics and the t7 head space is very recognizable for me.


*shrugs* I guess I just felt like sharing my story. any comments or thoughts are appreciated.

Mini-report:

Sunday evening a friend and I tripped on 2C-T-7. It had been tested twice previously by me, once 1-2 mg for idiosyncratic reactions, i definitely was off baseline! then 14 which was a little 2C-B-ish but just under the 'real threshold', minimal sparkles at most.

This sunday I began with 24 mg and a friend at 14, it was his first time. It was his own decision but I tried to be as informative and objective as possible, but he added more over the course of at least 3 hours to come to a total of 34 mg. He said at times it was overwhelming only to the senses, not the mind - if you will. I myself upped to 30 mg with added GHB, cannabis and nitrous. I did not experience any body load whatsoever during the trip, it felt a little buzzy like a family member of an empathogen or PEA. There was a little burpy thing but I managed it easily through meditation, possibly the same kind of energy emanating from the heart chakra (or just 5HT-3 binding in the stomache) MDMA can have: fake chemical nausea, that can be directed. Visual the stuff was rich, balloons produced effects like all my senses melding into a lava lamp type of nebula. We saw impossible things happening in HD documentaries. There were some shivers now and then, temp regulation seemed a little confused. My friend had a nasty pressure on his head and behind his nose, like he said.

He's on Risperdal almost daily and discontinued that day until abortion. After like 9 hours we called it a day. I took Zolpidem and he his Risperdal, after that didnt quite did the trick I gave both of us a tiny bit Xanax which didnt do a thing for him but mellowed me out plenty.

I've had no hangover and took a tested amount of 270 ug LSD on monday which produced very little (what a waste).


All in all I rate it superior to 2C-B and wish to take a higher dose or wait until lower tolerance to see it's fullest potential. A jewel if you appreciate my opinion =)

I definitely also find T-7 superior to MDMA.  It is more mental, yet doesn't seem to have a "cosmic" direction to it... it's much more emotion/feeling based.  It also makes me feel very witty, humorous and talkative.  Visually it beats 2C-B as well, and produces a similar sort of inner warmth and euphoria, although T-7 is a bit less forced I would say.  I also enjoy the duration and the lack of body load (unless you dose too high... then it can cause quite the bodyload, believe you me).

2C-T-7 is like MDMA X 1000 plus a little mescaline thrown in.  Wonderful material, my favorite actually.

Feelgoodhit, that could be way too much depending on your tolerance to it. Have you tried other 2CT's? I seem to recall you having tried t21?


You do NOT want to overdose on t7

When comparing the level of somatic and mental effects of the trip to its visual effects, 2C-T-7 is the most potently visual psychedelic I've ever used.  It's also the most "synthetic."  It has a very digital aesthetic where everything seems clean and smooth.  Segmented creatures seem to dominate its landscapes, which are cast in an eerie and unnatural light.  This description may sound unfavorable, but I think these qualities are great virtues because it means it takes me places other psychedelics don't.   


I have what I'm guessing is around 13-15mgs clinging to the bottoms of two separate vials that I'm saving for a rainy day.  I think I'll mix it with something, as that much probably won't be enough for my taste.  I'm thinking of partnering it with mescaline, 2C-E, or TMA-6.  Any opinions on which one of these would make the "least adulterated" 2C-T-7-ish mix?

^ i dunno if I'd go mixing 2ct7 with other drugs particularly other phenylethylamines with stimulating qualities. That said this is not exactly my forte, and perhaps someone can give a more specific answer.

Considering how rough it is on the body and its more-dangerous-than-most track record you may be right there.  I don't want to insufflate it as that's more pain than it's worth.  It's been sitting there for years already and I suppose it wouldn't be any great tragedy to just let it degrade away.  Just saw the thread and let my mind wonder-babble...

Still very little visual change though... it's only ever produced a very strong color saturation effect on me, stronger than even DOC (which makes everything positively glow with brilliance).

And how badly did that burn?  This is the other option I was considering but figured it would burn terribly.  Looking at the vials again it looks like I have more like 10mgs.  Rectal dissolved in DMSO might be the only way I could make it worthwhile.

There's no need to dissolve it in DMSO to make it worthwhile rectally.  I can't see where that would make much of a difference actually.  Often times I've just shoved the gel cap up there with some lotion and it was good to go.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  As far as pairing it up with something, I think that 2C-T-7 is probably the most mescaline-like of the 2C series that I've tried, and I've always suspected that they would go together magically.  I didn't find it synthetic feeling at all; to me it felt like a holy natural state.  Maybe that's just me though.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


feelgoodhit: Individual sensitivity to the 2C-T series seems to vary widely.  That said, no matter where your sensitivity lies 25mg is pretty much guaranteed to get you off.  I would probably just eat the whole thing, but if you wanted to be safe perhaps try eating 20mg and then, in two hours if you feel it necessary, eat the rest.

Well, it definitely burns... more than any other 2C-X.  The burn faded after 5 or 10 minutes though.  I definitely had to deal with it until then though.  There is no question that it was worth it, for me.

Rectal dosing lowers duration for sure... although the peak is not shorted by a lot in my experience.  Mostly it's the come-up and come-down/aftereffects that are shorted the most.  For example, orally, T-7 takes a good 3 hours to really get strongly going... it's a long one.  Rectally though it starts working strongly much faster... in a half hour you'll be tripping good and strong.  So that's 2.5 hours cut off right there, but it's not from the main effects.

Xorkoth: I've experimented with 2C-series drugs rectally a fair amount and my observations match yours quite a bit.  I found it very fascinating that the duration of the peak wasn't shortened by any noticeable amount.  Any other ROA that hits faster usually shortens the peak as well, but for whatever reason it's not the case with rectal.


Anyway, it's certainly the longest-lasting 2C I've tried.  I'd have to agree with the 12 hour figure.  Nothing can match its visuals either; not necessarily in quantity but in quality.  The geometric kaleidoscoping I experience from 2C-T-7 and, to a lesser extent, 2C-T-2 is just beautiful.

**2C-T-7 and Love. Need your advice!**


Hello, all. I've only posted here once before, concerning dropping Ecstasy weekly. It was an informative move, and I appreciate your inputs greatly. However, I'm pursuing other topics of self-exploration, now.. and would greatly value your input. Thanks in advance.


Now, I've been reading Thanatos to Eros, and my interest has been given a true prod - enough to act upon it. A bit earlier, reading the DMT Dandy and "What is your favorite psychadelic?" threads got my interested in the two chemicals as a possible first choice over LSD, in case I am unable to procure any soon. However, I'm intensely interested in the loved-up, empathic, euphoria that MDMA instills in it's users.. I have a very close group of friends who I roll with every Saturday. Very calm, mature people, some of whom I can genuinely say I love as friends. 


*Love.*


I read up on 2C-T-7, and while I understand that you should avoid insufflation and should keep your doses small and well-measured... I hear that it has the same extreme "love, euphoria" that comes with MDMA. Except that it also has extremely beautiful visuals.


I can handle the nausea; in fact, I recently popped two XBOX pills at once, due to how long it took to hit me (me and my friend figured we needed a second, due to never having had E hit us so late) and I ended up vomiting heavily due to excessive body-load. I actually was unable to move (90% paralysis) for about 5 minutes. I could hardly talk, due to my tongue being numb, in fact! However, I've recently stopped worrying about vomiting, and stuff of that nature - I realize that it is a part of the process, is natural, and have accepted it - when I did that, I actually had -fun- vomiting. Imagine that? I felt so "interested" with the whole paralysis experience, I just sat there mumbling "wow..." over and over. Intense.


I'm honestly ready to venture into the OEV realm, but I'd love to share the experience with that MDMA-love we all know. 


Is 2C-T-7 what I'm looking for?

Merged in a question about 2C-T-7.


All psychedelics affect everyone differently, so there are no guarantees that any of them will produce that kind of euphoria in you.  That being said, 2C-T-7 does tend to be a euphoric chemical that can facilitate increased love.  But please be aware that it is a full-on psychedelic and it is possible that it will become very mentally and physically intense... your post makes it unclear as to whether you've tripped on anything other than MDMA.  2C-T-7 will not be like MDMA.  It may share some characteristics, but that will be on the surface.  It is more than just visuals on top of MDMA euphoria, and if you go into it expecting that, you may end up being disappointed and/or afraid.


If you are looking for something psychedelic, however, it's a great chemical.  Just be aware that it's not going to be a substitute for MDMA. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yes! The visuals on 2CT7 I have to admit were the most beautiful I have ever seen, though they were a lot less than a tryptamine of course. They were like little beautiful crystal jewels hanging in the air rotating and circling around me. It was like there were a few 'things' in the air around me and not visuals in my head, very amazing.


Butane, if you get a chance I HIGHLY recommend combining DMT with 2CT7, it adds an amazing dimension to the visuals that really cannot be explained with words.


peace,

I've always thought that if (when more rather) I was going to combine a phenethylamine with a tryptamine, it would probably be 2C-T-7.  Thanks for the idea samadhi!

Rectal is A-OK.  I'd start with one third to one half of an oral dose.  As for the nausea, I think that's part and parcel of the experience.

I prefer it rectally... it comes up very fast and lasts quite some time, and there is no nausea at all with that method (for me).  Orally, I sometimes have gotten horrendous nausea and it takes like 3 hours to really come up.  The only downside (if you consider it that) is that the come-up is fast, and it can be an intense ride, whereas orally the come-up is very slow and gradual.

I puked so hard off a rectal dose of 2CT7 I bruised my sphincter muscle


take that fwiw


you'll still puke (if you're like me) if you take a strong dose of t7, no matter the route


I'd wager to say you'll puke harder on rectal since its more abrupt (I was tripping in 10 mins with a clean colon from an enema right beforehand)

Interesting... for me, the only reason I ever puked on T-7 was due to my stomach feeling so acidic from the chemical.  When I take it rectally, it burns very badly for a few minutes, so I just assumed it's an irritating chemical.  But since it was in my rectum and not my stomach, there was no hint of nausea by that route, only burning pain instead.

wow i find oral quite a stimulating experience i imagine snorted or rectally too be even more stimulating. its weird, i find it quite stimulating at first, and about 5 hours after injestion the ride turns into a MDMA like body high. i really rate this stuff, although i havnt gone past 20mg yet![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**2c-t-7 Question**


I've acquired 28mg of the stuff, now I don't want to do all 28 in one go as it may be a little intense for a first time. But also I don't want to have 2 sub-breakthrough trips...

What would you recommend?


I was thinking about doing say 10/12 and then 16/18 for a second time?

I heard you can smoke it in tiny amounts but don't really fancy that from a harm reduction perspective.

orally, I would personally recommend more than 10mg, but I took 14mg first time and felt practically nothing (though I do have fond recollections of the 'non-trip' so something must have been going on)


but 10mg would be conservative


sorry for not recommending a conservative dose

Thanks for the replies,

As I can't acquire any more of the stuff for the forseable future I'm going to do 10mg as a starter dose, then when the times right do 18 ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

**Hot-7**


Has anyone ever sampled HOT-7? 

Will it really treat you as similar to 2C-T-7 as Shulgin sez it does? 

What about dose for a first-timer(of both)?

**Hot-7**


Well, my ship has finally come in. My experiences are usually VERY spaced apart, so you'll have to exercise some more patience for a TR. And even then I can only hold a match to Xorkoth's eclectic experiences such as they are to be read on Erowid and BlueLight. Also, because I have no experience with 2C-T-7  I cannot make any comparison (bummer guys, I know).  All I can say now is that its physical properties are A LOT like 2C-E in almost all aspects except:


- its volume is somewhat (20 percent) higher compared to 2C-E (vial filled loosely and dropped from 2" on wood surface making it about 2ml to the gram),

- unlike 2C-E, it doesn't stick to the smoothest of surfaces, not even to the roughest. Its a dream to handle compared to 2C-E.


I hope have a melting point apparatus sometime in the next 3 months. I think m.p. should be a great and relatively cheap way to identify an RC. Why doesn't it happen more? 'Cause it's lossy?

Sorry if I compare to 2C-E so much; it's the only RC i've seen in any good amount. Come to think of it, it also looks a lot like the samples of 5MeO-DIPT, Br-DFly and DOI i've seen: just very fine slightly off-white powder ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif) 


Well, as they say patience is a virtue: Next time!


Peace.

15mg oral on an empty stomach


I didn't get much from 14mg oral but some people trip hard off that (hard to tell, 2CT7 is tricky dosage wise).


This will also give you much more confidence when you try 25mg as a second trial (which sounds about right for a +3 if you don't get a lot out of 15mg).

As you evidently are aware, even up to 35mg orally was fairly underwhelming to me, although I did have some tolerance then.  But 42mg was overpowering.  I'd recommend starting at 15mg as suggested by S_S, but don't be surprised if it's pretty weak.

I just re-read my post and I think I made an unintentional mistake: When I wrote of not being able to hold a match to Xorkoth's eclectic reports, I was thinking along the lines of "Can't hold a candle to something". I went a step further (or lower, if you look at it) and changed the candle into a puny match. Now it reads like I want to set fire to his TR's. Sorry Xorkoth, this was unintentional.![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

xorkoth I think 35mg and 42mg are VERY high doses of this chemical. Most people would be tripping extremely hard and I think 42mg might be pushing into the danger zone for some people.

The dose varies so widely from person to person.  Myself on 30mg, a blast!  The perfect dose.  My buddy Jason on 30mg, a mental breakdown.  He came out of it OK in the end, but it sure wasn't pleasant!

I agree.  I was just illustrating that it varies widely between users.  Morninggloryseed has said that he has enjoyed pushing it up as high as 70mg, and that his preferred dose was 40-50mg (or something like that, I may be remembering wrong except I know that 70mg was enjoyable but very intense for him).

yes but lest somebody think that these levels are safe for THEM let's point out that these folks most likely have naturally high tolerances to the chemicals (or acquired tolerances).


Start low - this chemical can **kill you**.

I should be purchasing a gram of this material soon, as I've been very interested in it for a long time. I am thinking for a first dose of 12-13mg rectally, bearing in mind the dose range of this chemical for different people. What does everyone else think of this? I've done 2C-E & 2C-T-2 at high doses before.

I think I'd be extra careful with redosing and taking higher doses of drugs that may inhibit their own breakdown when you exceed a certain dose.


Some of these 2c-t-* drugs have MAOI properties above a certain dose.


While the data is useful, you don't really want to help refine the LD50 info for the substance, you know?

give him a mg or so of xanax or any benzo if you have it laying around.

I would but he lives to far away from me otherwise I would've given him an antipsychotic. He also took some benadryl if that matters anything. I told him to puke and if he couldn't to go to the hospital to get his stomach pumped. I just hope he'll be ok.

It was brought to my attention recently that the paper everyone cites as proof of 2C-T-7's MAOI properties is actually only in reference to ALEPH compounds.


Is there any proof 2C-T-7 is an MAOI or is it purely speculation?

I don't think the deaths in themselves were evidence towards any MAO inhibition no. At least not to my knowledge.

Forgive my ignorance but why would MAO-I matter when the route of admin is insufflations? Or are 2c-t-x supposedly subject to MAO-B?

There are MAO's everywhere in your body.  In your brain, gut, liver, etc.  MAO-B is also in your blood platelets.  When you insufflate something, it'll bypass the gut, but it will still go through the blood, brain, and your liver.


Oh yeah, anyone know whether the 2c-t-x/ALEPH series inhibits MAO-A or B (or both?), if it is indeed an MAOI?

I've decided to shamelessly bump this thread, in hopes of generating more discussion, since I've finally decided to sample this chemical on the upcoming weekend.  After testing the product at >5mg, I'll probably end up starting with 25mg (orally)

I can't get over this "yucky" feeling I get with all the 2c-t-x's. They all have it, and it keeps me from enjoying them. Also, I tend to get an uncomfortable body load from 2c-t-7 that includes extreme naseau, strange muscles pains/discomfort and over stimulation. It really distracts from the experience, but the visuals are simply stunning!


How common is this? I've noticed most people experience these side effects to some degree, but for me they are usually unbearable.

I tried 10mg (test dose) for the first time last night and found the body load very similar to 2ct2.  The thing is, the body load for me is intense euphoria and rushes, REALLY nice, in fact none of the other 2cx family have that same almost mdma type rush.

  I didnt get much visuals on that dose, but the headspace and thought processes were great.


2ct2 and 2ct7 were both very similar at 10mg, but im sure they will be quite different on higher doses.


Lovely stuff!

I have foolishly sampled 2C-T-7 once with a massive dose (100-150mg at least) i just eyeballed!  I never took everything i had but lets just say i was suicidal but not suicidal to take it all so deep down i knew what i was doing! It was a stupid thing to do but on the other hand it was the best decision i EVER MADE!  I can hande high doses so im not to say how safe it is but my housemate called an ambulance on my behalf just to be careful.  I will never attempt this again but no there was no cause for alarm in any way (i was monitored) .  The experience was my first +++++.  The intensity could not be any higher.  In the few hours while i was +++++ and due to being in a hospital im sure intensified the experience greatly and SCARILY but on the other hand that is what made it what it was.  In that time i went through a life time.  


Fortunately i was seen by an experienced doctor in the righr fields who knew exactly what i'd took, he noted it down to an LSD overdose!  They monitored me for 4-6 hrs before calling me a taxi (not that was a mission!)  There were no side-effects, body load or anything in the slightest.  Not even a hangover, just PURE happiness!!!!  


The experience itself changed my life forever, ego death as we call it?  To be honest i thought i had died.  Time had seized to be in one millisecond i knew EVERYTHING and thought a million billion thoughts.  Connascence?  We are all all one!  I do remember for the most part a lot of the realisations i came too scared the shit out of me while on the other hand i do not want to or can remember on the other hand those realisation are so intense it is far beyond beauty or what words could describe.  I could go into more detail but i felt it best to have a safe high dose exp noted.  It was FAR..........................far beyond words!  For anyone curious i have experience with a wide range of phens and trypts


As for the 2ct-7 overdoses i believe these chemicals work on everyones personal body chemisty in their own way.  What would be safe for one could kill another.  I know myself... BE SAFE!


**I'm posting this msg on this account for the reason what i did was FOOLISH but is worth being noted.  This happened 2 months ago.  Apologies for rushing the post so much!**

hey be careful i did 15mg orally and had absolutely nothing. Then I did 15mg rectally and got my lid freakin blown off...very very intense trip. I might suggest you nose that rectal dose down to around 14-15mg, any higher than that for me and I would have been getting very much more delerious (not in a good way).

Ok, makes sense. I suppose the increased risk of OD/death from 2C-T-7 insufflated is down to the drug not being exposed to all the extra MAO in the digestive system then?

I think the CYP2D6 enzyme is important in 2C-T-7 metabolism as well, and exposure to that enzyme would probably also be lessened through bypassing the gut. Also, due to the quicker absorption of the drug into the blood via insufflation the peak plasma levels of 2C-T-7 could end up many times higher than they ever would with even a significantly higher oral dose.

I don't know man i've honestly tripped almost every day this week and I feel fine if not but a little over-emotional about things.


Generally though I like to space out my trips 3-5 weeks apart...any closer and I don't get as much out of it as I would otherwise (I still haven't integrated the last one).

Can anyone compare/contrast 2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7 for me?  I've tried 2C-T-2 a couple times and found it alright, though not incredibly interesting.  The descriptions of both seem almost identicle except for length of experience, but it seems many people find 2C-T-7 to be incredible and don't feel the same way about 2C-T-2.


For instance I saw morninggloryseed say that 2C-T-2 felt like poison and 2C-T-7 is his favorite.  What's the differences between them?  Same thing in the surveys posted by Illumnati Boy.  2C-T-2 was ranked much lower in "worthwhileness", and 2C-T-7 much higher.  Yet the effects profiles were similar.


I've been through all the big and dandy's, erowid, etc.  Still can't quite figure it out.  Thanks guys!

I ended up dosing 15mg for some reason.  I seem to have a high tolerance for phens, probably because I am a fatass.  Anyway, didn't feel a thing.  I will try 25mg next weekend.

I found little difference between 2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7, except for the visuals. 2C-T-7 had the most intense OEVs of any psychedelic I've ever tried, at any dose.

I find T-2 and T-7 to share a few minor similarities but mostly they are entirely different drugs for me... T-2 is much more introspective and intellectual for me whereas T-7 is more physical (not a negative thing though, just different).


Tomorrow I'll try to remember to add to this after I've slept.

FWIW, I found 2C-T-7 to be one of the most visual psychedelics I have tried, though one dose doesn't let me say much. Visual in more of a misinterpretation way though I feel...

Thanks for the replies guys!  What exactly do you mean by more physical Xorkoth?  I'm also interested in what a "misinterpretation way" means swilow?  Like when you see a rock and think it's a person?

Yeah, but of a more "cosmic" nature. Perhaps mistaking water running, briefly, for flowing pure silver energy....whether they are actually misinterpretations or a glimpse of the Truth who knows? Its certainly beautiful....but can lose its granduer when you realise that your in ecstasy in front of a tap. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) I actually find most of my OEV's tend to be mis-interpretation of objects, or extreme blending and flanging of objects, and then the brain attempting to find something in this mess...Though I cannot be sure why faces are so damn common. I understand the human mind is "programmed" to detect the human face, but why see it constantly in trails in the air, on trees, in the sky, in the walls.....? Hmm

2C-T-7 always gave me a combination of all of the classic visual distortions at once, and they were always intensified to a hilarious degree.


Swirling, rotating, fractal rainbows cover every surface. Everything shines, sparkles, and is covered with glitter. There's glitter floating through the air. Laser beams shoot out of lights and windows and mirrors and water. Anything that moves leaves composite images (trails) behind that take up to 30 seconds to fade away.


I sat on a sidewalk once and could watch the cars coming down a perpendicular street, from one end of my field of vision until they drove past the other end of my field of vision... and the cars would leave behind a dancing metallic rainbow colored stream of after-images of the car's tail end, so that it forms one 300ft long rainbow dragon... and as the car's front gets closer I realize it's an anthropomorphic face, and the grill gives me a huge Cheshire Cat smile and one of the headlights winks! And then as it speeds past me, its hundreds of feet long rainbow dragon trail slowly follows behind it, spitting pixie dust all over the road instead of exhaust.


2C-T-2 has visuals much more like 2C-B, 2C-C, etc.

I tried 25mgs yesterday with minimal effects.


I did however feel some uncomfortable bodily effects.  My body felt cold and almost numb with my head feeling flushed and hot.  Anyone experience this?  It wasn't very pleasant.

Tried 30mg with minimal effects as well.  No body load, though.  It actually felt *really* good sometimes (like peeing and just in overall waves), but I wasn't tripping really.  Maybe the body load from 25m was because I snorted a little.  


I did 35 with a little more luck.  A little nausea but nothing too bad (ginger gum is the best when it comes to nausea, I find).  I really liked this compound.  I only don't like that it takes so much to get me going.  


What is the ratio for putting it up the pooper vs oral?

Glad i found this thread. what is it with this chemical? its too damn variable. 13mg did nothing and then 23mg did nothing except maybe a lil naseau. 30mg will be next. although thats the highest shulgin has in his book so that makes me a lil nervous. why doesnt he mention anything about it being this variable in people? maybe he does i havent read the whole book. i may have to look in to this plugging technique but that cant feel good at all, right? 15mg 2c-t-2 blew my mind with good visuals and sound hallucinations like tones higher or lower than what was suppose to be and popping and also this sizzling sound in my head that was kind of scary like my brain was started to sizzle but then when i stopped focusing on it, it went away. kind of reminded me of DMT for some reason. anyone familiar with that sizzling? only done 2c-t-2 once though. the body load was too much. my muscles and joints felt like they were put together with nuts and bolts as if i was in knights armor or something. anyways, just kind of pissed 1 gram of 2c-t-7 is yet to be of any use to me.  any recommendations as to get this damn compound to work? take it up higher i guess?

I need high dosages of 2C-T-7 (35mg at least for a +3, used to push it to 40-50mg), where as I don't tend to need much of most other brother psychedelics (16mg of 2C-I was always fine, 30mg of 2C-C had me, and 40mg of 2C-D was sufficient).


That's just the way this one it.


As others have mentioned, it is a true gem.  At least for me, its my favorite of favorites (I wonder how many times I've said that at BL).

Hey.


A mate and I are planning on trying some 2C-T-7 next week. The setting will be outdoors in a really nice place (Hopefully the weather will be good!). It's sort of like a bay in a huge park, but most likely there will be no one around. 


Anyway we have 25mg caps and plan on just eating these and seeing how we go. We don't have HEAPS of psychadelic experience, I've tried 2cb the once and he has tried LSD (Might have been DOx though) once. Lots of experience with MDMA/marijauna/ket few other things though.


Will 25mg be alright? It seems like the doses vary drastically. Some people trip out on 15mg and some need 30-35 mg. Seems to make the experience a bit random and I dunno what to really expect. Not really keen on trying a lower dose because of the limited amount of product we have!


Won't be combining it with anyone except maybe a little toke during the trip. 


Anyone else had any experiences with this chemical lately?

Hmm, tough question... I suspect 25mg orally will be alright.  There's a possibility it will be stronger than you anticipated, but also a possibility it will not.  Going by averages I would say 25mg would be a good place.  Ideally I'd say you should start with 15mg and work up but if you only have 2 25mg caps then obviously that's not possible.


The good news is that 2C-T-7 seems to be pretty forgiving, in that the come-up in slow and gentle and it takes hours to reach the peak.  This makes for a smoother transition into the state and it makes it less likely that you'll feel significant anxiety.  The state that T-7 produces feels good physically (aside from some possible nausea early on) and it can be pretty euphoric mentally, so you're most likely in for a great time. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

25MG's was quite intense for me. It come on really slowly and nicely, but when it fully hit the visuals were intense. Colours merging/ things shaking and strange patterns. Throughout the whole trip there were these strange messages written within the drive way (full of rocks) and grassy/dirty areas. It looked as people had traced out letters and words with a stick as messages or notes that I couldn't decipher. Some seemd to have shapes like lovehearts ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) in them occasionaly. It was strange, subtle, but really cool. 


Bodyload was annoying right at the end though, but overall pretty good. 


May write up a trip report.

2C-T-7 is an absolutely ridiculous material.  At 12mg I found the pain 2x worse than 2C-E in duration and severity, but without any extra benefit.  Increasing the dose 5mg however gave me the most intense trip of my life, bar none.  I am unsure if I will ever go back to this chemical but it certainly rocked my world.   Complete insanity.

i loved it when i took 40mg oral though it scared me at times, much stronger than 2C-B, 2C-I, 2C-T-21, 2C-I, yet to try 2C-E, 2C-D, 2C-T-2 which i really would love too

Trying to be economical by using less material to go just as far.


No, I don't plan on that ROA again.


I have always had trouble with dosing phenethylamines orally.  45mg 2C-B & 20mg 2C-E both had very minute effects whilst insufflating 25mg and 10mg respectively had me going quite nicely.

How can you compare 2C-I to 2c-t-7 What are the differences? I found 2C-I to be quite visual but nothing like LSD and nowhere near as deep. Does 2C-T-7 have any depth to it and would the visuals be better?

you should definitely feel effects from that, rectal hits really quickly, don't be surprised if you feel effects within 5 mins of squirting that stuff up your bunghole.

Just keep in mind that at an active dose, it gives a plasma concentration that produces a significant degree of MAO inhibition, so certain drugs are best avoided in combination with 2C-T-7 (MDMA instantly springs to mind)

I'll be giving 2C-T-7 a trial tomorrow morning, along with 2 of my roommates, one of them being my boyfriend (Chemical Wizard). We're thinking that we'll try this one at 15mg orally. I've read a lot about this chemical, and I'm pretty excited to see what happens when I put it in my brain! I'll eat lightly tonight, and probably just drink some tea or juice in the morning. I'll report the results back here....we'll see what unfolds.....

Is the nausea decreased by rectal administration with 2C-T-7? I read Xorkoth's 41 mg dose report on erowid, and was wondering if there is something I could take to decrease the nausea. I get pretty severe nausea with 2C-E at >25mg. 


What is the dose range for 2C-T-7 rectally?

Well, here's my brief experience with t7 and nausea.


oral 14mg: nothing much, a little rumbling in stomach around 30-45 mins and some strange conceptual spaces explored around 2 hours, then pretty much nothing other than an elevated mood during the afternoon hike.


rectal 14mg: HOLY SHIT! Hit me in 5 minutes after squirting up my butt. Almost instantly peaking (peak probably started around 15-20 minutes). Very fast. Too fast. Thought I had overdosed. Diarreah. Nausea. Throwing up in the bushes so hard I felt like it bruised my anal muscles (from wretching). About 1 hour in all nausea went away as I smoked some cannabis and laid down on the couch. Beautiful space here, floating in a cloud of 3-d visuals. Smoking DMT during this peak caused the 3-dimensional visuals to crystalize more clearly into jewels the I could manipulate with my mind. Very malleable trip. Continued smoking small tokes of DMT the whole way through (about 4 hours of tripping). Came down and went to sleep around T+6-7 hours. Quality sleep.


Next time I try it I am going with 8mg IM with a possible 2-4mg booster shot.

Well I tried 2C-T-7 today....15 mgs orally, decided against rectal for the first go.  It was everything i hoped it would be....super warm, good insight and psychedelic thinking.  Went for a walk and it was nice.  Very clear headed.  Bit of stomach craziness during the come up phase, but it was transient.  Soon it was replaced with full on body buzz that was realllly pleasurable...tingly groin feeling........mmmmmm, how i love the tingly groin feeling.  It still hasn't fully worn on as of right now.  Next time i'm going to go for 25 mgs orally.  Super good material.

^^haha!


yes, we tried 15mg of 2C-T-7 yesterday morning. the come-up was slow, and a little rough on the stomach, but we found that easily cured with a little vitamin M(arijuana). 


very friendly, warm and humanizing. getting in to intense psychedelic conversation was very easy. it was clear headed, but i could see things getting crazy at higher doses. i look forward to future experiments with this one...

Id say so, smoking is usually the most harmful route. IV'ing is even safer depending on substance(maybe not for RC's) and how responsible the user is.

Anyone else feel like their arms are being stretched out from this compound?  My arms and my neck in particular.  Not that pleasant, but not unbearable by any means.  


All in all, wonderful compound.  I've had some very clear headed trips and soem very intense trips on this substance.  Also a couple very frightening ones..


For the record. ..  


25mg I feel nothing.  I hover around 35 mg now, and it's quite intense.  30mg I barely feel anything.  Weird how this works...  I can't find a middle ground.

This would be an interesting experiment -- it's very possible.  I would try that with this and 2c-t-2.  Since DMT is traditionally used with an MAOI, it's probably on the safer side.

Is the length of an ayahuasca experience determined by the MAO inhibition? If this enzyme is held at bay for such a length like that of 2C-T-2/7 would cause, could any adverse effects arise from extended exposure to DMT? Being on DMT and 2C-T-7 for upwards of 8 hours would be otherworldly.

Wait. I thought this has already been answered here... in this very thread, possibly even.


I thought it was determined 2c-t-7 does not provide enough mao inhibition at normal dosages to be able to activate oral DMT. It would require more 2ct7 than anyone would ever want to take. Perhaps I'm thinking of something else...

Fair enough. But if it has MAO inhibition properties, will it potentiate smoked DMT? Or is it the same story? I find that hard to believe when combing MDMA with T-7 is considered to be so dangerous.

I wasn't saying one way or another whether it works or not, I just faintly remember reading some speculation that it wouldn't. It's definitely worth some experimentation though! I'd give it a go myself, but I don't have any dmt at the moment.

Smoked DMT gets in your blood stream so quickly that whatever MAOI properties 2C-T-7 has aren't likely to make a noticeable difference in intensity. 2C-T-7's psychedelic properties will make a difference in intensity and quality, no doubt, and the smoked DMT may last slightly longer if MAO is busy with 2C-T-7, though.

Has anyone tried taking 2C-T-7 at the very end of MDMA, like the 5 hour point or so? It'd be nice if I could get the MDMA to lead into a 2C-T-7 trip, but it does take quite a while to come up fully, too. Any thoughts?

No, I meant taking the 2C-T-7 after the MDMA was worn off, not mixing them. I'm pretty sure I read in PIHKAL that there were several psychotherapy sessions in which they tried 2C-T-7, 2C-T-2, 2C-B, and I'm not sure what else at the end of an MDMA session as a way to help them integrate it. I'm not necessarily looking for that, but I do think MDMA could be a nice sort of lead in to a 2C-T-7 experience (it's an idea for a rave I'll be attending). I know it's an MAOI, but wouldn't it be fine after the MDMA's worn off? I guess MDMA does have a fairly long half-life too, though (6-10 hours according to Wikipedia) so that might be an issue.

Tried snorting 2ct7 for the first time the other week.

Wow, was I not ready for the pain, had around 10mg.


Also tried 30-35mg oral, and all I can say is wow.

Amazing. Just amazing.

Trying to say anything else to sum it up would just ruin it.

Snorted or IV.


Vaporizing it makes my lungs feel like I shoved a plastic bag in them and inflated it, even after smoking just a few milligrams.


I tried it once orally at a really high dose and felt nothing.


I would consider plugging it whenever I get around to doing it again.

I have.  It was rather wonderfully nice, but very, very intense.  I did it twice...with 30mg (way off the chart intense) and 10mg (just the right dosage.)  I felt no side effects or any sense of danger.


And yes, it takes 3hr for T7 to peak but the effects begin within 45min.

Good to know, thanks. I'm still not sure if I'm going to go through with this but if I do I'll definitely try 10 mg.

I found 25mg's intense but not quite enough. Orally that is. 30-35, was just perfect. Heaps of visuals and incredibly amazing. I feel that 10mg would be a waste. Although I'd still have it.


Had E after 2ct7 had worn off, with half a trip, that was quite intense and yet amazingly beautiful. Everything was so bright and pretty and I felt so loved up and happy to be strolling home at 6 in the morning.

dkennedy - it's against Bluelight guidelines to ask about how to synthesize or source drugs.  If you want to know about DMT and 2C-T-7, check [Erowid](http://www.erowid.org) first - it's where you find out about most any drug.  Then after that, read through from the beginning of this thread to learn more about 2C-T-7.  And for DMT, check the [Big and Dandy DMT thread](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=409844) (and the previous archived versions from older posts, [here](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=371884)).


In general, when you want to ask about or read about a substance here in PD, use the [Best of PD page](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?s=&threadid=141741) and follow the links.  And put your postys in the appropriate thread.


To learn about how to synthesize drugs, read [PIHKAL](http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal.shtml) and [TIHKAL](http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal.shtml) (2C-T-7 is in PIHKAL), by Dr. Shulgin.  I think you'll see that to do it you'll need to be a very accomplished chemist with a fully stocked lab.


Also, you can't possibly expect us to reply to your questions within a couple of minutes.  Have some patience.  And in general, Bluelight isn't here to make your every request for information effortless to obtain.  It's here to intelligently discuss drugs and make it as easy as possible to other people to later come and find information on their own.  Plus, if we just tell you everythying you want, you won't have done any of the research yourself, and in order to safely and responsibly use these chemicals it requires a person to take a little initiative and do the research.  The information is there, so start searching. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yes, it's a relatively weak MAOI but still is one. I don't think it'd be strong enough to make DMT orally active but it's dangerous to combine with stimulants, except for caffeine, of course. It might make you dissociate and/or have psychosis, or it might do nothing at all, but there's a really high risk of something going wrong and I would never risk it.

how long do t7's effects seem to last for you guys?  I've sampled it a few times at varying amounts from 20 mgs up to 35 mgs, but it only lasts about 7 hrs total.  I'll dose, then maybe an hour in begin to feel the effects, at about two hours in I hit my plateau, and around the 7 hour mark I'm basically fully down.  How does this compare to your experiences?  All the literature I've read say to expect a trip that lasts up to 12-14 hrs.  


I got this chemical from a pretty trusted source so I'd be surprised if what i was taking wasn't 2ct7.

Are you taking it orally or by another method?  When I take it orally it takes about 3 hours to come up, and an hour to even feel much of anything.  If I take it rectally or nasally it follows approximately the timeline you've suggested.

The dosages I list are for 2C-T-7 taken *after* MDMA or MDA.  On its own, 10mg is a +1 at best.

Thats good. I think thats where im goin have to go, around 30-35mg. 13mg and 23mg orally did nothing to me but 10mg seperated into 8 little piles snorted over the course of about 45 minutes was certianly active. Didnt do the whole 10mg though cause the burn was not pleasant at all. Just had to see if it was bunk or not and now i know my batch is good. Why does it seem almost everyone has to go higher with the oral doses then what shulgin said?  

17mg 2c-t-2 3 days ago gave a very beautiful, visual experience. lots of swirling,shifting, fractals and the newscaster on the tv in the other room started to sound chaotic and all out of order around the 3-4 hr point while i was peaking. Very psychedelic and amazing. Never done LSD or mushrooms but DMT i do all the time and when the newscaster was starting to not make sense it reminded me of DMT for some reason. Seems like the more i do psychs the better it gets. 2c-t-7 is suppose to be better then 2c-t-2? I cant wait

xorkoth - I'm taking it orally.  The largest dose I've taken was 33 mg.  Granted, I think I had a moderately full stomach at the time of ingestion, but that shouldn't lower the duration of the experience THAT much...would it?

If anything it would lengthen the duration, since it will take longer to absorb.  Really, taking any drug orally with much food in there isn't a great idea.  I find it will usually never be as strong as it should and it'll take a long time to take effect.

Ahh yes.  Well I guess that makes sense.  


However, my original question still remains.  What duration do you guys normally experience with a 25-35 mg dose?

Hmm, i never considered it before and think its probably not much of a risk, but is melatonin safe to combine with psychedelics?  It is metabolized into 5-meo Tryptamine correct?

Yes, it's safe.  Some say it helps to make trips stronger if you take melatonin the day before or several days before a trip.  I have no idea whether that's true or not, but I do know that it's perfectly safe to combine them.

Have got some more 2CT7. First dose = 25mg, Second 25mg, third 5-15mg(snorted), 4th 30-40mg.


Last two are certain due to eye balling doses (Yeah, yeah I know.)


The first few times I did not get many visuals although it was a very pleasant experience.

The third was very intense however made me quite sick and hurt so much, as well as my eye being so swollen I couldn't see out of it. I think I pretty much passed out during the trip.


The last time was the best. Floored me completely, got lots of OEVs and CEVs visuals however I don't really remember it much. Does any one else get this floored on T7?


I am not very heavy however I think I may have fairly large tolerance naturally to T7 due to the first few times. First time was with a mate, second time was in a social setting, freaked out a bit when i started getting sick and went home, then thought wtf am I doing at 11pm on a sat night and went back out and was fine.


The other times were at home with friends. The 30-40mg dose being the most relaxed and beautiful I have ever felt.


I am getting 25mg capsules, and do not have very accurate scales, will 50mg be too much?

Also, if I split a capsule and filled half with water, do you think the dose would be alright for plugging?

I got very trivial effects from 30mg, while got completely floored on 44mg. This one has an extremely steep dose-response curve indeed - I would say it's almost as steep as for 2C-E. Since you eyeballed your dose, the real amount you got might have just as easily been 50mg as it might have been 30mg, so no wonder you were floored.


2C-T-7 is an absolutely lovely substance - can't wait to venture into it again ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

What would be the effects of taking ~20mg of 2c-t-7 orally two days after taking LSD (or possibly candyflipping) be?


It should be safe to assume there won't be any MDMA + 2c-t-7 complications right?


Also, would the LSD dose diminish the effects of the 2c-t-7?

Welcome to PD and BL!


Firt of all, there is no way any of us can tell you what effects you would be getting. There are just too many variables. If you have taken 2C-T-7 before and know how 20mg affects you, you can expect somewhat diminished returns due to cross-tolerance from taking LSD 2 days before. You should wait at least 4 days (at least a week is recommended) if you want to avoid tolerance altogether.


MDMA will be gone from your system by that time, so no complications to worry about there.


If it's your first time taking 2C-T-7, well, you should try to read up on it as much as you can before you indulge. It is a very delicate material that should be treated with utmost respect. It has caused fatal overdoses a few times due to reckless use, and it has a very steep dose-response curve. Also, people seem to have very varying natural tolerance towards this substance. Some people might be overwhelmed by 20mg while some people need more than 50mg to get satisfying results. So, if you're new to 2C-T-7, definitely start low (20mg 2 days after taking LSD seems like a good starting point) and move up slowly (no more than 5mg at the time, at least a week between trials).


Please be careful, and enjoy this wonderful chemical ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Thanks a lot for the informative reply. 


I've read a fair bit about 2c-t-7, this will in fact be my first time taking it. In fact, I'm planning on doing it at a Phish show! (Phish by the way are known to have lots of colorful lights.) Do you guys think this will be too much stimulation for a 20-25mg 2c-t-7 trip? Is 2c-t-7 a bad idea for Phish or a festival in general? It seems like a cool combo to me. I'm all ears, and welcome anyones opinion.

^ Yes, but he was talking about maybe candiflipping 2 days before taking 2C-T-7. No need to worry about any dangerous interactions in that case IMO.


@barnacles: I don't think it's a bad idea, you will probably enjoy it a lot.


@Felix: I find 2C-T-7 even more nauseating when coming up than 2C-E. But the trip is every bit worth some puking IMO ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Then again, I have only taken it twice, once at 30mg and the other time at 44mg. The first time I didn't notice any significant body load at all (perhaps a small amount of nausea when coming up), but the second time I had intense nausea and spent maybe 30 minutes before the peak vomiting. But it was a very high dose, and I was having the most intense visuals of my life, so that probably contributed a lot to the nauseating come-up.

So plugging is about the same dose-wise as intranasal? (~3x more potent than oral ?)


I ask because I plugged 11mg, and so therefore, a 33mg oral dose would be about the same?

Plugging is somewhere between 1x and 3x as potent as oral. I've never tried 2C-T-7 orally, and never successfully plugged it (I underdosed both times I tried), so I have nothing more to offer than "Don't plug more than you'd snort."

i have tried 2C-T-7 nasally and orally, and i would never snort that substance again, i snorted less than 10mg and i passed out mate said i was shaking and basically throwing myself about till he stopped me. 


definately never snort that chem again, it was a while back and i should have known better ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) i feel qquite ashamed i snorted it after the deaths from it

I don't find 2C-T-7 to be painful when snorted; it just has a hellish bodyload/come-up marked by anxiety, irritability, nausea, and general discomfort.  As a boost to a plugged/oral/smoked dose though, it is much easier to deal with, especially if one snorts like 1-3mg bumps every few minutes.

Possibly stupid question: I was wondering what the appeal is behind 2C-t-7 compared to other 2C's? i.e., why would you choose this instead of something like 2C-E (other than availability).


From what I've read, it seems like 2c-t-7 has much more unpleasant physical side-effects, and is more toxic/dangerous than the other 2Cs. Is there an innate quality that 2c-t-7 has that makes up for these downsides?

2C-T-7 is much better than 2C-E in every way. There's no sign that 2C-T-7 is 'toxic', just dangerous.


2C-E has a worse body load, whereas 2C-T-7 has a body high comparable to MDMA or DOC. 2C-T-7 has some of the most intense visuals of any psychedelic.

Hmm, other people I've talked to have said that 2C-E is much easier on the body than T-7. I guess 2Cs affect everybody differently. 


In any case, I'll be able to directly compare them in a couple weeks, so I look forward to that.

Wow yeah, I get really no unpleasant feelings from 2c-e while when I tried 2ct-7 for my first time it felt like my body was trying to jump out of it's skin, I was tense and anxious. None of that happens for me when I take 2c-e, I just feel really light and great, visuals aren't as strong. But I think it's better all around, because for me there are really no negative effects from 2c-e.

my girlfriend tho was puking for 4 hours non-stop

i dont know how to explain what was going on with her.. she was puking every 5 minutes.. anyone experience this? any comments or thoughts on why she could have reacted that way? she does have a very sensitive stomach but i cant imagine why she could not help her self from puking every 5 minutes.. she could not stop it either no matter what we did..


also, can i dose again tomorrow and still feel the same effects?

the effects of 2C-T-7 seems to be particularly variables from one people to another. A couple of friends took 14mg each (of HOT-7 that seem to be 2C-T-7 actually), the male get almost no effects while the girl spend several hours in hell...

Wow, my experiences with T-7 have been pretty variable, tried 2, 15, 25-30 and also 20 mg with an added 15 mg 2C-B... but nothing as horrible as a vomiting streak or hell.

Granted it's not a light one I can definitely live with the side-effects. Best 2C ever.


The doses are estimations from recollection, I really should have written these values down dammit.

I liked to vaporize 5-15mg at a time. I don't like the way it makes my lungs feel afterwards though so I don't do it anymore.

sorry its hard to explain what she was feeling. at a point she also puked out white foam.. theres a report on erowid with that but it does not give much info..


this report actually has kind of the closest experience of what happened to her:

I know 2C-E and 2C-T-7 have not much in common but...what would be a 2C-T-7 dosage rivaling with a 16mg 2C-E dose (in term of intensity / visual activity) ?


If I recall correctly I've tried ~20mg of HOT-7 (supposedly 2C-T-7) and I didn't notice a lot of visual activity, but it was pleasant/good mood/fun/warm nonetheless.

Alright! I finally can sample this substance, so excited!


I wish I could share the fun with people like I did with 2C-E, but I don't feel comfortable giving it to anyone I don't know VERY well.

From my experience, around 25-30mg. But as usual with psychedelics, YMMV.

does insufflating 1-3mgs at a time still burn bad or is it tolerable? 

thinking of insufflating 1-3mg doses to reach up to 5-7mg? what would be a good insufflated dose?

The duration is probably 3-6 hours vaporized, and there is tolerance. If you rip a 5mg hit, it'll take 10mg to get to the same place again in 6 hours. I do not recommend vaporizing - I always had great experiences, but even a 10mg dose would leave my lungs feeling like they had a plastic bag jammed in them and inflated, or like I just had too much air pressure in my lungs, for the rest of the day, even after the trip wore off. It was a very minor sensation, but I've never had any kind of lung uncomfortableness from smoking any other substance, plant, phenethylamine, amphetamine, or whatever except for 2C-T-7.

Wow, this is the imfamous compound that precipitated or accelerated the Web Tryp busts.  Seems it's still available.


When people croaked on this stuff what did they die of.  Too much CNS sitimulation, convulsions?  Dumb ass parapalegic, what did he expect.  No scale, no sail!  (spelling intentional)


On the other hand, I'm really reluctant to try something the has a relatively narrow band in the dose response curve when there are other more less risky compounds out there that can probably get you close to the head space.


I can see from the threads on mephedrone and the like compounds that these may become the next compound of interest to LE.

It was never really determined what the exact cause for those two T7 fatalities was. Autopsy revealed pulmonary edema in the first case, I'm not sure how 2C-T-7 could have caused this but I remember reading some speculation on it. The other death was when it was combined with MDMA. Dosages were also insanely high for both cases, and the substance was insufflated. There have been no additional cases since then I believe, and there have been reports of it being used in very high doses orally without complications, so who knows what to make of it all.


Anyway, I don't know of any substances that can get you close to the headspace of T7 (other than perhaps 2C-T-2, but that one could easily have similar safety profile, plus it's more toxic feeling physically than T7), it is truly a wonderful substance. I'm hoping to sample this one again soon enough.

So in, obviously your opinion, it's special enough to take considering its "reputation".  It does look like if used responsibly there should be no problems.


From the reports it seems to be particularly visual  which I find most enjoyable.  So far I just havn't been able to get to the same place on 2ce as what I remembered acid to be.  Although is was great, there's too much unuseable energy or I can not sychronize with the energy.


Maybe I might take a second look.  Any experience with the 2?  Comparable?


Thanks, Bro

You mean with 2C-E? Well, I wouldn't say they are too similar. 2C-E is more cold and analytical and ego-dissolving, while 2C-T-7 is rather warm and emotional. They don't have much in common at all other than the generic 2C/PEA feel. IMO, 2C-E is more comparable to LSD while 2C-T-7 is comparable to mescaline (at least going by the descriptions - I haven't tried mescaline myself).

Oh, sorry. No, unfortunately I have no experience with T2. From what I understand, it can be more serious mentally than T7, but also with more physical side effects. Frankly, I don't think I'll ever have the desire to try it unless T7 becomes unavailable.


Yeah, no surprise there about the emergency scheduling by DEA that followed the death cases.

Yes 2C-T-7 is wonderful, so very rich - that is the best description I can give - it's like a feast for the senses, healing and warm for your emotional being and while it's not blatantly fun and toy-like as some other lighter 2C's are it's certainly enjoyable and beautiful.

I can get a bit queasy in the first half but it's more than worth it, that should also tell you something about how worthwhile it is.

Never felt threatening to me but I only take it orally and built up/titrated the dose very very carefully in the beginning. It's benign that way but give it a bunch of tries since the results can vary more than with other 2C's !!!

I feel that if you take this unpredictability into account plus the fact that there is not a huge margin of error it explains many if not all reports. People overshoot the mark so easily or just go about snorting the stuff even though there so many adverse reactions... It's like: no wonder it get such a bad rap!


Just, be careful for gods sake. Who cares that other 2C's are less difficult to keep within bounds, or are more forgiving when taken nasally or in heavy combination? 2C-T's are different anyway!

I should be acquiring some T7 shortly, my questions are;


-What is the bio-availability sublingually? I'm not after an exact figure, just curious as I'd rather not insuffulate (due to the deaths occuring when railing) however I would think that the bio-availability would be similar to insuffulating (due to both areas being high vascular).


-If the availability isn't the same, what dosage would one suggest if I were to use the sublingually route? (if it is the same, I would use erowid as a dosage guide)


The capsules I'm getting are 27.5mg and, seen as it's an RC and I haven't used it before. I was thinking about opening it up and titrating my dose so I see how I go before consuming such large amount.

Erm, I really, really would not try to administer T-7 or any other phen sublingually.  The bitterness I think would be almost nauseating in and of itself, and 2C-T-7 is already rough on the tummy.  If you're really determined to reduce come-up time/dose, rectal administration is the way to go with this one.  Same potency and timeline as intranasal sans the excruciating pain that ROA entails.

I couldn't find much on this combo but I was kinda high when I decided to do it and it was a last minute decision. 


2c-t-7 28mg and piracetam. 2400mg


also smoked jw-018 and haze mix for the sickness in the beginning, never threw up but only at a bagel earlier on in the day so i had nothing to throw up anyway.

tried to a couple times but i think it was reading so much about ppl puking that I think part of it was i was tripping.


so its was really cool. a lot of open eye visuals, kept thinking of 7 up so all my tracers were the 7up bottle color. music sounded great. lots of energy


while peaking there was lots of tracers, very vivid. at one point almost couldn't see things around the room there were so many. all the 7up color ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


comedown kinda sucked but i had some jams (opiates) later on so i felt great. 


but the next day, woow, really tired. ate more piracetam but didn't keep me awake. maybe next time i can take all of vitamins (5-htp, piracetam, multi v etc)

i was at a friends house far away or i would of. 


so yeah the two mix great would recommend it.

Does anybody else feel like its hard to keep your eyes open whist on a strong dose of T7...  kind of like how eyes feel on mdma?   Cuz I'm having a hard time trying to keep em open let alone just focus when they are open.

So, does anyone know the duration of 2C-T-7's MAOI activity?  Does it persist only for the duration of the drug's psychedelic effects, or is there residual inhibition even after the come-down?  I only ask because I've been planning a 2-day adventure and was hoping to take AMT, (an MAOI and monoamine releaser) the day after dropping T-7.  Any help is much appreciated.  Thanks guys. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

^I don't have a lot of experience with AMT, so I could be completely wrong, but it sounds like a very bad idea to me. Taking psychedelics two days in a row is a bad idea period. Chances are there will be some interaction. Probably nothing seriously dangerous, but who knows. You're experimenting with drug combos that have been used by only a handful of people. Be careful, and rethink this.

I had my first T7 experience last night, started at 10pm. Set/setting - at my home with my bf, didn't do anything the whole day (actually started a career on GuitarHero), pretty much in a relaxed mood.


+0:00hrs - my bf and I took a (27.5mg) cap each.


+2:00hrs - started getting a bit annoyed, feeling nothing and contemplating going to bed.


+3:30hrs - started to kick in! I was feeling like it was a mild dose of acid (basic wave visuals, bright lights, etc) but with a LOT of energy - I couldn't sit still, had to walk around and clean up the house. This "energy" though wasn't like a mid-peak on gear/pills, it was more of a sketchy feeling, like when you're coming down from MDMA.


+4:00hrs - intense visual - waves (however different to acid waves. Acid waves for me usually start from one side and go to the other, these kinds were more like random ocean waves), with random colours and patterns. I would be reading something on my laptop, look at the wall and would see (discernible) words.


+7:00 - this continued until about 5:00am when I started to feel myself "come down". Not really a come down (in a bad sense) just felt the effects of the drug wearing off.


+8:00 - went to bed and slept quite easily.


What I find strange however is that the effects on me were very similar to acid, however the effect on my bf was very different (he can't explained it apparently).

I didn't think the effects of T7 were (supposed to be) similar to LSD.


Whats also peculiar is the time it took to come up. Erowid says usually 60-90mins (obviously this would be average), this took *3.5hrs*.


Does anyone know how the body absorbs T7, and hence why it takes so long to take effect (read: the parakinetics of)? Through what mechanism(s)? (we took the caps orally)

I hope and guess that you ate since this morning but anyway MAOI-food interaction is about only some specific products that contain stuff the MAOI usually degrade (tyramine) like wine, cheese and other. I'd think that you'd take the same precautions observed for moclobemide.


I just found this : 


> Examples of foods and beverages which contain tyramine include: beer, ale, robust red wines, Chianti, vermouth, homemade breads, cheese, crackers (with cheese), sour cream, bananas, red plums, figs, raisins, avocados, fava beans, Italian broad beans, green bean pods, eggplant, pickled herring, liver dry sausages, canned meats, salami, yogurt, soup cubes, commercial gravies, chocolate, and soy sauce.

> Aged cheeses have the highest levels of tyramine. Some foods contain bacterial enzymes that convert tyrosine (an amino acid in foods) to tyramine.

After a few experiments with this substance I have to say that I don't think it's going to be one of my favorites. It's certainly a very interesting chemical: intense visuals, and some of the best body euphoria I've experienced from any drug. However, it feels very toxic to me in a way that I can't quite elucidate. It's like a warm, feverish sensation at the back of my head, like a warm brain freeze. The only other 2C that feels this toxic to me is perhaps 2C-I. 


I'm not writing this stuff off yet as I realize it's probably in my head, but still. When I'm on it I feel like I can understand how people can die from taking too much of this stuff. Of course, this is logic contrived while on 2C-T-7, so take with a grain of salt ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I have some T7 on the way right now, pretty excited!


I have a few friends that see psychedelics in the same light that I do, and would like to have a group trip with them. (2C-T-7 of course!)


I understand that t7 has a bit of a rough side, mostly stimulation and nausea I've heard. I want the group to experience the least negative side effects possible.


Stimulation - I hear it's that kinda useless, anxious "gotta do something" type stimulation. Would a beer or two help this? Or I'd appreciate suggestions for activities suited for this type of stimulation to keep us busy on the come up.


Nausea- I've heard of various remedies, empty stomach, cannabis, ginger, Tums. Is there a *near* fool proof method of getting rid of an icky stomach?


Thanks!

The only fool proof methods to avoid nausea on T7 are to take a low dose or to administer rectally. Otherwise you'll probably puke if you take it orally.


I don't find T7 to be stimulating. It's almost impossible to sleep on it, but it has more of a calmer demeanor like mescaline (though not nearly as gentle) unless you start getting maniacal thought loops which I have experienced with this compound. In any case it's much less stimulating than 2C-I and perhaps 2C-E but I'm not completely sure of the latter.

^ Ya man.  I took 38mg of T-7 and didn't yack.  IME plugging produces more nausea than oral dosing.  Not everyone's experience I know, but to some plugging is not all it's cracked up to be on here.

Please realize that everybody is not a clone of you and thus are liable to have different experiences with different drugs. Just because you usually don't puke after taking T7 doesn't mean a lot of people don't. I am not prone to nausea either, and have never puked from a 2C before. But that doesn't mean I go around foolishly assuming everyone is exactly like me.


The only crock is suggesting to take something like Pepcid AC to prevent T7 induced nausea. It's like offering someone a Band-Aid for a bullet wound. I mean, seriously? Pepcid AC is for heartburn dude. It reduces the acidity of your stomach. It's likely not going to prevent anybody from throwing up who would have thrown up anyway.

I would advise against taking this drug rectally.  Doing so requires one to be incredibly judicious and precise with one's dosing (T-7 seems as bioavailable rectally as it does nasally, and we've all read the stories of those unlucky few who died from putting this one up their honkers) and IME produces a short but incredibly violent come-up, which  inevitably culminates in projectile vomiting.

I think the best way to deal with nausea is don't.  If a drug has nausea and vomitting as one if it's effects, then it is part of the experience.  It may not be pleasant, but the psychedelic experience involves taking the good with the bad, and learning to accept whatever happens.  You just have to not resist.  I think you might actually be puking because you are trying to resist the puke.  I find i never get intense body loads on psychedelics, as long as I am in a totally allowing environment and I am letting my energy flow freely.  However, I have only done 2C-T-7 under 5 times, and the higest dose was about 30-35 mgs, i'm not exactly sure how much though.  Anyways, It has made me feel queasy, but I've never vomitted from 2C-T-7.

I think 2C-T-7 is a wonderful name for a drug.  Infact, I think Shulgin did an absolutely brilliant job of coming up with a...what's it called..taxonomic nomenclature this-or-that something or other.   But yeah, don't dis the 2C's, don't dis the 2C-T's, becuase if you are, you're basically dissing shulgin, and he's way cooler than you, and if you don't like it then don't do drugs, simple as that.

Doing so requires one to be incredibly judicious and precise with one's dosing (T-7 seems as bioavailable rectally as it does nasally, and we've all read the stories of those unlucky few who died from putting this one up their honkers) and IME produces a short but incredibly violent come-up, which  inevitably culminates in projectile vomiting.

Guys, take it easy. My statement was tongue-in-cheek. I understand that tone is often difficult to detect over the internet and that it wasn't really funny anyway, but frankly I'm surprised that people are actually getting offended over my statement. I thought PD was a little better natured than that.  


My educational background is in biochemistry. I completely understand why 2C-T-7 is named what it is. I also understand that pet names for drugs are not only stupid and unnecessary, but often dangerous as well. Again, my post was not serious. I was tripping on the stuff and in my intoxicated state of mind it struck me that 2C-T-7 is an especially ugly name, even compared to the other 2Cs. To me it sounds harsh and uninviting (which is probably a good thing anyway, but I digress). So I thought it would be fun to see what other PD regulars would come up with if they had to opportunity to rename 2C-T-7. I wasn't seriously suggesting that we should rename the compound (as if that would even be remotely possible anyway). I think that part at least should have been obvious.


**Shambles:** You are well respected in my eyes. I know that this is your forum, and it is completely your call how you moderate it. If you want to edit out the following and take it to PM, I'll respect that too. I'm just posting this in public to hopefully clear up any possible confusion.


In retrospect, my most recent reply to Chemical Wizard was probably a bit over the line. My response was a hurtful thing to say. I was just angry because of this:


> But yeah, don't dis the 2C's, don't dis the 2C-T's, becuase if you are, you're basically dissing shulgin, and he's way cooler than you, and if you don't like it then don't do drugs, simple as that.

At the time it seemed a rather obnoxious and presumptuous thing to say. It's a pet peeve of mine when people give their opinion as if it is fact and then follow it with "simple as that" (even though I am often guilty of this offense myself). Things in life are rarely "as simple as that" -- well, if you're a thoughtful person anyway. I mean, honestly, if I don't like the name of a particular compound then my only option is to abstain from drugs? If I don't like a particular compound [even though I do, and I don't believe I ever said otherwise] than that somehow means I'm "dissing" Shulgin? A very haughty remark. But alas, I'm probably overreacting in my sleep deprived state, so let's forget about it. So in conclusion, I agree that that my response to CW was unnecessary and basically an emotional personal attack.


I have a slight issue with deleting my posts that were in response to Dread. Even taking the ambiguity of online posting into account, I'm quite surprised that those posts could be interpreted as flaming. Nonetheless, they were also a bit off-topic and thus unnecessary, and if you really feel that they should be deleted then I completely understand. What I do have a bigger problem with is the fact that those posts were deleted while something like this:


> Your post is pure garbage and you are an ignorant and hypocritical fool. Pepcid AC works for ALL research chems, dumbass.
>

is allowed to remain.


Anyway, thanks if you actually read all of that and thanks for your consideration ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).

Alritght Trancendence, I apologize for making intense remarks.  I did have a bit of a snarky tone with that post, I will admit, but is 2C-T-7 really that bad of a name ?


I like to think of PiHKAL and TiHKAL as spell books, and Shulgin as Merlin.  All the chemical names are like spell names, all the recipes for making these drugs are like esoteric instructons that only "specially trained" chemists/magicians understand.  The chemical names and abbreviates names of these drugs are actually magical.  Most of the common population doesn't know what 2C-T-7 means, and I think that is pretty cool.


The Shulgin/Merlin comparison is from Breaking open the Head.  That is a sweet book, I recommend it if you have not read it.  Now lets be nice.  Sorry for all that everyone.

The emboldened part was the main reason for deletion and the only reason the "dumbass" comment escaped the snipping scissors was because that poster had been memberated into submission already. I quite possibly should have just removed *all* of that whole argument but that's often quite fiddly and disrupts the flow of conversation so I just removed the posts that I didn't think would be missed.


If a member has an issue with with what another member has posted then it's best to report it if it breaks the rules (flaming and personal attacks, for example) or take it to PM to either sort your differences or put them on "Ignore". I wasn't singling your posts out as being any worse than any others but that whole thing was pretty unnecessary and doesn't help others who read this thread to garner information.


Good to see apologies are being made now. It really can be hard to discern tone from words on a screen so misunderstandings are easy. They're just a bit of a chore for others to have to wade through is all ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Yeah, it's good to make peace.  Trancendence, I think of you as no less of a Bluelighter, infact, I appreciate your straightforwardness and I think that more people in this world need to be more open about how they feel, even if it results in arguing.  As long as we can argue like civil people.


I was also in a bit of manic state last night.  Re-reading your post, I can detect humor in what you are saying now.  I also have a bit of sarcastic wit, and I think I just got carried away.  I know you weren't dissing Shulgin.

funny, 2C-T-7 is the next thing on my to do list....after I get all these other things out of my system.  2C-T-7 is something i never feel like mixing with other stuff....it's jsut got too much going on.  I'm not that familiar with it either though....I would mix it with ketamine and nitrous for sure, but other psychedelics.....i dunno, it's a pretty rich experience by itself.

Umm, the fact that they are both 5-HT2a agonists means there would indeed most likely be cross tolerance.  Just like other 5-HT2a psychedelics it'll be gone by a few days to a week.

I'd say from a tolerance point of view it would be better to take the 2C one day and then LSD the next day.  


LSD has such a strong affinity for the 5HT2a receptor that it'll bind to nearly anything that didn't get down-regulated.

The key word there was "noticeable". Of course there will be some *some* tolerance. Unless you've been binging on LSD for a week, you should be able to trip on LSD one day and trip fine on T7 the next. At least that's true in my experience. YMMV and all of that.

I personally don't find there to be a whole lot of cross tolerance between 2C's and tryptamines like mushrooms and LSD when one's taken the day after the other, although there's certainly some. Then again, I find 2C's take a little while to produce any tolerances of their own, too. Myself and two others once took LSD the day after 2C-T-7 without really any noticeable cross tolerance, and once I took LSD a day after 2C-I, and again, without any real cross tolerance to speak of, although it was a mild LSD trip so it's hard to say. There's a definite cross tolerance between LSD and mushrooms, but I think tryptamines and phenethylamines are generally much slighter.

Tried t7 last night, 20mgs. After 3 hours I was feeling extremely euphoric but had barley any visuals at all so I took another 6-7mgs and still had very minimal visuals, so I took 10mg 2C-E. The experience was very intense, almost overwhelming. The visuals from the 10mg 2C-E plus the 26-27 of t7 gave me visuals much more intense than 25mgs 2C-E. Looking forward to trying this substance again at a 30mg dose.

I find that really interesting. A lot of reports speak about euphoria but when I tried it (~27mg I think it was) I didn't get *any* euphoria but decent (akin to a low/mid dose of acid) visuals.

25mg didn't give me euphoria or visuals.


~35mg made me pretty much watch the world dissolve with intense OEV and CEV with amazing euphoria.

Best trip I had was off 50 mgs orally , had some discomfort on the come up , I puked maybe twice


But after that it was awesome , very nice visuals and euphoria 


I'd say I took it at 12 in the afternoon and at 9 I was still going strong when I snorted 20 mg of 2c-e


Very fun trip I was starring at the stars for hours that night , memorized  ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Just dropping in to share that an acquaintance of mine dosed 40mg on one occasion, and 60mg another. Both times he got "alerts" and the second time he threw up. All he got were minute trails, and a bit of stimulation. Of course I can't tell ya any mental effects he got because he hardly recognizes those as effects of psychedelics ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif). 


2C-E, 2C-B, 2C-I, and 2C-T-2 all work fine for him.

my most intense trip with 2C-T-7 doesn't really follow the "responsible dosing" guidelines.  I was transferring my 2C-T-7 from the baggie to some vials, and every time there was a bit of 2C-T-7 on the scale, or if some fell on the table, I would eat it up.  So I did x amount of T7 like that, then I ate a 25 mg gelcap, and then once the bag was empty, I sliced it open, put it into a cup of water, and stirred it up with a spoon.  So i'm not sure how much 2C-T-7 was stuck to the inside of the baggie, but based on the trip that ensued, I'm guessing a lot.  I got the visual soup, almost puked, and had a super duper intense tingly groin full body buzz.  Super euphoric.  I was getting audio flanging, and I was starting to get the "psychedelic dissociated delerious nod off".   It was a very strong experience, but that's the trip that made me fall in love with 2C-T-7.  This psychedleic is very complex, there is a lot going on with it, mentally, physically, and even spiritually.  This stuff really has amazing potential for helping people heal personal issues, and I think it would be super amazing couples-therapy material.  Super valuable, but I wouldn't put it in the "take this if you just want fun trippy times" category.  I mean, it makes me very giggly and happy and I love being around people....but this one deserves every bit of respect you got.


I think my favorite dose will be in the 30-40 mg area.  I have done it at 23 before and I got some very light visuals, some fairly pronounced euphoria, and a headache the day after ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)  Still one of my favorites.

Does anybody else find the nausea from t7 to be too much?  I don't mind nausea if it is rectified in the end with some satisfying vomiting.  But the times I tried t7 I was very nauseous for 3 hours and then it just went away.  Feeling that bad and not being able to throw up easily is not something I enjoy.  


Is it recommended to take t7 on an empty stomach or full?

I've taken up to 26mg of 2C-T-7 and only had a mild rotten egg taste persisting in my mouth for the first couple of hours. No nausea at all. Granted, I hadn't eaten for 3 hours before the trip.

I did 24 mgs last time and I experienced nausea for about 2.5 hours of the come up, but i never did puke.  It usually takes me around 3.5 hours give or take to peak on 2C-T-7.  My stomach remains sensitive for a while, I find this material is very intense on the body in every way...stomach, muscles, headache, dehydrating and makes you piss alot.  I still think it's worth it though, it's really not that bad if you prepare for it.  If you fast a bit before taking it, stretch or do yoga when you experience muscle tension, and drink a lot of water during your trip, it's not so bad.  2C-T-7 is a really intense material though for sure.  I really like 2C-T-7 for its intensity, and it's wide spectrum of effects.  It's like a psychedelic and an empathogen all in one.

I guess I was just hoping that with t7 that it would make me puke like with AMT.  Instead it just gives me nausea with no relief other than waiting it out.  I really did like it once I peaked though.  Maybe smoking pot on the comeup will help...

That's one great thing about injecting, snorting, or plugging 2C-T-7. You'll projectile vomit or shit yourself pretty quickly, and the nausea will go away after that.

What could possibly be unhealthy about injecting 2C-T-7? Peripheral vasoconstriction? I don't think it's a very potent vasoconstrictor...


It certainly doesn't cause any cardiac issues in me either...


If the pharmacology of every other studied  phenethylamine is any indication, 2C-T-7 is as likely to be as non-toxic as mescaline at normal recreational doses... I think mescaline will kill most people if they were to overdose on 4000mg or whatever, which is probably equivalent to what the people overdosing on 2C-T-7 took.


How could you possibly think IV 2C-T-7 would be too intense? What do you think of things like IM ketamine, or vaporized N,N-DMT? Those are FAR more intense experiences than 2C-T-7.

Don't get me wrong, my comment wasn't based on any pharma-knowledge ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I was just going on my experiences with this drug and the fact that when injecting the bio-availability is much higher.


Plus the fact that I don't inject anything, I would think it would be too intense (for the average person). But I guess, different people react differently - and when adding different methods of.

Faster onset leads to better effects profile with less side effects with 2C-T-7, as long as you don't overdose. The best body high, least nausea, most euphoria comes from IV, followed by vaporization, plugging, and then insufflation.


For IV you wanna start with 3mg or 5mg...

This weekend I'm going to have my second experience with T7. The first time I tried this substance was at 20mg. After 3.5 hours I was disappointed and took 6mg. I really noticed no increase in visuals or euphoria so I finished out the trip. Now for this trip, I'm wondering if I should take 25-2mg or take straight 30mg. I wanna see what T7 can really do.

I used a light-bulb to vaporize it.  It was my 1st time with 2C-T-7 and yes I did get some effect but it was weak and a waste.  Every other method I have tryed is far superior.  Oral and IV are equal, oral being much safer and has a longer duration,  IV is well... hard to describe but it will blow your mind or kill you.  Insulflation works but is far inferior to oral or IV because it hurts like hell, is far less safe than oral and not anywhere near as impressive as IV.

Speaking from my own personal experience, snorting 2C-T-7 may bring on the effects much more quickly and intensely, but I also suffer more of the negative effects like uncomfortable body load, nausea, tachycardia and panic/anxiety.  When I eat it, the effects come on gradually but they are much more pleasurable with less of the negative effects.  


I've consumed a couple grams of this substance over the years so I've got quite a bit of experience with it.  Most of the people who have done it with me also prefer to eat it as opposed to snorting it.


I haven't IV'd, but I've read reports from experienced psychonauts that it was pretty intense and not recommended for the faint of heart.  I've also seen one person snort an insanely large amount and report that she felt NOTHING at all whilst the rest of us were tripping balls!   This substance is one that I recommend people approach with the greatest caution.  Start with very small doses and work your way up taking the safest route of administration before you proceed with any heroic attempts at intense experiences.


Just my $.02 for those who are relatively new with T7.

Yesterday I consumed 30 mgs of 2C-T-7 in two 15 mgs piles, 30 minutes apart.  I dosed at 7:00 and 7:30.   I experienced very little nausea, but I did experience some.  I didn't eat until about 11:30 or 12:00, at which point I noticed that I didn't haven't nausea, but I was still slightly unsettled in the stomach area when I ate.  Overall, I would say I was actually quite underwhelmed by this experience.  I did it alone and inside on a rainy day, and I just don't think it provided enough stimulus for the 2C-T-7 to do anything with. It reminded of when Shulgin speaks of the beth state in pihkal at times.  I didn't notice any particular euphoria, the visuals were almost non existent.  There was some introspection, but was it any more than there would be normally if you were sitting around all day ?  There was no increase in my ability to play guitar.  I did notice a significant body load, and I consumed lots of water and tea, but didn't urinate that much.  My body was up to a +++, but mind, i would say ++, maybe even a +1.5.  So far 2C-T-7 is the most variable in effects of all the 2C's I have done, which is 2C-I, 2C-E, 2C-C, 2C-T-2.  I think 30 mgs is still a little bit on the light side of the dose chart for me.  I have done less and experienced more effect than this, but I still feel like I have to push for 35+ mgs in order to have a full on trip on 2C-T-7.  Maybe I will try plugging next time.

Everybody is different.  The only sane way to experiment with any new psychedelic is start with a threshold dose and gradually work up to what is most comfortable and pleasurable for you.

2C-T-7's dose-response curve varies dramatically between people.  Some people need very high doses while others need very low ones.  One user from PD's earlier years reported needing at least 50mg for a real experience, and 75mg was his ideal strong experience.  For most, 75mg would be lethal, or close to it.  For some, 10mg produces a powerful state.  Everyone is affected differently by every drug, but 2C-T-7 seems especially variable.

I had a dose of 25-30mg of 2ct7 last friday and i can honestly say it was the best trip experience ive ever had. Once id been sick a few times and emptied my stomach (and the tolilet turned inot a kaliescope) it was excellent. I know im going to be sick now on 2cs so its not much of a bother. Once it i had comeup fully after about 2 hours all i could see were amazing detailed, colourful, sparkly visuals and this lasted a good 3 hours. I certainly was glad i was home and not out in public! My head was fairly clear the whole time and once it levelled out i felt extreme euphroria not kept saying to myself 'this is better than any trip/pill ive ever had'. I cant really compare to 2ce as only had a low doses but i found the visuals of e more bold and colourful. Had no comedown and great afterglow. Brilliant. Considering plugging, is gel caps fine and do u get any bowel problems?? i really recommend this drug ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I think that the no "what did I take?"-thread rule of bluelight makes perfect sense, because different people react very differently to different drugs, so no one can really answer that question. and that's why I wonder why this rule isn't inforced in this case, and there are discussions about 2C-B vs. 2C-I in the 2C-T-7 thread.

Does anyone get a comedown from 2c-t-7?  I have taken it 3 times and every time the day after I feel very emotionally flat and have just a generally down feeling.  


2c-t-7 gives me incredible blissful euphoria, maybe it has something to do with that?  Does anybody know if it releases a significant amount of serotonin?


btw I am taking doses at around 30mg

^^ Although I have never tried 2c-e I have tried 2c-b and 2c-i.  I get a horrible body load from t7, nausea, vomiting, dry heaving, and diarrhea. I did not get diarrhea or the dry heaving the first two times I took it and I believe this is because I took it on a relatively full stomach.


EDIT:  I feel compelled to mention that although the body load is huge for me, I still enjoy the experience.  t7 has given me not only the most intense visuals from all the psychs (excluding DMT) I've tried and the most intense euphoria.  (There are many psychs I haven't tried at huge doses though).

IME the bodyload on t7 sounds horrible to a sober person but once you are on it and you have nausea or vomiting it's not really that uncomfortable.  It's more just a neutral sensation than it would be perceived when you are sober.


On another note, can anybody comment on a 2c-t-7 and piracetam combination?  I only have 3 doses left and I want to make the most out of them.  I have tried piracetam with MDMA, AMT, and marijuana before with great results (on all separate occasions).

Does anybody have tried to combine 2C-T-7 and 5-MeO-MiPT ?


I wonder if the MAOI properties of T7 could lead to complications with 5-meo-mipt ?


I thought about 30 mg of T7 and 10mg of 5-MeO-MiPT...

I've had 2ct7 twice now and loved it. First time 20mg, 2nd time 25mg. Amazing visuals and euphoria. 


A friend had 30mg the other night at a psytrance party in the bush and flipped out. Thought he was dying. Said he needed medical attention because his heart was racing so fast... he came down and was fine though. Hm..

I have a friend that has taken up to 60mg of 2C-T-7 (orally) confirmed active by myself and others with no effect other than vomiting and slight visuals for a half hour or so after vomiting. It was my supply, and I refused to let him try more on my watch, because I haven't heard of people dosing any higher than that.


If T7 were to come around again, would any of you advise further exploration? My gut says hell no, but maybe it just has an interesting dose response thing going on like I've heard? I'm just concerned with the reported deaths with t7..i know they weren't really similar situations but safety first ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


PS: He's apparently taken 2C-T-2 with full expected effects

This my first post on this forum, so I would like to say 'Hi' to everyone and thanks  for all the helpful information I have read over the past weeks. 


I have heard and been with friends who have taken 2c-t-7 and had little or no effect from it (ingested) apart from nausea. They got it from a street dealer and it was in the form of a little red pill with a WY sign on it. Yesterday night my friend who hasn't taken the pills or 2c-t-7 (so he has no knowledge of the effects from them)gave me 6 pills. I have had a look on pillreports and found that the yaba (Meth-amphetamine) pills found in Thailand are almost identically to these but also read a comment on one the pills found in the UK being 2c-t-7. I am just wondering if anyone reading this has come into contact with these pills and can verify content?


Thanks in advance. Chemical Bliss

Regarding your WY pills, an testing kit could quite easily test for the presence of methamphetamine, and at the very least for the presence of a 2C-* compound.

I agree a testing kit would be the best answer but seeing as i am recently out of work, I don't have the money to purchase one. Yaba pills are commonly smoked aswell as ingested and they melt under heat, I'm thinking i might melt half a pill to see if they melt. Would 2ct7 melt in the same way? I'm also thinking i might try one and see the effects, can anyone think of any concerns with doing this?

Hi cheamical bliss. Welcome to Bluelight.

The only WY pills i have heard of are yaba (meth) pills.


A test kit would be your best option in this case.


I cant really recomend you take pills where you dont know what they contain but the effects of meth and 2ct7 are very different. One being a stong stimulant while the other is psychedelic. If you did try the pills i think you would be able to tell which it is.

I've got the worst body load of all psychedelics from 2C-E. The only one I've had violent shivers on. From 2C-T-7, the only thing I can complain about is the slight rotten egg taste that persists throughout the trip and sometimes causes transient nausea.


As for come-down, I regularly get day-after blankness from higher doses of 2C's, but for example, from the 18mg of 2C-T-7 I took on Saturday, the glow extended into the next day and gently faded leaving behind the lessons I learned and the renewed appreciation for life.


Speaking of which, 2C-T-7 is my favorite RC and my favorite psychedelic next to LSD. It has a beauty and clarity that rivals that of acid, and it breathes life into me. Whereas from mushrooms I often see all people's faces as caricatures, from t7 I see the beauty in everything and everyone. It brings me into the world and into the present, rather towards the cosmic abstraction of tryptamines.

Whereas from mushrooms I often see all people's faces as caricatures, from t7 I see the beauty in everything and everyone. It brings me into the world and into the present, rather towards the cosmic abstraction of tryptamines.

well i definately wouldnt turn any down if offered.

ok well about 3 and a half hours ago Ingested 1 of the pills along with a fiend. After about 45mins I thaught I started seeing visual distortions (only slight). I have eaten two microwave pizza's and have felt like I could sleep at times. I decided to leave my friends and return home and that leads me here. I can see some very slight connections to the 2cb that is the only other of the 2cx's i have tried. I doubt that they are the yaba pills because of the tiredness and hunger but can't truely say if their 2c-t-7. I'll probably end up reporting back later as i think whatever they are they have a few hours left in them.

From what I've read, including in PIHKAL, 2C-T-2 is known to cause more body load than -7, especially GI disturbances. 


2C-T-21 seems completely different from what I've read - some people said it isn't psychedelic at all and has very little visuals, so it didn't spark my interest.

Well I'm assuming it was 2c-t-7 as i fell asleep at t+7 hours and started coming down at roughly t+5. I am not sure how much t-7 was in the pills which is shame but i think a strong +1 was felt. It wasn't beautiful like the 2cb i have done and i felt slightly confused on it (not as confused as ketamine). The fact that my only sitter took one of my pills without me knowing scared me as I didn't know how much of the drug was in the pills and as I understand t-7 can get quite overwhelming in large doses. I found being on my own in my own bed watching t.v felt safe and that if anything went wrong my family was close by, something I have never felt before sober and un-sober. 


It was an interesting adventure, one that i will probably not persue again.


I am 99.9% sure that these were not the yaba pills which leads me to ask the question why would the manufacturer press 2c-t-7 into a very common shape for a meth-amphetamine pill (a drug not very highly regarded in the UK)?

Ive heard of both t7 and t2 giving horrible GI disturbance to some and none to others.


T21 sounds interesting because it sounds like more of an empathogen (i find most 2c's empthogen like at lower doses) and i enjoy that quality.

I'd love to see the b& hammer come down on this one.


Anyhow, I shall soon be in possession of some T7.


I plan to orally consume a 25-30 mg dose.  I am a very hard headed psychedelic user, and this will just be my "tester" dose.  If I am sensitive, then hey, my stash will last longer and I'll have more trips, but I don't see any medical proclivity occurring from orally consuming 30 mg, even if I am sensitive to T7, which I don't expect to be...  If not, I'll just be underwhelmed.  


Then on a second or third trip, I plan to up the dose of T7 (depending on how hard the 25 hit me, probably anywhere from 35-50 mg of T7) and* possibly *combine it with ~15 mg of 4-ACO-DMT.  I may save the combo for the third T7 experiment, just so I get the full on T7 effects without the trypt interference before I combine them.  Thanks for the idea Xorkoth ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)


Does anybody see any problems with doing any of this (I do not personally but there's a reason I'm asking everybody else)?


Short-term T7 tolerance?  Could I do this series of experiments two days in a row?  Generally I give myself at least the margin of what I (and maybe other people, who knows) call the "3-day rule" for psychedelics, but I wouldn't mind breaking that rule for a repeated T7 ride when the first is only 25-30 mg.

I would assume so as well, but exactly HOW MUCH tolerance?


Let's assume I dose 25mg one day, then double that to 50mg the next day.

Then what?


This is all mostly theoretical, I have the willpower to dose low on T7 one day, then go explore O-Acetylpsilocin the next day and wait at least a week before upping my T7 dose.


Just curious ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

While it won't cause any objective physical harm, if you *are* sensitive that dose could easily put you on your ass (30mg).

Me & 2c-e don't get along at all, hah. Nausea, nasty body load, sub-par trip, naff visuals, etc, etc.


2c-b I love.


The rest of the 2cs I've tried have just been alright, but nothing special or worth picking over acid, 4-trypts, mesc or whatever else.


If I can get ahold of 2c-hot-7 I'll give that a go though, a few friends are very impressed with it & apparently it put the other 2cs to shame.

I never got 2C-T-7 to work orally, Feste, even at 80mg. However, insufflated or IV'd, 2C-T-7 is far and away the best 2C. It's most similar to 2C-B but more intense. Most amazing visuals at only 10mg or less.

That's really not a terrific idea... the 2C-T's (at least -2 and -7, maybe -4) are pretty potent, using routes of administration that create a spike in peak blood plasma concentration seems to be generally bad to do.

Deleria and MAOI-like / serotonin syndrome like phenomenon have been observed...


Please just use them orally, steadily titrate the dose. If it doesnt do you any good my advice is to leave it.

Though I could understand that adverse reactions are a bit less likely if the general reaction is mild but still... keep it sensible.

Each to their own I suppose - 2CE for me is better than T7 - not that I dislike T7 mind you - greater depth IMO & greater predictability

I might be getting some 2C-T-7 in the coming weeks for the first time. Not only that but it's the first time I've had any phenethylamine for that matter. Im quite experianced with LSD - a drug i've come to know and love ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) and im quite comfortable tripping in most environments, clubs, rooms, with people, by myself etc. How would people rate 2C-T-7 as a first time phenethylamine? I'd personally much rather get to grips with 2C-B first though thats not an option at the moment. I know this is subjective but can anyone give me any idea about how it compares for social interaction with LSD?

Has anyone else found T-7 pretty unpredictable when it comes to CEVs?


30mg rocked my world last night, however my CEVs were a lot weaker than my previous 27 mg dose. Both times the visuals were a long time coming and it took a fair-sized joint to really kick them into gear.


I will say though, once the visuals do come they are simply magnificent.

I find 2C-T-7 very unpredictable in every way.  I have had several experiences with them, and there is nothing that ties together the dosages and effects.  The first time i did it, i did 15 mgs and i had a nice time.  No visuals to speak of really...it seemed as though visuals COULD erupt at any second, but never did.  The headspace at 15 mgs was nice and euphoric though.  another time i did 20 mgs, and I tripped, but none of the 4 or 5 people in the house could tell i was tripping even remotely.  Also, that was in total broad daylight.  Also no visuals.  Infact, it seemed like i was WAY too oversensitive to light, it kind of sucked.  Another time I did an unknown amount....kind of foolish of me, but i dosed 25 mgs, then i put all my 2C-T-7 from the baggie into a vial.   Then i licked up the remnants of 2C-T-7 powder from the tare paper, and then cut open the baggie and swooshed it around in a cup of water, then drank it down.  What ensued was 9 hours of the craziest visuals i have ever seen, with a super super duper crazy intense euphoric yet profoundly psychedelic trip to boot.  Crazy times.  Then another time i did 25 mgs, and it was perfect....it was in the evening, with a good buddy...nice visuals, nice trip, not too intense body.   But another time I did 30 mgs, and that day was spent alone, inside, on a shitty rainy day....and i got almost no effects, other than shitty body load.   Weird eh ?


I think 2C-T-7 is just very set and setting dependant, and also responds A LOT to what you have eaten recently, the physcial condition of your body at the time of dosing.  It's just all over the place. 


The unpredictability of 2C-T-7 is what usually makes me end up taking 2C-E instead.  I can always be certain 2C-E will deliver a valuable trip.  Although 2C-T-7 is awesome, and can certainly provide some amazing experiences.  Maybe i will try plugging.


I like combining oral and plugging....I've done it with 2C-D to great effect.  ate 30 mgs, and when i could feel it starting to take hold, i plugged 20, and I had a great time lying on the couch listening to music, reminiscing nice memories and watching the crazy unique fractal visuals that were more in my minds eye than anything...anyways, back to you, 2C-T-7 !

Tried T7 for the first time last week and it was really weird.  Ate 30mg and 3 hours later was only getting the faintest visuals.  Decided to bump 5mg just to see if it was bunk.  Sure enough, a few minutes later I'm tripping insanely hard.  Lasted another 6+ hours.

the one time i've tried t-7 (will be experimenting further in a week), the visuals were "hiding"-- that is, if i moved my eyes around or blinked, all i would get were tracers and halos, nothing special.


but if i centered myself, took a deep breath, and stared directly at one spot for three seconds, i would be suddenly immersed in flowing patterns and persian carpet visuals. with eyes closed, the same deep breath would play laser lights of electric colors across by mind.

Hello, PD. Can someone offer their opinion on how similar 2CT7 is to Mescaline?


I've tried 2CT2, 2CE, 2CB and 2CI, and the only one that really seemed similar to Mescaline in my brain was 2CT2. At 16mg, it seemed to take me to the "other place" fairly effectively without too many distracting visual effects, and opened up my head-space without altering it so much that I was unable to learn anything. That's basically what I get from Mescaline as well, although Mescaline is a bit more intoxicating and all-enveloping than 2CT2; more "purely psychedelic," perhaps. I'm going to try a higher dose of 2CT2 at some point to try to bring out its unique characteristics, but my two experiences with it thus far were very similar to what I've experienced from the cactus.


I suppose it is futile to try to describe the differences between psychedelic drugs, but I'd be interested to hear a more experienced tripper's opinion on how they compare. I only trip maybe 5 or 6 times a year, and I'm trying to decide whether I should simply continue using Mescaline, or if I should perhaps give 2CT7 a shot. Yes?


Thanks!

if you guys had only 50mg of 2c-t-7 at your disposal and had never done t-7 before, but were moderately experienced in other psychedelics, how would you go about using it?


i normally would just jump into a dose thats a guaranteed ++, but it seems individual response to this drug varies a lot more than other psychedelics.


my thought is to start with 10mg.  if that 10mg produces a mere +, i think i'll double the dose to 20mg for my next go and have two of those sized doses.  if 10mg produces a ++ then i think i'll go for 17mg next, then 23mg after that.  if 10mg produces a +++ then i'm just a lucky bastard and get 5 trips out of my 50mg.  here's hoping.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

10 mg will be a waste. I dosed 18 mg my first time and it had little effect. For me T-7 gets interesting at around 25 mg and a full dose is 30. So, I'd either advise two 25 mg doses (which may be underwhelming though), or a 20 mg dose to test the waters followed by 30 mg at a later date.

Something to consider is that 2C-T-7 seems to affect different people quite differently.  Some people find 20mg very intense and overwhelming, while others feel light effects at 20mg.  So definitely start on the low side and work up.  Also, when taken orally it takes quite a while to reach full effect, up to 3 hours or even more. 


I'd try 20mg and see what happens.  Most likely you'll need more, but it never hutrs to be cautious, because you don't want to overdo it with T-7.  But I do agree that 10mg will be a waste.

I find 2C-T_2 to be the most similar to mescaline of the 2C-Xs as well.  I don't think T-7 is very similar to mescaline really at all except that it does have a warm, intoxicating quality and empathy.  But visually, for one thing, it's got a reputation for being extremely intense, the most visual of all the 2C-Xs by far.  I found 2C-T-2 to be more mentally psychedelic and 2C-T-7 to be more emotional and feelings-based.  So I suppose it's like mescaline in that regard too, but T-2 is much closer to what mescaline is.

In 2000 I had my first phenethylamine experience and it was with 50mg of 2C-T-7.  I had countless LSD trips, morning glory, and mushrooms so I figured that since I handled insane dosages of LSD, this wounld't be hard.


Back then, there was little information around to tell me how completely stupid that was.  It was a wonderful trip.

Im quite experianced with LSD - a drug i've come to know and love and im quite comfortable tripping in most environments, clubs, rooms, with people, by myself etc. How would people rate 2C-T-7 as a first time phenethylamine? I'd personally much rather get to grips with 2C-B first though thats not an option at the moment. I know this is subjective but can anyone give me any idea about how it compares for social interaction with LSD?

How do you mean 'social interaction with LSD'?  I find it near impossible to communicate with non-trippers on LSD and I do not take it around other people unless I am at a concert or a festival.


2C-T-7 has a lot of the warmth and empathy of MDMA, but I still don't take it for social interaction.  I don't like to have to control my actions, so I tend to trip in the wilderness.

i find it nearly impossible to communicate with even with people who are tripping.

PSYCHS, UNLESS DOSED DECENTLY LOW Are never social drugs for me, but they canbe fun in social settings such as concerts.

More so for the music appreciation and outside stimuli that makes the trip even more interesting than actually socializing though.

That's odd. I guess my only experience with LSD was 'decently low' dosage (2.5 tabs of WoW, having been passed through numerous hands and taken on a 12 hour roadtrip then stored in my freezer for 3 months), but I spent the entire trip with at least one other person (all non-tripping, close friends or semi-close friends) and found socializing interesting enough. I didn't talk much, but listening was easy and enjoyable. Socially, I was about as quiet as I am when decently stoned. I even had some relatively deep one on one conversations, even though I felt that my conversation was oddly paced and slow, my friends told me that it wasn't far off from normal. This was mostly on what might be considered the 'come down' though (T+6-7 hours)

Thanks for the reply. I think I have a pretty good idea of what to expect when I get around to trying 2C-T-7, although I think I'll stick to Mescalito for the time being ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I'm in agreement with this as well Xor. It totally does have that mescaline 'thing' going on for sure. I'm very intrigued by the similarities and differences between 2c-t-2 and 2c-e at the moment, as they really do crossover psychedelic territory - whilst also having an absolutely recognizable difference between them. 2c-t-2, as slightly 'cartooney', uniquely brings out an intertangled, all encompassing, cosmic-laugh aspect of the experience, whilst leaving the door right open to a truley samadhi satori. 

Whilst 2c-e differs in it's approach to perspective on time and space, I have found by exploring with very high doses, and intravenous administration, it reaches a potential for tear-jearking beauty in nature, and similar sexy body feelings to t-2 (as Xorkoth has previously mentioned). I believe both of them really cut close to mescaline's approach, however - it has to be stated that all of them are as valuable as one another. There are big overlaps, but one common thread amongst them all is the rootsy-ness toward Mother Earth (Gaia-Sophia), and if you are lucky enough to look even further, how this stretches from Sophia out into the greater cosmos, (and further inward beyond the quantum level).


I expected 2c-t-7 to have a similar mescaline vibe to it, yet this is one of very few I haven't tasted as yet. My friends can only describe it as 'pokey' - in a good way, that is seriously the only description they give for it beside it's twisted visuals. They are more recreational users, so I cannot garner anything useful from them in terms of how it relates to reality etc.


I'm not in any hurry for t-7 yet, as there are far more other non-2cx compounds I want/need to get round to exploring. But it is certainly on the menu. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I really resonated with this post... you're so right. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  You reminded me of some aspects of 2C-T-2 I had forgotten... I've only had it a few times.  It was one of my earlier psychedelic experiences.

Tried this quite a few times now over the past month since acquiring some.


First time plugged 12mg and really enjoyed it, slight anal burn but bearable.


Next tried consuming 30mg orally which was horrible, something I wouldn't like to repeat, really drawn out come-up full of nausea and anxiety with a rather heavy bodyload similar to what I get from 2C-E, trip was interesting but rather mild, the anxiety got in the way a lot. Plus it was absolutely boiling that day and I thought it would be a good idea to take some t-7 in the sun... I spent most of the trip sat against the freezer next to several fans.


Next I tried snorting (Yes I was aware of the dangers) 10mg... Good god this stuff burns, not quite as badly as 2C-I but it sure does hurt. The trip was really botchy and the bodyload felt incredibly violent and aggressive, I couldn't wait for it to wear off, not worth the risk.


If you ask me the only way to do T-7 is rectally, Plug between 10-20mg, the comeup is smooth and really euphoric, no negative bodyload to speak of, no anxiety.. just lovelyness all round.


This definately has a place in my own personal magical half dozen.

Did this 2 or 3 times when my brother gave me his left overs for free.  It makes you sick with the flu the first 1/3 or more of the trip.  The visuals are very uncoordinated and not geometric like acid/psilo.  However, probablly one of the strongestest trips I've had was after railing a good bit of tct7

To add to the above comment, definitely never combine large doses of 2C-T-7 with anything that would react badly with an MAOI (MDMA especially). This has killed people. Be aware the dose/response on this compound varies HEAVILY per person. I know this goes for most 2Cs, but this one has some people eating 70mgs to get somewhere, while others are blown away by 20 mgs. Be careful and if you're going to snort it, don't go and do 20mg lines. If you must snort it, start with TINY doses and take breaks (both within a night and multiple day breaks between 'trials') You don't want to be a statistic against RC consumption...

Alright so I'll admit that I haven't thoroughly read this entire thread but I have searched it with no luck. But I was curious about recommendations for dosing for oral dosing? And yes I know that there is a huge variance in people's responses to the same but what would you say is a good threshold dose?

if I were you (and the identity of your 2c-t-7 is not under question)


start with 10-15mg orally. this is the average threshold (+/- on shulgin scale) dose. +1 effects are found in the range of 15-20mg; ++ around 20-30mg; +++ at 25-50mg depending on the person.


If you have no qualms with rectal dosing, I *highly *recommend it with this compound. Come up is reduced to about one hour and the dose should be halved accordingly. 5-7mg for +/-; 7-10mg for +1; 10-15mg for ++; 12-25mg for +++.


Side effects (nausea, vasoconstriction, etc) appear to be highest with nasal dosing, moderate with oral dosing, and mild with rectal dosing. Also note that side effects may be very psychosomatic (moreso than with other compounds) and can vary wildly from person to person. In my trials with this compound, I have found the side effects to be much less than 2C-I or 2C-E. Other people may have different opinions.

Thank you thank you ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I'd been looking for something where there were dosages lined up with the Shulgin scale but they were scattered through different posts. 


Rectal dosing of 2C-T-7 is one of those things that one day I'd like to try (provided I like it) just like IM ketamine. Its just the matter of getting past the idea of each.

Does anyone think there's a pattern between negative effects of across the 2c's and individual variation? ie. i dont get nausea with 2ct2 but I did horribly from even just 5mg testing dose of 2ce, dose that provide any clue of what you might I expect from 2ct7?

2C-I and 2C-E are some of my favorite drugs, especially combined with nitrous oxide.


Would 2C-T-7 be down my road? Anybodys take on that?

Nope I dont think there's any pattern as far as nausea and bodyload goes with the 2C's.

Some may give you strong nausea others mild and others non existant. 


For me 2C-E is absolutely brutal for nausea and bodyload to the point where its crippling. whereas 2C-P, 2C-T-7 and 2C-I are much more tolerable however they do cause a mild amount of nausea and bodyload. 2C-B, 2C-C and 2C-D I find to be really gentle and dont cause me any problems.


I find 2C-E to be the strongest trip out of all those by a LONG shot so maybe that has something to do with it.


And in response to nopipesdfw yeah I would say it would be down your road although despite what many others say I dont find 2C-T-7 to be anywhere near as visual or deep as 2C-I/E can be. Its bright and colourful and can feel very MDMA like but is really lacking depth, grab some and try it out, I very much doubt you will be dissapointed ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I've had maybe three or four +++ 2C-T-7 trips, and I gotta say this is one hell of a drug.  For me, it's the most unpredictable of the 2C's.  By that, I mean that the dose seems to be all over the place each time I take it.  One time I took 30 mgs of it alone at home on a rainy day when I was pretty bored, and nothing much of anything happened beyond a +.  Another time I did 25 mgs with a friend, and we stayed up all night having a super crazy visual experience and being overcome with waves of euphoria that were much deeper than the euphoria of MDMA.


It is rather hard on my body though, it's got the craziest body load out of all the 2C's for me.  It took about 3-4 hours to really be peaking for me, and those first 3-4 hours were spent doing breathing exercises to keep nausea down, and dealing with the very strange muscle tension in my limbs and neck especially.


Visually, at a proper dose, this drug is totally stunning though.  Lots of rainbowing and melting and swirling and everything look like it had a sort of digital overlay, and everything was shiny and sparkly.  One of my trips I took in very bright sunlight, and the sunshine was too much for my eyes.  I had quite an aversion to light.  Also I seem to get a headache every time I do it by the time the trip is over.  Usually it is a slight headache, but it's there.  I think the huge amount of neck tension i get may have something to do with it.


In conclusion, I would have to say that 2C-T-7 is a pretty intense, but worthwhile material, which a rich variety of effects that are worth exploring.  But due to it's unpredictable nature, and consistent hangover like feelings, I always seem to gravitate towards other things in my collection when I am choosing a psychedelic drug to ingest.

Also I should mention that the only way I will take my 2C-T-7 nowadays is rectally, my experience with the oral and nasal routes have been full of anxiety, nausea, muscle tension and GI distress.


Somewhere between 12-16mg up the poopshoot is perfect although be warned this one does have severe rectal burning, all part of the fun though ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Does anyone know what the correct melting point for 2C-T-7 HCl is? I have a sample that melts at 180-190C, but I have no idea what the correct MP is. The PiHKAL entry only states that the boiling point for the freebase is 140-150C at 33Pa. The wikipedia article takes this information and lists it as the melting point, which would (I assume) be incorrect.


Any ideas?

The shulgin index says the MP for the HCl salt is 206-207C. Hmm.

if we're solely talking mg for mg, 2c-p will obviously win every time (active dose 6-12mg), followed by 2c-e (active dose 12-20mg), followed by 2c-t-7 (active dose 15-35mg).


recall that 2c-t-7 is somewhat unpredictable when orally dosed, and shows much more dose-repeatability with rectal dosing.


as far as subjective effects, i would say t-7 feels more 'warm' and 'comforting' than 2c-e when it comes to bodyload. both are stimulating, but 2c-e can be more intense and difficult to 'release' the stimulation, while t-7 is more euphoric (like mdma) and can lend itself well to dancing. with 2c-e's body feeling i was unable to lie still in bed while under its spell, i was writhing and squirming because i could feel the movement of every fiber of my blanket rubbing against every cell of my skin. not necessarily a 'good' feeling of rubbing, but it was definitely 'loud' inside my brain. with channeling they are both excellent for sex.


for visuals, t-7 OEV are very soft, organic, almost mushroom-style warping. but they are very adaptable. 2c-e OEV was primarily color enhancement and 'crispness' when looking at intricately detailed objects (like noticing the moss on a tree). 2c-t-7 would allow me to look at my fluffy cat, and with a little concentration i was able to fill my entire visual field with waves of gently flowing fur, soft and comfortable and warm.


CEV for both 2c-e and 2c-t-7 were similar, with the main theme being bright bands of color crossing a black background like a laser show. but 2c-e CEV felt to be less connected (less synaesthesia) than 2c-t-7 was. when i closed my eyes on 2c-t-7, i heard the vibrations of neural fluid in my spine, and i could feel pulses firing up and down my body. at the same time i focused on these vibrations, my visuals would phase in tune with them. like i was focusing down on some core chakra or something (not sure, don't have formal training in these things, but it definitely felt real). much like the second PIHKAL trip report on 2c-t-7 (focusing on the silence, then bursting with energy).


i would say that 2c-e is definitely a worthwhile phen, but 2c-t-7 is currently my favorite. if only it weren't so unpredictable in dose response, i would trip on it more often or with friends. i like 2c-t-7 at ~20mg rectal, it comes on strong +++ in about one hour.


damn, you make me want to try it again, maybe higher ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Be aware that this route would carry similar risk to nasal admin due to you bypassing first pass metabolism.


The few times I tried this compound were plagued by muscle tension severe enough to put me off completely. This was a problem even with relatively low doses, the highest dose I ever took was 25mg. 


I feel as though I'm missing out given all the glowing experiences others seem to have. I may give it another chance but perhaps it's just not for me.

personally i feel rectal dosing is perfectly safe for 2c-x in SANE dose amounts. i'd bet good money that 100mg rectal 2c-t-7 could lead to seizures in some people.


also note that for most of the 2c-x, some people do not get anything positive from low doses, only side-effects. these people have reported dulling or backgrounding of the negative side effects when a large enough dose to fully break into +++ psychedelia is taken. but that's no guarantee and you may be correct that 2c-t-7 is simply not for you. do you enjoy other 2c-x?

I enjoy 2c-c, 2c-d, 2c-b, 2c-p and to a lesser extent 2c-e. I really don't like 2c-i due to excessive stimulation. I have not tried any of the 2c-t-x series apart from 2c-t-7.

2C-T-7 is amazing. Though one time I had it and all I got was a headache, but the second time I had the most amazing +++ trip, the OEV's and CEV's were both on another level to any other phen ive had before. It was amazing, one visual in particular that I remember was blue and red lasers strobing around my dark room. I would gladly do this chem again but I dont think i'll be seeing any 2C's again, I really hope I do though! Ive had 2C-B in low doses, 2C-I, 2C-E and 2C-T-7 and 2C-I and T7 were my favourites.

Almost all of it, I would say. It is thought that N-OH phenethylamines are metabolised into their N-H counterparts rapidly in the body and so the pharmacological effects are nearly identical.

So Just wanted to share a story. Some one had taken a nasal does and then got curious and vaporized a small amount of it chasing the dragon style. It bubbled and vaporized completely but couldn't tell if the visual effects where from the vaporized does of the nasal one. This persons tolerance was quite high and the effect vary mild. I was wondering if any one knew if it was actually possible to vaporize 2ct-7 or if the compound is degraded by the heat? Also they had quite vivid visuals when on t-7 and then huffing helium. Very reminiscent of N20 fishing out but more psychedelic.

Both do help ime, but their effectiveness varies from person to person. You can avoid nausea pretty much completely by fasting at least on the day you dose, and the most effective remedy for muscle tension or leg tremor is moderate exercise, like stretching, yoga, dancing or riding a bicycle. But that just may be me.

So I had my first experience with this compound yesterday afternoon at 25 mg, from a reputable source, though it has not been lab tested.


It was a very lovely experience, very warm, amazing body buzz which was very euphoric, if you will.. some leg tremors in my thighs but they were not unpleasant and not nearly as intense as the tremors I get from 2ce/i (which I find to be less pleasant then the tremors I got from t7).  I was also provided with a very positive mood lift that  verged on euphoria and which has carried on to this morning.  I was feeling somewhat down at the time (for seemingly unknown reasons) but decided to continue with my experience anyways figuring this might help me work through the sadness and it worked wonderfully. 


The experience (euphoria/mood lift) far exceeds my recent MDMA experience (3 weeks ago, which produced negligible effects at 200 mg, so there might have been some cross tolerance issues), M has lost its magic long ago for me and has ceased to provide anything positive at appropriate doses, even after a 10 month break.


What I thought was strange was the lack of visuals.  The visuals were not absent but they were very minimal: waves, changes in perception and colour enhancement, were all that were noted.  CEV were very minimal.  At T3:00 I had a very light supper with the family of chicken and rice.  And by t4:30 the waves and colour enhancement were negligible, though my perception was definitely still altered and the warm body feeling/mood lift were still present.   By T8:00 I was just above baseline and was able to sleep without any aid at T9:30.


I was not put off by the lack of visuals, as the experience was superb without them.  I was however surprised by the short duration, being almost completely down by T4:30, seemed odd.  Perhaps my body just metabolizes T7 quickly (though T2 seemed on par with experience reports)?  Has anyone else experienced such short durations with 2ct7 as I have?  Perhaps eating at T 3 caused me to come down sooner?  Perhaps there were cross tolerance issues from my roll 3 weeks ago?


Thoughts of any kind will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Tired

So I recently tried 30 mg at a very chill "rave" type party.  It was fantastic .


The experience was quite opening, and I was able to think about somethings that needed to be thought about, though I was not overwhelmed by these thoughts as with LSD (sometimes LSD can get weird and intense for me haha).  However, I was not stuck in thought and was able to effectively interact with other party goers.


As for "visuals", there were nice patterns (combined with the lights, things were nice and trippy, though i was not in a weird mind space ala LSD), colours were brightened and enhanced.  The visuals were nice, not "crazy" per say, but t7 is definitely the most visual 2c I have had to date (out of numerous trials of i and e, 2 trials with t2 and now 2 with t7).  I also experienced lots of empathy, and had a very nice body buzz (though some tremors and some nausea were experienced both however were mild, I might add nausea was aided with ginger tablets and peppermint gum).


Now for a question.  For my next event (late January) I would like to combine 2ct7 with LSD to get the best of both worlds.  

My question is when should I dose each? My thought is to dose the 2ct7 and then an hour or two later dose the L.


What do you guys think?

Anyone with experience with this sort of combo?

(I have read a few reports here and on erowid where the acid is taken after the t7)


Thanks,

Tired

I'm looking to combine 25mg of 2C-T-7 with a small amount of MDMA in order to take more advantage of the MDMA due to 2C-T-7's MAOI activity. I'm aware that this combo is potentially deadly in high doses of MDMA, however I think it should be safe if no more than 50mg of MDMA are taken. I'm looking for suggestions on how much MDMA I should take. Any ideas?

There are other things that could happen like delirium from the T-7, it has some tendency to produce this in stronger experiences and if you are going to enhance 25 mg in such an unsafe and unpredictable way it seems to me like you are asking for such an episode. Also I don't think it makes sense to potentiate MDMA by adding a significant dose of another drug, it would rather be like enhancing T-7 with MDMA so the other way around (which T-7 doesn't need IMO).


I know you asked for advice that would seem more helpful to you but I think the dose to take in this situation is zero. MAOI interactions with MDMA (the mechanism is speculative) certainly have dangers when you take enough of them but what makes you think it wouldn't be bad for your health in lower doses?


Just find some other strategy to get the most out of what you got, IMO it is a bad sign if someone considers a plan like this worth it. If you can't make it work, better accept it. Spend more on a bigger dose of MDMA. Try enhancing absorption with antacids.

You do realize that the deaths associated with 2C-T-7 were in combo with MDMA?


**This is a very bad idea, please reconsider.** Mixing MAOIs with serotonin releasers is probably the ultimate "no fucking way" on PD in terms of combo-related harm reduction. It boggles my mind why you would even consider doing it given the risk involved. It isn't proven about 2C-T-7's MAOI activity, and I have my reservations about its effectiveness in that regard, but if it really is one then it would be a very stupid mistake to dismiss the cautions surrounding it. 


If you are so desperate to roll that hard, just take a big dose of MDMA on its own.

My intention to do such is due to a very limited amount of available MDMA. Also, I doubt that I would be in trouble if I dosed 5mg of MDMA with 25mg of 2C-T-7. All the deaths were doses of +100mg of MDMA, I'm not trying to be stupid.

The point is that you probably shouldn't expect there to be a Goldilock's dosage where the MDMA is productive and feels satisfying in both quantity and quality of effect... but no danger or side-effect.


If you think this idea is fine, then you would also think it would be okay to potentiate MDMA with something like moclobemide (an actual proper MAOI)? I think even potentiation of selegiline via such a method is strongly discouraged because it quickly shows dangerous action such as adrenaline / HR / BP spiking.


Just admit defeat man, if you only have a very small dose of MDMA you can get. Just make it worthwhile some other way, if "only" (actually a good idea IMO) by selecting a great and beautiful set & setting so that a little bit goes a long way.

Staggering it, together in a dangerous combo, would actually seem like a way to ruin that little bit you have IMO.


And taking reports from people who got away with it, if the effect was pleasurable or not, as an argument why it is *possible* is not the way we do HR around here.


If you really want to potentiate with other drugs, what is wrong with something like 2C-B or 2C-C and/or "minor" drugs such as cannabis, nitrous, K (hell even GHB was somewhat of an 'add-on' to me, but not to disrespect the immense augmentation of other)? Typically, advising others to become total poly-users is not such an honorable M.O. but we are talking about making something extra special some time.

I admit that it's totally crazy from the perspective of someone attempting HR. I'm encouraged, however, by reports of people successfully combining moclobemide with >10mg of MDMA.. Well, if I do have the balls to do it, I'll do it in miniscule doses and report back. Wish me luck, and may nobody try to repeat what I'm doing. Maybe I'll come back with some useful information.

So I did the crazy experiment, and here are the results. There were no freak outs, no ridiculously intense moments, only subtle but long lasting euphoria over the night, even after taking 100mg Moclobemide. So this shows that apparently it IS POSSIBLE to mix releasing agents with MAOI's, as long as the doses are carefully measured and kept it in the low dose range.


23mg 2C-T-7 oral 

took three hours to kick in properly, wasn't as intense as expected


t+3 7mg 2C-T-7 oral

starts kicking in nicely. fuzzy colorful visuals, nice emotional opening and well being


t+4 10mg MDMA snorted over 30 minutes.

very subtle mood lift


20mg MDMA oral.

subtle mood lift,


T+5 35mg MDMA oral

decent mood lift, nothing close to sky-rocketing euphoria


T+6 10mg 5-APB, 10mg 6-APB snorted 50mg 6-APB oral

distinct euphoria, starts feeling like a real rolling experience


t+7:30 62mg of mixed 5-APB and 6-APB. Staggered 100mg of Moclobemide

there was no increase in the already waning euphoria. administration of MAO-A inhibitor only slowed the decent into sobriety.


Able to sleep at approximately t+9

Really though, what's the motive? Haven't done 2C-T-7 myself, but it seems euphoric enough by itself? If MDMA is that hard to get why don't you just focus on something else? There's a whole bunch of compounds out there ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) Good to hear you're alive though


Btw, anyone having experience with (oral?) DMT or a different tryptamine in combination with this? Could be the ultimate phenethylamine+tryptamine combo

I don't care if it's possible, it is dangerous and stupid. It's "possible" to drive 150 miles per hour down the autobahn in rush hour whilst drunk, but it doesn't mean it's safe, and most people who attempt it would die (and take a lot of other people with them).


I don't know why you felt you had to prove this to everybody. There's no safe way to combine moclobemide (or other pharmaceutical MAOIs) with MDMA, and just because you and others have reported that they did it and got away with it, does not mean it is safe to do so!

It doesn't work like this either. You can't just say "and may nobody try to repeat what I'm doing", whilst boldly declaring that you are going to do it. What kind of bullshit double-talk is that?


I don't wanna be hostile, but it really annoys me when people say they are doing (or have done) something reckless regardless of advice to the contrary, but then go on to say "don't anybody do this". What kind of a HR example does this set to your readers whom you are trying to discourage. Practice what you preach, or don't preach it at all.


I do hope nobody else tries to repeat your experiment, because there is no way to mitigate the effects of serotonin syndrome other than crossing your fingers, crouching in a corner, and hoping for the best.


I would have just taken the MDMA via another ROA. 50mg will go a lot further rectally than it would orally.

Interesting idea. I might give it a try. But I don't think the MAOI property of 2C-T7 is strong enough to leave DMT active.

Before any deaths or complications alleged to involve 2C-T-7 were published, I had tried 2C-T-7 combined with MDMA, as well as MDA, on several occasions; sometimes I took the MDMA (or MDA) first, and other times I took the MDxA several hours after 2C-T-7.  I found nothing toxic or dangerous, in fact it felt wonderful and healthy.  I still have no idea how 2C-T-7 was so dangerous for some....and by mentioning this I am in no way recommending it....just adding my experience.  2C-T-7 still ranks #1 for me when it comes to the 2Cs.  The euphoria was so 'spiritual' and godly, was off-the-charts good for me.  And the visuals still challange DMT.


Also, are we sure 2C-T-7 is an MAOI?  I thought that paper involved the Aleph series (alpha-methyl-2C-Ts).

I have a report on Erowid with LSD/2C-T-7.   I took the T7 first, and the LSD one hour later so they would both peak together. I did not think they combined well at all, seemed like both were just fighting to be dominate, and when it was over I felt like I wasted both by mixing them. 


Now DPT and 2C-T-7....oh man that was good.

But the combo together was rather chaotic. If you do choose, use much less 2C-T-7 as months later I tried it again (with just 10mg of 2C-T-7) and it worked great.**

Heh, funny how opinions change over the years.  Seems back in 2007 I didn't think it (MDMA/2C-T-7) was as great as I now remember it being.

Oral trials at up to 25mgs were found to be quite tiring physically. It was visually rich and all the usual effects from most of the 2c-x's were had, in my experience (except for 2c-b, 2c-i) it was pretty lethargic overall, there was no overly enjoyable bodyload really that would set this chemical apart from the rest. Although faster and more direct methods of administration such as rectally and nasally provided all the purported MDMA reminiscent feelings that this chem was supposed to have. I did 20mgs rectally and the euphoria was definitely comparable to MDMA just not as rushy, no body load or nausea it was going great. But fast forward to now, i snorted 10mgs and the sulphur smell makes it definitely the worst 2c-x to snort, although the euphoria kind of makes the sadomasochistic transition into psychedelia nice. It's definitely not necessary, but I can definitely feel the similarity to 2C-P sort of visually, in how colourful it is and also the body high that 2c-p gave me was somewhat "entactogenic" which i would have compared to MDMA just for the sake of having something somewhat "comparable" but 2c-t-7 much more so, the experiences between seem similar somehow but distantly. But 2C-T-7 only exhibited MDMA like effects during rectal and insufflated administration. Has anybody else had a similar experience? Orally it didn't have any sort of physical reinforcing push that it had insufflated, almost no entactogenic effects.

Insufflation of 2c-t-7 doesn't feel safe or advisable either btw, it's moreover disgusting and off putting. Comparatively low doses lead to excessive strain, blood pressure and heart rate are uncomfortably raised and psychedelia muted compared to oral dosing. At least that's my experience. It's half life is cut short too with insufflation, feels like you're dumped into restless and morose super sobriety halfway through the trip. Ymmv, but for me it's wasting one of those rare rc's who otherwise feel almost as 'complete' as the big classics.

Hello


I have a question about dosage compared to other the other 2Cs.


I am looking to predict a good first dose without going too high or too low, so I was wondering if there is anyone out there experienced enough to suggest what would be reasonable based on the info on my other 2C experiences? I am aware that T7 is to be regarded with much more caution than other 2Cs.


All of the trips below were taken while I was out clubbing with no other substances involved (apart from one), listening to loud music surrounded by both friends not on the same substance and people I don't know - I don't intended to do this with T7 however but that's to give you an idea of what I am used to setting wise:


2C-B ~ 15mg - Barely noticeable effect. Essentially pointless. Waited a long time for nothing to happen.

2C-B ~ 22mg - Highly satisfactory, not too engrossing but very worthwhile. Great for clubbing. Fun.

2C-B ~ 40+mg - Absolutely amazingly experience, incredible colours and engrossing visuals. Eager to repeat, however probably not in a nightclub. Was impossible to have a bad time.


2C-E ~15mg - Similar to 2C-B @ 22mg. Deeper / more serious thought. Very manageable. Useful. Have done this twice.

2C-E ~ 30mg - Expected much more from this. Really hard to differentiate between 15/30mg experience. Visuals were not as forthcoming as I'd hoped considering the dose. Dropped half a pill a few hours in which kind of took over. Hard to remember much visual activity.


2C-C ~ 40mg - 3 hour come-up. Was overwhelmed when it hit me, didn't really want to dance, ended up leaving to go relax on a sofa. Lots of closed eye fractals! Unique OEVs. Interesting experience. Not particularly eager to repeat though. Put me in a much more more of a passive state - lots of sitting down.


-


Regarding T7 - I don't want to overdo it. Is it possible to predict the effects based on my reactions to other 2Cs? Typically it seems I need about twice as much as my friends to reach the same level of experience.


Would 20mg Oral be reasonable or should I start with 10mg?

To be honest, start with 10mg. I have been known to have a tolerance from hell to EVERYTHING but 14.4mg (weighed it 5 times on my SI-234 semi-micro scale like I did with everything else) of 2C-T-7 was a strong +++ in my system and was so overwhelming that I actually had a black out for part of the experience and the rest of it I was so fucked up that I couldn't talk or walk. There is a steep dose/response curve with it for sure. And that was an oral dose (I'm not stupid enough to snort it).

Everyone is different with T7.  I usually find i need more than others, but last time with a normal dose I was literally deconstructed so start with 10mg.

2C-T-7 will really kick your ass if you aren't prepared for it. I've had it twice and I don't remember what my second dose was but I do remember that it obliterated me out of existence for a good 8 hours that time.

I've tried it twice, once at 15mg and second time around 27mg. Both times it was very very pleasant and at no time was it uncomfortable, or negative on anyway. In fact both times I thought wow! This stuff feels so mild and gentle! I can't believe this is the 2-ct-7 I've heard so much negativity about. YMMV indeed!!!

I'm not sure about 'mild' but it is a gentle material.  Even when the world becomes psychedelic soup, which happens for me above 45mg, the mental is always productive.  I cannot call, for instance, 2C-E or DOM gentle...those two can be downright difficult.

I can't say anything about DOM but 2C-E was much more gentle on my state of mind than 2C-T-7 which absolutely destroyed me both times I did it.

I still have nearly a gram of it in the freezer, it's only thing I ever bought from the vendor and to this day they still have one of the best ***no*** ratings of any Canadian vendor.  It's hard to say. I hope I got what I payed for. 

And I am certainly planning future trials with it in the new year.

Eh, there is a decent chance we got the same stuff. 2C-T-7 has always been said to be highly variable with no explanation. The only thing with me was that I hadn't had any drugs except for my benzos and alcohol for around a month the first time and about 3 months the second.

10mg was taken as part of the 'start low' initiative, in a nightclub setting. Effects were barely noticeable, if present at all. I rememberer thinking 'something' was happening at certain points. Probably a marginally altered state throughout the night from about 2 hours after ingestion, but no clearly obvious indicators or cues to refer to. I have experience with various 2Cs in a similar setting, normally I require more than most people. 


Would it be wise to increase to only 15mg next time, or would 20mg be more conventionally effective in achieving results?

You have to take into account the unpredictable nature of T-7, increasing the dose with small increments is wise, actually trying a certain dose such as 20 mg a number of times would be quite helpful because that would show what range of intensity and effects you can get at that dose. If only you could extrapolate when the dose-response curve had been linear, that would be enough to get as much as a handle of it as possible... but unfortunately it is not linear so it stays mystifying.


I first took an allergy test at about 2 mg, which brought about at least a + response in me, then at about 8-10 mg it was very disappointing, at about 15 mg it was interesting again and I'm sure that there was another disappointment at a higher dosage before being happily surprised again in the 25-30 mg range. There was also a glowing experience on a combination of 2C-T-7 and 2C-B using 2C-B as filler when the 2C-T-7 ran out splitting it between me and my fellow tripster. Extremely therapeutic and heart-opening and warming.

I can live with the side-effects, they are *so* worth it! Never snort any 2C-T-X though...

I tried 15mg's orally (female, 51kg) for the first time last night. Next time I will take a bit more, but for the first time, this dosage was perfect! It was exactly what I hoped for, but visually I expected a little more.  I could see the visual potential of this compound though. 

In advance, I was really scared for the bodyload/nausea. I tend to get sick on most drugs (for example, DOC/2C-P/6-apb), so I was quite sure I would have a tough first few hours. Some time ago I found a post about nausea & psychedelics where they talked about lemon oil: [https://www.dmt-nexus.me/forum/default.aspx?g=posts&t=24003](https://www.dmt-nexus.me/forum/default.aspx?g=posts&t=24003). This oils contains a high concentration of beta-epinene (also found in ginger) which blocks the 5htn3 antanogist (activated when nauseous or throwing up). I drank some ice-tea with 8 drops of lemon oil before dropping the 2ct7. I felt a little nausea for 1.5 hours, but nothing that bad, while I'm certain I would've been hugging the toilet for some hours without the lemon oil. **-Snip- Don't post source links please joshi, it doesn't matter what the source is for, the one exception is we allow links to sites selling scales in the scale discussion thread, but no substances even ethnobotanicals and such ~Jesusgreen**

It's very likely you just had doses much too low for a full trip.  Some people need up to 50mg or more, and some people need 25 or 30mg for a full trip.  It really varies dramatically.  I've had up to 40mg and I didn't have a strong trip at all, though at the time I was taking a lot of psychedelics and had a big tolerance.

Apparently, if you just search for 'vaporizing 2C-T-7'.


But I would still never do anything but oral. Please be careful, make sure it is always impossible to inadvertently inhale a large dose, and avoid combining it - if you do combine it with compounds that are considered safe with it, take them later in a step by step fashion.

Theoretically vaporising would only be more dangerous than snorting.

Anyone has tried mixing 2C-T-7 with Ketamine? What about GHB?


If it's in anyway similar to mescaline the ketamine will sygenized incredibly euphorically and visually. I'm also interested on the  GHB combo for the increased sociability (let go) like with mdma.

GHB might blunt the psychedelic aspect of 2C-T-7 due to GABAergic activation, but might mix nicely with the extra serotonin from T7's MAO-A inhibition.

Huge no no! I made the mistake of mixing this stuff with alcohol and paid for it... T7 is best enjoyed by itself.

no no b/c of the maoi/serotonin thing or what? how did you pay for it?


i am debating between this, e/c/b. have had e and c before, but not 7 and b. c+mxe= one of the most profound trips ever, without mxe c was kinda boring....  Honestly, mxe seems to make EVERYTHING better ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


stupid drug buying addiction... like frikkin pokemon.

I've read a good chunk of this thread and various other reports elsewhere.  This is on my to-do list before I die.  It's the only 2C-T-x I'm interested in.


Sorry if the answer is obvious, but can someone explain why this chem is considered dangerous?  I understand how it has a steep dose response curve, and that the same dose can vary in strength, but what kind of damage does it do?


I've tried 2C-P and supposedly that one is dangerous too, but I've had a good time with it and only minimal body load.  I know they're completely different, but that experience made me a little more comfortable taking rc's.

MXE is serotonergic and 2C-T-7 is a very potent MAOI. Serotonin syndrome and death are possible.


As for the alcohol interaction... I got a lot more fucked up than I should have from the dose I took and I actually blacked out for part of the trip and my blood pressure was through the roof for the next day or two (I could tell because I'd stand up too quickly and my vision would go black just like when I eat too much black licorice).

See above. 2C-P can be dangerous but 2C-T-7 is a potent MAOI and people like to mix it with things and then they die or end up in the hospital. 2C-T-7 was one of the first drugs to start piling up the deaths and ER visits that really brought attention to RCs. It was banned before I even got into AMT in 2002/2003.

I'm not aware that T7 has been shown to be any sort of MAOI.  There is a German paper with a ton of data on a ton of T7 homologous (or ALEPH analogues to be specific) but that paper did not examine any of the 2-carbon compounds.

News to me. It was said for years that 2C-T-7 was an MAOI. 


[http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/385484-2C-T-family-and-MAOI-properties](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/385484-2C-T-family-and-MAOI-properties)


> The other reason that 2CT7 is thought to be a particularly strong MAOI is that the n-propyl derivative (i.e. ALEPH-7) was the strongest MAOI in the series that was tested, so assuming the same holds true for the phenethylamines, 2CT7 will be the strongest.

Based on the trip disasters from combos and the deaths from mixing it with MDMA I think its better to err on the side of caution and assume that its an MAOI. I'm too lazy to do any further searching but my blood pressure only ever went that high when I ate licorice or mixed 2C-T-7 with an "adios muthafucka" alcoholic drink - [http://www.drinksmixer.com/cat/3217/](http://www.drinksmixer.com/cat/3217/)


Now that was a Louisiana-style daiquiri... so it had more than just that in it... but I drank those 40 ounce drinks all the time and never once blacked out, mixed it with 12mg of 2C-T-7 and came to near the end of the trip to find that I'd had sexual relations with the wrong sex, busted a bunch of shit, cried, etc., and then I had the blood pressure issue for the rest of that night and the whole next day.


Then there are the deaths when mixed with ephedrine and MDMA.


That's not counting the insufflated dosage deaths but if you peruse Erowid's trip reports on 2C-T-7 combinations with MAO-sensitive drugs didn't end nicely. I think we have more than ample evidence to call it an MAO inhibitor and advise caution.

Are we forgetting about HR? Because MXE has had some rather dangerous reactions with drugs that haven't killed people like your beloved 2C-T-7.


I really hope that your love for the drug isn't clouding the ability to see that there is potential for a reaction when you combine a drug like MXE that has even been tested to have mixtures that have MDPV along with the MXE with a drug that is known to cause fatalities when mixed with other drugs.


I respect you man, I always have. But harm reduction has to come first and both times I had 2C-T-7 involved nothing but alcohol with carefully measured doses and resulted in extremely intense experiences beyond what should have happened with that small amount of material and physical side effects that were alarming. This is a consistent theme with this drug. It tends to provoke toxic reactions in people. I would recommend that anyone take 2C-T-2 and puke and shit their brains out at the start of the trip than mess with 2C-T-7 combinations.


On its own, 2C-T-7 is probably great. Although there are still a ton of reports of serious physical distress from oral dosage with a careful MAOI-free diet.


And then knowing the intensity of this drug, recommending a combo to someone who has no experience with the drug is just asinine.

Yeah, I've read the reports too, well the ones where mdma was combined with 2C-T-7, and the other death from someone who insufflated a couple doses.  It sounds scary, but I mean even a 80mg dose of 2C-P could mean death too.  Caution is far and away #1 with substances like these.  I don't insufflate anything, but I'm curious as to why it can be deadly on that ROA for 2C-T-7.


Then again, I guess any ROA can be deadly to a uncommonly susceptible user, or if they take too large of a dose, for any substance...


Hmm, so it's generally recognized as a strong MAOI.  If one takes this orally without combinations, it still seems to be dangerous.  I was wondering what else makes this chem so different from the others?  There's just something about 2C-T-7 that has always intrigued me.  I've looked up a lot of info on this in the past, but the only thing I remembered finding was that a large dose could be deadly, and that the threshold varied quite a bit which made it even trickier.  Thanks for the MAOI heads up, any and all info is appreciated by this sponge.


I don't want to say, is that it?  But if that's it, then if or when I get around to this I'll just start at 1-5mg.  I hope being that cautious and working up in those increments would be foolproof.

Waste of material.


If you don't have something that is MAO reactive in you and you are careful, as you appear to be, 12mg should be a rolling ++ - but here's the thing... could be sensitive like me where 12mg is a very very very strong +++ that lasts around 7 hours.


Compared to any other drug... that I've taken... its the closest to mescaline... but with visuals that are in the middle of DMT and salvia... Its good fucking shit... but its scary too. Its one of the few drugs that I would never do again but I think everyone should experience once. I'd rather have DPT because my diet is full of tyramine and my chemicals back then were full of primary amines (the target for MAO-A)... but if you're smart, this is one very powerful and very spiritual drug. It doesn't touch mescaline... but it comes closer than anything other than 2C-T-2 at around 35-40mg which will cause nausea, vomiting, puking, and diarrhea... but when that shit flies out your ass you'll be somewhere other than the bathroom... at least in your mind.


And if you like shoving shit up your nose, DPT is almost always a +++ experience. If you can get over the heart... which goes to 140-160 tachycardia... which is still safe... I found out from the doc the other day that 250 in a limited time is safe. SoI guess I feel different about danger...

i dunno. Never really tried snorting psychs much. Just seems weird. Am a huge fan of plugging everything though. Dpt + mxe plugged was 


like some kind of sensual, tremmor filled, feeling of some crazy dark shit lurkng right around the corner and it wasn't sure it was going to play nice. 


will likely end up getting some 2ct-7 sometime soonish. I'm sure I will report back if I do.

I respect you greatly and I am all for harm reduction but there is no evidence for 2C-T-7 being an strong MAOI.  That is not to diminish the fact that it is unpredictable and potentially far more dangerous than 2C-B or even 2C-E.  THat said, I think it best that we stick with the facts.

Okay, lol, yeah I'm pretty cautious with new substances.  I've read horror stories of 2C-P, so when I started with that I took a 15mg capsule apart and eyeballed a third of it.  But I didn't feel anything.  I took the other ~10mg the next day, and barely felt it.  On the next weekend, I took a whole 15mg capsule and it tore me a new one.  I was tripping so hard, and I had diarrhea several times, but damn it was really fun and trippy.  It was a very unique and long lasting trip, and that was the last substance I took before I went clean for over 2 years.


But I went up by ~5mg increments.  The 2C-P was in crystallized form, and I've read that it had a steep dose response curve, so I was too scared in jump in at 15mg.  It was probably a waste of material, but hey, it's better than dying or getting hospitalized.


Yeah, I just don't know if or when I'll come across T7.  It's rare and scheduled here, and usually I like to get those kinds of chems from others, rather than on my own.


And no, I'd never insufflate anything.  When my allergies kick in, it probably wouldn't make it through anyway.  Haha.  And I don't want to put added stress on my nose as it is.  Thanks for the tips and info though.  I'm hoping I can try mescaline around Christmas time.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

pretty awesome IIRC. It's been two and a half years or so, my memory is a bit spotty. I had a small amount, and was trying to vape the hcl w/ a meth pipe. Was not working well. Decided to plug it. I am pretty sure I mixed it with mxe. I think dosed around 30-40mg, then maybe redosed the same amount....?


I just remember rolling around on my bedroom floor. "sensual" is the best word to describe it. Felt like something sinister lurking in the shadows (who knows if that is just due to reading a bunch of trip reports saying the same shit though), but never really appearing. Felt some crazy tremors. It seems a lot of people say "tremors" like it is a bad thing, I recall really enjoying it, but no real specific memories :-(


I am not sure if that was a "real" dpt experience. Didn't "go" anywhere, didn't lose sense of where or who I was. Have a gram on the way though. Will definatly be plugging it again. Will be posting back in the next week or two! Have some dmt comming too, and just got some mxe. must... take... all ... drugs... experience... non experience!

2C-T-7 has never been proven in any way to be an MAOI but the suspicion was raised as a way to explain its ability to cause fatalities in a way that others in the class have not.


If it is an MAOI it doesn't appear to be a *very* strong one but it is certainly worth exercising caution. I would be comfortable mixing MXE and 2C-T-7 at moderate doses or on the comedown of one another but as mentioned, I  would tread carefully.

Isn't a large dose on any of the 2C-Xs potentially deadly though?  I feel as though the 2C-T-7 deaths were more sensationalized by the media than the others.  I think the law of averages would infer that in a large sample of users, a few have probably died from taking too much of the other 2Cs as well.


I have no clue whether this substance is an MAOI or not.  Since it's suspected but not proven, I'd rather not be the guinea pig to find out.  I mean, we all take risks doing some of this stuff, but I'd rather take calculated risks than jump into the unknown.


Then again, almost everything is a risk.  Ahh, whatever.

On the contrary, it is precisely because the other 2C's have caused so few deaths that the 2C-T class comes with such warnings. People have reported "easily" surviving 10x doses of 2C-E, B and I think I.

It's true, people have taken very large doses, comparable or greater than those of the 2C-T-7 deaths, of many of the other 2C-Xs and had very intense trips but were fine, even 2C-I which is quite stimulating.  It seems the 2C-Ts, 2C-T-7 anyway, have a lower threshold for serious consequences.

Does this mean I don't have to be as careful with 2C-I?  Depending on my mood, I like to enjoy some intense trips.  I don't have much of it left either.

Too much 2C-I will have you so stimulated that you're running around the block for 30 minutes come home and still can't sit still. I've never been more stimulated than I was from high dose 2C-I

Haha, okay.  I remember Xorkoth recommending 16-18mg.  That was a nice, recreational dose.  After what you said, I think I'll just raise it to 25mg at most.  It certainly was stimulating, more so than other stims I've tried.

I 2nd this.  The annoying stimulation with 2C-I is a reason it quickly fell to the wayside compared to some of the other 2C analogues.  16mg at most for me, but then I'd just rather take 2C-B or C.

Oh, I kind of liked the stimulation, but idk I guess I'm just weird like that.


I think 2C-T-7 is a rare and exotic rc.  The trip sounds so intense and I've literally never seen or heard of it being around, ever.  I know people who have heard about it, but no one I've known has ever taken it.

2CT-2 felt much safer to me as well. Despite some possible nausea and so on.

2C-I felt pretty shallow and a bit plastic, think all that might have been ok if it were enjoyable but the stimulation was so uncomfortable it just wasn't workable same as 2C-T-7 which just didn't sit right.

I have never taken 2C-I above 22mg, and at that dose it was uncomfortable.  2C-I has this sort of psychotic kind of feeling to it for me... I wouldn't call it fully psychedelic, though it certainly alters your mindstate significantly.  I have never really gotten anything useful from it but it can be fun and quite visual.  Incidentally, I combined it with MXE once, a 14mg dose which I expected to just provide some fun and stimulation for the MXE, and instead what happened was an intense synergy, it was probably the strongest 2C-I trip I have ever had but it was also totally MXE in nature... they combined into something new which was fun but also very chaotic and a bit unsettling at first.  I felt like I was insane for the first half which was pretty fun but that was why it was unsettling as well.  It also started coming up at 15 minutes and reached a peak by an hour which is very fast for 2C-I.  Very strong synergy.  The same is not true for 2C-T-7... it did not seem to synergize with MXE at all, they were both just present.  It was a good trip but nothing unique.  The 2C-I combo was unique.


My dosages were 25mg of MXE and 14mg of 2C-I, both oral.  I took the MXE and then when it was affecting me, 45 minutes later, I took the 2C-I.  I find that's the best order for MXE combos, all the ones I've tried anyway (and I've tried a good few of them).

Yeah there was no exaggeration about the  block thing either... And I'm not a runner... The trip itself was not worth the bodyload. It was 25mg according to my scale. 2C-I went great with 4-subs though, they mellowed the stimulation and added the color and mental headspace 2C-I was missing. 


We actually discovered something interesting in our group... 2C-I was liked more by the females and 2C-E by the males. Was an interesting discovery and the females didn't appear to get stimulated anywhere near as much as the males at the same dose of 2C-I but they all reported disliking the bodyload of 2C-E enough to not want to do it again.

Yehh, I actually like 2C-I quite a bit.  It's my first real 2C besides 2C-P, but from my limited knowledge 2C-P is supposedly very different from the others.  I remember it well, but I don't have any experience to compare it to other 2Cs.  Except 2C-I, and they were indeed different in basically all aspects from each other.


But since I didn't have much of the 2C-I since the start, I'm purposefully not taking it often; 3-4 times a year at most.  I also wanted to save it for combos too.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

My first run in with 2c-i was also a bit meh, definitely very stimulating, and not a manageable stimulation like LSD. I also wouldn't call it fully psychedelic, but that's just been my experience as I know some people have deep trips with the stuff. What kept me coming back though was the visuals, they're just so structured and mathmaticaly geometric, absolutely beautiful! It also has a nice bright, warm colored theme for me which is a huge preference that I find makes for a more comforting trip. Out of the 2c's I've tried, this one had the most attractive visuals by far. 2c-e has some appealing visuals as well, but the substance is so deep that the visuals are a mere background with the mental insanity taking the forefront.


Anyways, my second and most recent run in with 2c-i was absolutely phenomenal, it definitely had all the aspects of a 2c-i trip, but the overstimulation and muscle tension were essentially non existent. I had about 3 trips with this batch so it wasn't a "one off". When I added medium doses of kratom on the third trip, it was completely without side effects and the body high was just so amazing, almost on par with a monoamine releaser. This bumped the substance into my top 10, possibly even top 5. My only complaint, like 2c-c, is I need rediculous doses to get a decent trip... like huge doses ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif). People should use this substance with caution though, as it seems to have a tendency to cause residual visuals lasting up to months when used twice in a row ime, and there are several reports of others experiencing the same. Haha anyways,  I just realized this isn't even the 2c-i  thread so forgive me ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

2C-I does have very mathematically structured visuals, you're right.  It really is pretty beautiful visually.  I've had some relatively profound moments on it, and actually one really intense group contact/shared high from it (without anyone knowing I was on it) that really tripped me out.  It's a good drug, it's actually a really unique headspace, not like any other psychedelic really.  I don't generally think of it as fully psychedelic though.  I really want to combine it with MXE again, that was a really cool trip.  There were christmas lights outside and they were all halo... but the halos were these beautifully intricate lattice formations, and they were sending brilliant beams of color into my eyes.

Done it 3 times - all the reports here I believe; it isn't the most exciting material out there but it does have something; doesn't have any rough speediness so that makes it preferable to 2C-I and 2CT-7 for me at least.

I was actually wondering about comparisons considering I have tried 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7 and 2C-T-21... just wondering how T-4 would be different. Seems relevant to 2C-T-7's qualities which by the way I find the absolute best of the bunch even if it is very unreliable fickle stuff dose-effect wise.


T-7 has enabled the best, personal and deepest but easiest talks of my life and besides that it feels very lush and rich, as if it has sophisticated character. It's less spiritual for me than mescaline but probably even warmer and more therapeutic than it.

T-2 came up a bit short for me. I had a lot of side effects but it did feel like it had worthwhile potential... I found it more gentle MDMA like in a way, pretty glowy but not quite as well-formed.

Anyone have any data regarding 2C-T-7 affinity for MAO-A?

Anyone with any personal experience?


I will be trying 2ct-7 sometime in the next week or three. Will most likely start with a test dose of 5-10mg plugged to get a feel and ramp up as warranted, most probably over two more doses. MXE or MXM (would mxm be better if we went with the OMG NOZ MAOI and serotonin train of thought or would it make a difference?) will almost definatly be included at some point.


Is there any reason DPT or 2c-b wouldn't mix with 2ct-7? These are the things I have access too, and once I start tripping sometimes I start mixing ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Having tried all 3 separately; dpt, 2c-b and 2ct-7 I reckon that dpt would be the more interesting one to mix w 2ct-7. Can't say why, mostly a hunch. Maybe because they have less overlap in effects, so more chance for interesting synergy.

For your safety I would try 2ct-7 on its own, I wouldn't mix it with anything to begin with, I've had some really strange reactions to this drug, the dose response curve is really strange, DO NOT SNORT THIS!


When u get used to it maybe a bump of mxe but not much, no point with 2cb.. dpt sounds interesting mix, be careful with this stuff

I am still fascinated by this one.  It's one of those I'd love to try, but probably won't ever.  Same goes with Bromo D Fly, heroin, dmt, coke, k, etc.


It's fascinating, but put me to the task of doing it, and I'll decline.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) There are just some things I won't do or take risks for.


But then I'll take risks for other chems.  Yeah, makes a lot of sense...plus I drew a line more than a decade ago to not ever insufflate or IV/IM anything.


Anyway, I'm interested in hearing about this one as of late.  As always, stay safe.

Tool this last night at a pretty hefty combined dosage over the night. With a good amount of mxe...All was well,.adventures in weird 2ct- 7 land. Probably close to 75 mg 2ct 7 pluggedand  150+ mxe. 2ct 7 was just weird. Like it was there, but Ai almost felt sober off and on... Until O added the dpt t+6 hrs or so. It was like "oh I've just been chilln dormant, now for the immersive clusterfuck of non reality you've been fiending


Decded to dose 50mg dpt and top it off with mxe... Catapulted straight into the most immersive outlandish Dpt I can imagine. Managed to hold on for a bit until the only piece of reality left was the etizolam dropper bottle I had begun clutching in my hand. Took I don't know how many mgs, perhaps closer to 10 than 2 based  on dropper level this morning... Still had to ride out insanity for a bit. A few years Ag I would have been toast. Just sat there chanting "aum" on my mind as something to hold onto while being thrown about by non ordinary reality...


It's funny I wake up and immediately thought ,"FUCK! I have to do that again but dose a little lower all around BC that was some fucking interesting shit!!! I was all good until I reached a place.where.I was told I could get off and leave this life behind. Abandon ship so to speak, and let someone else take over... Fuck

 most DMT like dpt trip ever.


Felt like I went through worlds where souls/whatnot are lost BC of suicides... Other fucked up things like that. Like I had gone so.far out I could choose which version of reality O could come.back too. Which was interesting at first.but started to freak me out. Toooo much information and not enough processing ability. Could only put on headphones of my "safety" music, start puttin etiz drops under tongue, sitting meditating refusing to move BC who knows where I would have ended up, and holding onto that thought of the one word.that creates the flow of all realities...


And fuck I can't wait to do it again... Wtf is wrong with me?

Sounds pretty amazing honestly.  Certainly unnerving though.  I'm not sure anything is wrong with you. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I've had trips where I was sure at the time I could have chosen to exit, or that I could change the reality I would exist in from then on, and I hope to have those experiences again.  Not too often of course.

i have always really wanted to to try T7, T2, T21. i really like the 2C's i have tried, specifically 2C-B. its been years since ive had any, barring 25i. 


i dont want to break any rules here (mods feel free to snip this is if i break any)--but is this stuff still around? only from the grey market?

Wow, 75mg??


Isn't a threshold dose around 12-15mg?


And I thought my tolerance was high.  =O


Good thing you're all safe and sound at that dose.

T7 has a hugely variable dose-response curve for people, moreso than almost anything else.  I remember morninggloryseed would always talk about how he needs 70+mg to get a full trip.  But then there are others who trip balls at even 20mg.  Personally 35mg for me didn't even produce visuals, I felt I could have taken a lot more.

Ah, I see.  Yeah, that just makes me scared to try it even more.  I've always wanted to try this one, but I just have a hunch that I might react badly to it.


lol, that's funny because some of the reports on Erowid are what got me interested in the first place, and I believe I read one of his.  This was during my very early 20's too, when I think it wasn't made illegal yet or it just barely was.


Fascinating stuff though.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

yah, it was one wild ride. I wrote that post on my phone immediatly upon waking up while it was fresh in my mind. Still in a tiz haze with a bit of psychedelic hangover. Need edit OP from "sum" to "aum" though... lol. 


last thing I knew i was meditating trying to hold on (maybe I shoulde have let go ;-) )and then I wake up in my bed.


I dunno.. I've taken 50mg dpt. Even taken like 150-175 mixed with some mdma and no fucks were given.


This was soooooooooo intense. As much as I fantasize about death/suicide, leaving this world behind, it scared the shit out of me feeling like I acually had the option to just get up and switch out with someone... I fucking love DPT. She's a trickster, lots to teach, but will fuck you over sideways and run cackling away with glee... jeebus christ allmighty.


The 2ct-7 absolutely refused to dissolve in water. I didn't apply any hot bath though. I wonder if using PG would work better? I guess i should ask that in the big n dandy plugging thread. It was definatly 2ct-7 though. I have a notoriously high tolerance sometimes sooo.


My dosing schedule was 

t- 0 - 15mg 2ct-7

t-130 - 27 mg 2ct-7

t-310 - 30mg 2ct-7

t-530 50mg dpt


I find that with plugging, and especially mixing chems, I don't really run into immediate tolerance. I like to start out low, testing the waters, and ramp up dose from there. Always works really well for me. 

each one of those redoses had varying amounts of mxe. I mean it was a really good trip... That 50mg dpt just hit iike a train. I did well for a while, much better than I would have years ago, it was just getting to the point where I might have ended up doing something physically dangerous, due in no small part to the manic high dose of mxe, so I started to take the etiz....


I dunno. k1159 or whatever. Don't be scared, you only live once... until you die and live again. 


also, I need to edit my original post and put "aum" instead of sum. That has really started to focus me and save me from fucked up tangents. Just centering, chanting aum, giving permission for those that love and want to help me to stay and do so, and for all others to leave my presence. Who knows how much it works, but my intentions are getting stronger each time.


I think the next 2ct-7 I will start with 40mg plugged and see what happens.


Also, I have sone unfinished buisness with 2c-e. Questions I need answered from "difficult" experiences, so that one is up next as well. And that DPT, scares me to the bone, but limitless potential for exploration. Combininb DPT with some MDMA is a superb combo IMO. Can dose high and lose completely the fear, face what is to face....

I really wanna try this and 2C-T-2 so I can experience the rest of the magical half dozen. Still need to try 2C-E and DOM but I can actually get those / have them in my stash.

T-7 does have an exceptionally variable dose-response curve -- some people get hammered with 20mg (or less), and some require at least double that amount. For me, 30mg is a very solid +++. Meanwhile, 25mg is almost disappointingly moderate, while 35mg is borderline "too much". In order to reach an altered state comparable to what I get out of 30mg, MGS would take 50mg (not 70mg or more). Incidentally, he probably would require less these days because his sensitivity to psychedelics has increased over time -- I bet that he'd be good with 30-35mg.

Ah ha @ yepyepwoah.  Those are actually my initials and 5 is my fave number.  Then I just added the 1 and 9 after because 5 is directly in the middle (not counting zero).


My secret code to represent two extremes, but most importantly it starts with calmness and serenity in the middle.  =P


Nice report, btw.  I'm still scared to try it though.  I reaaaally think I would have a bad reaction, but it isn't based on rationality.  Just my instincts.

Don't be scared of T-7. As long as you don't insufflate and/or combine it, you should be fine. Some combinations are less risky, but it's still best to avoid them.

Looking into acquiring some 2C-T-7 in the near future, seems like a very interesting substance, and I definitely want to see firsthand why it's at the top of shulgins list. 

It sounds like I want to start trials around 15-20mg to assess my sensitivity to this compound, is that about right?

I think I would dose ~40-45mg plugged plus 80mg mxe next time all at once. It was weird... like I knew I was tripping, but was almost clear headed... but then it wasn't. Have taken I, E, C, B, and out of all of them t-7 was the strangest one to me so far. 


I am not sure I would add DPT again...well i would, but holy fuck was that scary.

Be careful, it's considered dangerous to mix mxe and 2c-t-7, especially at those doses.

Do be careful, I will say though that I did it and didn't experience any particular synergy or worrisome effects whatsoever.  Now 2C-I and MXE... lots of synergy, with 14mg of 2C-I (a pretty low to low-moderate dose for me) while I was on 25mg of MXE producing a VERY strong and wild trip.


I find the greatest synergies that happen with MXE are when you are already on MXE and take a psychedelic, not the other way around.  Like taking the psychedelic 30-45 minutes into MXE.

I tried it 2c-t-7 last night for the first time at 35 mg... and i thought 2c-e was amazing at 20 mgs... this stuff is great! 

I have a new favorite here with t7.. I see why Alexander Shulgin loved this so much... It feels good, great visuals no body load for me.. took it a 7:30 pm, lasted until 4 am, until i took 1 mg of Xanax to fall asleep...

What is generally considered a dangerous dose of this one?  Just curious since a friend has a bit of this, but I'm not sure if I want to try it or not.  There's so much stuff I want to do but so little time for them, tolerance and safety-wise.  If anything, I might want to blast off into sobriety in December permanently after trying 2C-T-7.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Also, is it safe to re-dose and if so, by when?  Because with the way I am, I'll start low and try to work my way up.  Though I don't know how effective that might be, I feel like I have to because I'm insensitive to some substances but super sensitive with others.  I'm not that daring when it comes to substances.  


I could ask my friend, but you know...sshh, I trust BLers more on stuff like this.  And then I'll secretly compare his answer to the ones on here afterwards.  ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


Thanks.  But if no one answers, I'll stop being lazy and go searching around here.

The thing about T-7 is that everyone is different, even moreso than with most other drugs.  I've heard reports of people finding 15mg orally to be very strong, and for others, 50mg is a strong dose.  For me, I have never found a strong dose, and I took up to 42mg... I took 35mg within the past 6 months sometime an it was quite mild.  You'll probably have to work up a bit but I'd say 20mg is probably safe, after an allergy test.  Likely you'll need more but better safe than sorry.

Ah, I see.  I was too lazy at that moment to sift through the thread, so thanks once again Xorkoth.  I'll simply remember to take an allergy dose and then take 20mg.


Cool that you took it pretty recently.  I certainly have high hopes for this one!  And of course, if it happens to be too weak/strong, I'm 100% accountable for it, but you're 100% accountable for it if it turns out to be a good dose.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have some T-7 saved on the long-term space. Still it's one I would like to try as soon as I have the opportunity. I was checking the vial and it has a very slight pink tone. The material was analytically confirmed years ago. Does anybody experience the same?

Was it the same tint back then? Even very minute traces of an impurity can add a lot of discoloration so it really is not much to go on. Also in the synthesis in PIHKAL you can read various reagents and intermediates being described as wine-colored, orange, brown... if any of that was still hanging around that could account for it?


Phens like this are theoretically supposed to be very stable and to outlive us all... still, I would recommend not storing them in solution, and if they are contaminated with just the wrong reactive substances over time degradation reactions may still happen. But it is more tryptamines for example that can be terribly sensitive to a trace of an acid plus any water / moisture present.

It is stored as powder, on an amber vial, sealed. The vial is inside a bigger container, and this container inside the no-frost freezer.


Maybe I did not notice it on first instance, I guess it came like this.


It looks to be one of the intermediates you mention. What's weird on all this is that it was sent to GC/MS and the result was 2C-T-7, nothing more. Maybe the amount of intermediate in comparison with the chemical is ridiculous and they did not detect it? Should I send it to the lab again before testing it, I guess?


The "claret" color seems to be matching with what I am seeing...

There were a few deaths due to [insufflation of 2C-T-7](https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2ct7/2ct7_death1.shtml)

Also from combinations due to it being a MAOI.


Either way, miss this one..for me it was very sleek and easy going if I remember correctly slightly more psychedelic and more interesting than 2C-T-2, which was very functional in it's own way. Both were available around the same time here.

I hope it's alright to ask this question in this thread.


So I've had a bit of hot-7 for about a year or so now. I do believe it to be HOT-7 based on the effects and dosage required. Does anybody have any predictions on how much of it may have turned to 2CT7? I hope to do it again soon whichever one it is. I just want to know what I'm taking

I thought I remembered hearing that the supposed HOT-7 was actually 2C-T-2... I could be wrong on that though, it's been a long time.  I do remember for sure that some batch of HOT-7 was determined not to be HOT-7 though.

2CT2 is one of my favorite psychs. The HOT7 that I got around 3 hours to kick in except for once where it was fairly strong 90 minutes in. I did acquire it a couple different times, but always from the same vendor. Not sure why the inconsistencies but that's a big thing to keep in mind. I got almost no visuals, and the effects were about the same strength at 55mg as 40mg.


I'll just have to try it again to get a better idea of what it really is or if it's made the conversion yet

Finally got around to giving this one a go at 20mg, wound up puking a fair bit more than I had anticipated. Never reached a satisfying level of visuals at that dose either, although there was one moment while I was smoking some weed for the nausea where I let my eyes relax and this led to the image in my fovea being replicated kaleidoscopically across my entire field of vision, so that was pretty cool.  

Cool effect, but I'm not sure if it's worth pushing the dosage on this one for me. I had a similar reaction when testing 2C-P, all puke and not much else. Seems like 2C-T-7 is just a sulfur atom away from that one, too. Given that I've had good experiences with 2C-E, will this predict good times with 2C-T-2? Still have to get my hands on that one and find some time to try it out. 

I'm wondering whether I'll be better off seeking out some 2C-T-2 or attempting a higher dose of 2C-T-7 along with some ondansetron. Any thoughts?

I honestly think this chemical is very unpredictable, I had really good trips from 30mg but found 27 once a bit too much, stay safe, I'd probably give it another go but give 2ct2 a thought, I really loved 2ct-21!

How did you take this? If you tried eating it, do it rectally or vaginally next time. 25 up the bum should get you good. Never eat psychedelics.

Once again I firmly disagree with the sentiment that one should never eat psychedelics... that's ludicrous.  It's true that generally it takes more material but it's also the safest route, and for me it tends to produce the most desirable effects profile, unless it's a substance that produces a lot of bodyload.  Rectal and vaginal dosing are perfectly valid routes of administration but so is oral.

heh, you got that right!  37mg the other day was about the strongest trip I have had in years...flirting with ++++ at times.  35 would have been just fine, and 30mg for a more social/museum level thing.


I was a lot more out there 15 years ago when I'd take 50mg-60mg.  I suppose also a lot younger.  I am not sure I'd ever take 50mg again at this point in my life but it sure was amazing!  ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

DPT mixes BEAUTIFULLY with T2 and T7.  Just keep the DPT dose LOW (10mg-30mg) and it is a wonderful combo...take the DPT well after the peak of the T7.

I actually ended up taking DPT the night I tried the 2ct 7. I posted about it somewhere on here. It turned a "meh" 2ct 7 trip into "holy fuck I am in purgatory with people who have suicided and would give anything to go back" trip. Fucking DPT. I've gone through about a gram this past year. Exquisitely beautiful and terrifying. Better have your mind right with this one or it will take you on a ride you just might not like. Worth the risk though, I call DPT "mama", it feels like a straight connection to the female half of the divine, but YMMV.


I think the 2ct 7 I got was really impure. I have had 2c b/d/c/e/i and they all have the same basic appearance, this t-7 did not.

2C-T-7 Is one of the most unreliable psychedelics I have taken in terms of potency. The metabolism is supposed to be very complex and important in its action and it is hard to say what factors contribute. I would do no ROA but oral personally, it's way too sketchy otherwise.


Mine has had flakey appearance if not just powdery. As always, appearance says little.


I like it the best of all 2C's though, one of the best psychedelics for me: very rich and lush. I also never got much side-effects, but I did with 2C-T-2.

It really is *that* good but actually not for everyone.  I've shared it with at least two or three people that found it lacking compared to say 2c-E.  It is not just the dosage that is inconstant about 2C-T-7...the drug itself is inconsistent depending upon who eats it.

I didn't find it to be too special personally, despite the rosy adjectives I use to describe it. It felt a bit hedonistic and pointless, and then it seems to have a bit of a hangover, nothing major, but I felt just a tiny bit dirty after. 


However, I never found a good strong dose for myself before I ran out of material. Maybe my opinion would change if I had a full-on experience with it. I do kind of think I need to give more of a chance. I'm also not so thrilled by 2C-B, which a lot of people love, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.


edit: funny you wrote that MGS ^ while I was still typing. "lacking compared to 2C-E" is exactly one of the things I thought about it, and I almost wrote something along those lines.

*Sorry for posting twice, I tried to edit my first post and it accidentally got deleted*


Yeah, I'd definitely say oral has always been the best roa for psychedelics for me, in terms of effect profile. Plugging certainly can mitigate body load but didn't help with vomiting for me. 2C-P plugged was just awful. 

I'll probably try adjusting dosage and taking ondansetron. Do we know whether t-7 is very active at 5-ht3?

Perhaps it is a personal thing or a setting thing, but for me T-7 was very therapeutic both major times I used it when I got a full trip. (So not counting the 3-4 times I slowly titrated my dosage range) Definitely one of the deepest and most intimate conversations I have ever had in my life. With one of those times my best friend and I ran out so added a little 2C-B to top off for a +++ which worked well. There was also nitrous and perhaps GHB or weed used in one of those sittings but I would not combine it with other things than those. We surely enjoyed it, so was recreational on the side but not just that which can feel pointless like 2C-I for me.


Also with 2C-T-2 I felt the therapeutic potential the only time I tried it, but it was not fully developed and there was no one that I shared it with, also was overshadowed with nausea and GI issues that I did not get with 2C-T-7. Hard to say what contributes, 5-HT3 may explain at least part of it, or metabolites may act on 5HT3, but your exact enzyme activity and bowel contents may all play a role in how bad those compounds may cause side-effects. No idea if eating well no more or less than ~2 hours before dosing may help somewhat reliably, someone would need to test that. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


2C-T-7 itself is not listed here for 5HT3 but no psychedelics appear to be:

Also note that 2C-T-7 has an affinity for 5HT2C that is even higher than for 5HT2A:

I can echo the last couple posts that have been made here about T-7.


It's unpredictable as to dose and effect.  But it's one of my all time favorites.  30 mgs has been tame, and paradoxically, one time me and a friend did 15 mgs each and spent 4-5 hours writhing in ecstasy like we were candy flipping on 300 mgs of mdma and 3 hits of excellent acid, without a hint or paranoia or body load.


One time, I took 25 mgs and was chilling with my sober room mate.  I felt more or less 100% clear headed, except I had alternating bouts of nausea and orgasmic body load.  He was watching TV and I recall seeing football players on the TV that were so utterly mixed up and melting and morphing out of the TV screen that I was sitting in the chair next to him completely calm and put together but also totally floored by the intensity of the visuals.


I've mixed ketamine into the tail end of t-7 trips twice to great success. 


However, I know my body well, I know t-7 well, and I know keytamine well. This is a drug I never share with naive individuals, and certainly don't recommend mixing with anything.


If you're going to be reckless like me, my advice would be this:  if you do mix t-7 with anything, stick to low doses and substances you are intimately familiar with.  And don't mix peaks.  2c-t-7 is so rich and complex all by itself.  


Wait til the tail end of the trip.  Then a few beers, or a joint, or a couple little bumps of k, or a tiny bit of ghb is absolutely heavenly.


But really, from all the experience reports, deep down I always feel like drug combos with 2c-t-7 is kinda playing with fire.  TREAD CAREFULLY

There is a big difference between titrating oral dosage and insufflating or eyeballing this compound. It is just not forgiving. And it affects serotonergic function in ways that are poorly understood leading to unusual interactions and reactions - sometimes compared to MAOI but unfortunately it really may not be that simple. But the nausea and body temperature differences can be explained by relations to serotonergic function.


It's the bees knees if you 1) understand what is safer vs. unsafer use 2) have e.g. a scale to do this, or the discipline to avoid say monoamine releasers or reuptake inhibitors, and 3) have a bit of luck with your reaction.


It's terrible if you both have a strong reaction AND are careless.


But I don't know of fatal or dangerous reactions from back when it was sold legally in smartshops here in the Netherlands, as pills with a lot of breaking scores.

Yeah 2C-T-7 was extremely popular for a while pre 2001 web-tryp (and was one of the reasons RCs got a lot of negative attention).  The compound itself has the potential to be far more dangerous than most, and of course loads of people were snorting it and mixing it with MDMA, both of which hugely exacerbate the dangers/  hence the number of negative trip reports.  That, and it can cause a lot of nausea.

A consistent theme you will find is that nearly all of these negative reports involve people who did not weigh their dose of T7 out with a milligram scale, and proceeded to snort their eyeballed dosage.


I snorted the drug twice in my early days and it's literally a different substance when you snort it...and a horrible one at that.


Carefully weighed oral dosages are a different matter....not that I'd recommend using it to anyone.

Somehow 2C-T-7 seems right for the christmas season, not sure why.


We're not supposed to discuss legal matters on here, but for some reason this seems to be sliding all over the place here lately. It's not banned in Canada afaik. But you need to do your own research on this, I'm not a lawyer so that isn't legal advice.

When people say sensitive reactions, is this only with other routes than oral? I've less than 100mg of this and fairly experienced with a number of psychedelics so was thinking of just dosing 30-35mg oral.

Just diving in for the expected medium to full effects may be something you can do with forgiving compounds, only risking getting overwhelmed, but if you have 100 mg then you have enough to at least do *some* titration building up to a full dose. I'd take a little less first, maybe even 2 increments... do some economic calculation, if you want 2 good full trips at 30-35 maybe reserve 70 for that and use the other 30 to go: 10-20...


Severe health problems from other ROA ODs or combinations are not the only concern... people have also gone delirious at ~40 mg or so I think just like others have at 100+ to 200 mg 2C-B which is more forgiving having a more consistent reaction usually and a less steep and weird (multi variable?) dose-response curve. The responses are just unpredictable and can vary from trip to trip even in the same individual. Experience has little to do with it.


Watch out for interactions, use it sensibly and it should be alright ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Hope you have good journeys on it!

I finally got my hands on some! Subscribing to this thread so I can keep up with the convo. Not sure when I'll have the opportunity to try this. 


Do you guys prefer to take it alone or with others? Good for events or best done in a private setting?

Okay, so well over a year after acquiring it (wow, it's been that long?!) I finally tried this substance... accidentally. 


Two weeks ago I decided to day trip wth my friends, because it's been a while since I've had the opportunity to take psychedelics in a setting other than a festival/event. I capped out some mescaline extract, and also 30mg of 2C-T-7 in case the mesc was weak/bunk. I thought this would be a perfect, safe setting to try a new, potentially strong psychedelic. Well, the mescaline was lovely and I didn't feel the need to add the T-7. So it remained in my little pill box along with other misc drugs like an adderall and some tabs of L. I've been lazy lately about taking things out of the pill box so it's a fun assortment at the moment. 


Fast forward to this past weekend, I'm going to a festival and seeing some artists I really love. I ~don't~ want to trip because I have taken psychedelics the past two weekends. I decide 3-MeO-PCP would be perfect, so I cap out ~20mg (yes, I know this a lot but I'm very experienced and have a tolerance and/or a weak batch right now), and put it in my pill box. The T-7 is still in there, so I'm very mindful about which compartment I put it into. At this point in time, it's easy to know which is which (even though they look very similar) because of where I've placed them. 


A couple hours before I plan on dosing, some guy comes up asking if I have any extra tabs on me. As his luck would have it, I do, and take them out of my pill box for him. In doing so I kind of knock it over and a bunch of the stuff inside comes out. I put everything back in, focusing primarily on not losing anything. 


And then it's time to dose. I take out my pill box and... oh wait, that's right, everything got tossed around and nothing is in the right compartment anymore. I take out the two capsules, one being 3-MeO-PCP and the other 2C-T-7. I look at them long and hard. They look extremely similar. I decide the one that appears to have a little less is the 3-MeO. I put the pill box away and I'm about to eat it, when I think about how fluffy my current batch of 3-MeO is. I think, 20mg and 30mg would look almost the same in a capsule, so it's actually the fluffiness that would make it look like more! So I take the pill box back out, put the original capsule back in, take the other one out and eat it. 


Big mistake. 


Less than an hour later, I start to feel something in my stomach, which develops into nausea. I rarely get any sort of bodyload like that on 3-MeO. This makes me consider the possibility that I took the wrong capsule, but I don't want to accept it yet. It's not until I'm at a set, and trying to shout the lyrics along with the band makes me gag that I face the facts: I took the T-7 capsule. 

It's getting harder to talk to people as time goes on, and I'm really uncomfortable nauseous. There are so many times where I believe I'm going to vomit right there in the crowd. Thankfully I had not eaten for hours nor was I as hydrated at that moment as I should have been, so I wouldn't have thrown up much anyways. The rest of my body felt fine, but man was the nausea annoying. The feeling lingered for several hours after dosing. 

Once I got to the headliner, the set I was most excited to see, I was peaking. I was totally sucked into the music and could barely talk to my friends or even dance. At one point my friend points out that I'm standing there just holding onto my backpack straps as if for dear life. I turn down weed my friends are offering me because it feels entirely unnecessary. Everything is intense. The music sounds amazing, and the visuals are incredible, but I'm almost looking more forward to after the show, when I can explore the trip more without that stimulus. 


The visuals were super strong and beautiful. At one point I looked at my friend and it looked like there was body paint all over her body in intricate designs. I felt very inspired to paint what I was seeing. At another point during the set, it seemed like everything was suddenly going faster, like I was watching a video on fast forward. This was thankfully not for a long period of time. Everything I looked at was moving, but in a unique way that is different than LSD, shrooms, etc. and is difficult to describe.  


At the time I thought to describe my headspace as "medium". That is, not nearly as intensely emotional as something like shrooms/4-AcO-DMT, but a little less clearheaded than 2C-B. I'd say it is pretty close in headspace to 2C-E, where I similarly had trouble speaking to friends. I felt like the visuals were affecting my thoughts. It's like I watched something melting and my thoughts melted with it.


After the set, we had to wait for some friends and that felt like a lifetime. However, a friend of a friend (but a stranger to me) came and talked to us and I was able to participate in the conversation without too much difficulty. This was around 4 hours after dosing, I think I plateau'd around this point. However right before getting on the subway I had one of those moments where you laugh like a crazy person until you're crying, and then on the subway I struggled with feelings of not wanting to make eye contact with strangers or have them look at me at all. So the effects were still going pretty good. Thankfully I had plenty of friends to talk to and shield  me on the train from the masses ha. 


Once I got back to my apartment, I was no longer nauseous but definitely not hungry (all the rest of my friends proceeded to consume lots of food). Iced tea did taste more delicious than ever though. I was definitely highly amused by and engaged in the TV we put on: Off The Air, the latest Rick & Morty episode, and then lots of American Dad. Like I said earlier I was declining most weed offered to me, but once I was home and came down a little I accepted dabs from one of my friends. At this point the combo was lovely - it didn't really bring back the visuals, but it made me feel wonderfully heavy and calm. Unfortunately it didn't make me sleepy enough, because even at 10-11 hrs after dosing I struggled to sleep. Although my body was very tired I struggled to shut my mind down. At that point I still had closed eye visuals of the kaleidoscopic variety, and even though I really wanted to sleep it was fun to play around with trying to affect the CEVs with my thoughts, which I had some success with. 


I woke up the next day feeling really tired, but I attribute this more to three days of festivaling in the hot sun :~) 


Overall the experience was really fun despite not expecting or wanting it. It was definitely intense, but as an experienced psychonaut I was able to handle it relatively easily. I look forward to taking this in a much more controlled setting aka my apartment, where I can draw as much as I want and not worry about puking on people.

Nice!  Sounds like a cool trip.  I've had T-7 4 times, and I've never managed to get much in the way of visuals from it which is weird (and I am 100% sure it was T-7 too).  I've taken it up to 42mg which I found to feel a bit threatening and with a heavy bodyload.  I've always wanted to experience the classic T-7 super-visual trip.  I prefer 2C-T-2 from my experience, I find it very therapeutic, warm, insightful and good-humored, and also more potent/reliably dosed.

Yeah I had some t-7 a few yrs ago. And started orally  dosing it. But around the 25-30mg range I started to wonder  why effects were not there. So I decided to weigh  out 10mg and insufflate lil pin head sizes to see whats up. And sure enough lil  by lil  I got the appropriate  effects. Btw it burned like fire. So then I knew  I had something worth exploring.  So knowing fatal overdoses were official with this compound I slowly orally took the dose up higher and found out around   35-45mg orally was where the dose response  curve  went into play. All in all it was always very colorful and a worthwhile  trip. Those differences in metabolism  from person to person with 2c-t7 are interesting but dangerous  as well. Oral dose was sketchy but nasally it was straight forward.  Nothing  new but might give insight  to those who don't know about the dosing  of the 2ct7.it varies greatly from person to person.

It is, one of my favorites.  T-21 is cool too, not anything deep, but very recreational and euphoric.  I haven't tried T-4, a friend of mine had some, and I always meant to try it, but unfortunately his stash was confiscated. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Tried T-7 a couple of times. I've never really experienced nausea on psychedelics, but this one seemed to cause a fair bit. It would come in waves through the whole experience. There was some very nice euphoria and moments when I was laughing so much that I felt a bit dizzy. Also, music sounded incredible.


The whole experience seemed to bounce between energy and dissociation, dancing and nausea. The second time I had it, was for no real reason. It was Saturday morning, I was in the mood to trip and had the house to myself. My flatmate came home from work to find every radio and television in the house at full volume with all of the curtains drawn. I was sitting in the living room on a sun lounge wearing sunglasses and sipping a corona.


Not sure what happened there.


Glad I crossed it off the list, but I wouldn't do it again, mainly because of the nausea.. Also, light seemed to bother me a bit for some reason.

I read something about this being available in as the E isomer, instead of the Z isomer.


I have no idea what that means, and what result this would have on the effect of the drug, couldn't find anything on the internet too! Anyone has an idea? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Going to test the waters a bit more with a ~50mg oral dose tonight if it ends up being interesting I'll post a trip report ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Didn't have any luck with it on previous attempt at 35mg oral have some 2c-t-2 from the same source and it turned out to be a wonderful experience.

Man, really, good luck with that. 2C-T-7 can reportedly get VERY difficult physically. I think it'll be an interesting night either way. 


Didn't you feel anything on 35mg, slightly of baseline, a ++? Are you naturally tolerant to phenethylamines? I have some myself, but I haven't tried it yet.

With the 35 I felt like I was in a never ending come up, it felt like I was at the tip of a diving board about to be sent off to who knows where but nothing ever came of it. There was slight visual distortion but it was almost the opposite of what I would expect on a psychedelic everything was very still. For example I was on a porch on a farm and the wind was blowing, I could feel it but everything stayed static like there was no wind blowing. There was quite a heavy body load, my hands felt like they were covered in cob webs. I didn't throw up, I had dosed with another person and they threw up quite a bit, but overall was feeling the same effects as I did.


There was definitely something going on but nothing major because we did end up rolling around on the floor for a few hours listening to music lol


Weird tangent the persons farm we were tripping at was a friend of a friends and he was supposed to trip sit for us. He drove off for a while and came back spun off his tree stinking of meth, I didn't know he smoked meth. I try to stay away from that scene. Anyways he comes in saying we have to go says he will give me a ride home, so I hop in his car with him and his girlfriend. He ends up not taking me home and ends up taking me along in the back seat for his skip the dishes shift or whatever it was. So there I am at a definite +1, I guess with all the mental and bodily effects you could say a +2 but without any visuals. Being driven around delivering food with two tweakers doing whippets while they drive. At one point I asked for a whippet and his girlfriend turned around and snarled at me like an evil witch and refused to let me partake. I was fucking terrified about crashing but kind of just went along with it, it's quite a funny story I guess.


edit: This was with no tolerance

2C-T-7 is massively variable in individual response... some people trip hard on 20mg, an old friend of mine was not particularly a hardhead and liked to take 70mg.  For me, 35mg was like you describe, and 42mg one time was very strong but not the trip I have read about.  I prefer 2C-T-2, myself.

Maybe it was 2C-C nitrostyrene (an intermediate) I remember reading that somewhere - “Available as the E isomer, as opposed to the “z.”

t: 1:15: Already seems a lot more promising then last time +1


There is a somewhat uncomfortable feeling throughout my body and I'm feeling cold.


I always get the cold feeling after taking any 2c


I could definitely throw up if I wanted to, waiting until I really have to so more of it absorbs before I purge.


Slight breathing getting sucked into things more -- looking at a glass of water and watching the surface move to my vibrations on my desk from typing its quite mesmerizing

Feeling it come on more and more as I'm watching the water there are little circles on the outside of the glass and they're starting to move around.


Thought I'd be feeling worse my girlfriend dosed ~22mg of 2c-b


t: 1:25: if i just stare at the glass of water and don't blink i can see the glass becoming malleable distorting like a liquid


mild CEV's but nothing really taking shape just waving


Starting to see the desk move similar to the glass not the whole thing just parts like waves - objects themselves aren't becoming like that themselves but parts of them are it wants to draw my attention and give it a 3 dimensional spin

time is moving slowly but I'm  not sure if its the substance or just me -- lol funny thought there gave me a massive smile


Looking forward to throwing up but still waiting until i really have to -- had a sasauge and some pepperoni 6 or so hours ago and 2 bananas around lunch time


t: 1:50: think i might be in for a doozy -- much different then 2c-t-2 everything has a liquid like vibe too it the way I was transfixed on the water before -- the slight ripples I guess not quite waves but shrinking and growing to a definite flow


t 2: things are starting to have a static sort of vibe that's jiving with the liquid -- if I wasn't at home the body load would suck but just sitting around it isn't bad -- ofc as I'm thinking this i start to feel it a bit more in my fingers and limbs because my mind went in that direction


When I move the nausea is definitely there but just sitting still it isn't too bad anymore -- still definitely feel like i have to purge but not as badly as before -- At a medium ++


feeling bad ignoring my girlfriend but she says don't worry -- she thinks the cat is doing something funny playing or something and I look over and the cats nibbling her oatmeal cookie without her realizing lol


I have it my head that if i start throwing up it will be bad -- usually I don't mind to puke feel it a necessary cleanse.


words are starting to move on the screen -- but not in a confusing way -- everything just flows in and out like water-- I'm not sure if I'm being drawn to the water idea from my preconceived understanding of what would be happening.


Went out to the garage to get some frozen blueberries from the freezer I'm definitely pretty fucked not motor skills but typical in the dark is there someone there kind of sinister silliness


paranoia is silly I wonder why I have the preconceived instinct that someone might be there seems odd to me


Apparent tracers forming on my hands -- it isn't interactive yet -- maybe it will be, with 2c-p i love the little balls of energy that follow the tracers and disperse wondering if something similar will end up occuring.


t: 2:30: high +2 I want to smoke a joint but I'm being cautious with how much stronger it is then my first trial -- its funny I dont smoke weed when I'm sober because of this same anxiety ?? my thoughts definitely don't flow smoothly like 2c-t-2.


t: 2:45: Go to roll a joint, for fuck sakes cant find papers caused a massive curfuffle, flailing shit around the drawer, for fuck so much shit was in that drawer perfectly packed it didn't want to close


My mouth is very dry maybe slight jaw clenching ? going to smoke a bowl instead


t+3:30 forgetting everything I'm doing but in a very relaxed slow oh well this is better sort of feeling definite +++ the liquid like visuals are having sort of a glossy hue accross them, I'm looking at old movies on the far wall the glossy hue is making it so i  cant distinguish what they are but that glossy feeling is being applied to the liquid


got a jolly rancher to help with the jaw clenching


I feel great there is this overwhelming feeling of free -- like melting in the sun on lsd +++


t: 5:00: forced myself to piss had no desire to leave bed what so ever feels like a waste coming back to type. There are energetic feelings running up and down my back going with the liquidy feeling -- the visuals are nice but the feeling is the best part my body has done a full turn around from feeling heavy, nauseous -- Just basically shit to a reminiscent warm feeling in my upper body and shoulders that makes me feel comfortable and safe.


I can imagine it would be a terrible time to have a bad trip or have some sort of events go wrong because the feeling Isn't from the visuals everything is gentle, it's just I'm really fucking high, if some sort of serious event happened and I was alone I would most likely be panicking from how high I feel.


t 5:30: feels like I'm on ~400ug lsd visual wise but they don't melt they flow it just feels crisp and clean --   sex was great solid +++


Usually I find it hard to just lie down and keep my eyes closed for a while because the overstimulation makes me want to blink. Right now it feels warm  I could keep my eyes closed for long periods of time and just drift


I keep getting distracted and forgetting what I'm doing to a ridiculous degree. Girl friend had made a taco salad earlier, I always force myself to eat when I'm on things tastes good just my jaw is clenching makes it hard to chew


t 7:00: Have quite a bit of stomach pain I'm assuming this is coming from me being stubborn and not purging but it ends up just me being so high I'm forgetting to piss, feel a lot better after going to the bathroom strong +++


Slept at around t+10:00, If I hadn't been so tired from working I probably wouldn't have slept. I had around a 3 hour sleep, woke up feeling a little bit tired but can go about my day as usual. There were some mild CEV's still present when I woke up but have completely dissipated an hour or so later. There are minor OEV's the door on the other side of the room I'm in is still slightly flowing back and forth.


Overall I wasn't sure exactly what to expect, the visuals were nice but I did not expect how amazing my body would feel. Once I got through the first ~3 hours all negative body load went away and my entire body felt like it was filled with pulsating relaxing energy. There wasn't much geometry in the visuals, everything just flowed and stayed crisp and seemed to have a futuristic vibe to it.  The visuals were almost exactly like what you would expect from LSD in terms of complexity but they didn't melt they flowed. It was a very clean high.


The CEV's felt warm to look at and relaxed my eyes laid down for quite a few hours drifting around. The way the body high matched the visuals was something quite special and was my favorite part of the experience.


The way it just flowed up and down blanketing me in warmth making me feel free was sublime. It was almost an identical feeling of standing out in nature arms out, sun shining, wind blowing melting my worries away to a beautiful view on LSD feeling. The only difference being the flowing instead of melting.


The head space was very much like LSD as well except instead of being fast paced confusion it was a slow confusion, a much more stoned confusion. I looked in the mirror at one point and my eyes were saucers but not in a pinged sort of way in a very relaxed stoned sort of way.


I'm definitely going to do this again at the same dose. I think it would fair pretty well in a small gathering / festival type setting.

Warmth would be my number #1 description of 2C-T-7. Like taking a serotogenic bath. That warm body high is unreal for sex, had some very intense experiences to say the least!


To me it always felt like someone had turned 2C-B up a couple notches. Stronger visuals, much stronger body high/euphoria. I never found a strong "headspace", just a general mashed state of being. 


Glad you had a good experience. Im curious to try plugging to reduce dose, body load and come up. Figured 20mg ra would be good if I use 50mg po.

I've had T-7 a few times and really like it. Started to get visual around 25 mg for me and just slight nausea (only ETH-LAD has given me heavy nausea). I know there are big individual differences in dose-respons in different individuals and that some may trip hard on 10-15 mg and others may need 45-50 mg for a similar response. Some say that the responses to T-7 are very unpredictable and can vary from trip to trip even in the same individual. Have anyone who have had a lot of experience with T-7 noticed very big differences in response to taking the same dose? Wondering how common that is as I don't want to risk being overwhelmed in the wrong setting.

My one experience with this was...strange. I opted for plugging, because I knew the dose was wildly inconsistent. I titrated up slowly and carefully, because rectal isn't that different from intranasal dosing on paper and that's quite risky with this drug. Unlike 2C-T-2, this still took forever to comeup, develop, and evolve towards a peak; rectal dosing just didn't work well for titrating it. Also, I found my doses getting unsettlingly high, so I stopped lest I put myself at risk. In retrospect, I imagine what I did was fine, dividing those doses probably kept peak plasma levels down to reasonable levels and minimized side effects, but it was a hassle and led to a reeeeeally extended comeup period.


For a good chunk of that, I felt really monged out/muntered like I had taken MDMA, and eventually I got to some cognitive depth that was somewhere between the emotionality of mescaline and the psycholysis of 2C-E. All in all, I was not favorably impressed by it. That said, I was biased going into it. If something (a) has inconsistent dosing, and (b) has killed people that have overdosed [intranasally], then it's really going to have to knock my socks off to make me take it seriously. If I turned out to be a lightweight, I would have felt much better about it, I'm sure. If 10-20mg were a +++ for me, I would feel more comfortable exploring this material, but I seemed to be quite hardheaded to it. Bear in mind, I had a surprise +++ on 30mg of 2C-D, so needless to say I'm a bit uncomfortable when my 2C-T-7 oral dosage equivalent starts creeping up towards the heavy range, especially by a riskier ROA.


I keep thinking about revisiting it, but with so many other interesting and more valuable psychedelics that are far safer, it's probably not going to happen. It didn't have the cognitive or emotional richness of 2C-T-2, for instance, and the warmth felt more forced and empathogen-artificial than the 'scalines more wholesome vibe. Of course, everybody's different. Your mileage will definitely vary with this one, and I never gave it a proper shot

I'm still a bit unsure on how to dose this one. I only have one 35mg capsule of 2C-T-7 and I have never tried it before. I thought about starting with 22mg and redosing the remaining 13mg after a couple of hours, if needed.

What do you think?


My usual go-to doses for other 2C-x are - 2C-B HCl: 25mg / 2C-D HCl: 50mg / 2C-E HCl: 13mg

I'm in a similar boat.

Since it's so rare I'm biting the bullet either way, and whatever happens happens. It's hard to say, but for some 35mg is even too little for a full on trip, I won't take any risks. Obviously redosing should work quite well, but we all know that intended redose times are rarely as intended ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Yeah, I thought so too… Hm, maybe I'll bump it up to 25mg and do the 10mg 3-4 hours later (if it's necessary). Judging from my other 2C-x doses 35mg T-7 at once seems a bit much, especially in terms of the bodyload.

2C-T-7 seems to have the most variable dosage needed per individual of almost any psychedelic.  I know people who will take 15mg and find it plenty, and I have known a guy who needed 70mg to properly trip.  Personally I find it finicky, I have taken 35mg and had it be underwhelming, then the next time I took 42mg and it was too physical.  I have ever managed to get the  classic 2C-T-7 trip people describe.  It just doesn't seem to agree with me.  I vastly prefer 2C-T-2.

I'm with Xorkoth. I'm an average to lightweight with most psychedelics, and hardheaded to less than a handful. Unfortunately, one of those seems to be 2C-T-7. I've never been able to have a proper experience with it, because I'm just not willing to commit to a high enough oral dose. My usual workaround of titrating up slowly with insufflated or rectal dosing is even less appealing with 2C-T-7, because of the safety issues around it. Fortunately for me, my experience with 2C-T-7 hasn't been charming or special enough for me to feel like I'm missing much. 2C-T-2 agrees with me more. 


I'm not experienced enough to really say, but 2C-T-7 seemed closer to MDMA in its more shallow character and empathogenic push, while 2C-T-2 seemed more analogous to mescaline's deeper character and less forced-feeling empathogenesis.

Yeah exactly the same for me.  My good experiences with it reminded me more of MDMA than of a proper psychedelic.  It was slightly visual, with a euphoric warm character, comfortable, jovial.  One time it was decidedly very uncomfortable and began to be rather visual, but the TRs of unbelievable visuals bear no resemblance to any of my 2C-T-7 experiences.  On the other hand, 2C-T-2 is consistently more or less the same at particular dosages, and is deeply psychedelic, therapeutic, and strongly visual.

Let's not get discouraged [@Psychestim](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/543082/) we're not as lucky to be able to dabble with greats as 2C-T-2, but I fully trust that it will be a top tier drug

I would jump straight in with 35mg.


Personally I need ~50mg oral for a beautiful roaring +++ but I'm a bigger person  my girlfriend requires ~25mg for a strong trip.


Its hands down my favorite substance, the body high, visuals and feeling of being completely connected to nature are matched by none.


Sex on it is beautiful and there is no trouble getting it up or finishing. It's a perfect summer night substance!


I don't have very much left so I'm saving it for a once a year sort of thing. Planning to up the dosage a bit from my normal 50mg and see how much an additional 10mg kicks up the intensity.

I just want to clarify with the visuals to me they are spectacular but not because they are overwhelmingly strong. It's not that they aren't wonderful but I'd say 2C-E for example is more visual overall.


It's the way they form and flow that is spectacular. I get a water like vibe from it, the body high pulsates like an electric ocean and the visuals flow and form within that ocean spanning outwards forming beautiful scenery. What's occurring on its horizon and its bright flowing vastness is what makes me love 2c-t-7.


I'll close my eyes and see a bright whitish yellow bird flying through the green, red and blue landscape open my eyes and watch the bird soar and fly deeper before disappearing into the horizon of the vast landscape created on my wall.


It's definitely a lay down and enjoy substance and not a lets take an adventure substance

I'd take 10 mg first, as for some people that is plenty if you are sensitive. Wait 90 min, take 20-30 mg if very slight effect from 10 mg. If still underwhelmed another 90-120 min later, I'd insufflate what's needed of the remaining 5 mg in 1 mg doses with 15 min apart. I think that will work fine and not put you in any danger (like insufflating large doses in one go may).

I would never jump into 35mg of 2ct-7, the drug is just too variable in effects, have had a good trip from 25mg and then an uncomfortable trip from less. Also never snort this chemical (as i stupidly did when i was younger) i had a seizure from less than 10mg of the substance nasally.


This drug is nothing like alot of the 2c-x's in terms of effects that lines up with dosage.


stay safe out there

I disagree with your statement of it having variable effects that don't line up with dosages. Granted my pool of times I've taken it is rather low but, the 3 times I've taken 50mg I've had near identical trips. 


With 35mg I had no visuals, experienced no effects to mental space and only felt minor bodily effects. I even tried to kick start it by mixing ketamine with it but to no avail.


The only thing I find bizarre about it is marijuana seems to blunt the effects and make the come up take longer. It takes me around 3 hours to start to go off baseline which quickly climbs in intensity to a +++ after another 30-45 minutes. Once fully engulfed by it marijuana has the synergistic effect you would expect.


In regards to other 2C's I've played with more then once or twice my go to doses for strong fully engulfing trips are usually

2C-E : 21mg 

2C-B : 40mg

2C-P : 10mg

2C-T-2 : 30mg

2C-I : 25mg

Sorry for the late reply, but what are your usual go-to doses with other 2C-x? I will definitely not jump straight into 35mg, seeing that couldbesojs' usual doses are quite a bit higher than mine, but 22-25mg as an initial dose seems reasonable and still fairly responsible to me.

Thanks for your suggestion, but insufflation is out of the picture for me. I just don't feel comfortable snorting 2C-T-7 and I never really enjoyed any IN 2C-x experiences, no matter the dose and regardless of the pain. 


Perhaps I will start with the 10-13mg dose I had originally planned as my (potential) redose and take the remaining 22-25mg after 1.5-2 hours, if I need them. Of course there's no way to say for sure, but I do wonder what the likelihood of such an unpredictable and overly sensitive reaction might be.

Alright, took 10mg 2C-T-7 90 minutes ago and I don't feel anything. So I'm pretty confident in taking 25mg for my next trial.


I won't redose any of the T-7, but what are some good and safe combinations I could try? Thought about adding some Esketamine.

Yeah the 10mg were barely noticeable, but it was a nice day regardless. I had a mild bodyload and very slight perceptual changes but other than that I was practically sober. I'm a bit worried about the nausea though when I decide to do the remaining 25mg. Can sb. elaborate on how much worse the physical side-effects like stomach cramps, nausea, etc. were with T-7 in comparison to the other 2C-x.


The come-up took a really long time and I think I reached peak effects after 2.5 hours, even though my stomach was empty. 

Also, the duration seems perfect for me. I hate how short-lasting 2C-B/-C/-D are for me, but even the threshold dose today lasted a good 8 hours.

You gotta plug the 25mgs T-7, then their will be no nausea.


Also will be stronger that way, when it doubt...

I wouldn't worry about being nauseous, drink some water stick your fingers down your throat one good purge you'll be fine.


Puking sort of goes hand in hand with getting really high one good puke and you're fine.


I have a Japanese friend who can puke into a water bottle and not spill anything what a bizarre skill.

Say there's a solution of 10mg/ml of 2c-t-7 in 99% isopropyl alcohol, what would be the best way to turn it back into solid powder? Simply evaporating the alcohol should suffice, right? Is it possible to form crystals somehow?

Yeah exactly, you can evaporate the isopropyl alcohol. The 2c-t-7 will be left behind.. You could put the solution into some kind of glass container with a flat bottom to evaporate, then you scrape it with a razor blade after it crystalizes in order to minimize (almost eliminate) losses.

***Be careful.*** 


I'm all about plugging phenethylamines to reduce nausea. 2C-T-7 has hospitalized and killed people when insufflated, though. I've never read of a case of someone dying from taking it orally unless they combined it with other drugs. 


The running theory is that its toxicity is in part due to *peak* plasma levels. So when you take in a way where it hits harder and faster (rectal, intranasal, or injected,) the peak plasma level for that dose is going to be  much higher than if you'd taken the same dose orally. 


I'm not saying that it's impossible to use it safely rectally. I've done it once myself (but at tiny doses titrated up slowly over a long period of time.) You could theoretically do the same safely if you had a volumetrically dosed solution with a metered dosage nasal sprayer. But I don't think it's good harm reduction to recommend using this particular drug in ways that have so much more added risk. 


I opted to dose rectally because I was unsure of where my oral dosage would land. Recommended dosages for 2C-T-7 are all over the place. I was surprised to discover that the time to peak for rectal 2C-T-7 is still really, really long. When I dose other phenethylamines rectally, I feel them within just a few minutes and reach the peak quickly. Of all that I've tried, 2C-T-2 is has the fastest onset and the shortest time to peak. Surprisingly, 2C-T-7 had the longest. I was lucky that I was both hardheaded to 2C-T-7 and was dosing such small amounts, or I would have shot way past my mark. 


Also, phenethylamine potency is usually doubled when taken rectally. If that's true for 2C-T-7 (and I suspect it is,) then the rectal equivalent of your first oral dose would be 5mg. Taking 25mg rectally would be 5x that dose, but with significantly more risk of injury or death due to higher peak plasma levels. It might be fine, but I don't think that it would be good harm reduction to recommend taking a 5x equivalent of your first dose by a faster ROA. 


I was in a similar situation to you when I trialed 2C-T-7. I started low to be safe, and while I liked the duration well enough, the experience wasn't full or rich at the dosage that I tried. The only smart, safe way that I figured that I could proceed was to continue working my way up through carefully until I got to my target dosage, but that just seemed like it was going to give me more substandard experiences until I ran out before I got to my active dose. In the end, I decided to just sit on it until I was able to get more and test it out properly. The world is full of exotic and interesting psychedelics, and I felt like I could shelve it until I could test it out in a way I felt would be comfortable and rewarding.

Thanks for the detailed response! I appreciate your advice very much, but I wasn't going to rectally administer 25mg of 2C-T-7 in the first place. That would most likely be too much for me. From the things I've read on here Shadow Cat likes to go all out with his doses, whereas I'm most comfortable in the common-strong dose range (I posted my usual doses for the other 2C-x on the previous page). Furthermore, I only trip like once or twice a month, so I don't really have a tolerance to compensate for.


Usually, I titrate my way up with most substances, but as my 10mg test-dose was barely noticeable and I only have one shot I think I will just bite the bullet and take the 25mg orally.

Yes I would also imagine that rectal administration would share the same risks of intranasal administration through a similar mechanism (excess blood levels). I can't imagine any other mechanism that makes intranasal administration so uniquely dangerous.

Odd though as nasal 2C-T-7 is reported to have a rapid onset, whereas pfaffed states rectal has a slow come up. I'd love to switch from oral to rectal dosing as the come up orally takes forever. Would also be nice to reduce the material needed, I take 50mg+ as an oral dose. Just not comfortable with the risk however.

Once a year I take this stuff and every time it blows me away. 


Dancing in front of the tv mangled on ketamine and decided to eat a 50mg capsule. Felt it rather quickly ~30 minutes could feel it fighting the ketamine for space and control in my brain. 


Had an all out dry heaving puke session for at least 15 minutes at some point then lost track of time. 


There were all the usual components of colors and beautiful bullshit then these little scenes started playing, I would watch the scene form -- small Korean lady store owner interaction and I'd see it then I'd go into the scene and the little loop and realize this isn't real. I had enough with this belligerent lady whos house I was building who wanted me to take away lumber arguing with her back and forth in a loop realizing I'm in bed then going back to building her house over and over.

Yeah 2ct-7 is a strange one. I could never imagine a 50mg dose after i had some kind of seizure from it ages ago albeit stupidly mangled of gbl and snorted two doses in one. I felt reckless back then. Thats when you know you are using psychdelics for the wrong reasons.


Oral i never pushed more than 30mg though i can see 50mg being ok if you have trialled doses in past

Snorted 2C-T-7 seems to be quite dangerous, it's much, much more potent (as is true with all 2C-Xs) and 2C-T-7 is an MAOI, and seems to cause rhabdomyolysis in overdose.  Most of the deaths reported from it are either from snorting it, or combining it with MDMA, or both.


2C-T-7 is weird for me, I have never been able to dose it right to get the kind of experience people talk about.  I have dosed it from 25mg to 50mg.  At 50mg, it was still feeling weak and barely visual.  Then the next time I took 42mg and it was really strong, but kind of just like I was mangled, I had visuals but not like people describe, and I felt very unpleasant, super heavy bodyload,   The last time I took it, I took 35mg and found it very mild, pleasant though, but mild.  It just doesn't seem to agree with me.  2C-T-2, on the other hand, is consistent in effects every time and just wonderful.

I've taken 60mg dosed of 2C-T-7 a few times and snorted up to 30mgs before and lower amounts alot of times. It never felt dangerous to me when I was doing this but it was reckless, was young then and felt pretty invincible at that age. Remember when the bag came and Laika came over and I put a tray of it in front of him with a line to sniff like 5mins after he got there.


 He threw up in my parents bathroom and was like Jesus... you know Charlie it's like I walk in the door and you just immediately shove drugs in my face and then I'm puking watching rainbows explode out of surfaces. We mixed it with 2C-E also that day intranasal it was actually one of the best days of my life. I redosed like four times alternating between the two.


This was in the good old days when all of the 2C-x we're everywhere on the forums. Best period of my life in many ways but yeah T-7 is great stuff that year I ate and sniffed my way thru a bunch and had a blast. I'd be ecstatic to get to take it again at an older age and with a different perspective, deff would only eat it I would never sniff a 2C-x again, not only does it hurt like a mofo plugging would offer a similar fast onset without pain.

Yeah plugging is far superior.  Snorting 2C-Xs hurts so unbearably bad that I can't even enjoy the trip because of how traumatic the come-up is.  It is by far the worst snorting pain of any drug.  People say meth and MDMA are terrible, but they're like nothing compared to 2C-X nasal pain.  Like getting kicked in the face while someone takes a power drill to the nasal cavity.  Or so I imagine, I'm sure that would be at least marginally worse.


Great memories Charlie. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Those years were among the best of my life, too.  Certainly the sense of psychedelic potential and sheer joy of exploration were the greatest of my life.  PD was full of crazy motherfuckers in those days.

I haven’t been around back then but I’m intrigued what you mean by that? :D 


When I joined BL I was surprised by how slow-paced and quiet everything was. No instant comments or other notifications on posts and much less activity compared to sth. like Reddit but that shouldn’t have come as a surprise to me as BL is a forum in a much more classical sense. I actually much prefer it over Reddit now as everything is a lot more personal and intimate here. I’m still curious how it changed over the years because so many big & dandies are predominantly filled with old comments from users that don’t seem to be active anymore. Probably because so many chemicals (like 2C-T-7) have become unavailable over the years.

Oh I am just making reference to the old glory days of the old school PD crew... circa 2006.  The community was very strong, lots of people, PD Social would move sometimes as much as 10 pages a day.  Lots of people were tripping a lot, and discovering the world of RC psychedelics together.  There was also a lot of DMT smoking, and a few attempted worldwide group blastoffs (with countdown ![:alien:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f47d.png)).  A good friend of mine (met him here, now close friends IRL for many years), would get super excited and hypomanic and would say "DO YOU SMELL THE INDOLE IN THE AIR??"


A few people here might still remember those days.  Not many of us left. ![:cry:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f622.png)


Bluelight in general used to have many times as much traffic, back in the glory days of traditional forums.  There were so many intelligent and interesting people participating.  Not that there aren't still, there definitely are.  But things were definitely different and more vibrant back then.  Traditional forums are dying out, we have managed to stay alive and interesting which I am thankful for.  Google's search algorithm fucked us big-time, we used to be on the first page of search results for almost any drug-related question.  Now no drug forums are, it's all reddit, quora, and paid advertisements for rehabs with canned and often inaccurate information.

Presumably, plugging 2C-T-7 would have a similar risk profile as insufflation. Maybe a bit safer. 


*If* the danger of snorting it is due to peak plasma levels, then the speed at which the entirety of the dose is delivered to the brain makes all the difference. IV and smoking would be the riskiest. I can't say for sure, but the speed of rectal absorption might be affected by how dilute of a solution the drug is in. 10mg diluted in 10mL might take a little longer to absorb than 10mg in 1mL.


The one time I used 2C-T-7, I plugged it, titrating the dose slowly up. Some people seem to get rocked by 10mg while others need 50mg+. I didn't have a lot, so this was my compromise. 


This approach didn't work very well for me. With 2C-T-2, it kicks in almost immediately. It's easy to adjust my dose. 2C-T-7 was a creeper even when used rectally, slowly building and developing over time. In then end, it was a lot of trouble. My only takeaway was that I seemed to be a bit of a hardhead, so would probably need a hefty oral dose. And I wasn't wild about the experience. I liked 2C-T-2 much more fwiw.

The problem I find with places like twitter/fb and reddit, is there is so much noise and the focus on privacy in reddit and the overall mass of people there, reduces it often to a lowest common denominator discussion.


Here I find there is far more interesting content and the people on this forum are focused on the topic and lifestyle. It feels like a dedicated space, not mishmash of discussions.


Anyway... long live blue light... and 2ct7, one of my favourites.


How the hell are you doing 50mg of 2ct7, that's just an overdose. Given your preference for DOC, I would suggest that the subtle graces of the 2c's are likely missed by you. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Or maybe it's just not your thing, and that you prefer the full force of psychedelia that isn't bound to ebbs and flows. You like the torrent...


Damn I miss 2ct7

Also, don't be an idiot, don't snort 2CT7, EVER...


If you want an intense experience, go for DOM, LSD or 2C-E.


2CT7 is just not an INTENSE experience, it, like 2c-b and 2ct2 are generally subtle. When you push the dose up, the physical effects become pronounced and unpleasant. 2cb has a much better safety profile than 2ct2 and 2ct7, but why people try for an INTENSE experience with 2ct7 is beyond me, for gods sake...

I love the 2C-Xs, and the DOXs.  In fact I don't find the 2Cs very subtle in general, they can produce powerful and extremely  visual experiences.  I think people try for intense 2C-T-7 experiences because there are a lot of trip reports of amazing, incredible sounding experiences, in full doses of 2C-T-7.  Everyone is affected differently, by all psychedelics, but 2C-T-7 has even greater variability, in PIHKAL even.  Morninggloryseed said he used to take 70mg for a full experience and felt that was a good dose.  Some people seem to react strongly to as little as 15-20mg.  There are many reports of otherworldly visuals that beat all other drugs for visuals.  That sort of thing sounds pretty appealing.  Almost everything I've ever read about 2C-T-7 suggests it is anything but subtle.


But yeah I agree, don't ever snort 2C-T-7, or combine it with MDMA or similar drugs.  The deaths are from those two things.

I also have to disagree on 2C-Xes being 'subtle'! Little has thrown me through the metaphorical plate glass window like 2C-Xs, 2C-I gave me some incredible fantasy... In one case I was tangled up with a ex girlfriend and we both were entirely lost in the visuals occasionally

2C-E is the most overtly psychedelic and wildly mentally intense psychedelic I've ever done.  Even 2C-B is pretty intense unless you take a low dose, for me.  2C-I is almost dissociative in nature, very unique and also intense.  I find them all extremely visual compared to most other substances.

It's the perfect festival drug, take it by noon, trip all day with a great social, euphoric, outgoing energy, rage all night, the the next day, chill and relax, possibly not sleep until the second night, depending on how things go and how resistant to sleep you are as a person.

Dude even searching with 'bluelight' in the search often won't get this website!! Google has fucked over basically all forums it seems.


Really sad. I know exactly what you mean. I was a member from 2007 and forums were a different beast. 2000s internet was best internet.

Yeah, the early Internet was amazing.  I suspect anyone who lived through it will always pine for it.  It was like the wild west, the content was so much more unregulated and social media hadn't taken hold yet... peoples' attention spans hadn't reduced to that of a goldfish yet.

Back then Bluelight was so epic as was the RC scene in those days, so many incredible Vendors in the Clearnet. For us in the US we had tons of good options and with priority mail it would be there in 2-3 days. All of the 2C-x we're widely available and Methylone/Mephedrone I tripped and rolled so much it was just bonkers.


 There was Vending forums like numerous ones were it was just an open air market for RCs and since there was so many vendors the price competition made it all so cheap like I got grams of 2C-E for 60 dollars at one point, by the gram. But things are pretty good still there is lots of Lysergamides and many Tryptamines. 


But I really love the 2C-x series and I don't think so many will ever be available at one time like that again. Like 2C-I for instance is a gem and I haven't seen that available for awhile, I'd be ecstatic to take that one again it was really recreational and true psychedelic candy.


 I'm really grateful I got to live thru that period and I will always miss the open air forums, vendors had their own threads and people giving feedback forced quality and proper pricing. They used to do free samples when they opened shop and we would give reviews, I did so many it was really fun.

Omg I totally overdid this last night. ate 32mg and waited for an hour, nothing happened. took 18 more mg and waited another hour, nothing happened. maybe just the slightest awareness. Then i was real dumb and took 20mg of 2ct2 thinking it would kick the 7 in. well it did in a pretty terrible way. very physical and at one point i was astral projecting i guess? i was at a protest in Iran and these bird women were berating me for trying to help. Came back from that to a lot of laughing and crying and occasionally puking. i will definitley be writing a TR for this one. While overall the experience was good, I don't think I will ever touch t7 again in my life.

Here is my TR. fucking crazy and kind of embarrased..


##### 2C-T7 and 2C-T2 Astral Projecting to Foreign Protests

Dose: 50mg T7 and 20mg T2 Male, 150lb 30's  I kinda hate that I'm always coming in with reports that are way over the top and some are even potentially dangerous. In this case I was especially stupid with the compound known as 2C-T7. Lots of experience with tons of psychedelics, and this was...

I recently found my old stash of HOT-7 and you guys are making me want to explore it again. It's been a number of years. I never was lucky enough to get to try 2CT7


Oh an 2CT2. Found my old baggie of that. There's only the bag scrappings left, I'd be lucky if I got one low dose out of it, although I never had much in the first place. Only ever got to try it twice but I still regard it as my favorite psychedelic. A truly beautiful experience. I sure hope that I can revisit 2ct2 one day. That one is a gem

I’ve done more lurking than posting on this forum but I was here since the 2007ish days and I can agree, it was a golden age of exploration, comradery, and growth. Though I wasn’t as integral to the community here, names like Xorkoth, Morninggloryseed, and Sepher have been staples in my lexicon for years and inspired me in my own style of exploration which has served me quite well over the years. I went on to start the 5meo forums to try and create a similar repository of knowledge but I have noticed the same that the Google algorithms don’t really favor forums. Regardless, I think it’s a great format and brings back nostalgia to the good old days and inspires me to keep doing the work I am doing that I dreamed of so many years ago. Wishing you all the best, just wanted to jump in on the nostalgia train ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

First, I took 5.7 mg. After 30 minutes, I felt nothing, and I decided that the dose was too small for any effects, so I made the call for a second dose. I weighted 12.7 mg and took it. Both doses in a glass filled with water. The substance didn't dissolve at all, so I drank the water with floating specks of 2C-T-7.

Total dose: 18.4 mg

In summary, it was a pleasant experience with no negative effects.


37 minutes after taking the second dose, I began to feel the first effects. By effects, I mean any sensations that deviate from my usual sober state. It was the typical onset of a phenylethylamine psychedelic. My mood improved, and felt excited.


After 45 minutes, the effects were pronounced enough to rule out any placebo.


I felt a psychedelic aura around my thoughts and reasoning. My ability to think logically was intact, but somewhere in the depths of my mind, I sensed a subtle influence of the psychedelic mindspace. Visually, I noticed the first changes - colors became more intense and everything was pulsating. I didn't experience any body load.


I felt good, slightly dazed with euphoria.


When I looked out the window, everything seemed like there was hot air shimmering between me and the point I was looking at, like a heat haze.


55 minutes after the second dose, I decided to go out to the store to buy some sweets because I suddenly felt the urge for it.


As I was in the elevator, I noticed that time seemed to pass faster. The elevator was going from a high floor to the ground, but when it reached the first floor, it felt like it should already be on the ground floor.


I felt lightness in my legs, as if I weighed 10% less.


During the walk, I felt like I noticed more details and saw things I hadn't seen before. It seemed like I could see the movement of every branch on a tree and even every single leaf. Colors were so vivid that I felt like I could see more colors than my eyes could perceive.


I also noticed significant depth perception distortion. I saw a building in the distance with a tree in front of it. The tree seemed to move away from me while the building appeared getting closer. I can imagine that on higher doses of this substance, moving through space could be challenging.


I went to the store and of course, there were people inside. It might be interesting from the perspective of my research, how I reacted to other people. Usually, with psychedelics, I tend to feel stressed, and my social anxiety reaches its peak. With empathogens, however, I always feel confident, and people don't cause me any anxiety. With 2C-T-7 I felt more of that slight anxiety and reluctance to be among people, although it wasn't extreme like it is with 4-subbed tryptamines. I didn't feel too anxious walking around strangers. I mostly didn't care. Confidence, familiar from empathogens like MDMA, broke through, but it was subdued by the intensification of the psychedelic social anxiety. In summary: I felt more anxious than I would if I was sober. But it wasn't as intense as it is on, for example, 2cb or any other regular psychedelic.


I noticed slight signs of body load. Occasionally, I feel heaviness in my stomach. Sometimes cold, sometimes hot. Minimal nausea, really. The whole bodyload is such that you can ignore it - but its just me and I've heard many people complain about heavy body load on this substance.


After 85 minutes from the last dose, I began to wonder how I would compare this substance to 2C-B or mescaline.

The conclusions are that it definitely differs from 2C-B in terms of greater empathy and stimaulation. Visuals - I don't know, maybe 2C-T-7 performs better here? But I'm not sure about that. Maybe it's the same.

Mescaline - as above, but I would also say that mescaline has a much greater mindfuck and influence on thinking than 2C-T-7, on which I can think relatively soberly.


I also come to the conclusion that it's not worth taking this substance alone at home. It's too lively, and one feels urge to do something. I took it alone at home, though. Just because I prefer to take new drugs like this - with small doses, safely and at home. My next time with this substance will be most definitely not at home.


By psychedelic standards, 2C-T-7 is the most stimulating and empathogenic psychedelic I've taken (excluding things like AMT, which for me is no longer a psychedelic but has crossed the barrier of being an empathogen)


After 2 hours from the last dose, I checked how the CEVs are. Their immediately reminded me of a Lava lamp. They were slowly drifting abstract shapes. They didn't move to the rhythm of music, they were independent of it. I've encountered such CEVs with other phenylethylamines.


Every now and then, intense waves of euphoria, stimulation, and empathy appeared. And during these waves, I could risk saying that it's 50% empathogen and 50% psychedelic. But only for the duration of these waves. Because if I were to average it out, I would say it's 80% psychedelic, 20% empathogen. Still, a psychedelic overall.


The peak of the experience occurred around 2h45m after the last dose. Then, the effects began to fade, but they're still present. In my case I would say the duration of this drug is 6h, and then an afterglow, for an unknown time. Most likely until the next day.

Thanks for the report! That's certainly consistent with my feelings about 2C-T-7 for what it's worth. I'm glad you had a positive experience.

You'll enjoy 25-35 mg much more, I think. You can increase effects by insufflating 1 mg, wait 20 min, repeat 'till the level you want. Dangerous drug to insufflate in large doses though.

[@aag](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/547833/)


that's a really thorough and well thought out report. thanks for that. picture perfect.


i'd REALLY love to try the 2c-t-x ones, especially 7.


 (out of the phenethylamines, i've only had mescaline etc. in the form of echinopsis tea... oh, and unknown DOx and maybe an nbome of also unknown i.d.)


the +4 report in pihkal for 2c-t-4 also makes me crave that one, ok i'm rambling now... sick and gabaergicated.


anyway, nice report.

> 2C-T-7 is weird for me, I have never been able to dose it right to get the kind of experience people talk about.  I have dosed it from 25mg to 50mg.  At 50mg, it was still feeling weak and barely visual.  Then the next time I took 42mg and it was really strong, but kind of just like I was mangled, I had visuals but not like people describe, and I felt very unpleasant, super heavy bodyload,   The last time I took it, I took 35mg and found it very mild, pleasant though, but mild.  It just doesn't seem to agree with me.  2C-T-2, on the other hand, is consistent in effects every time and just wonderful.

The synth is actually quite complex compared to 2c-I and 2c-B.


Both respective compounds are a near one step reaction from 2c-H, which 2ct7 is not.


Also, it’s not as agreeable on the body.


But as for the character of the experience, it’s truly delicious. 


Like a rare fine wine.

Often it means that the material is either dangerous to work with outside of a fume hood, for example using halogens would result in filing my lungs with bromine crystals without a proper and well functioning fume hood. Chemistry can be incredibly dangerous. I've had a couple lab incidents so far where glass exploded due to heat and both were pretty catastrophic, frankly.


Diethylamine is just carcinogenic or mutagenic iirc? I'm pretty sure it's on the medium list of things to be careful with.


Edit: He likely said that 2C-T-7 is tougher to whip up relative to non 2C-T's in general because sulphur can be dangerous to work with, ESPECIALLY in clandestine contexts.

If you decide to try it, 2c-t-7 should be used in the dosage range described in psychonaut wiki.


Additionally, 2c-t-7 more so than other substances interacts. It is likely an MAOI.


To reduce risks, 1. only dose orally. 2.do not redose during your experiment. 3. never mix with other drugs, especially not Serotonin releasers like MDA or MDMA. 


Fatalities have resulted from not following the above considerations.


I haven't heard or read of any fatalities when used responsibly, orally, without mixing it with other drugs.

I'd imagine that anyone making 2C-X compounds is going pretty slowly and carefully in the first place. It's not like meth where a layman can bodge some together with household chemicals, you need to be pretty good at chemistry to even attempt this stuff.

Most disfunctional wrong choice search engine 99 %. And not only that it promotes itself.

'Google it !' common phrase. Why not ! give your private search in hand of a very discutable agglomerate of internet testikels.

So to speak.


So if you use google and Bluelight wasn t there, accept your a bit strung on a single search engine proven to be a enemy,

they are not honoust, so why should their results be? You where lured in in the beginning perhaps, like me.

When i set the languange of my engine on Uk / English Blue is first on the list, what about Google atm.


'but things are not the way they used to be'. Who uses Microsoft? Same mistake.

Time some re-evaluating your OS and Software [browser/ search engine] perhaps ?
