**3-MeO-PCMo** (**4-[1-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexyl]morpholine**) is a new morpholine analogue of 3-MeO-PCP. It is a dissociative NMDA receptor antagonist and anesthetic drug of the arylcyclohexylamine chemical class with a potency of less than 1/10th of that of 3-MeO-PCP.

This compound induces a state referred to as “dissociative anesthesia”
 when ingested and is therefore used as a recreational drug. 3-MeO-PCMo 
has recently become freely available through online research chemical 
vendors^[1] where it is being sold as a designer drug.

Although very little is known about this compound, similar morpholine analogues of phencyclidine have been researched before.^[2]^[3]

In terms of its chemistry, 3-MeO-PCMo, or 4-[1-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexyl]morpholine, is classified as an arylcyclohexylamine
 drug. Ayrlcyclohexylamine drugs are named for their structures which 
include a cyclohexane ring bound to an aromatic ring along with an amine
 group at the same location. The aryl substituent of 3-MeO-PCMo is a 
phenyl ring with a methoxy (CH3-O-) substituent at R3, which is bound to a six-membered cyclohexyl ring. Bound at the same location on the cyclohexyl ring R1 is an amine group which is incorporated into a morpholine ring as R4. Morpholine is a six-membered heterocyclic ring with an oxygen subsitutent at R1. 3-MeO-PCMo is a morpholine analogue to 3-MeO-PCP, which lacks an oxygen moiety in its six-membered amine ring (a piperidine ring instead of a morpholine ring).

In terms of its pharmacology, due to the lack of research regarding the substance, all discussion 
regarding the pharmacology of it is purely based on its structure and 
subjective effect similarities to other arylcyclohexylamine dissociatives such as 3-MeO-PCP, PCP and MXE. With this in mind, 3-Meo-PCMo is thought to act as an NMDA receptor antagonist.
 NMDA receptors allow for electrical signals to pass between neurons in 
the brain and spinal column; for the signals to pass, the receptor must 
be open. NMDA receptor antagonists close the NMDA receptors by blocking 
them. This disconnection of neurons leads to loss of feeling, difficulty
 moving, and eventually the famous “hole.”

The effects listed below are based upon the [subjective effects index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index) and personal experiences of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers).
 The listed effects will rarely (if ever) occur all at once, but heavier
 dosages will increase the chances and are more likely to induce a full 
range of effects.

**Physical effects:**

The subjective physical effects of 3-MeO-PCMo can be broken down into
 several components which progressively intensify proportional to 
dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **[Spontaneous tactile sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_tactile_sensations)**
 - The 3-MeO-PCMo body high is a soft, warm, motionless and pleasurable 
tingling sensation which is all-encompassing across the body and not 
location specific to any area.
- **[Decreased bodily weight](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_bodily_weight)**
 - This creates the sensation that the body is floating and has become 
entirely weightless. This effect is strangely stimulating and encourages
 physical activities at low to moderate doses by making the body feel 
light and effortless to move.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)**
 - It’s worth noting that high dose 3-MeO-PCMo trips can sometimes 
result in nausea and vomiting at the peak of the trip. For most people, 
this is surprisingly not as unpleasant as they would initially expect 
due to the accompanying detachment from the physical senses.
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)**
 - A loss of gross and fine motor control alongside of balance and 
coordination is prevalent within 3-MeO-PCMo and becomes especially 
strong at higher doses. This means that one should be sitting down 
before the onset (unless experienced) in case of falling over and 
injuring oneself.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)**
- **[Tactile disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_disconnection)**
- **[Tactile suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression)**
- **[Physical autonomy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_autonomy)**

**Cognitive effects:**

The general head space of 3-MeO-PCMo is often described as simplistic and shallow in comparison to that of MXE and ketamine. The specific cognitive effects can be broken down into several separate subcomponents which are listed and described below:

- **[Depersonalization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depersonalization)**
- **[Derealization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Derealization)**
- **[Consciousness disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Consciousness_disconnection)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** (ego death)
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Information processing suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Information_processing_suppression)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection)**
- **[Déjà vu](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)**

**Visual effects:**

*Suppressions:*

This substance does not enhance visual stimuli; instead, it tends to 
degrade and decrease visual aptitude in a variety of ways which 
generally include:

- **[Visual disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection)** - This eventually results in the 3-MeO-PCMo equivalent of the famous “k-hole” or, more specifically, *[holes, spaces and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids)* alongside of *[structures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Structures)*.
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)** - This component is prevalent at moderate to heavy doses and makes reading impossible unless one closes an eye.
- **[Pattern recognition suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_suppression)** - This effect generally occurs at higher doses and makes one unable to recognize and interpret perceivable visual data.
- **[Visual acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)**

*Distortions:*

- **[Perspective distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_distortions)**

*[Geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry):*

The visual geometry found within 3-MeO-PCMo can be described as very dark and bland when compared to that of ketamine or DXM.
 It often consists of many tiny interlocking and woven lines. It does 
not extend beyond level 4 geometry and can be comprehensively described 
through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations)
 as simplistic in complexity, algorithmic in style, synthetic in feel, 
unstructured in organization, dimly lit in lighting, multicoloured in 
scheme, glossy in shading, soft in edges, small in size, slow in speed, 
smooth in motion, equal in rounded and angular corners, immersive in 
depth and consistent in intensity.

**Auditory effects:**

- **[Suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_suppression)**
- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)**

**Physical health effects, potential addiction and tolerance:**

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 3-MeO-PCMo 
use have not been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic 
dose is unknown. This is because 3-MeO-PCMo is a research chemical with 
very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who 
have tried 3-MeO-PCMo within the psychonaut community suggests that 
there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this 
drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (but nothing 
can be completely guaranteed).

There is a tolerance build up with 3-MeO-PCMo which results in the 
need to consume increasingly large doses in order to achieve the same 
level of effects. This should reset to baseline after 1 - 2 weeks. There
 may be some addictive potential, but this is still unknown.

In terms of its long-term health effects when used repeatedly and 
with excess for extended periods of time, 3-MeO-PCMo seems to exhibit 
almost identical bladder and urinary tract problems to those found 
within ketamine, MXE and other arylcyclohexylamines,
 but to an even more extreme extent. This is because 3-MeO-PCMo is 50% 
less potent than that of ketamine which means significantly more of the 
drug must be consumed in order to achieve the same effects. Symptoms of 
3-MeO-PCMo-induced cystitis can become extremely serious and can be 
described as:

- **Urinary frequency** - Urinary frequency is the need to empty the bladder every few minutes.
- **Urinary urgency** - This can be described as a sudden and compelling need to urinate.
- **Urinary pressure** - This is experienced as a constant sensation of fullness in the bladder that is unrelieved by urination.
- **Pelvic and bladder pain** - Pain can develop suddenly and severely, particularly as the bladder fills with urine.
- **Hematuria** - Hematuria is visible blood in the urine.
- **Incontinence** - This is the leakage of urine.

All of these, however, can easily be avoided by simply not using 
3-MeO-PCMo on a daily or even weekly basis and manually limiting one’s 
usage of the substance.

**Legal issues:**

3-MeO-PCMo is currently a legal grey area drug worldwide and is 
freely available through the use of online research chemical vendors. 
However, this does not guarantee anyone to be immune from legal 
prosecution should they be found in possession of this substance as the 
legality is likely to vary from country to country.

Within the U.K. specifically, as 3-MeO-PCMo is the morpholine analogue of 3-MeO-PCP,
 it is therefore an arylcyclohexylamine (ACH) that is not controlled in 
the U.K. because a morpholine substituion on the amine is not proscribed
 by the country’s generic ACH laws.

**Conclusion:**

3-MeO-PCMo is by far the closest experience to that of MXE or ketamine currently available in the U.K. legal research chemical market. Its absurd lack of potency, however, makes it unusable for regular usage due to its proportionally adverse effects on the bladder.

## Subjective Experience

This is an analogue of the more widely known 3-MeO-PCP, and is generally
described as a dissociative anaesthetic. Given that there are warnings on harm
reduction websites stating that heavy doses of 3-MeO-PCP may result in psychosis
and mania, and that the doses generally suggested for that chemical are considerably
lower than those mooted for 3-MeO-PCMo, the need for caution is well sign-posted.

I sampled this about a year ago, snorting 45mg, but with only minor effects. I have no
idea why I chose that RoA, particularly as this was a new compound and it was
crystal, but I will take the more familiar oral route this time around.

Forum posts seem to be mixed, with many, but not all, suggesting no or little activity
(via any route).

On the basis of this my first inclination was to dose at 200mg. However, even though
I purchased from a relatively trusted vendor (BRC) the red flags referred to above
persuade me to go low.

Having consulted with a colleague (online), I dose at 100mg.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I crush the crystals into smaller shards, and then bomb them down
the hatch. [4:30pm]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:15 Is a tingling in the head developing? It does seem to be: a sort of
benign heady anaesthesia. It is barely noticeable, but it is there nonetheless.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:30 My head feels comfortably warm, which may or may not be a prelude
to something more significant. There may be a tiny anxiolytic effect, or
perhaps not.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
This is all very shallow at present.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 That heady anaesthesia has intensified and a gentle dissociation is
now in play. The familiar numbing of my hands has emerged, albeit mildly at
this stage.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
It is beyond question now that I have passed the threshold dose for this
substance. I am comfortable with it, so I hope it will go further, although I
don’t expect it to.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:30 I sense that this has definitely hit a plateau. I am slightly off kilter, but
in a pleasant way, and there is numbness to the experience, both physically
and mentally.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:00 By most accounts I should be peaking about now, although I feel that I
did so an hour ago. Indeed, this now has a coming-down feeling about it, and
appears to be tapering towards normality, although I remain calm and
somewhat dreamy in a slightly insentient bubble.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:00 The mild physical detachment and pleasant headiness are lingering,
albeit at the lower level. Mentally, I feel in a better place than I did before I
sampled this, so long may it continue.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+4:00 I now feel that I am more or less back to base.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+16:00 I retired to bed, tired, at around 11pm, and had a reasonable night’s
sleep. This morning, if anything, I feel more relaxed and refreshed than usual.
\`\`\`
There was nothing unpleasant about this, in that at this dose the ride was quite nice
throughout, if a little unspectacular. I suspect that it would be better still on perhaps
150-200mg, but those red flags and the existence of more market tested alternatives
will probably dissuade me from experimenting further.

**3-MeO-PCMo** ( **4-[1-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexyl]morpholine** ) is a new morpholine analogue of [3-MeO-PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-MeO-PCP) . It is a [dissociative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) [NMDA receptor antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor_antagonist) , [sigma receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma_receptor) agonist and [anesthetic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) drug of the [arylcyclohexylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Arylcyclohexylamine) chemical class with a potency of less than 1/10th of that of 3-MeO-PCP.

This compound induces a state referred to as " [dissociative anesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative#subjective_effects) " when ingested and is therefore used as a recreational drug. 3-MeO-PCMo has recently become easily accessible through online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) vendors where it is being sold as a [designer drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) .

Although very little is known about this compound, similar morpholine analogues of [phencyclidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phencyclidine) have been researched before.

## Chemistry

3-MeO-PCMo, or 4-[1-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexyl]morpholine, is classified as an [arylcyclohexylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Arylcyclohexylamine) drug. Ayrlcyclohexylamine drugs are named for their structures which include a cyclohexane ring bound to an aromatic ring along with an amine group at the same location. The aryl substituent of 3-MeO-PCMo is a phenyl ring with a methoxy (CH 3 -O-) substituent at R 3 , which is bound to a six-membered cyclohexyl ring. Bound at the same location on the cyclohexyl ring R 1 is an amine group which is incorporated into a morpholine ring as R 4 .

Morpholine is a six-membered heterocyclic ring with an oxygen subsitutent at R 1 . 3-MeO-PCMo is a morpholine analogue to [3-MeO-PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-MeO-PCP) , which lacks an oxygen moiety in its six-membered amine ring (a piperidine ring instead of a morpholine ring).

## Pharmacology

Due to the lack of research regarding the substance, all discussion regarding the pharmacology of it is purely based on its structure and subjective effect similarities to other [arylcyclohexylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Arylcyclohexylamine) [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) such as [3-MeO-PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-MeO-PCP) , [PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PCP) and [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) . With this in mind, 3-Meo-PCMo is thought to act as an [NMDA receptor antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor_antagonist) . NMDA receptors allow for electrical signals to pass between neurons in the brain and spinal column; for the signals to pass, the receptor must be open. Dissociatives close the NMDA receptors by blocking them. This disconnection of neurons leads to loss of feeling, difficulty moving, and eventually this substance's equivalent of the “ [K-hole](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids) .”

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - It's worth noting that high dose 3-MeO-PCMo trips can sometimes result in nausea and vomiting at the peak of the trip. For most people, this is surprisingly not as unpleasant as they would initially expect due to the accompanying detachment from the physical senses.
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)** - A loss of gross and fine motor control alongside of balance and coordination is prevalent within 3-MeO-PCMo and becomes especially strong at higher doses. This means that one should be sitting down before the onset (unless experienced) in case of falling over and injuring oneself.
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)** - This creates the sensation that the body is floating and has become entirely weightless. This effect is strangely stimulating and encourages physical activities at low to moderate doses by making the body feel light and effortless to move.
- **[Physical autonomy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_autonomy)**
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)**
- **[Spatial disorientation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spatial_disorientation)**
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The 3-MeO-PCMo "body high" is a soft, warm, motionless and pleasurable tingling sensation which is all-encompassing across the body and not location specific to any area.
- **[Tactile disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_disconnection)**
- **[Tactile suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression)** ### Visual effects
 
- #### Suppression
 
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)** - This component is prevalent at moderate to heavy doses and makes reading impossible unless one closes an eye.
- **[Frame rate suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frame_rate_suppression)**
- **[Pattern recognition suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_suppression)** - This effect generally occurs at higher doses and makes one unable to recognize and interpret perceivable visual data.
- **[Visual acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)**
- **[Visual disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection)** - This eventually results in the 3-MeO-PCMo equivalent of the famous "k-hole" or, more specifically, *[holes, spaces and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids)* alongside of *[structures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Structures)* .
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Perspective distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_distortions)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry found within 3-MeO-PCMo can be described as very dark and bland when compared to that of [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) or [DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM) . It often consists of many tiny interlocking and woven lines. It does not extend beyond level 4 geometry and can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as simplistic in complexity, algorithmic in style, synthetic in feel, unstructured in organization, dimly lit in lighting, multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, soft in edges, small in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, equal in rounded and angular corners, immersive in depth and consistent in intensity. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The general head space of 3-MeO-PCMo is often described as simplistic and shallow in comparison to that of [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) and [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) . The specific cognitive effects can be broken down into several separate subcomponents which are listed and described below: 
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)**
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**

## Potentially dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Stimulants** - Both stimulants and dissociatives carry the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and these risks are exacerbated when the two substances are combined.
- **Depressants** - Because both depress the respiratory system, this combination can result in an increased risk of suddenly falling unconscious, vomiting and choking to death from the resulting suffocation. If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 3-MeO-PCMo use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 3-MeO-PCMo has very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried 3-MeO-PCMo within the community suggest that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance to ensure the administration of the intended dose.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other NMDA receptor antagonists, the chronic use of 3-MeO-PCMo can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of 3-MeO-PCMo develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 3-MeO-PCMo presents cross-tolerance with all [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) , meaning that after the consumption of 3-MeO-PCMo all [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics)** - This combination is not advised because 3-MeO-PCE has been reported to cause extreme psychological disturbances such as [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and mania at a significantly higher rate than other [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives) .
- **Stimulants** - Both stimulants and dissociatives carry the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and these risks are exacerbated when the two substances are combined.
- **Depressants** - Because both depress the respiratory system, this combination can result in an increased risk of suddenly falling unconscious, vomiting and choking to death from the resulting suffocation. If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.

### Urinary tract effects

In terms of its long-term health effects when used repeatedly and with excess for extended periods of time, 3-MeO-PCMo seems to exhibit almost identical bladder and urinary tract problems to those found within [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) , [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) and other [arylcyclohexylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Arylcyclohexylamine) , but to an even more extreme extent. This is because 3-MeO-PCMo is 50% less potent than that of ketamine which means significantly more of the drug must be consumed in order to achieve the same effects. Symptoms of 3-MeO-PCMo-induced cystitis can become extremely serious and can be described as:

- **Urinary frequency** - Urinary frequency is the need to empty the bladder every few minutes.
- **Urinary urgency** - This can be described as a sudden and compelling need to urinate.
- **Urinary pressure** - This is experienced as a constant sensation of fullness in the bladder that is unrelieved by urination.
- **Pelvic and bladder pain** - Pain can develop suddenly and severely, particularly as the bladder fills with urine.
- **Hematuria** - Hematuria is visible blood in the urine.
- **Incontinence** - This is the leakage of urine.

All of these, however, can easily be avoided by simply not using 3-MeO-PCMo on a daily or even weekly basis and manually limiting one's usage of the substance.

## Legal status

3-MeO-PCMo is currently thought to be a legal grey area drug worldwide and is easily accessible through the use of online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) vendors. However, this does not guarantee anyone to be immune from legal prosecution should they be found in possession of this substance as the legality is likely to vary from country to country.

- **Germany:** 3-MeO-PCMo is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.
- **Switzerland:** 3-MeO-PCMo is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis E.
- **United Kingdom** - It is illegal to produce, supply, or import this drug under the Psychoactive Substance Act, which came into effect on May 26th, 2016. While most arylcyclohexylamines are covered by a generic clause , the 1-morpholine group of 3-MeO-PCMo is outside of the definition. While the drug is still controlled under the Psychoactive Substances Act, simple possession (other than within a custodial institution) is not criminalised.
