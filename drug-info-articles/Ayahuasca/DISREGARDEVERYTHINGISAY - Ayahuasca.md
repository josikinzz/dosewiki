*Duration* : 2 - 6 hours
*Normal After Effects* : 1 - 8 hours

Ayahuasca is any of various psychoactive infusions prepared from a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) such as B. caapi (Harmaline) or a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMAs) such as syrian rue (Harmine), taken with a brewed dimethyltryptamine (DMT) containing plant species. There are a large variety of these plants but in western society the most commonly used are either Psychotria viridis leaves or Mimosa Hostillis rootbark.

Harmala alkaloids are MAO-inhibiting beta-carbolines. Harmine and harmaline are classed as selective and reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A). This inhibition of MAO-A allows DMT to diffuse unmetabolized past the membranes in the stomach and small intestine, and eventually cross the blood–brain barrier (which, by itself, requires no MAO-A inhibition) to activate receptor sites in the brain. Without RIMAs or an MAOI, DMT would be oxidised (and thus rendered biologically inactive) by monoamine oxidase enzymes in the digestive tract.

Ayahuasca usually comes in the form of a foul tasting brown liquid that has been used by the indigenous tribes of South America since before recorded history. However, it was first discovered by the western world in the 16th century, when Christian missionaries from Spain and Portugal predictably described it as the work of the devil.

Those who undergo the ayahuasca experience report having profound spiritual revelations regarding their purpose on earth, the true nature of the universe, and deep insight as how to be the best person they possibly can. It is nearly always said that people experience profound positive changes in their life subsequent to consuming ayahuasca. In addition, it is often reported that individuals experience gaining access to so called “higher spiritual dimensions” and making contact with various autonomous entities who serve to act as guides or healers.

The ayahuasca experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of Ayahuasca can be broken down into five components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - The body high of ayahuasca can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft and all-encompassing glow. For some it is manifested spontaneously at different unpredictable points throughout the trip but for others it maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **Stimulation and Sedation** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, ayahuasca is entirely setting dependent. For example, when taken in social settings with fast paced music or during physically strenuous situations such as running, walking, climbing or dancing it becomes stimulating and energetic. In contrast, however, when taken in calm environments such as darkened rooms with comfortable seating it can become relaxing, peaceful and even moderately sedating.
- **Nausea** - In its traditional form, ayahuasca is famous for its purgative properties which can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and cold flashes. This effect is known as la purga or “the purge” and its presence is completely avoidable and dependent on the specific form or recipe of ayahuasca being used. The intense vomiting and occasional diarrhea it induces is often considered by many shamans and experienced users of ayahuasca to be an essential part of the experience as it represents a speculative healing process and the release of negative emotions built up over the course of one’s life. Studies have demonstrated a certain truth behind this speculation and shown that the purging process can clear the body of worms and other tropical parasites. Harmala alkaloids themselves have been shown to expel parasitic worms from the body by either stunning or killing them. Thus, this action is twofold; a direct action on the parasites by these harmala alkaloids (particularly harmine in ayahuasca) works to kill the parasites and parasites are expelled through the increased intestinal motility that is caused by these alkaloids. It’s worth noting that the overall cognitive positivity or negativity of an ayahuasca trip in psychologically balanced individuals depends greatly on how nauseating or purgative the chosen method of preparation is. For example, paranoia, anxiety, delirium and a difficulty stringing thoughts together often immediately manifest themselves during uncomfortable states of nausea for the inexperienced but remain absent when purge free methods of preparation are used.

**Cognitive Effects:**

The head space of ayahuasca is described by many as extremely sober and clear headed in its style when compared to other commonly used psychedelics such as LSD or Psilocin. This is despite the fact that it contains a large number of psychedelic typical and unique cognitive effects.

The most prominent of these typical effects include:

- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Connectivity of thought**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Time distortion**
- **Introspection**
- **Outrospection**
- **Rejuvenation**
- **Deja-Vu**
- **Mindfulness** - This is an effect which is unique within ayahuasca due to how consistently it is manifested and the way in which it can sustain itself for days, weeks or even months after a single high dose experience. This is an extremely beneficial and therapeutic effect for personal psychological health. In contrast, other more commonly used psychedelics such as LSD and Psilocin tend to induce this effect in an exclusive spontaneous and temporary form.
- **Removal of cultural filter**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Direct communication with the subconscious**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**
- **Feelings of interdependent opposites**
- **Delusions**
- **States of unity and interconnectedness** - This is an effect which is unique within ayahuasca due to how consistently it is manifested as an accompanying effect alongside of ego suppression and death. In contrast, other more commonly used psychedelics such as LSD and Psilocin tend to induce this effect rarely at best.
- **Suppression of language** - This effect can be described as a perceived inability or general unwillingness to talk aloud despite feeling perfectly capable of formulating coherent thoughts within the internal narrative. It is much more common among inexperienced users.

**Visual Effects:**

*Enhancements*

Ayahuasca presents a complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally include:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, effects experienced are detailed below:

- **Visual drifting** (*melting, breathing, warping and flowing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion and static in its appearance.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition**
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of Psilocin than LSD. They can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, equal in blurred and sharp edges and equal in rounded and angular corners. At higher dosages they are significantly more likely to result in states of level 7B visual geometry over level 7A.

In terms of their manifestation, they are progressive in nature and continuously self-complexify in settings with little or no visual input and disturbances. For example, darkness will cause the geometry to progressively intensify, but this can immediately be reset back down to base level by simply turning on a bright light or actively performing a physical task which requires any level of concentration.

*Hallucinatory States*

Ayahuasca and other forms of DMT produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of any other commonly used psychedelic. These effects include:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, landscapes, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.

**Auditory Effects:**

The auditory effects of ayahuasca are extremely consistent in occurrence in comparison to that of LSD and psilocin and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- **Enhancements**
- **Distortions**
- **Hallucinations**

**Health Effects, Potential Addiction and Tolerance:**

Research has been made showing the relative physical safety of DMT.

Ayahuasca, has been studied by multidisciplinary groups in Brazil and other countries and it was shown that in reasonable doses in a careful context, it presents no negative cognitive/psychiatric/physical consequences.

In terms of mental health, the very same study showed that users presented elevated levels of happiness and health. Ayahuasca is not physically addictive, and many users experience a frequency self-regulating quality to the drug. This is despite the fact that the substance holds no real tolerance and can be used on a daily basis if it is desired.

As for the harmine or Syrian rue, it is only dangerous when taken in combination with other drugs and it is not necessary to follow a strict tyramine free diet, which is the case with harmaline. So although RIMAs are generally safer than MAOIs, they still have highly dangerous interactions when combined with almost any antidepressant or stimulant, common migraine medications, certain herbs, or even most cold medicines (including decongestants, antihistamines, and cough syrup) as it can cause potentially lethal serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crisis.

**Legal Issues:**

- Internationally, DMT is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances notes, however, that the plants containing it are not subject to international control.
- The legal status in the United States of DMT-containing plants is somewhat questionable. Ayahuasca plants and preparations are legal, as they contain no scheduled chemicals. However, brews made using DMT containing plants are illegal since DMT is a Schedule I drug.
- Religious use in Brazil was legalized after two official inquiries into the tea in the mid-1980s, concluded that ayahuasca is not a recreational drug and has valid spiritual uses.
- In France, as of 2005 almost every single DMT containing plant that could be used to make ayahusca is illegal.

DMT has been made illegal in almost every country. The common botanical sources for it, however, are still legal pretty much everywhere. You can even freely purchase DMT containing plants from specialized ethnobotanical shops on the internet. Harmine and harmaline, are also generally legal, including most of its ethnobotanically common plant sources. In Canada, however, harmaline is a Schedule lll drug.

**Preparation Methods:**

Ayahuasca can be prepared in a number of ways using a variety of different plant sources. For the DMT, the most commonly used ingredients are mimosa hostillis rootbark or acacia rootbark. The harmala alkaloids and inhibitors are usually found within syrian rue seeds or Banisteriopsis caapi leaves. All of these are legal to purchase within most countries and freely available through the use of google.

**Misconceptions:**

There appears to be a general consensus among many online psychedelic communities that ayahuasca is simply too powerful for beginners and that even the most experienced of psychonauts should tread lightly. Some people even go as far as saying that you should not undergo the experience without the guidance of a practicing shaman and always within a traditional environment.

I would like to use this section of the article to express the opinion that these viewpoints are misinformed and at times, unnecessarily elitist. Providing the user can handle nausea or a purge free preparation method has been used, ayahuasca is the most perfect starter psychedelic in existence and not in any way more overwhelming than LSD or mushrooms. It can also be taken in any number of environments (no matter how shamanically inappropriate) but as with any psychedelic, it will only take you to its deepest points within silent darkness.

**Conclusion:**

Ayahuasca is by far my favourite psychedelic. It is extremely easy to make and offers a completely different, but amazing style of trip that needs to be taken much more seriously. If I had to choose a single substance for society to base its civilization around it would be ayahuasca, not LSD and certainly not alcohol.
