## Subjective Experience

Caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant, and is the world’s most popular
and widely used psychoactive drug. It is available via a vast array of beverages,
providing an extremely rich variety of flavours.

It is worth noting that there is significant variation between different botanical
caffeine experiences, and that in the modern era it can also be purchased in other
forms, including powder and tablet.

I personally find that there are two broad types of caffeine experience. One is a
general background stimulation that promotes an alert state of wakefulness. The
other provides a jolt: to counter tiredness or weariness in an urgent manner.

The first type, a relatively benign excitation, gives rise to ritual, social bonding, and
communication. Connoisseurs of particular beverages have emerged, and
sophisticated systems of sub-classification have been honed.

This state of consciousness is also conducive to sustained individual productive
capability, which is of course consistent with post industrial revolution capitalism. In
fact, over the ages the use of caffeine has had a huge influence upon the nature of our
civilisation (see various works by Michael Pollan for further information).

For millions of people, caffeine consumption is habitual; to the point that addiction
is not an unreasonable characterisation. However, as with another currently legal
intoxicant, alcohol, heavy users often respond with indignation at the very idea.

As generally known, higher doses of caffeine or evening consumption of coffee (for
example), can be an impediment to sleep. Other potentially more serious issues can
also ensue.

High or excessive doses can give rise to jitteriness, or can produce symptoms like
dizziness, irritability, headache and sometimes diarrhoea. Should symptoms like
vomiting, chest pains, rapid heartbeat, breathing difficulties or convulsions occur
immediate medical help should be summoned.

Partially due to familiarity there is little public awareness or consideration of its long
term effects with respect to both health and quality of life. Further, almost every
other stimulant is legislated against, and stigmatised, leaving little scope for rational
comparison. None of this, however, is intended to imply that its positive safety
profile is not generally merited.

Regarding dosage, as a general guide, a standard cup of brewed coffee is often cited
as containing approximately 100mg of caffeine. Erowid lists the caffeine content of a
number of other common beverages on the following web page:

DEATH BY CAFFEINE
Yes, it is possible to fatally overdose on caffeine. This is obviously very rare, but
deaths have been recorded for consumption via various forms, including energy
drinks, pills, and powder.

So just how extreme does your dose have to be to put your life in jeopardy? Internet
figures vary somewhat, but the verywellmind.com website is not untypical in citing
the following figures:

```
"In humans, more than 150-200mg per kg of body weight, or 5 to 10 grams
of total caffeine ingested is considered lethal. Consuming 3mg per kg of body
weight above the baseline dietary exposure is considered the ‘adverse effect
level’”
```
Whilst the odds are remote, there is risk, so I would simply suggest that you don’t go
absolutely crazy with it.
