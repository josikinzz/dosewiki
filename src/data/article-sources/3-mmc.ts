## Subjective Experience

3-MMC emerged from Sweden in 2012, and has frequently been sold as an
alternative to mephedrone. Despite this, I found relatively little online information
on it, which in itself indicates the need to tread carefully. This feeling was
exacerbated by a number of suggestions of toxicity and in particular, heart valve
issues.

Regarding the experience, users generally report a painful insufflation, significant
stimulation and a nice buzz.

I enter the fray by pouring 90mg from the baggy.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I snort 45mg. It hurts, with one eye watering a little. [12:36].
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
T+0:15 After on 15 minutes I am nicely buzzed. I am warm and sweaty and the
general stimulation is quite strong. The availability of horn is already evident,
and the rush of serotonin is unmistakable.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:40 A firm heady intensity has been established within the overall buzz,
and I remain hot and clammy.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 I feel a little lower than I was 10 minutes ago, so I snort the other
45mg, this time with my left nostril. It is again painful and my left eye waters.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+ 1:20 Against my better judgement I pour another 80mg, separate 20mg
and snort. I snort another 20mg with the left nostril 10 minutes later. I note
that the potential sexual payload is intense.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:00 I hit another 20mg with my right, and 20 minutes later a final 20mg is
hoovered with my left. I am flying, having consumed 170mg in total.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
2:30 Did I say final? I weigh another 50mg and split it into two lines. I snort
one. I recognize that this is now a binge.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
3:00 I insufflate the other 25mg. I am absolutely wired and I want to stay like
this. My higher brain is struggling to control my impulses.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
4:00 I weigh and snort another 30mg, which takes me to 250mg. Five minutes
later I smoke some weed to help stop the compulsive binging. Fortunately this
works and I am able to regain control.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
7:00 I’m still very zoned out at this point but with less zip than earlier. I now
retire to bed with 0.5mg of etizolam.
\`\`\`
The nights sleep was surprisingly good, in that I remember nothing. In the morning I
still feel a little out of it. I am also tired, but not overly drained. I take my morning
walk, pop some post-stim vitamins and supplements, and hope for the best. I may
engage some cannabis later if I still feel rough.

This was extremely moreish, and created a full-on binge. Its potential use as a
chemsex drug was evident throughout, as per social media commentary. I also felt
that it was more similar to amphetamine than to its sister 4-mmc (mephedrone).

I made a number of mistakes during this session. One was that I underestimated the
compulsive redosing intensity. I should have limited my immediate supply and put a
lid on it. Another error, stemming from this, was that I didn’t pre-measure the top-
up doses, meaning that I was using the scales whilst high as a kite, which is clearly
not a great idea. In truth I felt a bit rough most of the next day and for part of the
day after.

With the issues and risks referred to earlier this isn’t one I will return to.

**3-Methylmethcathinone** (also known as **3-MMC** or **metaphedrone** ) is a novel [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) - [entactogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) substance of the [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cathinone) class. It is a structural analog of [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) (4-MMC) and was created as a legal designer drug after the banning of 4-MMC. The mechanism of action is not fully studied, but [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and norepinephrine releasing activity is known to be involved.

3-MMC first appeared on the online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market shortly after the banning of the massively popular mephedrone. Its first emergence was recorded in Europe in 2012 . It is a prominent example of a contemporary [designer drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) specifically chosen to mimic and/or replace the functional and structural features of its recently-controlled predecessors.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) , [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [enhanced empathy and sociability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement) , [relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . The effects are reported to be similar to those of mephedrone, which is sometimes described as a hybrid of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) .

However, it is described as being slightly less entactogenic and more stimulating than mephedrone, and some report more side effects. Like mephedrone and [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) , it is associated with [compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) and abuse due to its powerful, short-lived [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoric) rush. It is typically administered via [insufflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insufflation) , although [oral](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Oral) and [injection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Injection) [routes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes) have been observed.

Limited data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 3-MMC, and it has little history of human use. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Preliminary evidence suggests chronic use (i.e. high dose, repeat administration) may carry neurotoxic and cardiotoxic risks. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] It is reported to produce the symptoms of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) depletion with overuse.

It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

3-MMC, or 3-Methylmethcathinone, belongs to a class of synthetic organic compounds known as cathinones. Cathinones are a sub-category of [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamines) , meaning they share the core amphetamine structure of a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain, and an additional methyl substitution at R α .

Cathinones are differentiated by their ketone substitution on the beta carbon of the amphetamine skeleton, meaning they are β-keto-amphetamines. 3-MMC has two methyl substitutions on its cathinone skeleton, one at R 3 of the phenyl ring, and a second at the nitrogen group R N .

It is a structural analog of [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) (4-methylmethcathinone), meaning it is identical in structure except for the placement of the methyl group at R 4 instead of R 3

It is a chiral compound with a stereocenter at R 2 of the propane side-chain. Two enantiomers exist: R-3-MMC and S-3-MMC. Due to the similarity with cathinone proper, the S form is thought to be more potent than the R form [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] .

The hydrochloride salt of 3-MMC occurs as a white crystalline powder. It has a melting point of 193.2 ± 0.2°C (hydrochloride salt) and a boiling point of 280.5 ± 23.0°C at 760 mm Hg. It is sparingly soluble in PBS; slightly soluble in ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, and dimethyl formamide [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] .

## Pharmacology

Due to the lack of research regarding the substance, all discussion regarding the pharmacology of it is purely speculation based upon its structure and subjective effect similarities to other [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) and [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) such as [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and [2-FMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FMA) .

3-MMC most likely acts as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) . This means that it effectively boosts the levels of the [monoamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine) [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) , and [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) in the brain by binding to and partially blocking the transporter proteins that normally remove them from the synaptic cleft. This allows the neurotransmitters to accumulate in the brain, resulting in [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - 3-MMC is reported to be extremely stimulating and energetic. It can encourage physical activities like running or dancing, which makes it popular for parties and raves. 
The style of stimulation can be described as "forced". This means that at higher doses, it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still as jaw clenching, involuntarily body shakes and vibrations become present.
 
Additionally, persistent or wave-like feelings of deep [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) and [relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) may be paradoxically present, typically at moderate to strong doses.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of 3-MMC can be characterized as a moderate to extreme euphoric tingling sensation that encompasses the entire body. It is capable of becoming overwhelmingly pleasurable at higher doses. This sensation maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - Physical euphoria is very prominent when used responsibly (i.e. reasonable dosing and spacing between experiences) and can lead to profound feelings of social and physical [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) .
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Tactile hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_hallucination)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)**
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Decreased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** ”
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Nausea is most commonly present during the [come up](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Come_up) phase of the experience, and at higher doses, but has been reported to occur spontaneously in those who are thought to be susceptible to it.
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Dry mouth](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dry_mouth)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** - This effect is typically very strong. It is reported that this effect is often more prominent than that experienced from using [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] This effect may contribute to excessive redosing, which is a commonly reported effect for this substance.
- **[Orgasm suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orgasm_suppression)**
- **[Vibrating vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vibrating_vision)** - At high doses, the user's eyeballs may begin to spontaneously wiggle back and forth in a rapid motion, causing the vision to become blurry and temporarily out of focus. This is a condition known as [nystagmus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nystagmus) .
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This effect when experienced alongside [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) can often lead to users mildly or intensely clenching their jaw muscles, sometimes even to the point where the individual’s facial expression begins to change. This is sometimes colloquially called “gurning” and is typically only experienced in common to high dosages.
- **[Shortness of breath](/w/index.php?title=Shortness_of_breath&action=edit&redlink=1)** - Due to the strong vasoconstriction 3-MMC causes, the blood flow to organs can be limited. When this happens in the lungs or in the chest muscles, the vasoconstriction can cause a blood oxygen deficiency and difficulty breathing.
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - This is a rare effect but can likely happen in those predisposed to them, especially when taking heavy doses or redosing while in physically taxing conditions such as being dehydrated, undernourished, overheated or fatigued. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) - The dopaminergic effects of 3-MMC likely contributes to this.**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium)** & **[Confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion)** - This effect typically only occurs with overly high doses, and is associated with temperature dysregulation and overheating, particularly when 3-MMC is taken in crowded, physically strenuous environments that leaves the user unable to cool off, rest, or rehydrate adequately.
- **[Time compression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - Strong feelings of time compression are commonly produced by 3-MMC and speed up the experience of time noticeably.
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
3-MMC presents an array of visual enhancements which are mild in comparison to traditional psychedelics, but still distinctly present. These generally include:
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
 
#### Suppressions
 
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**

## Reagent results

Exposing compounds to the reagents gives a colour change which is indicative of the compound under test.

## Toxicity and harm potential

As with most [research chemicals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemicals) , the long-term effects of 3-MMC have not been researched extensively enough to provide accurate information of its risks and harm.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , the chronic use of 3-MMC can be considered extremely addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage. It is said that this compound is considerably more addictive than that of [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) .

Tolerance to many of the effects of 3-MMC develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 3-MMC presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of 3-MMC all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with 3-MMC should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - 3-MMC may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.

#### Serotonin syndrome risk

Combinations with the following substances can cause dangerously high [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) levels. [Serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) requires immediate medical attention and can be fatal if left untreated.

- **MAOIs** - Such as [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , phenelzine, selegiline, and moclobemide.
- **Serotonin releasers** - Such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) , [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) and [αMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91MT) .
- **SSRIs** - Such as citalopram and sertraline
- **[SNRIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNRIs)** - Such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) and venlafaxine
- **5-HTP**

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-Methylmethcathinone*

3-Methylmethcathinone (3-MMC), also known as metaphedrone, is a designer drug from the substituted cathinone family. 3-MMC is a monoamine transporter substrate (a substance acted upon by monoamine transporters in the brain) that potently releases and inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, as well as displaying moderate serotonin releasing activity.
3-Methylmethcathinone is a structural isomer of mephedrone (4-methylmethcathinone), and as such is illegal via blanket bans in many countries that have banned mephedrone. However, 3-MMC has still appeared on the recreational drug market as an alternative to mephedrone, and was first identified being sold in Sweden in 2012. Unlike some other synthetic cathinones, 3-MMC has been evaluated in at least one large mammal study.

## History

3-MMC was first encountered in Sweden in 2012; it was created as a designer drug following the control in many countries of the related compound mephedrone. It was sold as a research chemical, usually in powdered form. There is no known or reported medical use of 3-MMC; it is primarily used recreationally.

## Side effects

Side effects of 3-MMC include increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, and decreased appetite.

### Toxicity

A total of 27 fatalities with at least some exposure to 3-MMC have been confirmed as of March 2022. Eighteen of the 27 reported fatalities involved multiple drugs of abuse, usually opioids and uppers ("speedballs"). Of the 13 cases that specified sex, 12 deaths were male and 1 death was female. Of the 7 males whose age was reported, the median age was 27. The fatalities see a wide range of blood concentrations, from 249 to 1600 ng/mL.  The route of administration in any of these fatalities is not clear.
Of the presumably nine monointoxication deaths involving only 3-MMC that have occurred, two monointoxication cases were reported in the Netherlands and one was reported in France. The death in France was determined to be an accidental overdose. In addition, there has been 291 reported cases of non-fatal 3-MMC intoxications. 213 of these cases (75%) were reported in Poland alone, and 50 cases (17%) were reported in Sweden.
The toxicokinetics of 3-MMC are thought to be similar to those for mephedrone. The first human study conducted in 14 healthy human volunteers concluded that "...low to moderate doses of 3-MMC were well tolerated and safe and that potential health risks might only occur at high or excessive doses of 3-MMC."

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

3-MMC potently inhibits the reuptake of monoamines in the human norepinephrine (NET) and dopamine (DAT) transporters. It also acts as a triple releasing agent of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, similar to many other cathinones. As a releasing agent, it is more selective for dopamine and especially norepinephrine, suggesting that it has stronger amphetamine-like stimulant properties compared to mephedrone or MDMA.
3-MMC also binds to serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C receptors and adrenergic α1A and α2A receptors. It binds much more strongly to the adrenergic receptors than the serotonergic 5-HT receptors, although it still retains significant serotonin-releasing activity (292 nM in one study). Other receptor interaction data have also been reported. In contrast to mephedrone, 3-MMC is inactive as a serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist.
3-MMC is inactive as an agonist of the rat and human TAAR1 (EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration = >10,000 nM). Conversely, it is a low-potency weak partial agonist of the mouse TAAR1 (EC50 = 3,800 nM, EmaxTooltip maximal efficacy = 25%).

### Pharmacokinetics

The oral bioavailability of 3-methylmethcathinone was determined at 7% in one pig study, with peak blood concentrations (Tmax) attained within 5 to 10 minutes, and a relatively short half-life of 50 minutes. Concentration in blood plasma dropped below detectability 24 hours after oral ingestion.  Decreased feeding behavior resulted in weight loss for some.
The metabolism of 3-MMC is not well-described. Known metabolites include 3-methylephedrine and 3-methylnorephedrine. A possible metabolic pathway is β-keto-reduction followed by N-demethylation.

## Chemistry

### Structure

3-Methylmethcathinone's IUPAC name is 2-(methylamino)-1-(3-methylphenyl)propan-1-one). It is 
one of many synthetic cathinones, designer drugs related to amphetamines. It is a structural isomer of mephedrone, and controlled as such. It can also be seen as the β-keto analog of 3-methylmethamphetamine
3-MMC contains a chiral center at the C-2 carbon. Therefore, two enantiomers exist, the R and S enantiomer. It is assumed that the S form is more potent due to its similarity to cathinone, but further research is needed to confirm this.

### Synthesis

There are several ways to synthesize 3-MMC. One route adapted from Power et al. is to add ethylmagnesium bromide to 3-methylbenzaldehyde (I) to form the product 1-(3-methylphenyl)-1-propanol (II). This product is then oxidized by pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) on silica gel to the ketone (III) and brominated with hydrobromic acid to yield the bromoketone (IV). This bromoketone is reacted with ethanolic methylamine to produce the 3-MMC free base (V), which can be converted to the hydrochloride salt (VI) by addition of ethereal hydrogen chloride (VI).

## Recreational use

### Effects

As with mephedrone, users of 3-MMC typically report effects such as an elevated mood, pleasant body sensations, feelings of love and empathy, euphoria, greater appreciation of music, heightened libido, and increased confidence and sociability.
Adverse effects range from aggression, dry mouth, and jaw clenching, to more serious effects such as hyponatremia, seizures, hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis.

### Abuse

Due to its fleeting duration and dopaminergic effects, 3-MMC is highly addictive and commonly abused. Repeated dosing within a sitting is typical, sometimes using different routes, primarily oral and intranasal. Common self-reported doses range from 50 to 150 mg, up to single 500 mg doses. Intranasal administration, or snorting, is the most common route of administration, followed by oral administration, followed by other routes, such as rectal administration and injection into the bloodstream.
Users may dose repeatedly in order to extend the drugs duration, leading to 0.5—2 gram "sessions" that can span an evening. Single-dose effects last from 30 to 60 minutes, typically peaking around 10-minutes post-dose. In a questionnaire-based study of self-reported 3-MMC users in Slovenia, it was found that 88% of users insufflated the drug while 42% took it orally. The study did not find any instances of users injecting 3-MMC. Moreover, 26% of the users reported taking more than 1.5 grams of 3-MMC in a single sitting and over 50% reported having consumed more than 0.5 grams in a single sitting.

### Available forms

3-Methylmethcathinone is commonly encountered as a white/off-white crystalline or pasty solid. It can be found sold in capsules. It is assumed to be a racemic mixture like mephedrone.

## Legal status

In the United States, 3-MMC is illegal as a positional isomer of the controlled substance mephedrone It was explicitly designated as a controlled substance on 13 December 2023.
Since October 2015, 3-MMC is a controlled substance in China.
3-MMC is banned in the Czech Republic.
3-MMC was not banned in 2016 by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) after a critical review. However, following its subsequent abuse beginning in 2019, this decision was overturned and it was placed into schedule II of the 1971 convention in March 2023.
Effective 28 October 2021, 3-MMC has been scheduled under the Dutch Opium Law and is therefore illegal in the Netherlands.
3-MMC was given narcotic status in India on 8 February 2024.

## Research

3-MMC is under development for use as a pharmaceutical drug in the potential treatment of dyskinesias. As of August 2023, it is in preclinical research for this indication. The drug is being developed by Clearmind Medicine.
3-MMC is currently being developed as a medicine by the American biotech company MindMed. They have filed for a patent to use 3-MMC for problems such as social anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and as an adjunct in couples therapy.
3-MMC is also undergoing clinical trials for its use in treating menstrual symptoms. A successful trial has been completed in the University of Maastricht. These efforts are led by the small Dutch company Period Pill. The company has filed for patent coverage in Canada, Mexico, Croatia, the United States, Morocco, Japan, Brazil, Poland, Hungary, and Korea.
The first in-human clinical study of 3-MMC was published in December 2024.
