### INTENSITY

2 to 4

### MATERIAL

Ecstasy is a synthetic compound developed
in 1914 as a potential dietary aid. However, its psychoactive effects were
not discovered until the mid-Seventies. It was used widely in therapy from
this time until 1985 when it was made illegal. Its chemical name is 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(MDMA), commonly known as "X", "E", or "Adam." It usually comes as a white
crystalline powder or made into tablets.
### DOSAGE

125 mg. (1/8th of a gram) is generally
considered a single dose of ecstasy. This amount will produce an experience
lasting about four hours total, with the intensity dropping off a couple
hours into the high. Many recreational X users do what's called "double
dosing," taking an additional 125 mg. as soon as the first dose starts
wearing off. My personal preference is to take one large dose of 150 to
170 mg. which produces an intense but short lasting experience. I prefer
this method because it reduces the side effects a double dose of X can
produce. Ecstasy should be taken on an empty stomach. If one ingests it
on a full stomach they might not get high at all, or may have a delayed
trip.
### THE HIGH

When ecstasy is coming on it feels
fantastically exhilarating. Users report feeling blissed out, energetic,
and emotionally opened and loving. The ride up usually lasts 30 minutes
to an hour. One then reaches a plateau where they'll be for the next one
to two hours, followed by a slow drift back to baseline. Taking multiple
doses will change the timing of these periods.
Most X users report that their first
couple of experiences are like being in heaven, and leave a strong impression.
Experiences after this are still enjoyable but can't match the initial
ride. After numerous X trips, I've concluded that lasting and beneficial
experiences are derived primarily from deep bonding with other people while
one is high. Nearly all of my better X experiences happened when I was
with either one other person or a small group of close friends. This framework
for using ecstasy closely parallels how it was used in therapeutic settings.
Ecstasy's ability to allow emotions to flow more easily and naturally,
and to create an atmosphere of nonjudgment and acceptance, is conducive
to deep bonding and healing. I find that the more general feeling of "connectedness,"
which users report feeling with larger groups of people at events such
as raves, tends to dissipate, leaving one feeling hollow by the time the
drug wears off.
Ecstasy is not really "psychedelic"
in the same way as other substances in this journal. It does not have the
potential to produce the fine level of detail in hallucinations that is
possible with substances like LSD or mushrooms. Indeed many users experience
no visual phenomena at all with ecstasy. Ecstasy also does not heighten
one's senses to the level of infinite sharpness that is common with the
traditional psychedelics. Ecstasy is sometimes called an empathogen because
of its ability to facilitate emotional empathy and communication. I've
also heard it referred to as a "selective psychedelic." I think this describes
it the best. Ecstasy opens one's mind in a psychedelic way, but much of
the personality and perceptual structure are left intact that would be
diminished on other, non-selective psychedelics. This makes ecstasy usable
by many people who could not handle the effects of something like LSD.
With ecstasy one does not go through the dissolution of identity, and can
not get into the multitude of "weird" head spaces that can be experienced
during an LSD trip. More than any other psychedelic, ecstasy seems to produce
very similar experiences in different people, generally described as loving
and emotionally opened. While advantageous to the novice psychedelic user,
ecstasy's limited experience-producing range provides a low ceiling to
the more adventurous psychonaut.
Ecstasy rarely produces a bad experience,
but there are some negative aspects to ecstasy's signature. I find ecstasy
can be one of the hardest psychedelics to come down from, particularly
if I've double dosed. I tend to feel depressed as the blissful ecstasy
feelings slip away. My previous personality feels "sticky" at this point,
and I feel I have less options choosing my return personality than I would
returning from the traditional psychedelics. Ecstasy also produces some
side effects: a speedy feeling throughout the experience, often accompanied
by jaw clenching (it is in the amphetamine family), a loss of appetite,
and sometimes a hangover the next day.
### SAFETY FACTORS

Ecstasy is the only psychedelic I've
used which leaves me feeling any less than perfect the next day, and this
experience seems to be common among most users of ecstasy. Based on this,
I suspect that ecstasy is not the most benign substance to take into one's
body, and I've reduced my consumption to an infrequent basis.
There have been a few cases of people
who died from heat stroke following the use of ecstasy in dance clubs.
They became dehydrated after dancing for hours without drinking any fluids.
Although this is rare, it's a reminder for one to pay attention to their
body's basic needs while using ecstasy or any other substance.
I've read numerous clinical articles
on ecstasy. There does not appear to be conclusive evidence one way or
the other as to whether it causes any type of damage to humans, or whether
any potential damage caused is permanent or reversible. However, many who
are concerned with safe use have gleaned suggestions from these articles.
Although large doses of ecstasy produced
some neurotoxicity [1] in lab animals, damage
was significantly less to non-existent with a smaller dose (equivalent
to 100-150 mg. for most humans.) Other experiments showed that a single
dose of Prozac (a prescription anti-depressant drug) will completely block
the neurotoxic effects ecstasy can produce in lab animals.
The Prozac can be taken up to six hours
after the ecstasy. I've taken Prozac toward the end of about 20 X trips,
and in most cases I've felt better the next day than I normally do after
taking ecstasy alone. Prozac is considered a controversial drug. Some of
the people to whom it was prescribed on a regular basis claim it gave them
suicidal tendencies. Apparently a small percentage of the people who try
Prozac have some type of negative mental reaction. Several people I know
have first tried Prozac by itself, to see what their reaction to it is,
before taking it at the end of an ecstasy trip.
As mentioned above, taking ecstasy
without Prozac, especially multiple doses, has a tendency to give one a
hangover the next day. This can leave one feeling physically drained and
mentally frizzled. One's chances of feeling bad the next day can be greatly
reduced by taking just a single dose of X. Another method of reducing or
eliminating this hangover is to take amino acids such as
DL
-Phenylalanine
(DLPA) or other neurotransmitter precursors prior to and after ingesting
the ecstasy. These nutrients are available from health food and vitamin
stores and are frequently included in "smart drinks." I've also read that
all of the phenethylamine drugs produce free radicals, and that taking
anti-oxidant formulas, also available at most health food stores, can help
prevent damage from their use.
### COMBINATIONS

LSD - Ecstasy is frequently
taken with LSD, a combination commonly known as "candyflip." I find the
feelings produced by this combination can be much deeper and more visual
than on ecstasy alone. But since the ecstasy has a much heavier signature
than the acid, I tend to experience more of an intensified ecstasy high,
and lose the depth I would experience on acid alone. If taken around the
same time, the ecstasy will wear off first, while the residual high from
the acid provides for a smoother recovery.
NITROUS OXIDE - Using nitrous
with X is growing in popularity, particularly in the rave scene. See the
LSD chapter for information on nitrous oxide.
Ecstasy may be significantly intensified
and possibly dangerous if combined with MAO inhibitors.
See the 2C-B
chapter.

in these cases as a reduction in the levels of serotinin, a neurotransmitter
present in the brain tissue.
