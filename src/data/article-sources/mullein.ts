## Subjective Experience

It took me a while to convince myself that this was psychoactive, but citations from
serious Internet sites finally persuaded me that there might well be something to it,
even though this is likely to be mild. For example:

\`\`\`
"The whole Mullein plant possesses slightly sedative and narcotic
properties." ~ altnature.com
\`\`\`
Mullein is commonly sold as tea, but on occasion it is also claimed that it is
smokable. For example, smokable.com states that:

\`\`\`
“Mullein is mildly relaxing, helps to promote calm feelings, and fights
against anxiety. Typically mullein is added to smoking blends to reduce
harshness. It burns slowly and steadily, with thick plumes of white smoke
that’s soothing to the throat.”
\`\`\`

I will be testing both routes, starting with the tea, but I will confess upfront that my
sample has been lying in a drawer for some years, so could hardly be described as
fresh.

\`\`\`
At about 2pm on a sunny afternoon I brew approximately 5g in my usual
teapot.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
It has a sort of tangy-peppermint odour to it but as I sip the taste is rather
muted and relatively bland. It is by no means unpleasant, with what I would
describe as a slightly mouldy aftertaste. There are possibly antiseptic-like
nasal tones in there too.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Perhaps the process itself helps but as I sit, sip and stroll around I do sense a
tiny degree of sedation, or perhaps what could be better described as
relaxation. We are still in potential placebo territory but I am quite
comfortable.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Twenty minutes into the exercise sedation does probably become a better
word. This is extremely mild but it does appear to be active, as I feel more
chilled and calmer than I did earlier. There is indeed something to it, as a sort
of anxiolytic headiness is in play.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Within an hour or two the intensity has waned, although I remain generally
calm.
\`\`\`
A week or so later I decided to embark upon the smoking experiment.

\`\`\`
At about 4:15pm I load a bong with a large pinch and take a few decent tokes.
The first is a little harsh (bear in mind that I don’t smoke tobacco) but the rest
are quite easy to inhale.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
A gentle soothing headiness has emerged as I sit and contemplate. Again, this
is nothing to write home about, relatively, but it is there and it is quite
pleasant.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
About 15 minutes in, my general disposition and mood is still noticeably
altered, and the general calmness remains.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
After half an hour or so, it is fair to say that some of the heady feeling has
dissipated. It is still active but is now more of a background post-trip-type
sedation than an active ride. These embers gradually fade over subsequent
hours.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
As with the tea, I didn’t have the best night’s sleep, although this could easily
be coincidence.
\`\`\`
Mullein delivered more than I had expected. It is probably another one for which
expectation will have consequence: expect a lot and you will be disappointed; expect
little and you may be pleasantly surprised. I fell into the latter category.

  "wikipedia": `# Verbascum
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbascum*

Verbascum is a genus of over 450 species of flowering plants, common name mullein (), in the figwort family Scrophulariaceae. They are native to Europe and Asia, with the highest species diversity in the Mediterranean.
Mullein or "mullein leaf" often refers to the leaves of Verbascum thapsus, the great or common mullein, which is frequently used in herbal medicine.

## Description

Verbascum are biennial or perennial plants, rarely annuals or subshrubs, growing to 0.5 to 3.0 m (1.6 to 9.8 ft) tall. The plants first form a dense rosette of leaves at ground level, subsequently sending up a tall flowering stem. Biennial plants form the rosette the first year and the stem the following season. The leaves are spirally arranged, often densely hairy, though glabrous (hairless) in some species. The flowers have five symmetrical petals; petal colours in different species include yellow (most common), orange, red-brown, purple, blue, or white. The fruit is a capsule containing numerous minute seeds.

## Cultivation

In gardening and landscaping, the mulleins are valued for their tall narrow stature and for flowering over a long period of time, even in dry soils. 
These cultivars have received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:

'Gainsborough' (Cotswold Group)
'Letitia'
'Pink Domino' (Cotswold Group)
'Tropic Sun'
