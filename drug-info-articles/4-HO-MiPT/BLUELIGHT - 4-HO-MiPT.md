It is thought to be a serotonergic psychedelic, similar to magic mushrooms, LSD and mescaline.[citation needed] Its molecular structure and pharmacological effects resemble those of the tryptamine psilocin, which is the primary psychoactive chemical in magic mushrooms.

In all this derailing I forgot to ask. Plugged dosage? I have some coming with a shipment and I have never plugged it before. Start at 5? 10?


I haven't had miprocin in years but I don't remember it having much in the way of side effects except insane giggles.

When you tried it, was it the hcl or the fumarate version?  You could be right about the purity issue, because even at 20mg by itself it was pretty mild, probably equal to 1-1.5g shrooms or 1 tab of acid.  Though I think the original dosage levels were for the hcl version, and I think the fumarate is around 2/3 of the hcl in strength, so I would align dose a bit higher than recommended.


Plugging, yaa, you'll have to ask someone who tried it.  I guess you could start at 5 and work your way up, of course, but ya know I have no idea how much stronger plugging might be.


And yeah, I noticed that many other researchers/scientists are intrigued by his work.  It makes we wonder why he isn't more widely recognized, especially on this side of the Atlantic.  He seems to be the pioneer of all these chems.

I'm fairly certain that my 4-HO-MiPT was fumarate... But who knows, it was a long time ago but after the whole hygroscopic 4-AcO-MiPT debacle I thought they went all fumarate on the 4-subs... Dunno. Definitely got my 4-HO-MIPT wayyyyyyy after the AcO batch from the ill-fated R*C company...

I see.  Yeah, idk I have a hard time believing you can be overwhelmed by 4-ho-mipt.  I mean, you know high I've taken it but still, I know for sure I wouldn't be able to handle high doses of dpt, dmt, 5-meo-amt, etc.  So if you've handled those chems well, which I know I wouldn't be able to just based on their effects profile, miprocin just isn't that...inherently intense?


But yeah, I'll wait for someone else to chime in who could give you a better answer.  All I can say, in my biased opinion, is that this a really fun and nice chem to trip on.

Miprocin always seemed more like a fun drug to me. Even when mixed with MDA pills it didn't result in a blackout, just a mess of us all laughing our asses off for hours and stopping because we thought what the fuck were we laughing about which made us laugh even harder, very mild neon visuals, and massive color enhancement. Although at one point my buddy went and hid in the bathroom in the bath tub thinking we were mad at him and then left to sit at the bus stop so my friend Cassie and I literally skipped our way to the bus stop to go find him. 


There's not much there in the mental side. I think the only negative i found was that it dehydrated me a bit, otherwise it was just a light mellow trip. 4-AcO-MiPT was more intense as I remember it actually but still not by a ton. 


I don't think miprocin ever really goes anywhere at the doses most of us have done and not many of us are keen on the heroic dosing when we have 4-subs that will blow you out of this world like 4-AcO-DMT, 4-HO-DiPT, and apparently 4-AcO-MET (can't wait til that gets here) without worrying about the cost or potential for negative side effects from high dose miprocin.

Yaa, the palms and soles will sweat like a mofo, especially on high doses.  I think water is the best to drink on it.  All of that definitely fits a miprocin trip, so obviously you know what to expect.  There were a few in the last thread that got hit hard by some mental happenings, so I guess ymmv for all of us as a whole.  But yeah, it carries that fun, humorous side just as well as shrooms.


It's milder and easier-going compared to even shrooms, for me anything 50mg or less was a mild trip mentally.  I like the visuals better though, but then metocin has even better visuals.  It's like the vision gets more character, wild and bright.


Yuup, for whatever reason, miprocin doesn't start messing with the mind until a breakthrough dose occurs.  I've tried a straight 100mg dose, and though I hallucinated all sorts of stuff, I never felt lost, overwhelmed or had difficulty keeping thoughts together.


I have no idea if this is the case, but I'm thinking that after I had abused mdma so much, these 4 sub trypts just don't hit me as hard as it should.  I'm basing it purely on the guess that they all work on the serotonergic system, and how I seem to need higher doses of all of them.  Maybe my brain got fried too many times?  From mdma to lsd, and now 5 mapb to miprocin, I've hit a wall in terms of trip levels.  Though I've never taken more than 5 tabs of acid, and that just sent me into a bad trip so I never took more than that.  However, I've always recovered from bad trips pretty easily.


Heh, that's a good point, dmt is one that scared me shitless because my friend who takes all kinds of hardcore stuff (IV and insufflates stuff too and all that) flipped out on that one.  Haha, he's the one I also gave miprocin to quite often, I think it was either the 50 or 70mg cap, but on his first time he sat on a chair for hours because he couldn't move, lol.  I had to remind him to blink sometimes too.  That was the funniest crap ever, well at the time.  He asked for it, and I told him to start at 20mg, but when I told him about the 150mg trip he wanted to take that much too.  And I said no, lolol.  So I think I gave him a 50, but I forgot now.


Yeah, I guess it depends on what people look for in a substance.  I like to have fun and be happy on my trips.  Seems kind of shallow, but I treat substances as recreational enhancements.  Thusly, miprocin is a good fit.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Plugged tryptamines (and most things) are about twice the strength of an oral dose, so that's a good benchmark to use when determining a plugged dose.

Gonna mix a 30/30 miprocin and metocin combo in the same cap right now and take it next weekend.  May mix with one Red Toyota to see if this will bring some of the magic back.


I'll report back in a week or so.

Does anyone else have this chem?  Am I the only one currently taking this on a trial run here?  This one is real good, but optimal set and setting makes it even better.  Well, like most psychedelics.


I've been thorough with this one, and after some combinations, I think I'm ready to ramp it up higher.  Looking back, I'm surprised people have had bad trips on this one.  I thought it was easy-going even on high doses.  It's just as good as mushrooms but with better visuals and euphoria, and minus the crap breath.  Personally, I can't stand that part though I've tolerated it every time.  I do think shrooms are more mind-fucky than this one.


Ugh, I'll be getting some hcl mescaline soon, still have these two trypts, 2C-I, kandy, weed and I might also get some 2C-E and DOC.  There's too much shit to try.


Stock up for the holidays guys!  I'm gonna get fried, baked and burned starting next week.  I'm staying clean until then so that I'll be ready for it.  ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I started with 20mg twice, then 150mg (accidentally, I thought it was 5 mapb), then from 50-100mg about five or six times.  And then I mixed it with metocin 20/20 each.

I've only taken MiPT and its analogues a few times, but for me:


- 4-HO-MiPT was less dramatic qualitatively than mushrooms and the same visionary intensity

- instead of having an earthy, natural vibe to me it feels not only 'pure' and synthetic but also weird, atypical, inconsistent, potentially alienating and indetermined: as if visions, effects and memories can be activated non-specifically. There isn't that much of a theme for me, not that much that's recognizable and constant. Comparing to other tryptamines that is. Part is generic tryptamine and another part I just cannot put my finger on. The weirdness can be uncomfortable for me, but it is interesting and surprising for that reason.

That's a good description though.  The waving and breathing effect is definitely generic for trypts.  Well, at least from the ones I've tried.  Miprocin feels lighter on the mind and more recreational than mushrooms.  But that's why I like it.  It has something resembling a warm aura or atmosphere, just emanating from all the senses except taste.  It made smoking cigs taste crappier than usual.  The experience does feel kind of forced and mechanical, including that saliva taste in the back of the throat, but the mood is lifted in an identical way to shrooms.  


It's nice to get more descriptions and trial notes in here.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Ime, miprocin doesn't come anywhere close to the mental intensity of acid or shrooms.  I'm old now, so I like to relax and enjoy my days.

im assuming when you said you too it within the 50-100 mg range it was because you were dosing frequently and were building a tolerance?

Kind of.  For example, 20 mg was a light-medium dose for me.  But mostly it was the 150 that boosted my tolerance that high.  From 50-100, it probably would've hit me harder if I upped it that way.

Neither my trip with 4-ho-mipt alone and my trip with it combined with other psychedelics was very positive. But combined with MXE it sent me on one of the wildest rides I've ever experienced.

Hmm, I didn't write a full trip report, which I regret now because I remembered it so much better back then.


It's on... [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/154051-The-Big-amp-Dandy-4-HO-MiPT-Thread-Part-1/page24](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/154051-The-Big-amp-Dandy-4-HO-MiPT-Thread-Part-1/page24)


It was my first post here too.  It's around halfway down.


Yeah, this one is a bit mind-fucky.  I definitely did panic at first because of the intensity and suddenness.  It's hard to generalize because of the many different responses from psychedelics, and my own bias from abusing lsd when I was younger.  Whereas now, I might think any hardcore psych is easy to handle if I were to try them.  Or the other way around, if I took this back then I might think this one is hardcore too.


I guess I just don't feel like finding out.  I enjoy the stuff that's available right now anyways.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Have a gram that just passed customs... But now I'm doing 60mg of DXM a day to stop drinking (again) so I'm going to have to see how it works but mushrooms and DXM work I think..... Making my own post. Just saying that Kl519 is not alone.... And don't underestimate this one... Taken on the come down of MDA this drug gave me one of only two trips in my life where we were all laughing so hard but didn't know why and couldn't stop. Visuals are neon. More LSD than shrooms that I remember. Didn't get to explore the closed eyes at all because of the house party but the OVA were pretty fucking incredible

Haha, great.  Not even my gf does substances anymore, so I did feel alone on some of my trials.  It was still good though, I fucking love this chem.  Thank you to those who came before me; it's because of all your trials that I decided to get this one.  I wish I didn't have to be busy tmrw and Friday (and possibly Saturday), or else I'd take some right now.


I haven't even gotten close to finishing a g...and I got 5 of them.  x.x  idk what I'm gonna do with all of it.  It was a good deal, but I'll stop right there.  Ya, I know you'll have fun with this one!  I know I did, and I will some more real soon.  ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

The only thing I didn't like about it is that it's somewhat stimulating.


Outside of that it's a really kickass mushroom analog. One of my faves


4-HO-MET > 4-HO-DiPT > 4-HO-MiPT >4-AcO-MiPT 


The rest of them aren't worth mentioning I wouldn't touch any of them again with the exception of 4-AcO-MET that is coming with the MiPT.

It is.  It's like felt all throughout, and sort of in the chest and upper body area.  But I'm kind of weird like that, since I enjoyed the 2C-I stimulation and that one got me more buzzed.


Did you happen to trip earlier today?

I'm tripping now. Lol. But not by a tryptamine. 


I'm leery of 4-HO-MiPT and likely won't fuss with it and instead will just keep it for collection sake. From what I remember the heart went up a good 40 or 50 with this one.

Oh really?  Yeah, you should be wary then.  I didn't check it with any accurate measurements, but for sure my own pulse/heart rate was elevated too.  Temperature rose a bit as well.


Haha, mannn, you make me want to trip right now too.  I gotta wait, and it sucks.  Why do you want to quit alky though, btw?


And are you tripping on the dxm?  Tbh, I'm not even sure what that is.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yaa, but do note that 4 ho met and 4 ho mipt are very similar to each other.  It's about as similar as...mdma and mda?  Where the miprocin is more psychedelic like mda is.  Bad analogy, heh, but both are good.  At least imo.


Both are kind of short in duration.  But if you take a high enough dose, it does last longer and that time dilation makes it seem even longer than that.  Have fun yo!

Eh, I don't find them similar at all besides them both being tryptamines. The mipt is much weirder and alien, whereas the met is very universally loving, if that makes sense. Once on a 4-ho-met trip I could truly feel all the love everyone I've met that cares about me has for me, and I just cried in fits of joy. 4-ho-met leaves me very prone to feeling the oneness, the source, pure happiness, etc which leaves me in a state of euphoria unmatched by any other drug, even MDMA. Whereas mipt seemed to be not as warm, much odder, and just different. More psychedelic in the sense of weirdness and a more different mindstate. Whereas met was more psychedelic in a human, emotional, loving way.

Really?  I see.  But I'm not really surprised about the difference in effects between different users.  A lot of people's opinion on miprocin differed a lot as well.  I think I got used to the chaotic mind mess that is acid, and even a high dose of miprocin didn't ever get as confusing as those acid trips.


So I say everyone's opinion is valid.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

This shit is a bitch to get to go into solution. It took me 30 minutes with Everclear and it fell out within 30 minutes giving me just enough time to divide it up into hits. I love this stuff though. I'm gonna take 25 milligrams tomorrow with some MXP.

I'll be trying the cap of 30/30 metocin/miprocin in a few hours.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I won't put up a trip report, but I took:


30mg miprocin + 30 mg metocin

2 purple batteries (plus-minus)

~2g's of good herb


The visuals and euphoria were stunning.  I had some auditory hallucinations going on too, but damn it was much better than any candyflip or hippyflip I've done.  I hadn't dropped for several years, but I took the pressed pills first and felt a very strong roll before I felt the tryptamines kick in.  The visuals were crazy; objects would float and morph sideways/diagonally, they got fuzzy or clear-looking in flashes, and despite all that I could concentrate and hold on to conversations easily.  I felt super wired and fried at the same time, and when I started smoking out of a bubbler things just got crazier.  Any light source was too damn bright, everything was funny and my mood was elevated like a mofo and I felt way more stimulated than I ever have.  It felt like a strong, warm breeze was constantly blowing through me.  I wasn't shaking or trembling, but I could tell my hr/bp rose pretty high since I could hear/feel my heart thumping like crazy.  My vision was so broken and mixing both tryptamines with mdma (after many years) was probably a bit too much.  My short term memory was fucked during the time; I would put down a pack of cigs on the table and it would take me 20 minutes to find them again.


It was a lot of fun, but idk if I'll be mixing so much stuff next time.  I didn't expect to roll at all, but it was hella strong instead, which ended up mixing with both trypts really well too.

Yeah, it was.  It was at the tail end of that night, so I was up for 2 days wide awake.  Then I'll go sleep for 14 hours...heh.  I have a sleeping problem anyway, before I ever used anything.


30 should be good, 20 was strong but good for me too.  30 should take you a bit higher.  The mind space on this one is positively heavy, which I got from shrooms during the "high" points.  Just strong euphoria and a smile.


But anyway, don't underestimate this stuff.  The levels on this one is trippy.  Probably not as much as others, but it'll be worth it.


All of this is imo, of course.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

ate 30mg, don't have a whole lot to report.....not a big fan of this substance, not nearly as visual as 4-HO-MET, or even as visual as 4-ACO-DET/MET...felt like i could of went MUCH higher with the dose...if i would of brought more with me id of redosed


and like the rest, real quick acting......up and down in 4 hours.....


would try it again, but won't waste my energy with it when i love HO-MET


Actually I think my next trip will be 30mg of 4-HO-MET mixed with 20mg 4-ACO- MET.....I feel this will be a beautiful mix

Your response to 4-HO-MiPT is rather unusual. 30mg should yield a pretty solid trip for most people, with plenty of visuals (among many other things), and it should last at least a couple more hours than it did for you. Do you have a lot of tolerance at the moment? You said that you took a long break, so probably not... Do you consider yourself a "hardhead"? If both answers are "no", then it's possible that your batch is so-so.


Also, why combine 4-AcO-MET and 4-HO-MET? A better mixture is 4-AcO/HO-MET and 4-AcO/HO-MiPT (AcO + AcO or HO + HO). I've tried the HO coupling and it was quite good (albeit not as great as the marriage of 4-AcO/HO-DiPT and 4-AcO/HO-MiPT; I've tried AcO + AcO and HO + HO; I prefer the former). Regardless, consider your 4-sub combo dosing strategy carefully, as these compounds synergize very strongly.

im guessing my batch is SOSO


reason for mixing those 2??


they are both great batches, and both have great effects....ive gotten stelar visuals and trips from each at 30mg, so I'm thinking hitting them both hard together would be sweet


not really a hardhead......just maneuvering my way through these batches of unknown strength it seems.....

Having recently discovered this little jewel, I have been doing a fair  bit of personal research with it lately. First, I bow before the  chemical artistry involved with this substance, In my opinion it is a  complete success. I started off with an allergy test, then went for 10  +/- 2 mg, a very nice introduction. After about a week I went up to  12+/-2 mg, what I found interesting about this was that the potency  curve did not seem linear, but rather a bit more exponential.


To  test this theory, the next day I took 14+/2 mg, I figured it was only a  few mg and worth the experiment. Much to my surprise, I experienced a  trip such as I would expect from that dosage. No noticeable tolerance  buildup. After about three days I took it up to 16+/-2mg. Again the trip  was as expected, no real tolerance buildup. The farthest I have gone so  far is 18+/-2mg, this was after a week since the last trip. This was  impressive, lots of open eye distortion (I love how it gives a  crystalline shimmer to everything), pretty deep closed eyed journeying  to music, and a serious amount of fun.

Had me up and dancing for a  fair bit, been a long ass time since that has happened heheh. Also, this  stuff has some legs for me, 10 hours with a really stimulated comedown,  that feels way better than a comedown should.


Can't wait to play with this and some of the other 4 series some more.

^^^damn, i wish miprocin lasted that long for me.  more like 4-6 hours, personally, which makes it good for those times when i might be short on time to trip.


be careful with frequent dosing, that tolerance is sure to sneak up on you sooner or later.

It is mainly that lack of tolerance build up that caused me to post, I was curious if anyone else has experienced this effect. I know with acid or mushrooms, that it would have been a complete waste for me to try and take it again the next day. I have in fact tried it in the past, with expected results. In my experience with psychedelics, which is fairly extensive with traditional substances, this is the first time I have seen this happen. For conclusive evidence, I may try taking two doses of the same amount on preceding days to see if it is just the extra two mg's that are kicking it in, or if it is just the chemical itself.

I recall someone saying the same thing about 4-AcO-DMT.  Personally I experience normal tolerance build-up from all the psychedelics I've tried.

Ditto. Some more than others, but yes, tolerance builds with all of them.

a friend of mine complained about building up a tolerance to miprocin.  and not even taking it back to back days, as far as i know.  maybe he was talking more about a general tolerance build up or more like the novelty wearing off.  in any case, i don't think that miprocin would be 'immune' to producing tolerance.


my only experience with psychedelic tolerance is dosing 17 mg 2ce the night after dosing 16 mg.  i think the 2nd trip was qualitatively weaker.  

also, i took 2 hits of LSD on a Saturday, after taking 1.5 hits on Thursday, so TWO days later.  worked like a charm.  many years ago i tried 1 hit or less the very next day after a trip, hardly worked at all...as to be expected.


but back to 4-ho-mipt, i have been thinking about a trip on this recently.  haven't dipped into my stash of it in almost 6 months.  over the spring and summer i was dosing it monthly or so.  i'd probably go with ~18 mg, my apparent "sweet spot" for this chemical.  16-20 mg has usually resulted in a very solid trip without feeling a little too harsh as higher doses have.  once i get up to 22 or 23 mg, it can give me this particular back-of-the-head headache that i have experienced on a few psychedelics...anyone know the feeling?  like a tingly feeling in the the back of your head, not particularly pleasant.  like you're brain might be being overstimulated or something...or maybe you're just tripping out ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I have a strong suspicion that what was happening, is that by increasing the dosage by 2 mg each time, I was over riding a tolerance buildup. That combined with the novelty of first time use of this chemical. Sometime I will try a couple of lower doses of the same amount on consecutive days, in order to test the theory. I think next time I will go up to 20 mg though, 18 was good, I think 20 will be just about right. Unless my Psilacetin arrives first %).

For the record, my preferred dosage range for this compound is 20-30mg (oral), with 25mg being my favorite amount.

This one felt the most like acid to me out of all the sub 4's. I may try again alone.....I did this one with friends, and I'm thinking I would rather be alone and meditate in this one....and yeah, 20-30mg is a great range.....my dose was 30 and I actually would prolly go down to 25 next time.......and I'll prolly throw in 25 of mitocin

As my research continues I have concluded that 4-HO-MIPT and 4-ACO-DMT are an excellent combination. They balance each other out and compliment each other seamlessly. My latest experiment with 15 mg +/- 2 of each taken at the same time was impressive. Straight from the heart to the mind to a hyperspace of geometric creation within a two hour period of closed eye relaxation to music. Open eye visuals were definitely present, but since this trip was done during the daytime were in the background. After the initial two hour rush, I found that a lower level, yet still fairly high state persisted for approx. 12 hours. This might just be my physiology though, as most psychedelics seem to have a long duration for me.  


It should be noted that I found the liftoff at this dosage to be fairly quick and intense, and those who are inexperienced with rapid psychedelic onset should use caution.

Indeed.  This has a rapid onset, especially at higher doses.  At right around the 30 min mark, you go from sober to psychedelic fucking Disneyland within a couple minutes, after the first wave of effects.


I'm surprised such an euphoric psychedelic like this one doesn't get much love/attention.  I haven't taken it in a while (due to tolerance and time concern), but I've been sober for a while anyways.  Unless weed counts.  But really, weed is not that hardcore.  I still count myself as sober if I'm just smoking herb.  I love it, but it's softcore maaaan.


This year has been busy and I was suppose to go out with a bang...seems like I'll be going out with a whimper.  Fucking great.  Unless I win the Mega Millions or some impossible crap like get a one hour access to a printing press, this year is it for me.  And I'm taking miprocin down with me, aka gonna take an extreme amount and turn into a vegetable again.  Hopefully.

Then you don't know how great it is to trip on miprocin.  The peak probably lasts around 3 hours, but it feels like it's more than that because of the time dilation.  On high doses, that is.   After that, vegetable time is over.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  It's definitely my favorite psychedelic, until I find something that trumps it.


In case you're being sarcastic, I like vegetables.  And don't poop on my party.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


But I've taken high doses before with no ill effects whatsoever.  It's very likely that these 4 sub trypts are safe to take at high-ish doses, as long as it's not like a gram or something.  And c'mon, I have a lot left.  Might as well take a chunk of it at once.  ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


Not recommending it though, but only because of HR on BL.  It's kind of a waste, but I have g's left still so I have too much anyways.  Heh.  I'll just toss it down the hatch.  Mine, that is.

Most likely sometime next month.  I'm gonna have to go against what I said to MKat a while back, because I want to try 200mg just ffs and to see what happens.  I love how that vegetative state immobilizes you, with the trade off being your mind becoming freed in dynamic fashion (aka a massive explosion, like an atomic bomb with a Mushroom cloud over it).  I hope I can reach that state again, because IRL I've been a bit uptight lately.  I need to unwind and enjoy the fuck out of some quality, relaxation time by stuffing 200mg of miprocin in a gel cap, and then tossing it in the air and catching it with my mouth.  Next month.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


It depends on my tolerance though.  I'll probably consume 20mg the week before to see where my tolerance is at.  If it's still kind of weak to me (just a +), then I'm literally going to increase the dose tenfold.  ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

^Nevermind, by vegetable state, I thought that you meant harm to yourself haha! Miprocin is one of my favorites that I have about ten years of research with, now that I think about it, high doses do cause a sort of vegetable state lol! I've felt almost trapped within myself at least once or twice - unable to communicate, but that's not so different from other psychs. I'm just glad this one hasn't drawn much attention, and gotten banned.

Haha, it's all good.  Yeah, my ego loss trip from miprocin definitely turned me into a veggie.  I couldn't talk, walk, or do anything except lay in a prostate position in bed.  The best few hours ever.  ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)  I might as well have been a carrot that just got plucked by miprocin and set aside.

Had an interesting trip on 30mg of miprocin today. The headspace was easygoing and euphoric and I found myself crying with laughter more than a couple of times. Mainly though I was just content to simply sit and take in my surroundings, very strong connection to nature reminiscent of shrooms was felt throughout. This definitely has a sharper feel to it than 4-aco-DMT and at times it was downright weird, at one point my body felt impossibly light, like the gravity had been turned down. I wish I got the kind of visuals some are reporting off this, 30mg produced only vague tryptamine patterning and distortions that strangely enough were most pronounced at the end of the trip. Colours were wonderfully intense though, with emphasis on greens and purples like I get on mushrooms. Walking around was fun but for the most part I felt very sleepy and yawned constantly for almost all of the trip. The afterglow was absolutely beautiful and I've felt wonderful since gradually coming down. Weird substance, not sure what to make of it.

I love this drug, I've used it to introduce a few people to the psychedelic experience, I think it's perfect for that as it has a shorter duration like mushrooms, but is a much easier & more explicitly "feel good" trip than mush, while still demonstrating the awe inspiring mind-fuck of the psychedelic experience. Some of the coolest visuals I've seen as well, strong "aztec" feeling or something like that. Something interesting I've experienced on high doses a few times is brief moments where I sensed an "evil" sort of presence...the most recent time was about a month ago, I took about 50mg, a little while into the peak, as the visuals reached their most intense point (I was also looking at a picture of an alien my younger sister drew & gave to me), I suddenly sensed this dark presence, for just a moment I felt some anxiety, then I thought "wait a minute, I'm tripping, this is just a part of me", & suddenly I couldn't fear anymore, I embraced the darkness & went back to the thought patterns I was having before that with a new sort of strength.

Yaa, I'm glad someone else perceived miprocin's effects almost directly in line with my own.  I felt like maybe I wasn't analyzing it right, especially since psychs affect everyone differently...well, it does and sometimes doesn't, I guess.  But the euphoria and positivity absolutely shines in this one, and for me it's simply impossible to not have a good time on it.  Even at threshold doses (10-15mg), it is very recreational with very little visuals, but the feeling and the body high/buzz is really nice, reminiscent of mdma except it feels more "raw."  But imo the best thing about it is that it's safe and treated me so well during my trials.  It's safer than otc medicines od-wise.


If I do go back to tripping in the summer, it'll be back to this one.  It's still my favorite.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I'm beginning to see what people mean when they say the word "aztec."  The visuals do seem to take on a yellow/orange/red spectrum of colors from light sources.  They create some neat visuals by themselves.  I also like the effect from trying your best to see "reality" clearly, but then it only holds for a few seconds before everything gets all bright and fluid-looking again even stronger.


I think that happens for most psychs though.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I highly recommend this one to beginners and anyone looking for a little recreation.  And no, I'm not a dealer or vendor (ya wish!), but I really like this stuff.  Heh.

has anyone else experienced a strange body high with this where it feels like your body has become impossibly light, low gravity style? had this for a few moments on the latter stages of my last miprocin trip, very odd feeling, something i've only ever experienced before when smoking DMT and to a much lesser extent on 4-aco-dmt, seems to be a distinctly tryptamine characteristic

Yeah I have had that on 4-HO-MET quite a bit, where I feel like my insides are made of hydrogen or helium or something. Coupled with some vertigo it makes for quite some fun. Probably just walking back in forth in the normal world, but the normal world is for boring people ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

What was your dose, and at what level would you put it at?  The effects change or become stronger when a higher dose is taken, naturally.  Sort of like shrooms themselves too.


It got to a point where I could barely move.  So idk if it's the same thing, but I guess in a way that could be described as a light feeling, instead of what I originally thought (can't feel anything but an intense buzz).


Maybe that's it?

I sometimes get this sensation at the 25-30mg range (oral). At this dosage, I always get to a solid +++ level. The feeling is that of being much lighter than normal, almost as if floating, but I can move without issue. It's always rather brief, though -- just a few minutes and it typically occurs a little before the mid-point of the experience.

Curious to know people's experiences with combining this with other psychedelics. Once I've finished my exams I'm thinking of dosing 20mg with around 115ug of LSD as a celebration of sorts, has anyone had any luck with this combo? Acid and 4-Aco-DMT is one of my favourite psychedelic combos and I love the zen, tranquil headspace it puts me in, purely speculating but I can imagine acid and miprocin being a little more wacky and hedonistic

^I don't know about lsd or 4-aco-dmt but 40mgs of 4- mipt mixed with 40mgs 4- ho-met caused me to go catatonic a while. I'm usually a hard head and have taken 100+  mg of 4-aco-dmt and up to 80mgs ho-met without issue. The 40/40mgs was taken before hiking ~4 or so miles into the woods around a lake where the girl I was with spotted a pack of very large wild dogs. Since I was tripping I didn't bring my .357 I usually take hiking.


 The way the girl reacted and almost gave her self an asthma attack power walking on the way back sent me into a state of shock. The reaction was obviously caused by the set and setting but after using this a couple more time I think it definitely has a more sinister side to it compared to any other 4-subbed-t that I've tried.

This substance is definitely close to shrooms as far as the headspace goes, but set and setting is underrated.  I've always liked this one too.


Been having a weird couple of days, but whatever.


You all make it sound fun, bad tripping or not.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


As for combining with lsd, I haven't tried that but I probably would have back then.  That just sounds really good right about now anyways.

I've done my research but have found some contradicting info on the reported duration of the trip.


How long would you say that a 15 mg experience would last ? I'm thinking of trying this one soon.

This one is and remains one of the very few psychedelics i'll ever remember as a very nice, gentle, even though wild and entertaining Compound that is unique and oh-so special!


It's along with 4-AcO-DMT one of the best 4-subbed Tryptamines i've had the chance to experience and it still lingers in the back of my head as a true Classic and a kind of it's own.

Yes, this one is definitely a gem to me too.  It's all warm and fuzzy, with plenty of psychedelia with a strong undercurrent of those shroomy vibes.  I actually made up my mind on settling for this 4 sub trypt after reading the previous big and dandy.  I don't regret it in the least.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Wow, I tried this in the fumarate form at 13.5  mg yesterday and I must admit that the intensity of it caught me off guard. For what I've read on the previous thread I was expecting mild effects, but it was actually very potent for me. Also, very short lived. The come up was so fast it almost become a little uncomfortable. I felt shaky and my temperature receptors were very confused. But at the same time, I felt so euphoric, that it wasn't really a problem. 


Visuals weren't very colorful, but they were completely immersing. Everything was breathing, lots of patterns everywhere, the visuals where so prominent they became three-dimensional at times. I wasn't expecting full blown tripping at this dose. Also, the bodily sensations where incredibly intense, all my senses felt disarranged, my skin felt cold, but my chest was warm inside. I had that head rush I get with tryptamines, like mental orgasms. Spontaneous tactile sensations. It felt amazing actually, it was pure psychedelic orgy. Remarkably, I felt fairly clear-headed, and anxiety was nonexistent. There was clearly a trippy headspace going on, but verbalizing was easier than with other psychedelics, thought processes were altered but I still was in charge of them. 


But suddenly at arround t+2 everything ceased. I felt from +++ to ++ in an interval of 10 minutes, and was left very confused. Everything seemed to happen too fast, yet that two hours felt incredibly long. It was as if too much had happened in too little time, it was very difficult to grasp. For the next two hours I was tripping very mildly, and began to feel progressively restless and uneasy, which was emphasized by the little muscular tensions I was feeling, specially in the area of the neck and face. 


At t+4 I decided to smoke some high CBD cannabis to relax a little bit, which worked wonders. The visual madness came back when I smoked, but it was different. I felt a lot less euphoric, rather tranquil and happy. The visuals where less defined, a lot blurrier, but they where incredibly complex if I would  let them manifest. In fact, probably the most complex I have ever seen. The introspective part of the trip was also intensified with cannabis, but in a calmer, more contemplative form. 


Sleep was hard at t+7, but not impossible. 


All in all I was very impressed, and I would say this is still very potent at "lower" dosages, but I must admit that most of the dosages reported here on bluelight are a little on the higher side for me.

Does anyone know how strong is the mid term tolerance with this one ? Nowadays I can barely find the time to trip, but next week I'm presented with the opportunity to do it two weekends in a row. If I take 15 mg of Miprocin and drop a lysergamide six days later, will I get the expected effects from my usual dose ?  Right now my tolerance is at baseline. I know consensus is that within seven days tolerance is near 120%, but just wanted to read some first hand experiences with this compound in particular. Thanks in advance!

I've dosed miprocin within ~3 days from each other, and the effects were only slightly weaker.  I think 6 days is a long enough break even if it's a lysergamide being taken on the 2nd trip.  That's just my two cents.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yeah 4-HO-MiPT is definitely great for sex, no doubt about that. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I didn't ever get much from 4-HO-DiPT though (in any facets), even when I hadn't tripped much yet and was very sensitive.  I have only tried -MiPT recently but I really love it, I've had 2 really fun, social and euphoric trips on it, and one trip that was intensely beautiful and empowering and visuals (and euphoric), one of the best trips I've ever had.

^ This. It's ACE for erotic adventures. ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Unfortunately, after four or five adventures with 4-HO-Mipt, the space has taken on a more twisted character than the positive (if side-effect prone) space it initially had. Now, it has a bit of the same intimidating flavour of a smoked DPT experience. A shame, because it really is a beautiful material.

How does miprocin affect body temperature perception? Not too worried about actual temp, but 4-Aco-DMT always made me feel very cold, or more sensitive to cold, and I'm wondering if this substance is similar in that regard. Psilacetin is the only psilocin analog I've tried so far, and I'm thinking that miprocin would be a better fit for me based on others' reports and am eager to try it regardless, but just wondering if taking it in a cold environment would be a bad idea, as that always led to a less than enjoyable trip on psilacetin.

Never noticed any changes in body temp perception with this chem, but I couldn't guarantee that you won't experience that of course.

On wiki it says Like other serotonergic psychedelics, its method of action is believed to result from its partial agonism of 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A serotonin receptors, 


if one wanted to use this for borax combo, this would kind of hit that 5-HT1A shot partially , just not as fully as 5-meo-mipt as this binds strong to 5-HT1A ?   

(or 5-oh met? , according to borax)

Finally tried this out at STS9 tonight. Only prior tryptamine experience is 4-AcO-DMT and DMT and I was pleasantly surprised to find that miprocin is nothing at all like those! 20mg dosed ten minutes before the opener, another 20mg an hour later because not much was happening. Still didnt hit until the last song of the first set but when it did WHOA. Nice dancey stimulation, beautiful soft organic but geometrically ordered CEVs, some electric OEVs but not much noticeable in this environment. Very little headspace, but mood definitely elevated, somewhat scatterbrained plus excess energy at the peak. Very pleased with the first trial.

Yeah the headspace isn't too deep, but I still like the headspace.  For me it really brings out my sense of humor in a great way, and I find everything hilariously ironic.  My friend is like that with it too and I love those nights where you're in pain from all the laughter the next morning.  I've had some great conversations that were meaningful to me and insightful on it also.  Once I combined it with DOC and had a phenomenal trip that was deep but focused.


But yeah, miprocin is gorgeous stuff.  It's fairly empathogenic, feels great and is euphoric, sociability is easy, it gives you energy, and it can be beautiful visually too.  One of my favorites but I go with different tryptamines when I want a full trip.

Haven't been able to find this one.


Only really tried 4-aco-dmt and currently mainly experimenting with 4-HO-MET...how does it compare to that? Is it more dose sensitive in comparison to the 4-ACO-DMT and less deep headspace?

4-ho-met is like the 2c-b of the 2Cs; it has fantastic visuals with a nice buzz, albeit with barely any headspace and about a 6 hour duration.


I haven't tried 4-aco-dmt, but I've read that it's more like shrooms with its headspace/mindfuck.

Anyone have experience with long term storage with miprocin? I have a sample that's been sealed in a vial w/desiccant at room temp for almost three years now with no noticeable change in appearance. It also reacts with marquis and mandelin as it should. I've always heard the 4-ho trypts degrade after a year, but I'm going to go for a small dose to check it out. I had a friend get sick for days from degraded 5-meo-dipt that shit was like black though.

All of my sub 4 trypts have basicly went to shit within 9 months....it's to the point where I don't even want to order them anymore 


Love them but there is even a noticAble difference after 4-5 months

so for responsible users whats the ideal wait time on this , once someone finds their sweet spot dose after experimenting?


(example on any empathogeons wait time is once every three months and that's minimum )


 Alexander Shulgin mentioned this is some potent stuff and didnt recommend any more than 20 mgs

I think 2 weeks is a good break time


And maybe my batch was week, but I was doing anywhere from 30-45mg

Hmm, mine seems just as potent to me.  It's been over a year, but I keep it in a baggy, inside a baggy, in a sealed jar away from sunlight.  That's it though.


Yeah, it is potent.  20mg is a strong +2/light +3, about the equivalent of 2 g's of shrooms.  Shulgin tends to under-dose, which is completely understandable but miprocin is worth taking higher than that.  Well, if you're unsatisfied.  20mg is where I started, but people often recommend starting lower than that.

I'm currently storing 4-HO-MiPT, 4-HO-DiPT, 4-HO-MET, 4-HO-DET, 4-HO-MPT, and 4-HO-DPT and they are all still exactly as they arrived. All but the last two I've had for almost two years now. The 4-HO-MiPT in particular arrived totally white and pure and has not changed in appearance or potency at all since then. As long as they are stored properly I believe they will last a very long time without degrading.


Also, 20 mg for me is the lowest starting point, not even really satisfying as a full trip but a good introductory dose. However, I have also seen a friend start looping and go a little delirious from 15 mg, so it definitely varies.

I would have to agree with that sentiment. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I still haven't taken my 50 mg dosage of this yet because I've been distracted with other things, but I will very soon. I've been pushing off trying DOC for too long though now so I really do want to do that next!

lol, ya, I read one of your trip reports and I was like O_O at the number of tryptamines that you've tried.  I can see why you haven't gotten all the way around back to this one.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I know, I also have a tiny amount of DOC, but I'm saving it for next month.  I hope you make a report on it when you get around to trying it.

Hehe, well I've just a lot of others to get to as well. ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) I actually have taken 4-HO-MiPT three times already, they've just been testing the waters, a social event, and a combination. I want to say it's actually been possibly over a year now since the last time I took it though....

This bears repeating again. It bugs me whenever people write off one of his chemicals just because he didn't feel like pushing past the threshold. Honestly, so far most of the best ones I've found have fallen into that category.

Nice, I had a recent 50mg trip but it was more of the same...great for me, but not much else to report on.  I kind of did extensively in the previous miprocin thread, so I didn't want to be too redundant.  It's very visual and euphoric though.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I have high hopes for DOC.  And by the looks of it, I'm sure it'll be smooth sailing at 3mg.


And do you mean immediate as in now?  Jk, I've been up all night and can't sleep...


But ya, for me 50mg is definitely +3 territory.  It should be really nice if you enjoyed your previous 3 trips.


Help and yourself are on the spot though.  I actually sponged up that tidbit somewhere around here on BL, heh.

Sounds good to me. :D I actually think that 4-HO-MiPT works very well as a party or casual trip due to its strong euphoric effects in me relative to other psychedelia, but the one thing I believe I've seen the least of at those doses is the visuals. They are very light for me at 20-30 mg.... I'm definitely excited to see where 50 mg takes them. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) And I'm sure the mindset and body at that point are just wonderful too!

I'm shocked that people have had them for up to 2 years with zero difference.


I store mine in the bag they come in (sealed) in another sealed Blacked out bag full of dessicant pouches in a closet in a very cool dry atmosphere.


And the stuff is fire when I obtained it.


I guess though i am giving them out to friends in capsules....I guess once they are sent out like that it when the degradation starts?

I'm going to have to try some straight out of the bag again and check the strength.

No idea about the quality of your blackout bag, but would highly recommend a glass mason jar, just to be absolutely sure that it's a perfect seal.


Also, if you're storing for years, I still think freezer makes sense. My hope is for my stuff to be good for the next 30 years or so. We shall see. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Are they holding on to the capsules themselves for extended periods of time? If that's the case then I'd definitely think that could be what's causing them to degrade, if they're not then storing them well themselves.

whats it like for a person first trip, never tripped before and does it change one forever or what?


also how good is this stored in say 50 mgs of mixed water and alcohol.  someone mentioned it turns blue or goes bad with a lil alcohol mixed    ?


if anyone can help ,it was asked in this thread    [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads...dy-Volumetric-Liquid-Measurement-thread/page8](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/286239-The-Big-amp-Dandy-Volumetric-Liquid-Measurement-thread/page8)

Honestly, I'd just bag it up really tight and nicely, and maybe put some desiccant in it.  Get one of those jars with a cork and store it away from heat/sunlight.  


I'm sure one of the reasons why miprocin is usually in fumarate form is because it is very stable.  Good for us as well as the providers, even though it is less potent per mg than the hcl, I think around 2/3 or around there.


Of course, the type of storage you're inquiring about is another viable option too.  But I just think the old fashioned way is easier and probably more than good enough for miprocin.

breathes out....I know furmate is a bit weaker,  fumarate is 2/3 for sure?  


all miprocin ive seen are fumarates, so most likely not a good idea to up the dose or anything esp when first experimenting with it bc it might be strong many Been researching days and days on this compound and reading a lot of reports last night, -from memory of the stories ive read last night-some people reports first time reports were 25 and 30 respectably, and one person said it was colors were so bright and maybe too overwhelming and the other said it was too much and looks like no more than 20 mgs.  one person did like 38 mgs and said it was way too much and wish never did it and recommended 19 mgs....so to each their own what one wants to get out of it think +1 or +2 at most is good for first timer--just my personal feelings on the subject


a lot of people say this one had happy like qualities and thats why they love it-Empathogen-entactogen (happy) effects 


where would 15-20 mgs get a person for time, and I realize everyone's mileage may vary...as a general rule though wondering what seems to be about the concenus---  +1+2+3 ? hopefully no +4 or +5  ? were talking about first timers here wanting to take it easy , more comfortable,  again no more than 2.5 ?

Yeah, the individual varies.  As you say, 20mg for someone can be anywhere from +2 to a +3, with the strength of each varying as well.  So it could be a 2.1 or 3.3 or whatever heh, I like that.  I doubt it'd be a +1 or +4 though.


Yeah, I'm positive it's at 66% potency compared to the hcl if my memory serves me correct.  I gleaned that from the previous miprocin B & D, and in the beginning of that thread I think the consensus was that the people who took it in the early days tried the hcl version.  So, their 20 mg trip was the equivalent of 30mg for the fumarate form.


But you have the right mindset.  If in doubt, start lower.  Anywhere between 10-20mg sounds about right.  Oh, and take an allergy dose before as well.  I took <1mg but of course I don't count it because I didn't trip off of it.  Just for safety reasons.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Yeah, it does seem to have some empathogenic/entactogenic qualities to it.  I would say a little bit more so than the original mushies.  The euphoria is strong and it's definitely one of those feel-good tryptamines.  I'm sure you'll enjoy it!

for wanting to keep purity optimal for a long time


silica packets work well right?   and do I just put put them in the sealed container and put silcia desiccants in with the actual powder? ?


same thing with oxygen absorbers, are these okay with miprocin ,since they are not okay long term for sugar and salt , as they make them hard.  


and put these in the container or in with the actual powder inside the bag?

How much powder do you have? If you have about a gram, get an amber pyrex vial. Make sure it has a cap with a proper lining. Something like this:

250 mgs and some other powders  -one other 250 mgs and one about 500 mgs or so-all different rc's.(3-fpm, 5-mapb)


  can these all be stored in the same container, like something like a supplement container?

looking to store these for years because life is busy and researching these happens few and far between.


and silica packets and oxygen absorbers in the container, or in the actually bag with the rc or bag outside the bag with the rc?

You should read the thread I linked you. Or some of it, and it's actually the right place for the questions you are asking.


I'd say, put you baggies in the supplement container with the dessicant (silica packets) and the oxygen absorbers. Don't put the dessicant and the oxygen absorbers inside the zip-lock bags.


imo, then store that in a cold and dark place. Not the fridge or the freeze because it's a moist environment, and you're not protecting your compounds enough to put them in there.


You have to understand, that zip-lock bags aren't airtight, and the jar you are keeping it in will contain air. Also, iron based oxygen absorbers (the most common ones) need moisture to work...so....Anyway, the phenethylamines you have are going to last a long time no matter what you do. 4-oh-tryptamines are more unstable though. As I said, uptimal for tryptamines is to put them in a tightly sealed vial. One that has a siz so it gets filled up, then stick that in the freezer.

3 Days ago I did an INSANE miprocin trip ; 75mg miprocin, 1.5-2g aniracetam, 750mg centrophenoxine, 150mg noopept and shit ton of L-Theanine. plus that mornin I took 2g phenibut which ended at the beginning of the miprocin trip.


Visuals were easily close to losing contact with reality, what was the most incredible was that I felt so in sync with the universe; I could answer before people would talk, see shit tons of geometrical patterns with dots and coordinates like a graphic and somehow it all made sense. I even unlocked the door for a friend that forgot something without knowing what he forgot and even without him knowing he forgot something, I just saw a number and felt like unlocking and opening the door. Same thing with words. People coulndt understand what I was saying cuz I had too much in mind to generate a sentence. I only talked by gestures and words but was more precise than ever cuz I was litteraly talking to what the person was thinking ... was awsome. Plus hallucinations were not only patterns over the world, the world too was morphing but at my will like deciding to make a dead plant regain life.. was INSANE. (of course only hallucinations not real)

for someone that coupel use this as there first trip ever...I know music on empathogons is techno, trance, house, etc      ( edm word as a crude term right?)


what about music on this stuff is there a particular category that best goes with this music?             would empathogon music work well?


heard this stuff is similar to psilocin , maybe a bit more empathogen-entacogeonic

I don't know, whatever music you like would be good.  Personally I like anything interesting on any substance or sober.  I'm sure "empathogen music" would work great, or something you'd take for a psychedelic.

Keep in mind that music can greatly color the mood of the psychedelic experience. First time I dosed this I played Stravinsky and my mind was swallowed by the complex narrative of what was going on in the music. I found myself locked inwards. Then I tried to change the music, but everything sounded "bland" in comparison, plain and uninteresting, so I couldn't enjoy music anymore and ended turning it off altogether. 


Another time I started the trip with more upbeat music and the whole experience was a lot more euphoric.

so true how music effects mood so much and with a trip its a huge setting so pick happy music  , upbeat etc if thats your thing...or for relaxing, chillen, reggae or happy jazz or something


My friend, yes it is my friend, is on effexor xr which is a ssni, I looked up what i could, theres not much on it though, and some say miprocin and this can interact and other story said girlfriend was on this and tripped..of course it could be dose related.  anyone know if these are safe?


I'm erring on the side of caution of this one, something tells me if im not totally sure dont do it, just want to know if anyone knows though

I have recently ordered a gram of miprocin from a reputable vendor. Can't wait untill it does get here. For my first trip I'm gonna take a small dose, probably 5-10 milligrams just to test the waters. I have read alot of research on all of the 4 sub tryptamines and miprocin just seems to stick out to me compared to the other 4 subs. I almost feel like my unconsciousness is telling me to do miprocin over the 4 sub tryptamines I could do. I guess I feel that I have some sort of a connection with this drug even though I have not tried it yet. Does anyone else ever feel a strong connection to a drug before they ever do them, Like something outside myself is telling me this is the drug for me.

funny you said this , I initally wanted 4-ho-met; however Ive heard 5-meo-mipt is super erotic and this is a mix between 4-ho-met and 5-meo-mipt .    This seems to cause more happiness than either one from the stories ive read and my research- correct me if im wrong so the others kind of scare me with the abbreviation dmt so this seems like a good compromise between 4-ho-met and 5-meo-mipt

So the 4 subs that have dmt in their name scare you. And 4-ho-mipt is the mix between the two other subs your interested in? So have you done 4-ho-mipt? Or any of the other 4 tryptamine subs?


Also I got my order in today. It came in as a brown powder, does anyone have experience with having brown 4-ho-mipt instead of pure white, which is what I have read people normally receive.


Any whos I'm gonna wait until after Christmas is over and have my first dance with 4-ho-mipt. I'm pretty damn excited about it too.

only thing ive researched is empathogeons.  fifteen yers ago used to do lots of mdma on myself...now a days just like to research them for fun that what chemicals interact which ones and the regeants s test and such


its white from what I know.   my regeants tests came out decent for the colors, and its like 9 months old and didnt re-frigate it until after 7 months or so so its not new quality, but still works some what

i got a brown batch of 5-mapb and tested out good and think it was 5-eapb, and it was the worst sides ive had for a full week afterwards .  I dont know what to tell you


as for when to conduct research, no idea, had mine since right after thanksgiving, and just-have to wait for the right time when the stars align.

I tried the lsd and miprocin combo, which I'm currently coming down on.  Just a tab and 20mg respectively.


It was pretty good.  I just mimicked a candyflip timing wise, and when the miprocin was coming on the visuals and the headspace became positively wild.  CEVs were really strong, stronger than OEVs by a lot, which surprised me.  Time dilation was apparent from the lsd peak all the way to the combo's plateau, but around the 7th hour, time seemed to go faster.  I know I was coming down, but it felt like the drop off accelerated faster than either substance by itself.  Of course, the euphoria was strong, but not as much as I thought it would be.


Overall, it was pretty good, though it's probably not the greatest psych combo.  Still nice to experience at least once though and test the waters.  What I noticed is that the headspace and CEVs were potentiated the most.  Well, at least for me.


That's about it.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

That sounds interesting Kl519, the quick drop off reminds me of my experience mixing LSD and 4-HO-DiPT. I would expect those doses together to produce almost only CEV for me though; that's what I get out of that much 4-HO-MiPT anyway, and I wouldn't even take that low of a dose of LSD. ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) So far the synergy for me has been found with moderate tryptamine doses plus high LSD doses... though I always dose high on LSD no matter what.


I am thinking about tripping today... and I think this is the substance I still need to explore more than any. Maybe 50 mg? We'll see probably within an hour or so....


Edit: 50 mg down the hatch.... This should be intriguing. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hey, I fell asleep again lol.  Idk how ya stay up so late.


Hopefully the trip helped relieve your fibromyalgia symptoms, well if it's still bothering you at the moment.  Ah, 50mg is a solid, median dose for me too.  It should be a pretty strong +3.


Yeah, the coming down part was quick, lol.  I was all enjoying the CEVs, and then it started fading fast.  I was sad in that nanosecond, haha. (Where did it go?)


Mm hmm, miprocin is definitely the substance with several levels that are safe to explore, since you can push the dose on this one.  It's one of my all time faves.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

the powder amount is so tiny on a 0.000 scale that it would probably be best put in water verses in a capsule


one issue ive read 4-ho-mipt is that it doesnt dissolve in distilled water,  one could always try and just keep pouring water and hoping all the powder gets taken.


putting the little amount of powder in a pill seems a lil difficult obviously could do it but maybe water is a best option ?

It's got nothing to do with staying up late, that was me after waking up in the morning lol. It hasn't really been long enough to tell if it's helped with my pain much yet, but thanks for asking. It did increase my GI issues at first but after that it seemed to numb a lot of my body.... Currently I haven't had any aches and pains since the trip, so that's good.


I have to say that I now have a lot more appreciation for the fact that you took 150 mg of this stuff! I was not at all expecting what turned out to be an extreme exponential dose-response curve going from 30 mg to 50 mg. I honestly don't think I would ever want to surpass this dose, or maybe even equal it again. All sensory input was already so confusing for me that any more would have been overkill; the tracers were functionally blinding, any bodily sensations were just overwhelming, sounds became not only echoed but also somewhat distorted in a distinctly DiPT-like manner....


It's a very intriguing chemical, but truthfully, I think I'm almost done with my explorations of it. I only have enough left for one more less than 50 mg dose and I don't really feel much of a pull to seek it out again after that.... This was an impressively strong trip for me, but despite pushing the limits of my comfort zone and the aforementioned tracers it still didn't get that hallucinogenic for me, not to a level that would make it worth going through that intensity for it anyway, and I don't think I need to experience that just for the sake of it more than once. This trip really did feel like it mostly showed me what I need to know....


Anyway, I'm planning to write a trip report on it, so I won't go into too much detail here. Hopefully I'll get that up some time tomorrow, maybe the next day. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yeah, I wouldn't bother with dissolving this stuff in liquid.  But you do need steady hands, that's for sure.  What I did was weigh the powder, then dumped it in an index card folded in half to slide the powder in the capsule.  It's bitchy at times when it won't slide down since it might cluster up here and there, but a tiny shake will get it all down.

Haha, thanks for the correction.  I try not to make assumptions, since even a 50% accuracy isn't a very good ratio to me (which is actually very good if they are true assumptions).  But I guess the time difference made me think you stayed up.  Heh.  I'm usually good at guesses though, because honestly, even IRL and in many ways, nobody tells me anything.  At all.  I always have to figure stuff out, which takes a lot of patience and effort.  But even then, I don't even know if what I know is actually happening or not, so yeah...it's all confusing as hell to me.  =l


But anyway, yeah, 50mg is a really strong dose.  150mg equals immobile vegetable, no kidding.  Although everyone's different, I'd bet a lot of $ if someone actually took that much too, they'd have the same reaction.  I even panicked a bit, which is very unlike me, so that kind of showed (to me) how absolutely over the top it is at that level.  I just want to try it again so I don't have to crave and wonder what it'd be like to do it once more, lol.


Although it does kind of make me nervous thinking about the massive reduction in cognitive functioning in literally less than a minute.  I'm just hoping I'll be more prepared since it'll be on purpose this time.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I see, perhaps the 50mg dose for you is a bit strong?  Your individual body chemistry and characteristics (height, weight, metabolism, etc) are probably more sensitive than mine.  But definitely a 50mg dose should be heavy and I can see many being overwhelmed...I'm just biased because I love miprocin and whatever state it gives me is ultra enjoyable.  I can't actually explain why really, especially if you were to ask me what makes it so special from other chems...I guess it's just one of my favorite cup of teas because it's like a more positive headspace + more euphoric version of shrooms ime.


A TR would be cool, but only if you have the time for it.  I probably won't be around BL until Sunday night myself, unless I have some mod responsibilities to take care of.  So, take your time.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

My trip report has been posted. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) And yeah, I'm sure I would panic on 150 mg too lol. I do find the lower doses of 4-HO-MiPT to be enjoyable, but this was a little too heavy for me for that already.... It was more of a difficult, life lessons kind of trip for me, similar to some mushroom and 4-HO-DiPT trips for me as well.

Great.  I just read it, though I'm wondering about the 'difficult, life lessons' part of it, I'm sure it must be something you want to keep to yourself.  However, I hope that everything is going well for you!


Yeah, unless you like a vegetative +4 like me because I'm weird like that, 150mg probably won't be so good to try.  It happens really fast, and of course with the aspect of not being able to turn back, I wouldn't recommend it usually since it's one of those 'have to try it to know it'.  Though you may have already experienced something like this, I don't know really, but yeah, on the other hand it depends on what you're looking for.  Low doses are definitely easier and more suitable for recreation, which is my preference most of the time.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I can't imagine 150mg....I would think the body load would be extremely uncomfortable....too te point of me wanting it to end

Not that I get any perceivable body load with miprocin to begin with, but at 150mg the high (body buzz included) is so strong that I would imagine it could be uncomfortable for some.  Well, the whole state you're in could be, unless you embrace it or it's what you're looking for.  ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


It's not something I'd recommend though.  I wouldn't even be doing it if I didn't feel fantastic during and afterwards, and have also tried it with good results before (yay animals, my dog is right next to me too).  Plus the 4 subs are as benign as they get, although I'm not comfortable with taking it any higher than that either.  I'm actually doing it strictly to try to reach a +4 state again, since I desire that before I quit.  And with what I have, miprocin would be my safest bet to try to do so.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

What I did was weigh the powder, then dumped it in an index card folded in half to slide the powder in the capsule.  It's bitchy at times when it won't slide down since it might cluster up here and there, but a tiny shake will get it all down.

tested it out at around 15 mgs weighed out and didnt work.  15 mgs is such a small dose, so little powder--stuck to scale and card.  may be best to just put it in water and drink it , over and over untill its injected.   That said still havent got the chance to research it.  Kind of difficult with responsibilities and not many friends that want to do this or can not because on prescription that interfere ..seems a lil difficult to find a good tripping partner.. no worries if its not meant to be , or could try alone for first time or just wait or whatever

Ah, if you're having trouble like that, then you can just parachute it.  As long as you got the dose right, then the caps aren't necessary.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have enjoyed the 4-HO and 4-AcO tryptamines I have taken. 4-AcO-DMT was my favorite drug back then. How similar are 4-AcO-DMT and 4-HO-MiPT? Erowid lists the [dose range of 4-HO-MiPT as 5mg-30mg](https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/4_ho_mipt/4_ho_mipt_dose.shtml) and the [dose range of 4-AcO-DMT as 2.5mg-25mg](https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/4_acetoxy_dmt/4_acetoxy_dmt_dose.shtml). Are the dosages similar or is the 4-HO-MiPT dosage much higher?

30mg 4HO-MiPT is a good hit. I ate it on an empty stomach and it started coming up in 5 minutes. It was strong but manageable.

I find miprocin's come-up very fast. It's like being sky-rocketed into the trip. It's a manageable tryptamine, but at the correct dosage it's intense indeed ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

I do like this stuff... And you are right it comes on fast...

 I usually take 25mg when i do....  But; A while back, i took 30, 32 mg.. what a big difference from 25mg,   I lost it for a bit.... I never seen as many visuals as i did form this stuff like i did last week... The walls and posters expanded outwards  into the other room morphing melting and back again... thought's became serial... i even forgot my name, why i was so to speak.... I believe it mite have been, the over the top potent bud i puffed on just before.... Just saying... you never know when you get a but kicking in psychedelic land... 

Be careful out there peeps .. 

Can't wait to try that again.

Cheers

I had my first go with miprocin last night. I at 11 milligrams, It came on super quick even though I didn't have an empty stomach. It gave me a weird body load for most of the trip which was unpleasant. I didn't have any visuals at that low of a dose, but I had lost of emotions about my life and where I am going running through me. I'm probably gonna wait about a week or two before I finally try a bigger dose.

I could have posted this in any one of the three threads, its an article I read previously and thought it was interesting.  I dont know how accurate it is or isnt bc ive only tried 4-ho-mipt once mixed with enpathogen (trip report above)


looks like a happy medium between these other two compounds.       Some say 5-meo-mipt is more like a typtamine mdma-some say its scary past 8 mgs or more-never done it from own experience

I barely post in PD anymore, but I have to ask what those points/analyses are based off of?  The come up times do not sound accurate, especially because miprocin has been consistently around 30-45 min for me.


Although it's just me, which isn't a point of reference for much of anything, but the metocin also seems off too.  The headspace was nil for me, while miprocin's was much heavier.  And that also seems to be in-line with most of everyone else's experiences too.  =l

I've not yet tried 5-MeO-MiPT, but I have to say that I actually find that comparison between 4-HO-MiPT and 4-HO-MET to be pretty accurate to my personal experiences.


For what it's worth, 4-HO-MiPT does come on fairly quickly for me when I eat it straight, but when I took 50 mg in a capsule I really couldn't even tell if anything was happening for about an hour, and it took at least another thirty minutes to peak. I haven't taken 4-HO-MET in a capsule but it does come on hard and fast when eaten straight....


The headspace is a very subjective, debatable point as well of course, but I have personally found 4-HO-MET to feel more psychological than 4-HO-MiPT, though I do feel that I have tripped harder overall on 4-HO-MiPT. To me 4-HO-MiPT feels like a very basic, if also very powerful psychedelic.... At 50 mg the feeling of sensory overload was so intense that I felt like I was seeing visual distortions on a microscopic level, where your vision just zooms in and in and in and you see reality cracking at the seams.... It felt very extreme and hyperspatial in that way, but despite that, at least once it all set in and I adjusted to the sensory onslaught, it was still incredibly clearheaded and malleable. Even the psychedelic mind's eye visions, which were quite colorful and beautifully detailed, tended only to reflect whatever I chose to think about. If I had been that far out on LSD, which I have been before, I would still have some self-control but I would have barely any idea of what the hell is going on....


I have not reached that level of sensory intensity on 4-HO-MET, but I have felt the exact same effect at lower strength multiple times which leads me to believe that the same level could likely be reached with a higher dose. The difference however is that at such a dose that is equivalent to that, 4-HO-MiPT feels so light on my mind that I've found it useful in settings fit for MDMA, whereas 4-HO-MET already causes me some manic pressure of thought and moments of full dissociation. The visuals at that point also seem to reflect the beginnings of delirium to me, as the furthest I've gone into pushing that sensory overload feeling on 4-HO-MET also came with vivid, integrated hallucinations of spiders and animals, and the geometry that was present became filled with cartoony imagery to a level beyond what I have experienced with really anything else. To contrast what I said about 4-HO-MiPT, 4-HO-MET feels to me like a very atypical, and uniquely intense psychedelic.... I'm not sure if I think that it will ever reach an ego loss point quite similar to 4-HO-MiPT or LSD, it seems it may or may not under the right circumstances, but more significantly I do believe that it could become pretty mindbogglingly weird in its own way by the time it reaches a similar cognitive overload.


Here is an excerpt from [a report on Erowid of 150 mg of 4-HO-MET](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=71218) that I really like:


> The visual hallucinations were of an intensity I had never thought  possible, and got stronger and stronger over the next hour or two.  Multiple life-sized human figures, mainly female, their skin comprised  of constantly-refreshing, pulsating and incredibly complex geometric  hallucinations. These geometric patterns were 3 dimensional in their own  right, wrapped and arranged into the human figures. These figures were  extremely real, but benign and empathetic, and could be seen in equal  intensity with eyes open or shut. With eyes open, objects were  breathing, pulsating and changing in size and position in relation to  each other, to a staggering extent. 
> 
> 
> 
> During the peak, approximately 90 minutes to 3 1/2 hours after  ingestion, the interaction with these figures intensified to what can  only be described as a cosmic mindorgy of some sort. This was incredibly  pleasurable, blissful almost, somewhere between lust and extreme,  all-encompassing empathy was felt between myself and these multiple  hallucinatory figures. These feelings, though incredibly intense, were  never scary or unpleasant in any way. 
> 
> 
> 
> For the middle and most intense part of the peak, maybe 2-3 hours in,  these interactions continued, but my mind wandered through an incredible  tapestry of thoughts, emotions and memories. I felt that I understood  and empathised fully with everyone in my life, and the world made  incredible sense. I was laughing uncontrollably through most of this  time at the constant realisations. It felt like I had missed some  incredibly subtle cosmic trick all these years, and now I had realised  it I would never be the same again. 
> 
> 
> 
> The synchronicity was incredible, every object had it's own meaning, no  matter how small or insignficant, every moment by every person spent  pondering anything seemed part of some deeper plan, no second of idle  ponderance in the entirety of human history wasted, everything part of  this eternal and infinite plan. 
> 
> 
> 
> Metaphors of pirates and twisted, ponderous crackpots with crazed eyes  and twirled moustaches, spectacles and purple top hats and pipes  abounded, every tiniest thought like a great and powerful mystery to be  mulled over for days by these crazed thinkers. The piratical metaphors  took over at this point, my bones felt like sturdy oak and my flesh like  leather. The interaction with the hallucinatory beings, which has  continued during these meanderings, took on a twisted, tribal pirate  rave at the end of the cosmos quality (words fail me at this point,  that's the best I can describe it) and the mind-orgy became an  uncomfortable proposition.  
> 
> 
> 
> I took this opportunity, perhaps 3 1/2 to 4 hours in, to retire to  another room. The synchronicity had become so intense that it seemed my  personal universe was some sort of incredibly complex matrix conspiracy  bat shit involving only myself, my acquaintances and a few random  players to keep me on my toes. I soon realised the insanity of this and  left such thoughts behind. The last half hour of the peak was spent in  intense introspection.

I like that last line too because it reflects my experiences and I think the aphrodisiac properties listed in that link as well; for me, 4-HO-MET also causes many sexual hallucinations but makes me feel much more satisfied than anything, whereas 4-HO-MiPT has a similarly orgasmic high but still also can facilitate sexual thoughts more easily for me.


Now, I don't doubt that 150 mg of 4-HO-MiPT would be extremely intense as well... but the difference, for me at least, is that I can actually see strong signs of the sort of intensely mental and hallucinogenic experience described above already quite present even on 25 mg of 4-HO-MET, whereas 50 mg of 4-HO-MiPT still only felt more like a classic psychedelic ego loss experience with colorful geometric visuals and distortions. It feels very much to me as though going up to 150 mg of 4-HO-MiPT would likely produce an experience of complete detachment and traveling through inner worlds similar to high doses of mushrooms or LSD, which would surely be intense in its own right, but I also find such experiences to feel more like a deconstruction of consciousness than anything.... On the other hand, the headspace that 4-HO-MET puts me into feels more likely to keep me around while my thoughts become progressively more deranged, and generally such things tend to hit a delusional breaking point eventually at least in my experience.... I would say that the effects described in that report seem to support this idea in my opinion as well.


So, I guess ultimately it comes down to which you personally consider to be a more mentally intense experience as well, but I would have to say that I generally think of strong delirium with a sense of self relatively in tact as being more of a "mindfuck" than a loss of self. But opinions may vary! Just my thoughts on the matter for now.... Perhaps I'm wrong, and maybe I'll know for sure one day with each. :D

Ay, Kaleida, what is UP?  Wtf, it's been a while.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Sorry, I rarely go on PD nowadays and MED has gotten my hands tied, so I didn't notice.  Well, I mean miprocin and metocin are very similar in the first place, so I wouldn't doubt metocin can get head fucky, esp. at higher doses like the one you described.  I'm just adamant that it isn't as strong as miprocin, at least ime, but then again I'm not going to debate about subjectivity so that's that.


However, it does seem to be the case that either miprocin or metocin (apparently) have some higher levels beyond 50mg, which I've only tried with one of them.  Miprocin is not medium or light above that dose, and I would imagine metocin would follow suit as well.


Opinions may vary indeed.  Extremely so sometimes.  8(

Yeah, I'd say your opinion of it might be at least a little bit  biased through all that lol. There are definite similarities between  4-HO-MET and 4-HO-MiPT but quite a few significant differences as well,  though I'd say probably not quite as many around 15 mg for most people.

Hey, yeah it has. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I was not actually aware that you were still around these parts... and I've been pretty distracted with my life myself. It's nice to see you still posting here.


And yes, particularly with these molecules I think opinions will vary wildly.... For instance, I have met people who have taken highish doses of each and claimed that 4-HO-MiPT is extremely visual whereas 4-HO-MET is almost not at all, and that's the exact opposite of my situation. Furthermore, the fact that there were no doses listed on that chart only makes it even more difficult to extract meaning from.... For me, 25 mg of 4-HO-MET was stronger than 25 mg of 4-HO-MiPT in every single way, and yet 50 mg of 4-HO-MiPT produced a decidedly more potent, if still less visual trip than 50 mg of 4-HO-MET. So, I think even comparing them linearly is likely to lead to at least as many questions as answers, and even more so the higher up the dose gets.


In my case, I think one thing that leads to my opinion of 4-HO-MiPT as lighter is just the fact that ego loss usually isn't a very mentally intense experience for me, and as I said that seems to be the primary effect of 4-HO-MiPT for me. As long as it's not of an overly unexpected severity for the setting I've prepared, which of course can lead to some anxiety, I actually find it quite calming. I recognize it when it's coming, I'm happy that I'll be free from the real world for a while, the experience itself is generally just a numbed out feeling like a dream, and when it's over I'm usually totally coherent about what happened and how I handled it. It's still a very powerful experience, but not really one that I consider "mental".... More like emotional, to the point that I consider it to essentially be like a psychedelic orgasm. However, I have also seen many people absolutely flip shit and be disturbed by the thoughts they had during ego loss for some time after the trip is over... so I'm well aware that it's not quite so smooth and clear for everyone.


On the other hand, I seem to be quite sensitive to the sort of delirium that 4-HO-MET causes in me, and part of the reason I'm sure that it will get so much crazier even is that I find it comparable in many ways to 4-HO-DET, likely due to the ethyl groups I would imagine, and 4-HO-DET is even more extreme for me in this way. The hardest I've tripped on it so far involved me thinking that I was discovering my destiny as a demon shaman and that I was supposed to use my sexuality to conquer the netherworld and unite the forces of light and dark. And there was no loss of self whatsoever as this was happening.... I was still walking around my house going about my day, only with the most insane visionary hallucinations of naked women with flame wings walking around, giant demon temples surrounded by dark guards, flowers growing out of nothing and disgustingly withering away within seconds, skulls and severed body parts reaching out of the walls and covering my body, and a collection of intrigued demons all hanging out with me and excitedly watching me realize the truth of my life. And it all felt completely normal until suddenly it just began dissipating... and I thought to myself, *what the fuck?*


So, again as I said it would come down to subjective opinion and experience, but I do personally find this delirium to be much more of a head trip for me, and that's why I think I will likely remain adamant about 4-HO-MET being stronger than 4-HO-MiPT as well. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) Though, that is pretty much to say that I find 4-HO-MET stronger than 4-HO-MiPT in a similar way that I prefer oranges to apples.... In other words, I find them different enough that they're probably not worth trying to compare side by side anyway!

It's more about just knowing your body than anything. I know people that won't trip without eating because they'll feel weird or weak if they don't, whereas I always try to avoid eating before tripping because it gives me gastrointestinal issues.

Kaleida, in regards to how you feel about ego-death being calming and what-not, do you not at least panic a little when you notice it's coming? I always do because my first experience with ego-death was on 3mg+\- of 25I-NBOMe, thinking it was 200ug-250ug of LSD and I thought I was dying/died. It was one of the most traumatic & unexpected experiences of my life and now just the thought of ego-death is extremely terrifying. Since that trip I've only had ego-death once on 3.5 grams of very potent mushrooms & that left me riddled with anxiety/PTSD type symptoms for about a month. I'd love to find a way to come to terms with the feeling of ego-death so that I don't panic when it's coming. Any ideas to make such an experience easier? Maybe a sitter would help, seeing that I was alone for both of my ego-death experiences.

Innerpeace:  Generally, food in the stomach will hinder absorption.  A full stomach (ie, you feel full) will cause the trip to be weaker and it will come on much slower.  I personally like to eat a light meal an hour or two before I dose psychedelics, so I have nutrition and my digestion is going.


That's interesting kaleida, for me, 4-HO-MiPT is quite a bit stronger than 4-HO-MET at 25-30mg doses.  I haven't taken either higher than 30mg, and for me, 4-HO-MET at 30mg was quite underwhelming, not even particularly visual.  It was nice, and very calm, but I felt content, not euphoric, and not very social.  With 4-HO-MiPT at 30mg (or 25mg), I get big rushes of euphoria and a rather empathogenic state of mind... if in good company, I become very social and I laugh a lot (to the point that I'm sore the next day sometimes).  Sometimes it's barely visual at all, and sometimes it's been beautifully visual.  I don't generally care about visuals nearly as much as the head change so that's fine by me.  I find 4-HO-MET to be the weakest-feeling tryptamine I've tried, except for 4-HO-DiPT which I found extremely transparent and light to the point where I wasn't sure what it was even doing to me.

Well, I have not tried 25I-NBOMe myself, but from what I've heard about it it wouldn't be surprising to me that such a high dose could produce anxiety along with its other effects, particularly because I have also heard that it can be very stimulating. Mushrooms are also definitely one of the most mental and emotional psychedelics for me, regardless of any ego loss effects.... They're probably not the best way to approach ego loss if you have a problem about panicking when it begins, though they're definitely ultimately effective if you don't have any better options.


Honestly though, I really don't tend to panic unless it was unexpected and I have some reason to worry about the setting, such as if I was expecting a controllable trip and instead got strong ego loss when I don't have a sitter and I'm somewhere where I need to make sure I don't act too crazy. To that end though, the only thing that really needs to be done to remove the anxiety is to know how a drug effects you and know how to plan your settings so that you feel as comfortable and safe as possible, and truthfully the only way you can really learn how to perfect either of those things is through experience.


About having a sitter, that is a great way to start. You really want to be at a point where you have no worries whatsoever, because even the smallest ones can be inflated by the experience to prevent you from completely giving in.... Knowing that there's someone there to look after you when you cannot can be a tremendous help. However, something that you have to know is just that there are only so many precautions you can take to prepare yourself for an experience in which you will lose track of what is happening around you and any memories you might have had leading up to the experience....


On that level, I really do think that it's just state-dependent memory that you'll have to work with. That is to say, the knowledge you can use during such strong ego loss is primarily going to be any reflexes you've learned from previous ego loss experiences... or at least, that's how it's worked for me. That's why it's so important to be able to relax completely during your trip, because that's how you can teach yourself that the ego loss is not something to fear, and ergo if you keep having negative trips it may only lead to them becoming habit. From the other perspective though, it may be necessary for you to force yourself to have some negative experiences again so that you can learn how to *prevent* them from being negative in the future, learning through seeing what sets you off... and that's another reason why having a sitter can help so much too. Not only can they help keep you calm and remind you that you are experiencing something voluntarily to increase your understanding of it, but they can also remind you of lessons that you may have otherwise lost to the amnesic haze of a strong solo trip.


So I guess that would be the main advice that first comes to mind.... Does what I've said make enough sense?

See, what did I say? ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) From what I have observed so far, these two compounds have a particular likelihood of creating polarized groups when being compared.


The way you describe 4-HO-MiPT around 25 mg is pretty similar to what I get, minus a couple of bits of intensity. I would describe it as surprisingly euphoric but not in "big rushes", and it is very empathogenic though I wouldn't say I've been sore yet from laughing. I also have only gotten it to be barely visual at all, though imaginative imagery (purely in the mind's eye) can be very elaborate; however, the most remarkable effects for me generally don't surpass lights tracers and electric auras, or very rarely brief, dim patterns in the darkness. I would actually describe *it* as one of the lightest tryptamines I've tried at that point, though it still is quite enjoyable and does feel like a full trip.


4-HO-MET at 25 mg for me is an entirely different story. The euphoria is nearly unmatched, surpassed so far only by LSD and MiPT. It's not very empathogenic for me, but I've laughed on it more than any other equivalent strength trip except for 4-HO-MPT. The visuals at that point also already exceed essentially any other psychedelic I've ever taken.... Intricate, three-dimensional rainbow geometry everywhere, color enhancement comparable to 2C-B, vivid, open eye imagery of full-bodied female entities, neon arrangements of abstract faces and plants interwoven with the patterns on surfaces, closed eye visuals similar to moderately high doses of mushrooms, and moments where the overload becomes so intense that I pop into brief dissociative states, and all of this is pretty consistently reproducible at that dose for me. I also get a lot of mental stimulation at that point despite the clearheaded nature, it's definitely "pushier" for me than 4-HO-MiPT, and that really contributes to the overall overloaded feeling of the trip as well.


Funnily enough, I also find 4-HO-DiPT to be incredibly mental in similar doses, one of the most of the 4-substituted tryptamines for me. One of the primary reasons I have waited so long to push further with it is because I'm somewhat apprehensive of what it will do to my mind.... It feels nearly delirious to me already at doses that don't even produce open eye visuals, and I have a hunch that its intensity will increase more than linearly by dose just like 4-HO-MiPT! I'm okay with taking my time with it though.... I love the headspace changes too but visuals are one of my favorite things personally (particularly the dream-like hallucinations, not just patterns and such, though those are nice too), so I'm happy sticking to other tryptamines for the moment. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

you re not the first one ive seen to say 4-ho-mipt causes empathetic and euphoric effects.   My only experience with  4-ho-mipt was 11 mgs combined with 5-mapb, 100 mgs, and on the comeup got a rush.  For a brief time it was like mdma on the come-up I was listening to progressive house and just got up and started dancing in the middle of the room.  The visuals were mild and the head-space was different, emotions were different.   I know its cliche, setting makes quite the difference , and can introduce feelings you would never feel just sitting in a boring place doing boring things, I know this from experience, not saying to go out of town all the time , and such, just dont let it be  same ol, same ol

Hello I'm new here but have read a ton of valuable info. Thanks for all of this collective info! just received some 4 ho mipt and 4 aco met.  Has any one ever combined the 2.  Not much info on the aco met.  I'm looking for a profound trip.  Any dosage recommendations? I've also got a little 4 aco dmt may be 30mg left.  I've taken it up to 35mg and was a decent trip but def no ego loss.  I have some mal to if anyone has any info on that would be greatly appreciated! all came from Canada.

I've tried 4-AcO-MiPT at 18-20mg (I forget which), and experienced a very mild effect consisting of euphoria, colour enhancement and some tracers. 


Am I right in thinking that 4-HO-MiPT is more potent? I know they're fairly similar, but I'd like the full experience, as I felt the 4-AcO had potential but ultimately wasn't taken at a strong enough dose.


Can anybody reccomend a first time dose of miprocin please?


Roughly how much would be equivalent to the 4-AcO experience that I had?


Cheers.

I find 4-HO-MiPT to be more potent.  What are you usual doses of 4-sub-tryptamine?  I'd recommend anywhere from 20-25mg for a first time, but it depends on your sensitivity.  For some it might be lower.

My favorite compound! One time I mixed 60mg with 3gAniracetam,1gcentrophenoxine,200mgnoopept,200mgL-Dopa,500L-Theanine and tons of cannabis. It was the best trip I ever had, the most joyful and careless feeling of the world, the feeling that the world is mine and I can do whatever I want, The only thing stopping me is my body. I think with some more Mipt I would have left my body but I can't afford that much! I also think That this combination made me temporarely smarter because I had ideas more complex than ever.

I miss this stuff!  Still one of my favorites.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I have everything stashed away now, safe and secure, but I don't feel like tripping anymore.


Even though I miss it.  Miprocin ime is a solid ++ @ 20mg.  40mg is definitely +++, so somewhere between those numbers the dose response curve spikes up.  It's just like shrooms except with more of a positive vibe/euphoria and less...intense trippiness at the doses above.  Shrooms can get edgy/trippier.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hey Kl519, I hope the break from tripping is going well. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Did you ever get to that combination of LSD, 4-HO-MiPT, and 2C-B that you wanted to before you stopped? I'm still jealous that you even have the option!


You know, I have to admit, despite saying before that I felt content    having experienced 50 mg of 4-HO-MiPT without feeling the need to go    back or push further, I honestly have not been able to stop thinking    about it since then. I'm thinking that the strength of it might have    just pushed me away at first because it was much greater than I was    expecting for that dose... but now that some time has passed since then,    I find myself becoming more and more curious about what I would get   out  of that level if I actually planned for it, or for going even   deeper  with it.


I would like to make one more observation on the variability of personal   responses: I find it very interesting how many people say that it is   just like mushrooms, because I think I would actually say that it may   have been the least mushroom-like of any 4-substituted tryptamine I've   tried so far. There are two very significant structure-activity patterns   I have been noticing consistently throughout all of my experiences  with  these substances, the first being constrained to those with  symmetrical  but not asymmetrical nitrogen tail substitution patterns,  and the  second being constrained to those with at least one methyl  group on  their tail and one other straight but not forked alkyl group.  So, in  other words, the first group contains the 4-substituted DMTs,  DETs,  DiPTs, DPTs, and DALTs, whereas the second group contains the  DMTs,  METs, and MPTs. Notice how psilocin falls into each, but  4-HO-MiPT is  not present in either?


The first collection of effects, present within the symmetrical tails,   can be very easily identified by a very distinct and obvious visual   effect, which appears much more readily with eyes closed or when in a   dark room. This involves an extremely large number of arms often in   hyperspatial garb reaching out towards me, sometimes attached to full   human forms and other times simply acting on their own, and typically   arranged into geometric designs such as winding spirals that tunnel back   into the distance, projections outward from the center of my view in   linear perspective, or in cascades raining down and slightly outward   from atop my view. It has been exclusively shown in darker colors like   blues, greens, or grays, but, on the other hand, is almost always   accompanied by foreground imagery of turning faces that tend to use   similar colors but in much lighter shades in the form of eye color,   jewelry, or other such things. On the perceptual and behavioral fronts,   these visuals have also associated very significantly with a consistent   and recognizable effect of feeling like I am stuck in a dissociative   whirlwind, with my mind just kind of dreamily flying around on its own,   in such a way that seems to lead to immersive visions with the proper   setting as well. I have experienced all of this relatively equally on a   couple good grams of mushrooms, 25 mg of 4-HO-DET, 30 mg of 4-HO-DiPT,   60 mg of 4-HO-DPT, and 60 mg of 4-AcO-DALT, and I also found 50 mg of   4-AcO-DMT comparable to 100 mg of 4-HO-DPT in this way.


The second collection of effects also begins with a very notable visual   effect, which also involves faces but in a different way than from   before. Whereas the faces detailed above are very detailed and crisp, at   the same time there is often a sort of flatness to them, a   photorealistic but still ultimately cartoonish design. On the other   hand, the faces I notice in this visual effect feel consistently   three-dimensional and far more fully rendered, but notably still   slightly sub-realistic, less so than a flat image, but more like maybe a   virtual reality world. To follow this theme, it is also almost always   accompanied by straight, white grid patterns appearing over surfaces,   giving everything a particularly rendered feeling. However, rather than   turning or moving in other ways like with the first group, these faces   are more often static, occasionally shifting expression but not   interacting much, and rather than being extremely vivid and close, they   are often somewhat blurred and distant. Though, I should note that   mushrooms, falling into both of these groups, do indeed give me a   combination of both effects which I believe is probably why their entity   perceptions are so much more complete for me than any of these other   tryptamines still. Anyway, these visuals tend to be expressed through a   wider variety of brighter but still deep colors, with red, green, blue,   yellow, and white seeming to make the most common appearances. And   finally, to contrast the first group, these visual effects seem to   accompanied for me by, rather than an immersion in an inner world, a   state of delusion brought about by bringing the mind into the outside   world. I have experienced this about the same on a few grams of   mushrooms, 50 mg of 4-AcO-DMT, 25 mg of 4-HO-MET, and 50 mg of 4-HO-MPT,   and have gotten lesser versions on lower doses of each.


So, now I have to admit something else too.... While I say that these   effects seem exclusive to these groups, I really believe that it is   likely that each group is just more potent at its effect than the other,   but that all of these tryptamines will probably do all of these things   at a high enough dose. To that end, I have experienced a much weaker   version of the reaching arms and turning faces effect on 50 mg each of   4-HO-MET and 4-HO-MPT, and I also had some of the virtual world and grid   lines appearing during meditation on 100 mg of 4-HO-DPT, and I've seen  a  brief flash of it once on 4-HO-DET and 4-AcO-DET each. However, what   makes me divide these groups into these categories is not the total   exclusivity, but just the fact that these effects do consistently seem   to appear much more often and much more potently at my lowest   significantly psychedelic doses of their corresponding substances, and   that they both appear together with psilocin. But then, as I pointed out   before, I did not include 4-HO-MiPT in either list... because it does   not do either of these things significantly for me at doses which   produce fully active psychedelia. In fact, even at 50 mg I thought it   really only maybe started hinting at either, and neither of them were   significant at all compared to how intense the rest of the trip was. By   that I mean the typical effects you would attribute to any strong   psychedelic, the feeling of ego loss, thought, emotion, and sensory   intensification, extreme visual tracers and distortions, and so on, but   just not all of those more complex hallucinogenic effects that I tend  to  associate with other tryptamines. So, given that mushrooms have both  of  those qualities for me and all the other synthetic 4-substituted   tryptamines I've tried had one of them, the one with neither is the one   that seems the least like mushrooms to me.


Not to ramble on for *too* long, but there's one last thought of   mine to add in now which is where my personal appreciation for  4-HO-MiPT  actually comes in strongly.... In regards to those basic  psychedelic  effects that 4-HO-MiPT has that you could expect from  anything, I  actually find it incredibly similar to LSD, I think second  only to  4-HO-MPT of the 4-substituted tryptamines that I've tried. I  have a  theory about the general structure of the lysergamides in  relation to  these tryptamines... which I think is actually a pretty  basic one, but I  just never see it discussed. Technically, lysergamides  can be viewed as conformationally constrained analogues of tryptamines,  with LSD in particular being a locked version of MPT with the three  hydrogen bonds on the last carbon of the propyl group replaced with a  double-bonded oxygen and a nitrogen with two diethyl groups attached to  it, whereas for instance LSA would simply be with a nitrogen attached.  This would make it even closer to MPT itself, but a step further can  actually be found in nature too, in the form of agroclavine, which not  only is literally *just* a constrained MPT with no further  substitutions, but even sometimes occurs in higher amounts than LSA in  some morning glory chemical composition analyses. See all of these  chemicals, along with 4-HO-MPT, shown below:


![2zykily.jpg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi67.tinypic.com%2F2zykily.jpg&hash=13e8c841ebe5189a2c8af42dc536a8c6)


So, first of all my thought would be that this clearly might be why  4-HO-MPT was the most LSD-like of the 4-substituted tryptamines for me,  but I think it opens up other interesting avenues of speculation as  well. For instance, 4-HO-MET is often described as feeling somewhat  lysergic as well, and I feel this way about it too, but to me it feels  much more like mushrooms but with a little lysergic flavoring, but not  really entirely like LSD.... This could seemingly then be because the  ethyl group is one carbon less than the propyl, so it's not as close to  the LSD structure as 4-HO-MPT, but it is still one step closer than  psilocin is. On the other hand, in one sense an isopropyl could even be  seen as a step in the wrong direction because it adds a carbon group  extended out somewhere where there isn't one on the lysergamide  molecules, but however, an isopropyl is the most similar bulk extension  to a propyl, it it not? I realized that logically it's probably not best  to think about these structure-activity relationship as LSD-centric  given that they work by mimicking serotonin, which should mean that it'd  be much more logical to have something like psilocin as the starting  point. So, from that perspective, I have to ask is it not possible that  the "lysergic" feeling is one that is simply added to an  N-methyltryptamine by extending the bulk of its other tail substitution,  such that when it reaches three carbons a similar effect will be  achieved whether it is through a propyl or an isopropyl?


Perhaps notably, MiPT is even more similar to LSD for me than 4-HO-MiPT  is, which should make sense if you consider that LSD is a locked version  of a tryptamine with no ring substitutions, thereby making a 4-hydroxy  group a step away from its structure. On that note though, I think that  step may also be very important for adding those effects to 4-HO-MPT  that I also get from mushrooms and 4-HO-MET but which seem to be  disrupted on 4-HO-MiPT. In reference to that I would also have to assert  something about 4-HO-MPT: that even though I do indeed find it to be  even more LSD-like than 4-HO-MiPT is, I also find it to be more  mushroom-like to an even greater extent. The only explanation that I can  come up with for it as that, at least in my brain, that isopropyl group  must disrupt psilocin-like receptor binding relative to what the propyl  group does much more so than it does the same for LSD-like receptor  binding, the end result being a drug which is slightly less LSD-like in  that particular style, but ultimately more LSD-like as a whole.  Likewise, because neither 4-HO-MPT nor 4-HO-MiPT is *entirely*  like LSD even in the ways that they are similar, I feel that the lack of  more overt mushroom-like effects also allows the subtle differences in  its "like LSD but different"-ness to shine through more clearly, which  is quite interesting in its own right.


Anyway, all of these thoughts are what have made me start to think that I  will actually be attempting to explore more with 4-HO-MiPT in the  future again.... Maybe I will find that at an even higher dose these one  or both of these two distinct patterns of effect I've noticed in other  tryptamines will show up together simply late for the party, and at that  moment the distinction between 4-HO-MiPT and other 4-substituted  tryptamines will be essentially obliterated? Maybe I'm just not  sensitive enough to these effects to get them on doses of 4-HO-MiPT  lower than 50 mg, whereas others get their own personal variants of them  readily, or, possibly, just get something entirely different.... I'm  not complaining though, as this atypical predominantly LSD-likeness is  really what has caused my interest in this and other MiPT molecules to  suddenly peak, and I wouldn't want to rob them of the thing I find the  most unique about them. Quite frankly, I am intending to try 5-MeO-MiPT  within the next day or two and am secretly hoping that it will have this  special "lysergic" feeling for me as well. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Alrighty, I will shut up now....

Kaleida-Damn, lol, well hi to you too.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


It's been okay, just busy.  Well, Thursday night-Sunday I'll be doing whatever though.  Nah, I didn't get to try it!  I still have them, haha.  I was going to flush them, but kind of thought about how retarded that would be.  Especially the DOPr...but anyway, they're locked and stashed away so I don't have the option either.  At least for the foreseeable future, aka not any time soon year-wise.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Yeah, definitely there's a lot of wiggle room for variable effects between users, but they'll have some similarities as well.  For me, just ime, it was subjectively more like mushrooms than anything else, even metocin.  What should be noted is that those are the only 4-substituted tryptamines that I've tried, so I'm sure the ones you mentioned should be even more so, or at least that it's very likely to be even more similar to psilocin subjectively.  I can see your point.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


About with lsd, it was different for me, but that doesn't mean someone such as yourself can't find the similarities between them.  To me, opposite reactions to psychedelics are a reality, so yeah, I would just agree with everything you said.  I haven't tried MPT, and honestly a few years ago I would've been down to try all of the psilocin analogues, so you're lucky to have taken all of those.  I don't really have a personal opinion since I haven't tried them, but it's nice to get your take on it.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


But yeah, miprocin can get hectic at higher doses.  50mg and above is sure to induce a strong +++.  Have fun!

I agree that miprocin kind of resembles LSD. First time I tried it I found it was like an acid trip at high speed, compressed into a few couple of hours. 

Anyway, psychedelic's seem to affect everyone more or less differently, and in further experimenting with this compound I found the LSD aspect to be less pronounced as I upped the dose.

How long would 18-20mg of miprocin last, roughly? About equivalent to a mushroom trip of similar effects?

Anywhere from 4-6 hours, depending on if you're including the come-up time too.  Yeah, I'd say 20mg is roughly equivalent 2g's of pcilocybin mushies.  I guess the point is 20mg is about a medium to maybe high dose in most cases.


For me, it was a definite ++ and not much more than that.  But others have seemed to have had +++, so I guess the range is right around there at ~20mg (because some dose by the mg like 18, 22, 23, etc).

Well, I'm glad to hear it's going well. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) But, you were going to flush them? O.O Just because you don't feel like tripping anymore? You and I have very different mindsets about these things lol. But, oh well, for now I've got plenty of time and I'm not going anywhere.... Even if it takes over a year, I'd still be interested in hearing how that trip goes if you ever get around to it. ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


That is a good observation though, when I said all that I wasn't thinking about the fact that a lot of people have experience with 4-HO-MiPT but not many other 4-substituted tryptamines. That would of course skew the perception of how mushroom-like they are compared to one another... so there's just even more potential confusion muddling things up. Though, I should say, I actually did take some 5-MeO-MiPT today and had sort of a realization while thinking about it and my other trips about how 4-HO-MiPT is more similar to mushrooms than other tryptamines for me too: to make a long story short, I find them both to be very high on the geometric, sensory overload, mind loopy kind of experience, as opposed to the more hedonistic, dissociative/visionary kind of trip I get from straight alkyls with bulk like 4-HO-MPT or 4-HO-DPT. So, in that sense, even though I do personally find its geometry and things to be more like LSD than mushrooms, from a quantitative rather than qualitative perspective I also find that to make it more mushroom-like than the others. So, again, I guess it just comes down to perspective.


I am definitely even more interested in exploring with 4-HO-MiPT again after today.... Thanks for the encouragement! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

That's a very fitting description of how I felt about it, and actually also 4-HO-MPT, MiPT, and even the 5-MeO-MiPT I took today to some extent. One of the most noticeable things about it is that the time course in changes in visual, mental, and physical effects is very similar to LSD with each, just proportionally shortened.


I expect the similarities to LSD to become less with higher doses too, but that's perfectly fine. I don't mean to suggest that I'd rather these molecules be LSD-like either, as I'm not married to the idea of LSD being the perfect psychedelic.... I simply think that something that feels at its base like it may draw from a similar area of perception as LSD might be likely to produce similarly deep effects of its own when used properly, but ultimately I would rather those effects be unique in their own right as well, not just a copy of something else good. Variety is the spice of life, after all. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

To me Miprocin last lot longer than 4-6 hours, I always mix with nootropics tho and I think it can increase the lengh of the trip.

I can feel it for at least 6-10 hours depending on the dose. 10 hours is for 60mg fumarate or 42mg freebase.

O.O Just because you don't feel like tripping anymore? You and I have very different mindsets about these things lol. But, oh well, for now I've got plenty of time and I'm not going anywhere.... Even if it takes over a year, I'd still be interested in hearing how that trip goes if you ever get around to it. ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

That would of course skew the perception of how mushroom-like they are compared to one another... so there's just even more potential confusion muddling things up. Though, I should say, I actually did take some 5-MeO-MiPT today and had sort of a realization while thinking about it and my other trips about how 4-HO-MiPT is more similar to mushrooms than other tryptamines for me too: to make a long story short, I find them both to be very high on the geometric, sensory overload, mind loopy kind of experience, as opposed to the more hedonistic, dissociative/visionary kind of trip I get from straight alkyls with bulk like 4-HO-MPT or 4-HO-DPT. So, in that sense, even though I do personally find its geometry and things to be more like LSD than mushrooms, from a quantitative rather than qualitative perspective I also find that to make it more mushroom-like than the others. So, again, I guess it just comes down to perspective.

Haha, yeah I know, I felt all righteous when I decided to quit.  But when I opened my Pandora's box, I thought about the effort I put into getting them, and so...yeah.  I'm just glad I'm not tempted like I would've been in the past, but that's how I know that I really made up my mind about it.


Hmm...I thought about tripping maybe once a year after this year, but the thing is that I know myself and my own tendencies; once I get back into it, tripping once a year will be impossible.  It's still an all or nothing style for me, until I have the leisure to try to strike a balance with my damn ways of doing things.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Yeah, your life seems so chill!  Especially because you've gotten to try so many of the psilocin analogues during the last couple (?) years or so, meaning you were able to do everything you needed to do while still finding time to trip like that.  I could barely find time to trip last year that it was hella disappointing to go out like that, but whatever.  The DOPr trip still sticks with me though!  I'll never forget that 8mg trip.


Though when I reach my current goals, I may actually take up that offer and try both the DOPr and DOC.  And perhaps I'll finish the combinations, idk, if that time comes it won't be for a long time anyway, so I'll decide then.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


But yeah, shrooms have always been one of my favorites.  I just refuse to ever eat any again because the last time I did, my stomach hurt so bad that I just stayed doubled over in pain at my friend's house for hours.  So years later, I literally came here searching for a potential replacement and saw this thread.  Miprocin is just that good ime.  Very similar, imo a bit better, and of course no body load to speak of.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


But yeah, I had always wondered what the other 4 subs were like.  Lucky you!  Iprocin also interested me too.


Anyway, glad to see you're a mod here now.  I may bug you from time to time if you don't mind.  ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And yeah, I'm sure you'll enjoy it!  I remember a trip a couple months ago where I could not stop laughing/joking/smiling, and that's like the hallmark of psilocin for me.  It always has that effect, whether it's the 4 subs or shrooms.  For that alone, and the happiness as well as the positivity, it's simply a gem.  You'll like it and ride with it just fine.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yeah, that's one of the main reasons I would never flush my stuff, it's  not like it all just fell into my lap lol. At the very least though,  even if I felt sure that I would never use any of it again for some  reason, I think I would probably at least slowly distribute them to  friends when they were wanting novel psychedelic experiences. That way  they would at least be used for something....


I totally get that, as the all or nothing style used to be how I handled  psychedelics too. Only lately has it started mellowing out.... Even now  when I've only been dosing about once a month I sometimes feel like I'm  forcing myself to trip again, but I still never regret it and I think  that I wouldn't want to completely cut it out of my life. I'm actually  really happy with it being that way right now, I feel like this is  probably the healthiest level of psychedelic use I have yet achieved.


My life is nice too, though it could be chiller lol. But I'm not  complaining; it definitely was a major player in why I was able to  explore so many psychedelics so quickly. And yeah, most of it happened  over the last couple years, though I had used 4-AcO-DMT before I  actually started seeking them out specifically. You got some good ones  in though too, and there's plenty of life left.... That's also why I'd  never flush my stuff. ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) You never know when you might have a lot more  time to trip again and a strong desire to do so at the same time.... No  reason to get rid of everything now when you might want it later! (Well,  unless you're like paranoid of being busted with it or something I  suppose.... That whole thing.) I really would love to hear about that  combination though, if you do decide to do it one day I bet you'll be  happy you saved them and waited for the right time. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


That sounds awful about the mushrooms, though. :S And now that actually  makes me really worried.... I've never gotten any stomach problems from  eating mushrooms before, but I also haven't eaten them in... at least  three or four years? And in that time I *have* started getting GI  issues from many other things.... I've actually had five grams stashed  away to eat at some point in the future when it feels right, but now I'm  really paranoid that that will happen if I do, and I'll be tripping my  head off at the same time. Maybe it'll be better if I make a tea from  them....


It's cool that you found your replacement in 4-HO-MiPT though. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  That's another one of the reasons I love all the individual differences  too.... I think it's neat that everyone is able to find their  individual perfect medicines if they do the research and look in the  right places. Personally, as I believe I've said, I actually get a  consistently decently heavy body load from 4-HO-MiPT, compared to most  other 4-substituted tryptamines. I even had a mostly cleaner body  feeling with 5-MeO-MiPT, surprisingly. Despite that though, I do still  find it very euphoric most of the time.... Even with that particularly  heavy 50 mg trip I had, I did also get bursts of laughter every now and  then, and sometimes even moaning. I also get that on 4-HO-MPT, whereas  on 4-HO-MET and mushrooms I have only gotten the laughter so far, and I  honestly don't think I can say that it has played a significant role in  any of my experiences with tryptamines lacking N-methyl groups... though  I have seen someone laugh so hard on 4-HO-DET that they started losing  control of their bodily functions.


Yes, I don't mean to entice  you further, but 4-substituted tryptamines really are a special group of  psychedelics. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) I feel very lucky to have sampled all of them that I  have. There's not one I don't think I would take again without  hesitation if the mood struck and it was my best option, which is not  something I'm sure I would say about other groups of tryptamines within  the same subfamilies yet despite having used an even fewer number of  them (e.g., DALT was way too mild for the hassle of taking it, and  bufotenin/5-HO-DMT gave me the harshest body load I've ever had from a  psychedelic).


With regards to 4-HO-DiPT, I think you would  probably get a kick out of it. Understandably with its structure,  something about it I do find to be more similar to 4-HO-MiPT than any of  the others, but there are some pretty significant differences too. An easily noticeable but hard to describe one is that there is just a similar "feeling" to the specific type of psychedelic dissociation and thought trains produced therein caused by the isopropyls just like there is with the methyls, ethyls, and propyls, but beyond that I  think I would say that the primary similarity for me is that 4-HO-DiPT  seems to be subjected to the same activity-reducing effects that  4-HO-MiPT has relative to other N-methyltryptamines but within the  symmetrical tail tryptamine group instead; that is to say, those  qualities I find strongly in psilocin, 4-HO-MET, and 4-HO-MPT and weakly  in 4-HO-DET and 4-HO-DPT I have yet to find really at all or at least  more than slightly in either 4-HO-MiPT or 4-HO-DiPT. However, it doesn't  work the other way around, as I find 4-HO-DiPT to be just as potent as  any of the other symmetrical tail tryptamines in producing the specific  effect I notice within them, if not even the most potent at it. The end  result is that I find it to still be more similar to mushrooms in some  ways than 4-HO-MiPT is for me, but the thing about 4-HO-DiPT is that it  also has a drastic reduction in colorful geometric visuals in relation  to these visionary effects and its headspace, so this makes it seem less  like most of the other tryptamines for me in that way and more  comparable to lower doses of 4-HO-DPT and 4-AcO-DALT, but even less  visual. But, 4-HO-MiPT is also not very visual with eyes open for me  around 30 mg but became practically blinding at 50 mg, so perhaps a  similar relationship will follow here. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Likewise, 4-HO-DPT and  4-AcO-DALT also seem to have more visual potential in higher doses for  me, but I have not quite experimented enough with them yet to really get  anything too heavy.


Actually, all of this talk is really making  me want to explore more deeply with it.... I think I might do it as my  next 50 mg 4-substituted tryptamine trip. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And definitely, drop me a line whenever you'd like, from one mod to another. :D And thanks! I'm enjoying being on board.

Kaleida-Apologies, but replying back to you properly takes some time.  There's a lot to digest, heh.


Haha, yeah, I did give away my 5 mapb when I had it, and miprocin too, but everything else I actually got from my friends.  So they don't want them since they can get them and also more stuff than I can give.  =T  I haven't seen them for about 6 months, and it's only because they're going to pressure me to trip with them, so yeah.  (They're like boooo because I quit, lmao).  Are you implying you want my stuff?  Haha, jk.


That's good.  If you have the time and leeway, might as well.  That's always fun.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Oh lol, no worries, I'm not very paranoid about much.  I'm actually a bit too carefree sometimes that it annoys me.  However, I don't have That much stuff, so if worst comes to worst, they can all be flushed in one go easily.


Indeed.  I had taken shrooms a maximum of 10 times before my last time, and that was the only time that happened.  I'm positive the shrooms were bad though; moldy, old or whatever--I have no idea.  But it didn't just hurt that day, but the day after too.  It felt like my stomach was between a vice and getting crushed.  It took me about 2-3 days to feel well again.  So, as one can imagine, I didn't eat another shroom again even though I loved its effects.


I see.  Yes, that's why at the time miprocin was a Godsend to me.  I had missed that tryptamine-shroom-like experience since it had been many years.  It is great that people have their own personal favorites and what not, and it only makes sense because we're all different, and the fact that there's a huge variety of substances to choose from.


Yup, these psilocin analogues are special.  I couldn't find even half of the stuff you tried, and the ones I did see, I didn't get and they subsequently disappeared afterwards.  Metocin was nice, but I felt like miprocin is better and had more to offer.  Iprocin seemed like a gem too, especially because I've never experienced tremors off of anything, so I feel like I would've gotten the best out of that one too.  I wanted to see how the headspace was, and to try a 4-sub that isn't really known for its visuals.  But yeah, it's cool that you had the pleasure of partaking on all of those.  4-ho-mpt seems interesting as well!


Okay, good luck with your trip!  50mg is a strong dose, yet considering your experience, it should be a piece of cake since all that's needed is to simply relax and be comfortable.  Miprocin will then take you away, lol.


Yeah, I kind of do need to talk to you outside of this thread, (not anything that important) so I'll drop you a line some time soon.  And no problem!  However, as you saw, it was all you in the end.  I just nodded in agreement metaphorically, heh.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

What I will say is that it isn't worth the risk, from potentially dangerous interactions to reducing the effectiveness of either/or.  It's probably a good idea to just wait until you are over it.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

yeah, took a week off, which supposed to be enough to fully clear system, and I was one of the ones who got the worst side effects from my first time doing 5-mapb.  had it abou 8-9 days and really dont know what caused it, bc it tested out good on all the regeant tests (testkits fro dancesafe), weighted 110 mgs out on two scales.       ive done ecstacy pills/mdma  around 30 nighs in my lifetime and never had those sides for a week, even the comedown from ecstacy pills seemed minor compared to this, this was full blown, super emotional, id cry over the littest things, brain zaps when sleeping, feeling sick, fainty, low blood sugar i actually passed out while cooking in my kitchen and hit my head on the floor hard.  I told my mom what ive did (5-map) actually lied o her first time =-(, but i told her if i died i was in a good place.     on a scale of 1-10 i thought i was about a 7.5 close to dieing.  Ended up throwing three grams of 5-mapb out.


since then I tried another tested batch and started low at 50 mgs..then next time 70, hen 90, then 100, so that batch seemed fine.   That is why with new stuff testing is a must , along with allergy test and the first time always start on the lower end, to make sure its no containmented or get bad sides


the sub-4  trypatmine experience, miprocin, was so much different than empthogeon experience. to me it was quite intense, at one pointt i was not making any sense logically to my girlfriend or myself and she pointed this out and helped me relize. Later on I did.   Its alwas good to use these as positive tool, to enhance your life, whether it be for couples therapy, healing trama, or helping yourself out in any way

Innerpeace-I see.  Idk, I'm not expert or a doctor, so just use your best judgment.


Yeah, 5 mapb is strong.  I can only relate when I got that vaso.  Man, that was bad.  Haha, learned my lesson after that.  But are you good with your mom now?  I hope so.


Miprocin is awesome.  Ahh, I miss those trips.  It does get hectic, but it's like the welcome kind (eg. bring it on, lol).


Yeah, self help is important to take away from psychedelic use, well whenever it is possible.  It's like an opportunity that is great to take advantage of because of the unique experience.

yup those were doses done. One time combined 5-mapb at 100 with 11 mgs 4-ho-mipt, and psychedelia was there. Didnt mean to derail the thread.

I think someone here should maybe adress this thread I found in the pill reports subforum. Not sure why it was there but I think it would he in the interest of harm reduction if someone who knew more about the subject of 4-ho-mipt and lithium than me to answer.

Finally getting to try 4-HO-MiPT soon after having told myself I would try it for the past year and a half. Can anyone compare the mindfuck with this in comparison to say, 4-AcO-DMT or mushrooms for me?

There's a lot less in low to moderate-ish doses. In a relative dose-dose comparison, it's most likely never going to have the same kind of sometimes overwhelming profundity that those two drugs can cause, IME. However, at pretty high doses (in my case, repeated insufflated doses) it can get pretty fuckin' confusing/mindfucky. But those were excessive doses that produced massive visual distortion. In general, it's a pretty easy going, positively tinged experience.

The above is on point.  It's only when you push the dose above 50mg does the headspace get wacky.  Otherwise, it's a happy-go-lucky 4 sub.

I'm not sure about miprocin yet, but I've taken 4-Aco-DMT as a daily kratom user.  My miprocin is on the way so I'll let you guys know about the combo soon.

I find myself unexpectedly humbled by this chemical. 55mg ingested orally at 1 am, by 1:15 I notice strong visual distortions and very colorful hallucinations. I laid in bed around 1:45 with Grateful Dead playing in the background and I am engulfed in my own imagination. All barriers between my normally (in retrospect) very compartmentalized memories and emotions are evaporated. Some very confusing interval of time passes and I weary of my complete lack of sense and definition, so I put on Netflix and find "The Inexplicable Universe" with Neil DeGrasse Tyson and have someone I trust to explain to me how the universe works. I had completely forgotten how crazy a tryptamine headfuck can be, and I'm just glad I had the sense to wait until I was home to take it and not at a concert.

Sorry to double post but I've had issues with mobile before.


I forgot to mention something that really weirded me out at first until I figured it out. I experienced HUGE audio distortions for probably the first 5 hours of the trip. As I was listening to Dr Tyson speak it sounded like he was constantly speeding up and slowing down, like if you had a knob tied to the audio speed and just kept twisting it as he spoke. Once I figured out it was the drug and not Netflix fucking with me I found it somewhat amusing.

To me miprocin is the all funs and games of the 4-ho-Xtryptamine. I was psychologically stuck in a logical loup of unused thoughts. I didnt know why I was thinking so I didnt know why to stop so I could not know how. This drug showed me thinking is to gain control on things that gives you satisfaction/comfort/pleasure 2 months after the trip I was a totally different person.

I had my third experience with miprocin recently.  I am an alcoholic/addict in recovery and have revisited psychedelics recently in hopes that I could reawaken my sense of wonder an appreciation of the world as I've been soul searching and working towards solutions.  I'm of the opinion that recovery is not necessarily total abstinence.


I dosed 15 mg of miprocin recently after the last dosage of approx 20 mg.  It's not as heavy to me as 4-aco-DMT, which I have dosed up to 50+ milligrams, but to me it feels more potent.  It's "brighter" to me and very introspective but hasn't left me weeping rainbow tears of joy like psilacetin.  


I have really wanted to drink lately but I have abstained.  Alcohol isn't something that I want to use anymore although I still crave it often.  It helped me ruin my life and psychedelics have only given me positive results.  It has no place in the future I want to build for myself and the family I want to have some day.  I am a severe alcoholic in remission and cannot drink like a normal person.  I was so grateful during and after my trip that I didn't drink.  It would've tainted the trip.


During the slightly uncomfortable come-up( I insufflated most of it) I struggled with wanting to drink to take the edge off but once it kicked in fully after 1 hour I felt joyous and introspective.  I decided to go speak to my cousin who is visiting from Austin,TX.  It was close by I did not drive. I spoke to her for 2+ hours as I haven't spoken to her at length in many years. I want to be a better friend, son, family member, and worker at my job.  I stopped caring about anything and everybody for so so long and now I've been working hard on self improvement and seeing results in my life.


My heart chakra is open today. I appreciate people despite and sometimes because of their flaws, when I can stay mindful that is!  After a decade of struggling, the last 3 1/2 years having been the worst, I'm finally recovering which I didn't think was possible.  It has been due to support and a lot of hard work, but the responsible use of some psychedelics has also been a catalyst for change and has helped me remember that life is beautiful and that we all shine under the same sun.

This is such an important thing to realize. I think a lot of people go in to psychedelics thinking it will fix their problems, but that's just unrealistic. Maybe you realize something, but then you still have to do something to get there. That something you have to do can be very hard, and it won't be any easier, but psychedelics can help you find the drive to be the best person you can be.

Both modern and pre-prohibtion research have indicated psychedelics have potential in treating addiction. The co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous Bill Wilson was involved with early LSD research and advocated LSD assisted psychotherapy as a treatment.

> Psilocybin-occasioned mystical experiences have been linked to persisting effects in healthy volunteers including positive changes in behavior, attitudes, and values, and increases in the personality domain of openness. In an open-label pilot-study of psilocybin-facilitated smoking addiction treatment, 15 smokers received 2 or 3 doses of psilocybin in the context of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for smoking cessation. Twelve of 15 participants (80%) demonstrated biologically verified smoking abstinence at 6-month follow-up. Participants who were abstinent at 6 months (n=12) were compared to participants still smoking at 6 months (n=3) on measures of subjective effects of psilocybin. Abstainers scored significantly higher on a measure of psilocybin-occasioned mystical experience. No significant differences in general intensity of drug effects were found between groups, suggesting that mystical-type subjective effects, rather than overall intensity of drug effects, were responsible for smoking cessation. Nine of 15 participants (60%) met criteria for “complete” mystical experience. Smoking cessation outcomes were significantly correlated with measures of mystical experience on session days, as well as retrospective ratings of personal meaning and spiritual significance of psilocybin sessions. These results suggest a mediating role of mystical experience in psychedelic-facilitated addiction treatment.

> Assessments of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in the treatment of alcoholism have not been based on quantitative meta-analysis. Hence, we performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in order to evaluate the clinical efficacy of LSD in the treatment of alcoholism. Two reviewers independently extracted the data, pooling the effects using odds ratios (ORs) by a generic inverse variance, random effects model. We identified six eligible trials, including 536 participants. There was evidence for a beneficial effect of LSD on alcohol misuse (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.36–2.84; p = 0.0003). Between-trial heterogeneity for the treatment effects was negligible (I2 = 0%). Secondary outcomes, risk of bias and limitations are discussed. A single dose of LSD, in the context of various alcoholism treatment programs, is associated with a decrease in alcohol misuse.

Absolutely true. There's documentation.  I go to AA pretty religiously, ha ha. It's kind of cultish and I haven't "drank the Kool-Aid" but it's a good support group and free therapy. I do love telling people in AA that Bill W. took acid, a lot of them don't want to believe it.  It shakes them up.  He co-authored several papers but I read that he had his name taken off of some of them because of backlash in the group.


I hate how they tell people not to use " drugs" but most of them sitting there drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes, drinking a drug and smoking one at the same time. They can get very hypocritical.

The part of AA that kills me is when people use for a quick fix and do get better.....figure things out and see themselves and learn 


And them if as when they no longer need it and can successfully use like a "normal person" there is now that stigma....your an alcoholic, you can't do that

For example, I've been going to AA off and on for almost 10 years.  It's like how talk therapy is more efficacious with medicine co-administered.


To stay on topic, I hadn't tried any rc psychedelics until recently.  Rc's in general yes, psychs no.  I didn't have much access to traditional entheogens besides cacti and HBWR but having mostly gotten sober already I needed a push, enter mystical experience with 4-aco-DMT and miprocin.  Miprocin has  been an incredible medicine so far.  I could dose precisely and know what to expect, as much as one can with psychedelics.  Fantastic compound.

^Thank you.  I'm not one to usually tout AA, it is extremely flawed.  I benefit from the support though.  It's like night and day how much better my life has gotten.  Haha, when they say the Lord's Prayer at the end sometimes I pray to the peyote gods...

I received 100mg of this yesterday and have just got round to opening the package. It's been hot recently (for this place anyway!) and the substance has turned into a sticky, resinous sort of consistency. Any ideas on how to recover the material? It's impossible to weigh out at the moment as I have no idea of the weight of the greaseproof paper to which it is currently set. I've put it in the freezer for now to see if it will solidify and enable me to break it off in order to weigh.

In terms of storage, I think I read in one of these threads that this stuff doesn't dissolve easily; I'm hoping that freezing it will bring it to the consistency of shatter so I can at least weigh it. After that I guess I just have to keep it in the freezer in that state rather than trying to dissolve?

Ha ha! I could actually have spread it on toast and had miprocin butter. If I'd ordered 25mg it would have been perfect!

Freezing it made the substance a little more manageable, albeit briefly! I was able to measure out a few doses before it returned to gloop. I haven't come across such a sticky substance for ages. Touching it leaves a thin film on the skin. I tried to lick off a tiny bit but it barely budged. Reckon I licked about 2mg judging by weights so that can act as my test dose. Will probably spend the next 2 hours with Placebo effects...

Sorry for seeming to talk to myself so much (as Blackadder said, it's the only way I can be sure of an intelligent conversation ). Anyway, I received a delivery of 100mg of 4-ho-mipt today. That left me wondering just what it was I received yesterday. Looking at early posts in thread 1 it is definitely of the consistency that the early batches of 4-aco-mipt were described as "...an epoxy like goo". It must have come from the same vendor who realised their mistake and am waiting on a reply.

In the absence of a response from the vendor I went with the lovely powdered 4-ho-mipt. 

Just 12mg, dumped in water, stirred and down the hatch. I'd actually been wondering whether to up it to 15mg given the reports on here. So, 11.15, down the hatch. 

According to my notes, at T +0:25 I was quite stunned by the come up. I thought 4-HO-MET was quick, but this stuff leapt upon my senses like a horde of shoppers on black Friday. 

With the help of some new weed just at the plateau I was able to achieve a solid +++ and ride the waves of pleasure for a good couple of hours.


My god this stuff rocks! I'll put up a trip report when I get a chance (loads already I know, but the more info out there on various responses to doses the better IMHO). Can't wait to go up to 15mg...


Addit: [Trip report here](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/792920-(4-HO-MiPT-12mg)-First-Time-Today-s-Shipping-Forecast).


I feel a bit like I arrived late to a party in this thread..

Lots of people are saying this stuff turns color/goopy after a few months/weeks if you don't store it in a freezer.  I am by no means a chemist, but does that mean it eventually degrades in potency and effectiveness as well?


I'm Just wondering because I've also seen people that say 4-AcO-DMT degrades over time but I have a batch from over 10 years ago that seems just as potent as the newer batches I have, which was just stored in a clear bag inside an envelope.  It got a little bit more "goopy" in that time.  I'm going to try to vacuum seal the 4-HO-MiPt and at least put it in a fridge if not a freezer, but I'm just wondering at what point does it become a problem in terms of losing potency?  And can it break down into anything potentially harmful (not that the drug itself is necessarily completely harmless in the first place)?

I thought this was only true for 4-aco-mipt???

I've had a vial of 4-ho-mipt sitting in a drawer for almost a year and it has the exact same potency and appearance as the day I bought it. 

(Fine white powder with some clumpy hard chunks that break up into a fine powder.  It's not sticky or anything but there were a few clumps of "rocks" of powder that broke up just fine. 

I usually keep important chemicals under lock Bd key and in multiple containers in a deep freeze with dessicants but I forgot entirely about that vial of 4-ho-mipt and after a year I tried it at a festival 2 weeks ago and it was potent as the day I tried it!

Interesting thanks for the response.  People were definitely saying the degradation/goopy stuff about 4-HO-MiPT in this thread and "part 1" though.  Good to hear it's maybe not quite as sensitive as many people have said.  I will still probably err on the side of caution.  I haven't actually tried it yet but hopefully in the next couple days I'll be able to make time for it.

Seems plausible that degradation may depend on impurities and exposure to humidity among other things. I wonder if pure microcrystals could 'galvanize' when particles degrade on the outside a little. With the 4-AcO the acetyl may pop to the 1-position, and I guess this happens more rapidly if there is the right salt or pH in the product to facility that transfer. Still, technically you would not really expect an issue with 1-Ac-4-HO-MiPT potency, it would be similar to ALD-52:LSD ... but pretty sure it has been detected in black goop.


Also perhaps the type of salt may matter...

So basically, 4-aco-mipt should be pretty much as stable as 4-ho-mipt if not moreso?

I assumed this was the case for all 4-aco vs 4-ho compounds but I've never seen 4-aco-mipt available anywhere ever but 4-ho-mipt is everywhere I look. 

I always wondered about this and assumed it was because 4-aco-mipt was more unstable than 4-ho-mipt. 

Strange.

No, you would expect 4-AcO's to be more stable than 4-HO's because the AcO protects the OH from degradation reactions like this:


![244dwfk.jpg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi39.tinypic.com%2F244dwfk.jpg&hash=7151591bfb9bdd4ecc4673b759a10e7d)


If the 4-AcO transfers to the 1-position it leaves the 4-HO exposed, negating that protection... but was just mentioning a few other factors involved here. The conclusion was not that they are all equally stable though.


[https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/4_acetoxy_det/4_acetoxy_det_article1.shtml](https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/4_acetoxy_det/4_acetoxy_det_article1.shtml)


The color of dark gooey products is hypothesized to be a sort of polymer or oligomer... but as mentioned before initial degradation does not abolish psychoactivity, however I wouldn't be quick to believe that further degradation wouldn't be harmful to potency.

Also, there is the question of a change in effect from possible initial degradation products, plus the gooey stuff is just nasty.

I finally got around to trying this stuff and submitted a detailed report to erowid which hasn't been approved yet but unfortunately forgot to save it in a file, but anyway...


I tried 21-22mg for my first dose, eaten on a piece of bread on a pretty much empty stomach other than that (had eaten 6 hours earlier).  I dosed half of it at first, then the other half after about an hour.  First effects were felt around 20mins in, and peaking after about an hour.  I've tried a handful of other tryptamines in the past but this one has a very unique feeling to it.  While I enjoy them all (and have known and loved them) all of the other ones I have tried had a little bit of a "harsh" edge to the body load and also a little bit of an "evil" side to the headspace, whereas this one just felt 100% positive, very smooth but at the same time very intense and very pleasurable body sensations in places I never knew I had.


Like most tryptamines I had all sorts of ideas rushing through my mind at all times, but for me this one had more of a positive vibe to it than some others I have tried.  4-AcO-DMT and shrooms for example are very introspective for me in a way that sort of points out the things I could do better in life, whereas this one was more telling me how a lot of the things I'm already doing are great and sort of "patting me on the back" while still acknowledging there is always room for improvement.


I took a short walk outside during the trip as well and nature was absolutely stunning.  Everything had colors and vibrancy I don't think I've ever seen before even on other tryptamines, but at the same time didn't have as many visual distortions as other tryptamines in terms of patterning, breathing, trails, etc.  I would love to go camping on this stuff as I just wanted to go lay in the woods somewhere soaking it all in, but since I was in a semi-public wooded area/park I had to at least try to hold it together a little bit.  Inside the OEVs weren't anything too spectacular.  Definitely some major color enhancement but just not nearly on the same level as being outside with all the plants/trees.


This had the most powerful pre-sensory hallucinations I have ever experienced outside of maybe some very high dose Ketamine and DXM holes.  I could both "hear" and "see" completely vivid/realistic other worlds and people in my mind's eye, and even more amazing still I seemed to be able to completely control it.  I could just think about something and that would magically appear for me.  I also had rapid back and forth conversations with myself and other "characters" in my trip who had their own voices that I could hear, and we would sort of engage in a debate with each other about various things (mostly of a philosophical/metaphysical nature).  I have never experienced this on anywhere near this level on any other tryptamine before and it is by far my favorite thing about the experience.


This stuff also lasted a pretty long time for me.  The peak alone was a good 6-7 hours, then another 3-4 hours coming down but still feeling pretty "out there".  I've only tried it once so far so it's a bit early to say for sure but this may just be my favorite tryptamine I have ever tried (having tried LSD, Shrooms, 4-HO-DiPT, 4-AcO-DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, and ayahuasca/DMT).  It was all of the good things about tryptamines and none of the bad things.  Despite being such a "feel good" sort of experience it was at the same time more intense than I expected it to be.  It's hard to compare different drugs but 21-22mg felt far more "powerful" than 30-35mg 4-AcO-DMT doses or 1/8th of shrooms, 3 hits of LSD, etc


In a way I am very much looking forward to doing it again, but on the other hand I have been so contented by the experience it almost seems pointless somehow.

my subtle without overwhelming dose was maybe 22 mgs.  It was strong and was second time ever on a psychedelic.  


*remember the fumurate version , which many use currently, is about 1/4th less potent than hcl*

All I can say about this substance is that IT IS AWSOME. I did 50mg of it and got BEAUTIFUL visuals and GREAT euphoria. I am sad I can't get any more of it but I have LSD ATM so I am ok.

Apologies, I know this post is a bit scrambled, I don't find writing all that easy at the best of times. but anyway.. I had my first decent trip from this tonight at 26mg taken in 2 bumps 30 mins apart and I'm now totally blown away by what this substance can do. After a couple of initial disappointments at lower doses. I experienced what I can best describe as a 370-380 degree headspace, my mind felt like a constantly expanding, inflating bubble, for hours just coming up and up, 3 hours and still climbing and the time dilation was like...3 hours felt more like 6. Listening to Boards of Canada the music sounded incredible, beyond stereo. At around 4 hours into it I experienced a repeat of the everything's going green effect which I find utterly fascinating, like I'm wearing green lens shades, I even had to check that I wasn't. truly bizarre. What really strikes me most about it is the 'physical' feeling that my mind is just getting bigger, seeing so much more. 

I'm going to try combining this soon with 4-ACO-DMT to see if it could prolong the visuals of that. I think could be a killer pairing if done right. 

I still haven't found this to be as in-your-face in the visuals department as BK-2CB which for me was off the charts melting wax rainbow infused curtains at 100 mg. I can now see how it could get more visual at higher doses. The headspace is really where this chemical shines though. It's quite deep but it's also light and I found myself seeing the funny side in everything. The visuals, such as they are crystalline in quality with a lovely glow coming from lights when not looked at directly. I can see how 50mg would give you awesome visuals but I don't feel ready to go that high just yet. I'm getting a lot out this at 26mg and it's only the fumarate. I seem to be quite sensitive to psychs. Sorry if this was all a bit disjointed. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Recently I added a few 4-HO-MiPT trip reports. Referencing to them here seams appropriate.


24mg: [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/805760-(4-HO-MiPT-24mg)?p=13818959#post13818959](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/805760-(4-HO-MiPT-24mg)?p=13818959#post13818959)

21/26/31mg: [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/805761-(4-HO-MiPT-21-amp-26-amp-31mg)](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/805761-(4-HO-MiPT-21-amp-26-amp-31mg))

Rectal admin. of 16mg: [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/805762-(4-HO-MiPT-16mg-(IR))?p=13818951#post13818951](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/805762-(4-HO-MiPT-16mg-(IR))?p=13818951#post13818951)


I really like this substance as it is quite intense for me visually, while remaining pretty clearheaded during most part of the trip. In my experience, mental fogginess will raise it's head round and about the time visuals start to subside a bit, and I do notice some cognitive fatigue from this point on. 


I've found dosing 20mg's on an empty stomach to vary in intensity in the past. Three times, using the oral parachute method, I've had very different results from the same batch while being in the same set and setting. One time it came on quickly, delivering a ++ within 15 minutes and ramping up to a +++ at T + 00:20. Other times, also dosing 20mg, I would have to wait an hour to reach a ++ state. And one time, again with 20mg, I was at a meager + two hours after ingestion and it never got beyond that intensity.


A 24mg oral dose dissolved in some liquid came on quickly, + at 15 minutes, ++ at 20 minutes, +++ at 30 minutes. 

A 31mg dose via parachute took a bit longer then an hour to get to +++ and was maybe a bit less intense as the previously mentioned 24mg dose that was dissolved in some liquid. Both times were on a completely empty stomach.


A 16mg rectal dose felt like a oral dose that lies somewhere between 20 and 25 milligrams (very tentative) with a quick come up (+ at T+00:15 / ++ at T+00:20 / +++ at T+00:30 (approximately)).


The plateau for visual effects after oral ingestion last ~4 hours for me with a visual comedown of ~1 to ~2 hours. Some lingering effects remain after this. 

The plateau for visual effects after rectal administration lasts about ~1,5 to ~2 hours, with a comedown of ~0,5 to 1,5 hours.


I'm wondering if others have experienced varying intensity of effects with the same dosage, set and setting.

I'm so jealous of everyone who gets such beautiful visuals from this chemical. I very much enjoy 4-HO-MiPT, but the visuals have always been lackluster for me compared to a lot of tryptamines. Even when they got fairly complex for me at 50 mg, they were still rather disorganized and stylistically restricted, though certain basic things like the tracers did get extremely intense. It did seem like they would probably continue to get a bit better at even higher doses than that too, but I already had a good bit of physical discomfort from that dose that makes me not really want to push much further.


I do find it potentially useful in the way it is for me too though. I think it's quite versatile in the sense that lower doses around 20-30 mg feel somewhat like a more trippy and erotic and less forced version of MDMA, whereas the 50 mg dose felt more like a full classic psychedelic experience along the lines of LSD or mushrooms with the same head trip and all, but at the same time its subtlety still made it feel much easier to handle than most that give me that kind of trip. I feel like it would be a fantastic option for me any time I wanted to commit to a full-blown tryptamine experience, but for whatever reason still wanted it to be as little of a commitment as possible. It's not really my favorite chemical for deeper exploration because of this, but I do find it to be a very nice recreational trip.


Maybe I just need to find a better dose for myself to really get a more fully satisfying trip with it though, it could just be that I've taken too much and too little, but not quite the dose that's just right. Maybe I'll try 40 mg next time and see how it goes. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have not used the same dose in the same set and setting twice, so I cannot answer that question. I have however noticed quite a bit of variability in that way with other psychedelics.

I`ve noticed it with DMT. Where smoking a set dose, say 30 mg, from the same batch, could give very different results on different occasions.

This one is particularly unpredictable for me. The first time I tried it I did 12 mgs expecting a VERY mild experience but my girlfriend and I had a pretty intense and shaky come-up, and then it was insanely visual for two hours with a sudden stop at the third hour. 


Two monthns after that I tried it at 15 mgs, and it was very underwhelming, and then later again at 18 mgs, and had a very euphoric and visual trip, but mentally underwhelming. I tried it at 20 mgs  after a long break, with similar results to the 18 mg experience.

I've smoked DMT a good number of times but not actually with measured doses, so it's hard for me to comment on that. I have noticed this kind of variability especially with LSD though, the trips are always strong but they can go in a lot of different directions at the beginning and that tends to set the mood for the rest of the experience. 4-HO-MPT seems to vary a good bit for me as well, though I've only tried it a few times so far and not at the same doses. The experiences have been remarkably versatile though, the first for me being most alike other synthetic tryptamines like 4-HO-MET and 4-HO-DET, the second being the most LSD-like trip I've ever had on a research chemical, and the third being much more heavily mushroom-like than either of those. 4-HO-MPT and 4-HO-MiPT are incredibly close structurally and in some effects too, so that might make sense here.


Maybe I'll just have to keep trying this one. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I'm definitely looking forward to my next experience with it, as visual or not it's always awesome anyway!

I've only tried 4-ho-mipt and 4-aco-dmt I think (I need to check my list to be sure, but lazy), and I can't remember anything from the 4-aco-dmt. So I can't comment on the 4-ho-MPT. 


On a side-note, which 4 substituted tryptamine do you like best, and how dissimilar is it from 4-ho-mipt?


And it's good to read that me and some of my friends aren't the only ones having varied effects from the same dose Img_9999.

For me, the 4 subs are horses for courses. If I want a relaxing ride and eye candy then it's metocin.

I find with miprocin that my writing creativity goes through the roof (I write political commentary) and am able to pick the most fantastic smilies and metaphors through deep thought (for example describing Nigel Farage as a Populist whore, a fetish doll for the disaffected - Nick Griffin (nasty racist ex-Leader of BNP basically a white supremacist) with a private education, vitriol with a posh accent).

4-aco-Met is for a rocket ride of fun, less relaxing than metocin, bit nicely visual.

I also have 4-ho-dmt which I will get around to testing soon.


Anyway, miprocin is to go-to substance for creativity for me.

I had a different response written to this before but I deleted it because I didn't quite fully agree with it in the end.... It's pretty hard to pick a favorite honestly, and believe me I've tried often. Let me see if I can try to explain my feelings about it all in a way that's satisfying this time....


First, let me say a little bit about my feelings about 4-HO-MiPT in relation to all this too. Though I do find it a bit reduced in effect from what I'm typically used to or going for with tryptamines, it does have the advantage of having an asymmetrical tail, which apparently is a good thing. Maybe it's just a coincidence, maybe there is some deeper consistent biological pattern to the difference, who knows? All I can say is that I'm not the first one to have noticed the symmetrical vs asymmetrical difference with tryptamines, and I've definitely preferred the latter so far. In simplistic terms, the primary differences between the 4-substituted ones that I personally have noticed are that the symmetrical ones seem to share a much higher magnitude of this one type of visionary imagery I get while meditating to an out-of-body state, and they often seem to leave me drifting into dream-like states, whereas the asymmetrical ones have less of this but instead seem to apply this really interesting filter to the visuals of people I get from each tryptamine at high enough doses, making them noticeably less 3D-looking than the visuals I usually get on the symmetrical ones, but also adding this really unique erotic twist to their design and the visuals around them which is accompanied by a greater degree of hedonistic euphoria. I really could go deeper into that too, and probably rethink parts of it here and there, but that's probably good enough for this time.... So, in relation to 4-HO-MiPT, even though it's a weaker hallucinogen in some more universal ways than the others for me, it still has that asymmetrical hedonistic vibe that I love, and its imagery is actually in some ways the most erotic of all of them still, so it's not like I don't still really appreciate it. While I really do enjoy exploring with all of these tryptamines too, in any typical mood I would probably still be more inclined to take 4-HO-MiPT than to go with something like mushrooms, 4-HO-DET, or 4-HO-DPT, which I would instead save for some deeper exploration.


So, the only 4-substituted tryptamines that I prefer to 4-HO-MiPT at the moment are the other asymmetricals that I've tried, being 4-HO-MET, 4-HO-MPT, and 4-HO-EPT, in the order I tried them. When it comes to actually picking a best between these three, it can be pretty tough.... My first post was more about this actually. One of the issues is that in many ways they just represent very different uses of psychedelic drugs, as does 4-HO-MiPT for me from the rest of them. To try to make it as easy as possible, I'd say that 4-HO-MiPT for me is best used as something like a psychedelic empathogen, 4-HO-MET is like visuals out the wazoo to the point of full-blown hallucinations while still being an easygoing ride, 4-HO-MPT feels a lot like LSD or mushrooms and can cause a pretty heavy mind/self trip under the right circumstances, and 4-HO-EPT so far has not been that geometric, but has lots of hedonistic visions and some headspace not unlike the classics. There are honestly almost no circumstances under which I would consider any of them interchangeable lol. I will say that the largest reason I prefer all of them to 4-HO-MiPT is just because of the intensity disparity, I enjoy the empathogenic properties but am normally looking to mostly hallucinate, but I'll give a little bit deeper of a comparison of each of them to it too.


4-HO-MET I think has the closest visuals to 4-HO-MiPT of them, with a bit less intricate geometry but a lot more realistic imagery and also a lot more color and light, the visuals can be extremely obvious and intense even in bright light. It produces no confusing or mystical headspace for me even at high doses unlike 4-HO-MiPT, but it can be stimulating and a bit delirious depending on how far you push. The body high I find to a little bit piercing than 4-HO-MiPT's, but also less tense, which is actually true for all of these tryptamines, but I also find 4-HO-MET to produce a greater hedonistic euphoria, possibly the most purely recreational of any 4-substituted tryptamine actually, it's great fun. The duration for me I would say is probably also the closest to 4-HO-MiPT's.


4-HO-MPT is a bit more unique visually, it actually has some of the elements that 4-HO-MET has for me that 4-HO-MiPT doesn't have but lacks some of the ones it does, and also brings in a few more things like more mushroom-like geometric designs and more LSD-like cartoon imagery. I personally consider it to be the most visually interesting 4-substituted tryptamine I've tried so far, but it can sometimes be dimmer or less broadly colorful than 4-HO-MET, and it takes higher doses to reach the same level of intensity. The headspace it puts me in is very similar to higher doses of 4-HO-MiPT, except that whereas that to me feels like sort of a lighter, more easygoing version of an experience like LSD, this one does not feel reduced in any way. I have as much respect for 4-HO-MPT's ability to rock my ego as I do LSD's, and that's just not quite true of 4-HO-MiPT. However, 4-HO-MPT also produces even less of a body high than 4-HO-MET at the same dose, so it can make me feel kind of raw or exposed compared to 4-HO-MiPT especially, though it does have some stimulating euphoria as well, and at higher doses produces a buzzing body vibration similar to other strong tryptamines. I would say that its duration is the longest for me compared to 4-HO-MiPT's, but not by a huge amount still.


4-HO-EPT is definitely the most distinct from 4-HO-MiPT, for me so far it's barely even produced geometric imagery while at the same time producing far more intense and detailed visionary imagery, particularly with eyes closed. The visions I've gotten on it so far have actually been almost entirely the kind that I've gotten specifically on the asymmetrical tryptamines so far, and I am starting to grow pretty fond of it for that reason. The headspace was pretty easygoing at the lower dose but started to have a bit of the same stimulated disorientation as 4-HO-MET and 4-HO-MPT at the higher dose, but at any dose there was also a distinct white light kind of thing going on, it is fairly dissociating at points but in a still fairly clearheaded way. The body high it provides is more subtle than most of these for me, but it does grow stronger over the course of the trip and by the end can actually feel pretty nice, and I'm betting it gets even better as the dose gets higher. This is overall definitely the most sedating of these tryptamines for me though, and I suppose kind of closer to 4-HO-MiPT in that way for me than either 4-HO-MET or 4-HO-MPT. Its duration also might actually a bit shorter than 4-HO-MiPT's for me, particularly for the span of time in which I actually significantly hallucinated.


So, I think that might be a bit better.... There really just are so many different things going on with these tryptamines though, like in addition to the symmetrical vs asymmetrical relationship there are different functional groups, like 4-HO-DET has a mind trip most similar to 4-HO-MET for me, 4-HO-DPT is most similar to 4-HO-EPT in that way, and so on, and then there are things like bulk groups such as similarities between 4-carbon tryptamines (4-HO-MPT, 4-HO-DET, 4-HO-MiPT, etc.) or 6-carbon tryptamines (4-HO-DPT, 4-HO-DiPT, etc.), there are just so many overlaps that it's almost impossible to just objectively rank them, it really just comes down to what you need when you need it. As I said before I really go in for the hallucinations, but even that doesn't necessarily help me much, because 4-HO-MET has the heaviest pure fun visual to any other effects ratio, 4-HO-MPT has the best mix of visuals and classic psychedelic headspace, and 4-HO-EPT has the most enjoyable and deep visionary effects I've had so far, so even with that the preference only gets you so far and you just end up having equally great options for very different scenarios. They really are each just amazingly unique molecules, no matter how many overlaps they all have.


Anyway, I hope this has all made sense and been informative!

Thank you both! 


4-ho-met sounds interesting! I like max visuals while staying as sober as possible mentally. Not always mind you. A good psychedelic head-space once in a while is fine. 


I'm a bit short on time now. Might edit this later for a more fleshed out response. 

Thanks!

Well, 4-HO-MET is definitely a great option for that. My highest dose was still totally clearheaded despite causing lots of hallucinations like animals and aliens mixed in with mandalas and mushroom-like facial imagery. It's a special psychedelic for sure, and quite popular for a reason!

For me, 4-HO-MiPT is very clearheaded mentally. It's only when visuals start to subside that I notice the onset of some mental fatigue. At that point I'm def. not mentally sober anymore. If 4-HO-MET does not do this, I'm interested indeed. Also, the more visuals it I'll bring, the better! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

What is the highest dose of 4-HO-MiPT you've taken again? It really makes a difference for me, when I took up to 30 mg I always found it very clearheaded as well, but when I jumped up to 50 mg it suddenly hit me really hard, even the perceptual effects were disorienting enough because I couldn't even see straight or focus my vision properly. I'm not sure if I've noticed the fatigue you mention on lower doses, but it does make me feel kind of lazy, so I could see a connection.


4-HO-MET has never been disorienting in the slightest for me, but it's worth noting that it can be quite stimulating, and if that aspect of it hits you hard you may feel lucid and in control but not exactly sober, it can make my thoughts feel a little rushed. Interestingly though, this actually disappeared and was replaced by a very alert relaxation at 50 mg, so it was even more of a purely visual trip then. I definitely think it's something you might really enjoy based on what you've been saying.

The highest I've gone is 31mg. What's the safety profile on the 4 subs? I'm def. interested in pushing the dosage.


4-HO-MET does seem intruiging. Thanks!

There is a report by someone on another forum about taking 450 mg of 4-HO-MiPT and having their vitals checked at the hospital and having them come out totally normal, all in the midst of an utterly mind-bending and relatively atypical trip. I'm also aware of others who have taken doses around 150 mg and claimed that they would still be willing to do more. Trip reports of similarly large doses of other 4-substituted tryptamines can be found around the net as well, not necessarily the 450 mg except for one I know of 4-AcO-DMT and doses of around 300 mg being reported for 4-HO-DPT, but I've definitely seen a good few of them reported on between 100-200 mg. I don't think that any of these reports should necessarily be taken as evidence that doing this is safe or that it wouldn't kill someone, but I think it's quite notable that despite having been used like by some and having been around for a while I am still not aware of a single death on medical record ever having been caused entirely or primarily be a 4-substituted tryptamine. It's worth considering as well that people have already been doing this for a very long time, like with taking an ounce of mushrooms for instance, and that hasn't seemed to cause serious health problems either. This all would suggest that, at the very least, this class of psychedelics is likely quite safe when used reasonably and responsibly, though of course as most of these are strong monoamine receptor agonists care should still be taken by anyone who has something like cardiovascular issues or increased risk of stroke or something along those lines, especially with the more newly released molecules before we have gathered information on them.


Personally, while I did not find 50 mg of 4-HO-MiPT to feel dangerous, I did find it to be verging on uncomfortable already, it made me feel very twisted up inside. It could have been a one-off thing though, hard to say... but it did discourage me a bit from pushing higher, though again my preferred effects from it so far have come from lower doses anyway. I might try pushing a good deal higher one day through a different route of administration though.


And no problem, I hope you find the 4-HO-MET to your liking. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

FWIW, I found 30mg metocin + 30mg miprocin to be a very nice combo. Pretty visual and the mental effects of both together felt very nice. Also seems to prolong the duration by 25% or so.

Of course, I would never ecommend those doses to someone who hasn't experienced the substances at higher doses separately first.

I had a lot of experience with empathogens, more so than delics and I could be wrong, I found miprocin to feel some what like an empathogen, yet I seemed to cry on it every time Ive done it past 15 mgs, and esp when alone, really let it out,  which didnt happen ever on the 35 times or so empathogens were done.   Maybe a coincidence, I dont know

Can anyone advise a solid but sensible low dosage for a party situation?  I've heard that 10mg or so is similar to a gram of shrooms, which would be about the level I'd like to be at.  However, I've also seen people claiming to have found only 12mg or so to be powerful.  I have a fair amount of experience of lowish dose tripping in public settings, but I'd rather not be blatantly tripping balls in this situation.  I've had a few experiences with 4-ho-mipt and found it pretty mild, but it has been a while and I can't remember the dosages I've tried.

If you're going to be dosing in a reliable manner ala relatively empty stomach, not in a gel cap, etc. then 8mg is probably enough.

It's going to depend largely on your own personal metabolic factors.  I'd say 8mg is certainly going to be safe, I can't imagine anyone tripping hard from 8mg.  It might also be quite underwhelming.  But probably best to try it low, and then next time you want it for this sort of situation and you want it to be a little stronger, try raising it up to 10 or 12mg.

I've never done it but I can guarantee there will be a huge difference, yes. I would start no higher than 10mg, maybe even 8mg. Plugged that will definitely be a full on trip. Not super strong, but a good starting point.

Yeah plugging most things makes them about twice as potent, or thereabouts.  So 8mg plugged is around the same strength as 16mg oral, or maybe a little less.  I can only think of a few exceptions, AMT comes to mind, it's about the same strength orally as plugged.  But all the 4-sub-tryptamines follow the doubled strength rule.

I haven't really experimented much with plugging tryptamines as I tend to find they come up so fast anyway and it works better with phenylethylamines.


Having said that, I have IMed tryptamines. The reason for mentioning this is that in my experience the strength of ROA goes eat>plug>IM (IV would be next but don't want to go there). 


So,  10mg of 4-HO-MIPT IM equates to roughly 25mg oral. Come up is faster as you'd expect. Therefore, I would expect plugging miprocin, based on my experiences with other substances, to be about 2x oral. Come up on IM takes less than 10 minutes for first effects (although this was after peak of an ALD52 trip so difficult to pinpoint exactly), so plugged I'd expect to be seeing first alerts in 10-15 min range.

Yeah I don't ever plug tryptamines either for the same reason.  They just work so well orally.


Yeah, IM and rectal admin are fairly similar really, for many things.

Has anyone tried this with codeine?  Does anyone have an idea how a lowish dose of 9-10mg 4-ho-mipt would work alongside codeine/opioids in general?  


I have some time to myself this evening and fancy a bit of fun.  I'd already picked up a pack of cocodamol to do a CWE on when I remembered about my small baggie of 4-ho-mipt sitting in my wallet.  I'm not necessarily looking for anything particularly mindbending, rather I'm hoping to add a bit of music/emotional/tactile enhancement, and perhaps even some minor visuals, to a chill euphoric high.  


It sounds like a good time to me, but I wanted to check there wouldn't be any issues with the 4-ho-mipt cancelling out the codeine (I can live with the trip being dulled a bit).  Does my suggested dosage of around 10mg added on to perhaps around 200-250mg codeine (with fairly considerable opiate tolerance, so this won't be a particularly heavy opiate dose for me)?  Any reason this could be a bad idea?

I got some trembling using this one on the come up's @ 30mg and 40mg but smoking a bit of pot took care of it. 


Only had two experiences so far, both whilst watching some music films on netflix which facilitated my consciousness to flow in fluid motion with the sights and sounds. I've always been very moved by music but this stuff seems to peak the emotional response to it up quite a bit. When sober music can hold personal meaning to me but on this I get a much deeper emotional response as I journey through my mind and I become part of the narrative of the songs. Was actually watching Neil Young Journeys on one of the trips and was able to sort through some depression ive been dealing with relating to low-self esteem and uncertainty since moving to a new area and starting my life over. I gained a lot of confidence from that trip and was able to see this new slate as a great opportunity and an exciting new chapter in my life, full of opportunity for growth. It made me realize everything is rolling along smoothly ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I should have written a TR for my second experience while I was watching Get On Up, it felt like I was thrust into that movie while I was watching it. It was a darker trip than the first and I don't even particularly care for James Brown but wow, I sure appreciated him and his story as portrayed by the end of it. Tried watching it again the next day when I came down but it was like a different movie without the fireworks.

So I got a chance to try this compound last saturday, 20 mg fumarate. At first I was feeling not even placebo, but at the 45 minute mark it hit me like a freight train, I was so high I felt dizzy. Nausea was unbearable at times, but I think that's something that usually happens to me rather than an effect of the drug. It was quite sensual and very visual regarding CEVs. OEVs only breathing and moving, no fractals. If I could spare the nausea it was nice, but the negatives far outweighted the positives. Is there anything that could help me? Ginger didn't do anything, maybe metoclopramide?


(mobile edit) I dosed on empty stomach, and ate a light sandwich when the nausea subsided a little to see if it helped, but it didn't ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

If you can get ahold of some ondansetron, it's an anti-nausea medication that is a 5-HT3 antagonist, which means it works particularly well to combat psychedelic nausea because the 5-HT3 receptors in the gut produce nausea and many psychedelic have action at those receptors.


Bummer about the nausea... I've never gotten any from any tryptamine except AMT,  Hope you find something that works.

Yeah, it sucks, but at least I'm certain it has to do with 5ht3 agonism because I don't have any even on high doses of amphetamines and dissociatives. I have read of ondansetron an was thinking of get ahold of some, thanks for the advice Xorkoth ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I still believe I will try miprocin again but at the 10 mg level as an aphrodisiac. I think it shows some promise there.

To me 4-HO-MiPT and 5-MeO-MiPT share a few characteristics in body feel, but the 5-MeO is a lot different too, it has a very intense energetic component.  4-HO-MiPT is more warm and glowy, quite pleasurable for me.  They're quite different drugs.


It's a 5-MeO thing mostly, seems that they all have an intense energetic/stimulating component.  5-MeO-DiPT is known for having that aspect, and [Kaleida recently tried 5-MeO-EiPT](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/824641-(5-MeO-EiPT-10-mg)-First-Time-A-Beautiful-Road-With-A-High-Toll?highlight=Kaleida) and found there to be a strong physical component to that too.  5-MeO-MiPT has this component the least for me, out of 5-MeO-(MiPT/DiPT/AMT).

Hey all

planning to do this materiel for the first time but only have experience with lysergamides and mdma..

how would you compare 20mg 4-ho-mipt to 150µg 1plsd?

and what are the chances of having a "bad trip"? just like LSD?

4-HO-MiPT and LSD are very different drugs.  I'd say that 4-HO-MiPT has a lower chance of a bad trip than LSD, because it's quite euphoric and friendly.  It also lasts much shorter.  I'm not really sure how to compare the two drugs honestly.  4-HO-MiPT is a tryptamine, it has that tryptamine thing going on.  It's more visual generally, with a stronger body high (which is pleasurable) and probably a similar level of intoxication at 20mg as with 150ug of 1p-LSD.


I like it best around 30mg personally, but 20mg is a good place to start.

cool

i understand comparing different drugs categorie is not easy, i just want to know if i can handle 20 mg of 4-ho-mipt and so i give 150 µg 1plsd as a reference, cause for me this dose is my normal dose for being just confortable and have a good trip without being too challenging.

A couple of weeks ago I measured out what I thought was 20mg of 4-HO-MiPT, i.e, 4 x 5mg scoops. Then later I realized that the scoop I used was 10mg so I actually took about 40mg. I had a really good time and never felt anxious or panicky at any point in the trip. 

I find there is something really beautiful and pristine about 4-HO-MiPT. It's really good for music enhancement and makes everything look sharp and twinkly. At lower doses I find it's not overtly visual in the way 4-HO-MET is but at 40mg the visual side becomes apparent.

By the way those scoops are not reliable ways to measure masses of powders, because different substances can occupy wildly different sizes for their weight, based on crystal structure.  You should really spend $25 and get a cheap milligram scale, The AWS Gemini-20 is pretty much the standard cheap scale and it works great.


But yeah you're really only guessing with those scoops.  Better than eyeballing, but not much better.

A level scoop gives you a decent starting point. I used a cheap scale (Gemini type) to check afterwards and found them to be close enough to the mark for relatively benign substances such as 4-HO-MiPT. . I would be more careful with substances like 2-CE with a steep dose- response curve.

How is redosing on this material ?

I mean can someone for exemple take 20 mg and 5 or 6 hours later when comming down take another 20 mg ?

is redosing worth it ?

^ I found that short-term tolerance builds rapidly with 4-HO-MiPT. If I were to redose on the comedown, I would double the dose to compensate.

Cross tolerance will definitely be a factor just 3 days after. For fear of giving bad advice, I don't wish to speculate on how much you'd need to increase your dose to compensate. Miprocin doesn't seem to be harsh on the body but larger doses can be unexpectedly intense given how light and benign it feels in the "normal" dose range.

I've tried microdosing miprocin at 5mg but the come up on tryptamines for me is too disorienting to take in the middle of a work day, for example. Even at 5mg, maybe that dose is too high? I may try 2-3mg when I get more of this stuff.


After the first 1.5 hours or so the 5mg dose works well as a cognitive enhancer for creative work. Makes me super clear headed and focused.

I'd say 5mg is well above a microdose for a 4-sub-tryptamine like 4-HO-MiPT.  I'd try 1-2mg and see what happens if you really intend to microdose and not just low dose.

I can now confirm that there is cross tolerence.4 days after candyflipping i had to take 77 mg (25mg + 25mg 50 min later + 27mg 35 min later ) in order to have a proper trip wich last for too long time, sleep was impossible even with weed, had to consume 0.25 mg xanax in order to fall asleep.

I find it stimulating also as far as tryptamines go, which is to say it's pretty relaxing, but unlike with some where I feel like I want to lay around, with 4-HO-MiPT I feel more fulfilled moving around and doing things, and if I do so, the euphoric excitement produces the tendency to move quite a bit.

^ I wouldn't necessarily say it's good for *all* needs. It is pretty radically different from psilocin, much moreso than 4-HO-MET or 4-HO-MPT, and strays from classical psychedelia more towards an empathogenic type high, with less hallucinogenic depth and ego-shattering mindfuck, and more blissful feelings of love and acceptance. Personally, if I had to pick a psilocin substitute, I'd go with 4-HO-MET any day of the week.

Hmmm...not me.  For me, metocin was just shallow.  Miprocin does have a particularly randy component to it...maybe that is the "empathy" you see in it?  All of the psychedelia of psilocin is in miprocin.....mostly....for me that is the way I read it.  Metocin was just a show.

4-HO-MiPT is one of two RC tryps that I have had.  I also had a 4-ACO-DET trip I may have written about.  But I had two 4-HO-MiPT trips at 20 and 22 mgs. It was very similar to mushrooms, but I have to say the whole being guided by a wise force only comes out for me when I take mushrooms. It is probably psychosomatic? I know the whole natural verses synthetic argument has been beaten to death on some threads here.  I think there is a big and dandy too so I am not bringing that up.  But 4-HO-MiPT at 22mgs I found it hard to put on a CD (2005) as it was head spinning. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I will say my second trip the dose was in a cap in an airtight jar in a cool closet for two years and it was still white and damn strong. I have heard of this clumping and turning black but that was not so.

Nah, its not just you...there is something holy to psilocin...probably because it comes from a mushroom.  I've had the mushroom and the pure psilocin and either way, that's holy stuff.  Sabina thought so too.

Yeah, you're definitely not alone in your opinion that metocin is just a show. I'm just always surprised to hear people say that, because metocin is incredibly profound for me, in fact the most thoroughly ego-dissolving 4-substituted tryptamine I've taken.


Out of curiosity, what's the maximum dosage of 4-HO-MET you've done?

How does tolerence build on Tryptamines over time ?I read on psychonautwiki.org that tolerence for this compound needs 7 days to be back at baseline, i find that is not accurate cause after one mouth of consumption of 4HO-Mipt weekly, i had to dose 90 mg (60 mg then 30 mg 45 min later...a huge dose !!) to trip correctly last saturday.any idea ?

That's a good question and one I'm interested in as well. Before I flushed my 3-meo-pcp, I was combining it at least once a week with miprocin, often more. My tolerance 6 months later still doesn't seem to have reset for tryptamines, although I can get full effects from LSD. Haven't tried any phenethylamines lately.


That dose is crazy. 60mg or so was very intense. I only go to around 30-40, though with the tolerance I've built up it's usually pretty disappointing. I just don't want to overshoot it and end up tripping as hard as I did on 60.

I would still expect effects. For me personally, adding a tryptamine on top of acid will bring on a pretty strong second stage to the trip.

After a 6month hiatus of taking tryptamines I took +/-20mg 4HOMiPT and had a wonderful trip. 3D visuals, music sounding extremely sensual (hallucinating whole scenarios in a sex club while listening to Pantha du Prince & The Bell Laboratory - Elements of Light), euphoric body load, resolved some guilt issues regarding my grandfather's death, cried some stuff out, and enjoyed some tasty foods afterwards. 


This is excellent stuff. Next time I will go for 25mg (w/o tolerance).

Me and a friend concluded that 20 mg is an uncomfortable high dose, and prefer 15 mg or less. We can't gain much insight if we're tripping so hard.

Strange, I can't seem to get worthwhile effects anywhere under 30mg with no tolerance. Prefer around 35mg for a pretty relaxed trip

Yes, I would say that we're pretty much psychedelic naives. And 20 mg got us both zoning out pretty hard. Not much deep thoughts, just floating around in space for at least two hours. Maybe I have a super powerful batch haha

Well it's probably the fumarate salt if it's a recent batch, but those are less potent than HCl or freebase, so if you have one of those it could indeed be stronger.  Also, when I started tripping I was a lightweight too. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  15-20mg isn't actually that low of a dose, but for someone who's tripped too many times to count for many years, it doesn't quite cut it anymore.

Since there's so much talk of dosages, I'll share my personal anecdote.... I actually recently took 4-HO-MiPT for the fifth time, at 35 mg, and it was by far my most intense and satisfying experience with this beautiful molecule thus far, even though it was just 5 mg above my decidedly mild first experience on 30 mg, and despite the fact that I've taken in dosages ranging from 20 to 50 mg already.


When I first took that 30 mg it was honestly mostly an empathogenic euphoria with mild, soft neon visual auras, barely psychedelic at all, though quite satisfying nonetheless. When I took the 20 mg then I was actually quite surprised, because while it still wasn't any more intense than the 30 mg in terms of open eye visuals, there was suddenly a very strong psychedelic psychological component, not an ego loss kind but not just the empathogenic vibe I was getting before either, but rather more like a very manicly stimulated LSD-like imaginative space filled with incredibly lush and exuberant visual imagery with a really confident or erotic vibe, making it feel much more visionary than the 30 mg even came close to. The 50 mg then was an attempt to try to bring these qualities out as much as possible, but honestly was mostly just a massive sensual overload, blinding tracers and texture magnifications and such, and the trip mostly focused on that overload without much other substance....


Then I took this 35 mg, again just 5 mg above my first experience which almost wasn't even psychedelic. It completely smashed me up.... There was a point during the peak where I was buckled over as if in pain because I felt so physically overwhelmed while simultaneously feeling so blissful it felt like a constant orgasm and laughing hysterically to myself about how insane it all was. With eyes open I had my best neon visuals on it yet, beautiful, ornate geometric designs pulsing into and out of existence on the shower curtains in the dark with flashing rainbow lights and all that kind of good stuff, and with eyes closed I was always immediately met with giant 3D geometric structures densely containing mushroom-like visual imagery quickly falling towards me over what seems like vast distances. There was also a very heavy sense of dissociation despite the apparent clarity, along with the visual effect of a huge spiral tunnel of arms reaching out to me that usually accompanies such a state, as well as the beginnings of delusions that I was a completely different person living a completely different life, and one that seemed to be headed in a particularly sexual direction. In other words, just a very intense and satisfying experience all around, and one I definitely wasn't expecting from a dosage so little above my starting point and so low compared to my current maximum....


What's the point? Not much really, other than that dosages can be tricky, and sometimes things are not quite as set in stone as we think or simply happen the way they're going to happen....


Also, I kind of just wanted to share a little about my trip. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 4-HO-MiPT is a wonderful molecule for sure, can't wait to take 40 mg next and see what other nonlinear response I get next....

I did a bag wash of this before.  I had done a bag wash of 4-HO-MET combined with 2C-B another time before that, and had an incredible musical trip, maybe the best CEVs I've ever had (very realistic yet super psychedelic, colorful, and they were telling this epic story the whole time, the peak was during Paul Simon's Graceland, which I hadn't heard since I was a kid, and I never got into it then).  Anyway, 4-HO-MiPT is particularly clumpy and I think I ended up taking a LOT of it with the bag wash because a lot was stuck in the bag.  I'd been tripping often during that time, so I expected I'd have a lot of tolerance and it would be fine, I wasn't gonna throw it away and I didn't have the foresight to dissolve it all and let it evaporate, so I went for it.  I very quickly became overwhelmingly high, all I could do was sit there.  Then it felt like my head ceased to exist, all I could perceive was colors radiating out from everything, it was impossible to think.  It wasn't even spiritual, it was just SO INTENSE.  I just sat there and stared.  Vaguely I had thoughts that I had surely broken my brain.  I was truly scared except I wasn't even able to grasp onto the fear fully.  


After a while I started to rebuild myself and my companions were having a nitrous party.  I started playing along to the music that was on and my friends were freaking out about how awesome it was with the nitrous, it was some of the best I've ever played.  Then I did a single nitrous blast and went to somewhere absolutely heavenly.  It ended up being a wonderful trip but I always have wondered how much I took.  The effects didn't even compare to any other time I've taken it and I've taken it up to 40mg intentionally.

Sounds like an awesome experience. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) At least, if intensity is your thing, haha. It is too bad you'll never know how much it was, I'd love to see how it compared to your normal dosages.... In my experience so far, it does seem to ramp up in intensity pretty quickly beyond a certain point.


That does sound a whole lot like my two really intense 4-HO-MiPT trips so far, this 35 mg one and the 50 mg one especially. Total sensory overload.... Not even necessarily extreme hallucination in the way that other psychedelics would provide, though they were present, but more literally just an overblown intensification and alteration of the senses until they start to malfunction, sight and sound become chaotic blurs and tactile sensations oscillate between bliss, agony, and numbness, and they as well as any thoughts and feelings start running into each other and there's really not much to do but stop moving and start wondering what the hell you've done to yourself.... It's a hell of a trip, that's for sure! Not the kind I'm looking for all the time but I definitely love it for its sheer strength and ability to remain both fun and meaningful despite that.


That 4-HO-MET and 2C-B combo sounds really great too, by the way! I would have to imagine it would be, I don't combo psychedelics much but those two actually sound great together....

I'm planning this WE to take 4HO-MiPT in the come down of MDMA, and I will be smoking weed troughout the experience (I must say that I don't smoke weed very often, so when I do it hit me really strong) and was wondering if I have to lower my dose of miprocin beacause of weed ?  Any idea?

I would expect both the M and the weed to enhance the 4-ho-mipt, I would still take the same dosage, but I am used to the strength of weed on psychs. If anything I would just be careful with how much you smoke but still take a reasonable dose of miprocin, because redosing the mipt will be less effective than just smoking more.

Every trip is different, psychedelics aren't like other drugs.  I've had trips on DOC, for example, where 2mg was weak, and then a week later, 2mg can be really strong.  It depends on set and setting a lot, it depends on how far along your food is toward being digested, it depends on your body chemistry that day, etc.

Last WE I dosed 35 mg + 50 mg 40 min later in the peak o a third pill of MDMA, smoked weed while waiting for it to kick and during, visuals were outstanding ! I had my first time 3d visuals. but also felt very dumb and didn't felt the euphoria  that caracterise this compound, using my phone was just impossible because of visuals, also the effect last for a very long time.. i dosed at approx 1am, and i was still having visuals at 11 am !

I've also had 3-D visuals with these compound !

Not to insult, but this may be because you took 85mg - a pretty strong dose - after taking three pressed pills of MDMA. That's a ridiculously high dose of both, and together, I'm not surprised you were overloaded.

That is such an absurd dose. I can't fathom why he would have taken the third dose like that after he realized what it was. Would have gotten three+ beautiful trips out of 120mg but instead gets one horrific one

I took probably around 60mg at once. My account of the experience can be found earlier in this thread. (Spoiler: it was a bit too much)

I took somthing like 90 mg but not in one shot (if i remeber well it was 50mg then 25 mg at T+35 min later then 15 mg At T+70min) and haven't feel anything bad.. the trip was strong and pleasant, and I had auditory distortions for the first time of my life... BUT I must also say that I had some tolerance and that is my first batch of this material, (maybe it is less potent than average batchs? who knows) so I really discourage to take such a dose, I worked my why to those doses very slowly.

After some testing, Ive made it up to 100mg with this myself so far. I find the dose response curve is pretty heavy, but even on doses that would put me out of commision on other substances I notice no real negative side effects with this except an excessively manic comeup. Id love to push this harder, potentially up to 150+ mgs but have safety concerns due to the relatively little info about high doses of this substance


For reference, I find 20 mg a fairly strong trip by itself.

Really?  Weird...the lost vial I had I believe was freebase, and 26mg was the max I ever took....that was STRONG.  Even 16mg could ++ me.

Well the fumarate salts are really heavy so 25mg of the fumarate and 25mg of the freebase are very different doses.

I'd agree.  I've noted psilacetin fumarate is not the same animal as the psilacetin freebase I had all those years ago.

EDIT: This was supposed to quote Koritt asking me about my trip. Not sure how I failed quoting somebody

EDIT 2: Added some more info

EDIT 3: If I do push this substance again, ill write up a proper trip report. Ive invested in a tape recorder to help with note taking


Ill try. I normally take notes but by the thirty minute mark they were incomprehensible, finally gave up an hour in when I realized it was all becoming gibberish. One quote that stands out nicely is "Hedonistic overload". My whole trip had a very hedonistic vibe on it, and most of my pscyhadelic thoughts revolved around the concept in some way or other. After the mania faded and I was fully peaked (hour in, roughly) I decided to try to appreciate the visuals that this substance had gifted me, and I wouldnt even know how to begin to describe them. They were akin to mushrooms in OEV terms, but significantly stronger. Everything was breathing, and warping, and even my hallucinations had significant tracers on them. There were several points where I had full blown open eye hallucinations on top of the optical overload I was otherwise experiencing. In terms of physically, I felt absolutely divine. I felt like a sexual titan, had boundless energy, and the feel of everything was just absolute bliss. Tried working out and I almost had an orgasm just from the stretching and straining of my muscles. Checked my heartrate a handful of times and (unless mistaken due to me tripping) my rate was between 100-120 throughout. The comedown was very smooth, and my ridiculous dose did not extend the trips life past what a 20mg or similar trip would be. And I almost forgot, music. Music was extremely pleasurable, but my senses were all mixing with each other. Not fully, just dipping their toes in. Music in particular would reverbrate through both my visuals, lstening to ride of the valkyries was just absolutely intense. 


Sorry for my poor writing, Im really not very eloquent and can not at all capture the sheer intensity of this experience. happened a week or so now and Im feeling so much more confident, and happy with my body even now. Im sure you can see why Id love to push this trip farther.

Thanks for your report ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)last saturday I tried for the first time 64 mg of this material, usuelly I start tripping at home (confortable setting) this time I was outside with some friends, I was not confortable during the come up, and the trip took a veeery dark orientation in the begening... I was with some very old good friends who were rolling on MDMA but suddenly felt very sad and like I was about to cry.. I managed somehow to pass this cause I didn't want to fuck the evening for my friends.. But that feeling of sadness never really left me, he just set in the background.Visuals was really good, and I found that this dose had extended the duration of the trip by more than 1 hour. music felt weird because I had lot of time dilatation and some sound distortion, but dancing felt really good...  9 hours after dosing I dosed 20 mg 5Meo-Mipt: that was bizarre cause the trip last only 2h30 and the feeling of sadness who was in the background become a feeling of scare ! (with no reason).. and i wasn't able to sleep until 7 hours had passed after my second dose.sorry for my english.

That sounds prett unfortunate. Personally I wouldnt have tried pushing doses in a new setting like that, but I'm glad you managed to keep everything together alright.


Ive had some pretty deep moments on this substance, its been at moments brutal in the realizations about myself, or my actions. But theyve usually been fairly brief, and no concious effort has been needed to remove myself from such a mindset

If I enjoyed 4-ho-met and 4-aco-dmt... is this one very much different?


I loved both of those psychedelics. They were both very much different from mushrooms to me, a lot cleaner feeling on the body and less confusing. 4-aco-dmt was nothing whatsoever like mushrooms... people say they are indistinguishable, not to me! It was like a really clean DMT version of shrooms that was more tingly and stimulating. 4-ho-met, felt like really clean shrooms at a low dose, but at a high dose it became something really crazy... I was so caught up in heroin back then, I'd have to check my journal to see what I wrote about high dose 4-ho-met. 

I'm interested in 4-ho-mipt... is there any nausea or body load to it very much? The other two analogues were so damn clean to me... lovely psychedelics I'd totally take again if I wasn't blowing through so much 2CC lately and just crazy about that one lately...

I never dosed 4ho-met neither 4aco but before ordering my 4ho-mipt I did lot of research in order to choose one to buy from those three... from what I read it seems that 4ho-mipt is somewhere between the other two, with less mind-fuck than 4Aco, but more than 4ho-Met, and also more visual than 4Aco but less than 4ho-Met... It really seems that 4HO-Mipt is something between the two... hope someone here who had tried them all can confirm that...personnaly it dosent give me any nausea, the bodyload is smooth, pleasurable and clean its essentially a stimulation... I think if you liked 4aco and 4ho-MET you will defenetly like this one too.

Really? K, I thought 4-aco-dmt was extremely visual, and 4-ho-met was fucking crazy at high doses (but not very deep), at lower doses was like a couple grams of shrooms but cleaner, more lucid (depending on the shrooms or whatev). 


I felt like 4-ho-mipt would be the natural progression after trying 4-aco-dmt and 4-ho-met... it seems to me like the hardest one to handle? 4-aco-dmt is AMAZING to me, really visual and also profound, it reminds me a lot of a more chemical feeling cross between DMT and shrooms that lasts a lot longer and leaves me with a lovely afterglow. It normally lays me out... it's stimulating, but sedating. I can't really walk around on 4-aco lol. Same with 4-ho-met... really, at least at high doses, but it's easier to function on that one. 


Thanks for the info, especially the last sentence. I have been concerned about the body load regarding this one, I thought it was known for confusion, and nausea (I can get VERY confused on shrooms haha... forgetting that I'm human and stuff). A smooth, pleasurable, and clean stimulation is really one thing I love about certain psychedelics like 2CC and 2CD. 


It almost seems like this drug might be a more function, stimulating kind of trip compared to 4-aco-dmt and 4-ho-met. I don't know though... how can I know before trying it? Considering I love all of its analogues, I'm going to have to try it sometime soon (probably once I blow through my couple grams of 2CC).


I'm reading what you said again, and the way you describe it sounds AMAZING and totally not what I would think about it. I thought it would have *much more* mindfuck than 4-aco-dmt, but that totally makes sense if it is a stimulating psych. I find that 4-aco-dmt is stimulating too, physically, but mentally it just completely lays me out. I normally spend the trip laying down, travelling through the mind. Is 4-ho-mipt more like acid or something like 2CC or 2CD in the sense that there are insane visuals and stuff, but you can still function, walk around, explore the external reality? Because, I can't really do that on higher doses of 4-aco-dmt, or 4-ho-met, and a quarter of shrooms will make me forget that I'm human (I really don't get much out of that... I don't do shrooms anymore).

I have tried all three of 4-aco-dmt, 4-ho-mipt, and 4-ho-met. Of the three 4-ho-mipt is indisputably my favourite. 


4-aco-dmt is very boring visually for me, things just spin like pinwheels so it's pretty lame. Mentally it's definitely worthwhile but can be intense for less experienced people. 


4-ho-met by contrast is completely non-threatening mentally and has some great organic visuals for me. I remember one time in particular I was staring at the sky and all the clouds had turned into baby shapes so they were 'falling' out of the sky. They were in the shape of the baby from the nevermind cover. Definitely neat. I did end up getting some anxiety on that trip but it was mainly socially driven and not necessarily because of the drug.


4-ho-mipt is far more complex visually IME, more geometric and closer to LSD. I've also had the 3D visuals on it - while watching a visualizer the shapes started to fold out of the wall they were being projected onto, very trippy. Goes very well with music, movies, and mxe.

I have tried all 3.  I would also say that 4-HO-MiPT is my favorite, but also probably the easiest to handle.  I find it to be extremely euphoric, to the point of getting rushes almost like an empathogen.  It makes me want to be with people and talk to people about stuff.  I usually have a sore face and abs from laughing the next morning if I take some with my friends.  I had one of the best trips on my life on it, when I took it with 20mg of MXE on the tail end of a DOC trip.  The body high is wonderful.


I find 4-AcO-DMT the potentially deepest, but in a cosmic way.  4-HO-MiPT is deep in an interpersonal/self sort of way, very prone to useful insight.  On some trips its very visual for me, and on some it's not.


That's how it is for me anyway.

Sounds right up my alley.


Also, if you rail this one does it have no burn and is kinda chalky so inhale very slowly like 4-aco? I like to rail that stuff haha, makes it come on in like 10 minutes for me, harsh and quick. Then I am laid out, almost like a visionary experience as with DMT but I still have my thought processes going on as opposed to being overwhelmed by the power of DMT and feeling like I am waking up from a crazy dream 15 minutes later (and I like to keep my eyes open on 4-aco-dmt at least half the time... on DMT I will never open my eyes. Don't think I even could until like 5 or 10 minutes into the experience... and then I quickly shut them again LOL.

> ..... Is 4-ho-mipt more like acid or something like 2CC or 2CD in the sense that there are insane visuals and stuff, but you can still function, walk around, explore the external reality? Because, I can't really do that on higher doses of 4-aco-dmt, or 4-ho-met, and a quarter of shrooms will make me forget that I'm human (I really don't get much out of that... I don't do shrooms anymore).

I find visuals from 4HO-Mipt to be really beautiful, I even had my first time 3D visuals on it (well, it was when I took a very large dose on the peak of a third pill of MDMA while smoking weed) but visuals are differents from those of acid or 2cb (never tried 2cc or 2cd so can't talk for those)...and for me I can really fonction, be social, talk to friends and all the stuff while on it.. it's not the kind of drug that makes me floored... in the same time everyone is different, you are making an idea about this stuff but you have to try it to see by yourself if it is for you or not ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Since you don't mention mg weights for your "heavy doses" of aco and met, let me just say mipt seems very non threatening up to about 40mg, and after that it will FUCK YOU UP. My accidental-on-purpose high dose of an estimated 55-60mg was the strongest trip I've ever had on any psychedelic (the 3-meo-pcp "hole" trumps it though).

4-HO-MiPT definitely seems to suddenly flip and become extremely intense beyond a certain point for me as well; if I don't hit that point it will be very manageable and have strong imagination enhancement but otherwise pretty much just have a decent empathogenic headapace, and if I do it will be characterized by feelings of extreme sensory overload such that every physical sensation is either agonizing or nearly produces an orgasm, visual distortions, illusions, and depth perception changes become nearly blinding, and my mind starts spinning off into wild fantasies where I start to think I'm someone else somewhere else living some other life, usually in some sort of sexual situation. I actually find them in some ways readily comparable to the states produced by MDMA and LSD, respectively, just with a unique tryptamine twist on them. 30 mg for me so far produces the former kind of experience, and 35 mg produced the latter, so the margin is thin, though, notably, 50 mg for me, while being even more extremely intense in these ways, and easily competing for a spot in my collection of most intense trips ever, did feel somewhat more like a linear increase from the effects of the 35 mg, unlike how that was completely different from the 30 mg.


With regards to comparisons to other psychedelics, I will say that for me 4-HO-MiPT definitely does not seem to be a "walk around with crazy visuals" type of trip, and I think I would be disappointed if I took it looking for something comparable to 2C-C, which I just recently tried for the first time. I don't really get much in the way of visuals from 4-HO-MiPT personally at doses less than those that produce the strong head trip, and honestly even at that point they're still much more subtle than most tryptamines for me, definitely less active than 4-AcO-DMT and 4-HO-MET, though also more artistically appealing in some ways despite the subtlety, and not unlike LSD in that way. Still, while I do enjoy the visuals when they're there, for me it's not the best option as a psychedelic to take with crazy visuals as the goal, and rather think that something like 4-HO-MET is far better suited for that.


I would say that 4-HO-MiPT is probably the second hardest to handle for me of these three tryptamines, with 4-AcO-DMT being the hardest and 4-HO-MET being the easiest. 4-HO-MiPT also seems to have a considerably higher chance of causing significant nausea for me while coming up, but otherwise the body load is the same as the others. Overall, I would say it's my second favorite of these, again following 4-HO-MET and followed by 4-AcO-DMT, the latter mainly because even though it's stronger and smoother it's also less overtly fun and hedonistic in design for me, which works against something being one of my recreational favorites.


Just my two cents. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

They all have merit IMO.


I've often heard 4homet is regarded as the least "deep", but it's the only psychedelic that gave ma a ++++,so there you go... .


My comparison is done at 20-25mg, w/o tolerance.

4homet is very controllable, euphoric, empathogenic, visual and colorful. Can be deep but most of the time it's about laughter ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I don't get much in the way of visuals from 4-HO-MiPT either, Kaleida.  I definitely find it one of the least visual tryptamines, although one time when I combined it with DOC (in the later stages of the DOC so its visuals were gone), I had some truly beautiful visuals, so colorful and warm.  Usually I don't really notice visuals much from it though.

Ive found visuals lacking in average to moderately high doses as well. The visuals are awesome, and unique when you can get them, but it required pushing to probably 50mg (fumurate) or so before they started becoming pronounced. Many people may find such a dose fairly intense

Wow, that's crazy ! I get significant visuals from 20 mg of the fumarate ! That's with 2+ years of tripping at least once a month. Guess I'm just lucky.

After reading this page, and with my experience with the other ones, I want to try this one so bad I might combine it with some 2cc tonight. I am already subtle shades of pink and yellowish-green in the computer screen, which is morphing and has depth, so perhaps I would get really high and should take a low dose of it if I even do.

Hello everyone. I just registered and decided to post here since I'm about dive in on this green delight.


I've already tried it once, but it seems I've taken waaay too much (30mg) and it hit me like a speeding truck. The start was kind of nice, with great body-load, sensory anomalies and so on. But after ~5 hours a really bad trip started, brought on most likely by a horrible sound of motor engine some folks were working outside, which even on a good day would be insufferable (you know, the kind of low, roaring noise that makes you shiver even when you're not high like a kite). I felt like time was ripping apart and I was dropping from one dimension to another constantly. At the peak of it it felt like some kind of alien intelligence took over the entire world and I was locked in a kharmic combat with that otherworldly threat. Interestingly going down from the high was actually kind of pleasant- I was reduced to the feelings of slight pressure, like a gentle hug, wetness and high temperature. It was actually very nice.


This time I'm taking half that dosage and I'm planning on a good dive. I'll be telling you more shortly.

Yeah if your setting turn to crap it's normal that the experience goes south... But IMO you don't have to reduce the dose to half, I think 20 mg is OK for a good and very manageable trip with the CORRECT set and setting.

Well I've taken ~14 about an hour ago and I don't know if upping the dosage now is a great idea. Plus psychedelics generally hit me twice as hard as they would a person of my size, from my experience. Right now I'm watching Car Boys and having a great time.

Reporting in again. This has been an extremely gentle ride so far. Took ~4 more when the high died down to get it back up with no ill effects. I think I'll just let it gently go down now. Just ordered some pizza.


Slight body-load, a veeery slight visual anomalies. Large relaxation. For a tiny moment there was a slight space-time tearing but nothing major. All in all a very enjoyable dive, much more so than the last time. Next time though I'm taking the whole 30mg, when I wanna dive, I wanna *dive*.

Does anybody have anything to report on the interaction between 4-HO-MiPT and nicotine? On my last trip I smoked several cigarettes and although they felt really good (it was a bit like there was a kind of warm fire inside of me which I even want to call "creative force" but that's a bit lofty) I have sneaking suspicion they might have weakened the high actually, because in the end it was much, much weaker than my first one and I have virtually no tolerance to psychedelics (I'm very new to drugs in general).


Also, a point of note: be warned as the presence of people makes a HUGE difference for 4-HO-MiPT. I took just a bit, about ~6mg before going to lectures today as a form of maybe poorly thought-through experiment (but there's no middle sliders in real life right?) and while it had virtually no effect on me, the presence of people around me, on the public transport and during University lectures proper was VERY recognizable. I don't want to sound all woo-woo and shit, but this thing dials your awareness of the "psychic energy" of people around you to 11. If you're introvert in nature or if you just have little space in your social batteries and find that you're the kind of person who needs to "recharge" between social encounters, take my advice and use this drug with nobody around if you're planning a deep dive. This may go against standard risk reduction guidelines but in my experience it's actually MORE risky to have people around. Communicate with people through chats if you find that you want to talk to somebody. Too many people around is very mentally taxing, even being exposed to the same people who you know very well and are intimate with will lead to tiredness, then frustration and then paranoia. Exercise a lot of caution, this thing **breaks barriers**. Hard. With "too much" (subject to personal tolerance of course) you become so sensitive losing the sense of self is absolutely possible.


And while ego death can be fun... It's best to tackle it as a matter of choice.

Hello (I can finally say) fellow Bluelighters! I've lurked for many years, always satisfied with the answers or entertainment I found. 


   I've decided to join to ask this forum a question about Miprocin. I've seen this question asked here and there, but wanted to ask and quite frankly, have a reason to join ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


  I've been a psychonaught for a long time now -so glad we can just order this stuff instead of wandering the fields anxiously and picking. Anyway, I've got a new batch of Miprocin and I'd like to IM it. I was curious if anyone has and what they would think a comparable dose to oral ca. 60-70 mg's? 

  Also, has anyone combined the psilacetin and miprocin in the same shot? I have both and have taken both, but never the IM route. I love the miprocin because it's so much lighter on the brain, but if you get the right ratio ( for me, about 3:1), then the visuals can get complex. For me, too much of the 4acodmt and I'm stuck in a loop trying to figure out everything that is wrong with my life. Ugh.


Anyway, thanks guys!!!!!

I haven't IMed this, but hey, welcome, glad you finally joined. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I've also never combined those two.  But I really love miprocin, it's one of my favorite psychedelics.  I find it very warm and jovial and somewhat entactogenic, but still nicely psychedelic.

Yesterday took a 20mg dose orally in a gel cap about an hour after taking a syrian rue extract, also in a gelcap. The extract seems to have a lot of sodium leftover in it so my dosage is meaningless but it was ~180mg of material which I believe fully inhibited my MAO. 


The trip came on quickly, had an empty stomach. I had a nice trip for about 6-7 hours, with visuals that were very familiar patterning, similar to google's deep dream stuff. Close to the peak I was grinding some weed and the weed patterned out in the grinder so I couldn't tell where there was weed and where there wasn't lol. Introspection was nicely enhanced, not as intense as acid for me but the feeling was the same when it occurred. 


Would definitely go for this combination again, although I would increase the dosage of the 4-ho-mipt to at least 25mg. My usual dose without an MAOI is around 35mg and tends to be more intense than this one. I did get the effect I was looking for out of the mixture which was an increased perceived depth of meaning and a general sense of well-being.

I did get the effect I was looking for out of the mixture which was  an increased perceived depth of meaning and a general sense of  well-being.

Combining with MAOIs has provided some of my most memorable trips, it seems harder to go wrong with it. While on their own psychedelics can be hit-or-miss for me in whether they trigger some kind of epiphany, MAOIs seem to set the stage more reliably. I also did get help from k and nitrous but I had a serious 'aha!' moment on this combo that I haven't gotten from a trip in quite some time.

Hell of a first 4 posts.  Good luck with your petition...


I do agree that 4-HO-MiPT is easy to work with.  However the dose response curve of LSD is actually quite linear, a few micrograms either way is barely going to affect the experience at all, whereas if comparing graphs of the dose response curves of 4-HO-MiPT and LSD, 4-HO-MiPT's is steeper.  In any case, 4-HO-MiPT is one of my favorites.


I gotta say though that your deification of a human, even someone as special and influential and wonderful as Shulgin, is probably not what he would have wanted, knowing the guy.  And calling a drug Lord God (capitalized no less) kinda turns me off.  It's a chemical, the spirit is inside you, not inside a chemical.  The answers are in you, not somewhere external.

I totally get that this is a religion, I guess that was my... I don't want to say criticism, but maybe more skepticism.  Anyway just voicing my thoughts about it, you gotta do you for sure and sometimes whatever we believe *is* real to us, and sometimes it really just matters that you're happy. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Interesting, I found the description of the deity to be in line with what I perceived while on 4-HO-MiPT...


About Soma, the deity:


 Soma, also called as Indu or Soma-Pavamana, is                  one of the most important deities in the Rgveda. The entire                  ninth Mandala is devoted to his praise. He is the presiding                  deity of the Soma creeper whose juice is often used in                  sacrifices as offering and also drink. He is sometimes praised                  as the Supreme God. **He cures the mortals of their diseases,                  gives them joy and leads them to immortal blissful worlds.** It                  was because of the power he bestowed that Indra was able to do                  wonderful deeds and slay the demon Vrtra. **He rules over the mind                  and activates speech.**

                Hence he is sometimes described as Vacaspati, **'lord of speech'**.                  It is he who makes ordinary mortals Rsis, wise sages. He creates                  the worlds, rules over mountains and rivers.

                The name Soma has been used in the Rgveda for the deity that                  animates the Soma creeper, the juice of the creeper itself, as                  also **the moon**. In later literature, Some has been practically                  identified with the moon itself. Scholars opine that the deity                  Homa of the Zend-Avesta is this Soma itself.


Best of luck with the petition! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

It's "canonize". The steps are usually these: Servus Dei (Servant of God), Venerabilis (Venerable), Beatus (Blessed), Sanctus (Saint).

I support your goal of legitimizing and legalizing psychedelic chemicals, I just think the religious aspect of it is unnecessary and silly and even damaging to the cause.  I do understand that religious exemption is currently a way to allow legal use of a substance, but... honestly, if you want something adopted mainstream, the goal should be to appeal to reason, not to religious zealotry.  Ultimately it will turn most people off, they're going to think that 4-HO-MiPT turns you into a religious zealot, ie, makes you crazy.  As opposed to if the scientific community manages to convince people that psychedelics have a valuable place in psychotherapy and personal growth (which is what is currently happening as the ban on psychedelic research is finally lifting).

15% of the people on the planet revere 4-HO-MiPT religiously?  Or do you mean psychedelics in general?  Well, indigenous cultures (some of them) do use psychedelics as tools for spirituality, it's true... so do I.  And you're entitled to your beliefs, I'm just saying that proselytizing generally turns people off, especially people who already don't understand psychedelics (ie, most of modern civilization).  We're still coming out of a period of very heavy demonization of psychedelics, and in my opinion the way out of that is to get the scientific community to start telling people that they're not these scary drugs that make people crazy, but are instead useful tools.  I'm just trying to tell you that to most people, you're coming across as a religious zealot who has had a few too many psychedelics.  I'm not saying you ARE that... I mean I've taken enough psychedelics to make most people think I must be clinically insane.  I'm trying to let you know how it's coming across, even to someone who loves psychedelics and whose first trip changed his life forever due to experiencing non-duality/oneness.

Okay but that doesn't really address my points.  None of that necessitates religion, and trying to attach religion to it, IMO, hurts the cause.  I'm not denying at all that 4-HO-MiPT or other psychedelics are great tools to access the divine and gain greater understanding of the universe.

I seem to see people preferring the acetate more often than not, I have only tried the hydroxy myself, however.

I've only tried the acetate a couple times. It seemed like a less potent version of the hydroxy with more sedation and nausea, which only lasted the first 1-2 hours. The acetoxy tryptamines in general feel more clear headed to me.

I recently compared the acetate and hydroxy back-to-back, 1 week apart, at similar dosages. My trip on 4-HO-MiPT was significantly more mind-bending and visual than my trip on 4-AcO-MiPT. I agree with Volsam's description: while 4-AcO-MiPT feels more "LSD-like", 4-HO-MiPT feels more "mushroom-like". I also agree with indigowizard's comment that the 4-AcO tryptamines feel more clearheaded. So far, I think I may prefer 4-HO-MiPT, if this pattern is to hold for future trips, although there are advantages to both variants.


My trip on 4-HO-MiPT, 10 milligrams if my scale is to be trusted, truly shocked me with its intensity. The introspection was profound, and the visuals were among the most wonderful I've seen recently, in the highly imaginative style that is unique to the MiPTs for me. The most memorable visual consisted of a colorful Alex Grey-like spiral of eyeballs, which were rolling back all at once (mocking my fascination? ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)) But I also saw images of things like women in erotic poses, insects, and even strange alien technologies. I've read multiple people right here on the forums say that they discovered seemingly low doses of 4-HO-MiPT to be fully satisfying, in the <15 mg range or so, and now I'm a convert! I also had a highly satisfying trip on only 60 ug LSD in recent past, and I do find LSD and 4-HO-MiPT to overlap in significant ways.

This is how I feel about a the acetoxy esters of 4-ho tryptamines. So groggy and sleepy. 4-go-moot is a shirt one indeed, also seemed like the trip stopped abruptly.

Caution !!!!

I consider myself fairly experienced with different psychedelics, having done acid numerous times, shrooms, MDMA, 2-CB, 2-CE, 25Nbome, Dipt, DOC, DOM. I was a fool trying this chemical while having a candida overgrowth issue. 

I ingested 20mg in water on a fairly full stomach. The comeup and bodyload was intense, strong discomfort in stomach for an hour and half. Afterwards it calmed down and enjoyed the visuals which contained lots of alien-like symbolics. This was back in the end of december last year. Next day had some mild stomach pain when smoking cannabis. In february I started to have weird pains under right ribcage. Got an endoscopy in the beginning of april which showed duodenal erosions. Follow up endoscopy in june showed healing of the erosions although pain and nausea continued, bile reflux was diagnosed. In the last months it has only progressed and now also having intestinal pains. Im quite sure that crap didnt dissolve properly and made its way down to the intestinal track creating mucosal damage when I drank the liquid. Im having bowel movements with black specks all over the place also some blood at times. Going to see a gastroenterologist soon for further testing. Its just crazy how could I mess up my life with just ingesting 20mg in water. The underlying cause is probably the candida overgrowth in my body which triggered the inflammatory response in the intestines. Im just really hoping the damage is reversible somehow and I dont have Crohns ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Be extremely careful with this substance !!

Havent done any other psychedelics  besides smoking weed after the experience in december last year and im 100% sure this RC started the damage.

Cool... good luck with that...


I do mean that, even though I think making a religion around anything isn't the right move, and that doing it around a psychedelic isn't going to help the cause in the eyes of the masses.  If you really have a meeting with a DEA agent, have you considered it might be a trap?  I realize 4-HO-MiPT isn't illegal, but the "RC" scene has been targeted recently and is very much on the radar and it could certainly be considered an analogue.

Although I would be hesitent to make sure that you do not intend that sample for human consumption nor are you in posession of any for human consumption

​Yesterday I took oral 25mg of 4-ho-mipt HCl with my brother and some friends. The trip was incredible, much more powerful and visual than the last 30mg of 2c-c plugged in. We did not expect it to be that strong, 25mg of 4-ho-Met from my lot are a joke in comparison.


Great euphoria, CEV and OEV very complex and colorful, an overflowing sense of humor. It did not last more than 4 hours, but a little bit of THC and K towards the end of the trip lengthened the experience and it was nice. 4/5


Substance highly recommended.

I found 4-HO-MIPT to be lacking visually. Mainly some OEVs of slight morphing and that was it.

Maybe it's a matter of purity or tolerance? We took 25mg of 4-ho-mipt HCl and we all had massive hallucinations of all kinds, including synesthesia. I was also surprised that the body felt so much like MDMA. 

On the other hand, I have a batch of 4-ho- Met Fumarate that with the same dose is much less potent although very nice. 4-Ho-Met is very visual for me, but with 4-ho-Mipt at times I could not recognize what was around me lol. 

We did fasting and the configuration was exceptionally good but this fact does not justify the potency of the substance.

I recently ordered a chem and after doing research with it discovered it was NOT the chem I ordered. I've taken 4-HO-MIPT at 35 mgs with no tolerance  and barely had distinct visuals. Physically is was amazing.Very Euphoric . 

 I'm doubting my vendor's effort to send the proper chems. It's not a stretch to think any of us would get the wrong chem we ordered. It's happened before with a vendor that is now out of business from Canada. I ordered 4-HO-MET and when it came in I did a small allergy test and then tried 20mgs. Within an hour I started having brain zaps . This only happens when I eat mushrooms or 4-ACO-DMT. I contacted the vendor because I suspected I was sent 4-ACO-DMT and the vendor confirmed there was a mix up and it was in fact 4-ACO-DMT.

*sigh*, I wish I liked this material, but it did not play well with my receptor morphology. First, I get the whole grab bag of side effects. Secondly, the second half of the experience always turns warped and disturbing, which isn't worth putting up with for such a straightforwardly hedonistic substance. It's strange, because 4-AcO-MiPT and 4-MeO-MiPT are fine (just bland), and I absolutely adore 5-MeO-MiPT and MiPT. 4-HO-MiPT is consistently menacing, though

I wonder how I could mess up my GI tract with this. Maybe because I took it on full stomach in a glass full of water ? So it didnt absorb in the stomach and made its way to the intestines and burning the lining. I have chronic inflammatory response syndrome from previous mold exposure which probably didnt let the intestine tract to heal and now im in this mess. I wish I would have snorted it instead. Seems to be very hard on the GI. I have never encountered problems with 2C-X series, MDMA, MDA, Speed while consuming them orally in the past, but this is dangerous.

I think the contaminants that would may be present are to blame. Is a misfortune that we can not buy decent pharmaceutical products due to the lack of quality control. 4-ho-mipt should not burn the intestine in any way.

I clean all my substances with acetone to eliminate possible solvents and soluble cuts, then, I send a sample to be analyzed at the laboratory. If necessary, I will make a simple extraction A/B to be calmer. I guess this fact makes a difference.


My 4-ho-mipt offer a clean and powerful feeling, but I always do fasting before taking psychedelics with 4mg of Ondansetron and 2.5mg of Diazepan that greatly help bodyload.

I'm sure DocLad knows, but make sure you dehydrate your acetone before using it to wash any of your product, or you'll lose some in the process

There is a lot of literature on the web about how to do an anhydrous acetone wash.

I looked it up, sorry for asking... I've converted DMT freebase to fumarate using anhydrous acetone and have read about people washing coke in a similar way, I didn't realize it would be the same or to google it all before I posted.

Doing research lately it seems there are many reports of it causing strong stomach pains, for example: 


[https://www.reddit.com/r/researchch...nyone_with_experience_with_4homipt_or_4hodet/](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/5rcvbj/anyone_with_experience_with_4homipt_or_4hodet/)


Last few months have been hell, spitting blood occasionally, also blood in stool. Waiting for the pill small intestine cam results. I would have never thought this would cause such demise in my health. Now probably I have developed Crohn disease. 


[https://www.upload.ee/image/8780958/FB_IMG_1533639051164.jpg](https://www.upload.ee/image/8780958/FB_IMG_1533639051164.jpg)


These were the results from endoscopy which showed the erosions in duodenum, I hadnt taken any NSAIDs prior to this and Helicobacter was negative, the erosions appeared after ingesting 20mg of 4-HO-MIPT in a glass of water. It caused a severe burning feeling down in my chest, I havent experienced anything like this with other psychedelics. Nausea on the comeup on shrooms and 2-CB is normal but this felt like I was literally going to die. Kept pacing between bed and shower to feel better. I dont know if it was the contaminants or the fact that I drank it with a glass of water on a full stomach. It should probably dissolve in the stomach when taken in a capsule form but the water most likely ran it straight to small intestine and from there to the intestines. Be very careful when buying this from an european vendor !

Maybe there is a really bad batch going around or something?  I've never once in all my years of researching these things heard of anyone having a reaction like yours.  if there are now multiple reports surfacing, it sounds like there is something going around that is heavily contaminated or not the drug at all.

Very weird yes. I have done a fair share of psychedelics throughout my years and have experienced some discomfort from slight nausea at times, but not anything like this. Pretty messed up that only 20mg could burn erosions like that in duodenum and fuck up the intestine track. I always thought in my mindset that nothing could go physically wrong with psychedelics and now dealing with this crap. In the reddit link a user also reported that their stomach hurt even the next day which is pretty suspicious. Seems that certain batches or the substance itself are very harsh on the body.

There is no reason to believe that the substance itself is harsh on the body at all, Shulgin and company experimented with it for a long time and it's been available since the 90s, and I've never once heard of such a report.  It seems ovewhelmingly likely that some batch out of China or something was badly contaminated, if there are more reports coming out.  Before now I had never once heard of anything even remotely like this happening from any tryptamine, even AMT which is quite nauseating and hard on the stomach.

It sounds like there was a contaminated batch.Thank you for the warning! 4-ho-mipt fumarate definitely isn't a notable GI irritant, certainly no worse than any other 4-subbed tryptamine, so this is worrying!

I agree that 4-HO-MiPT seems unlikely to be a GI irritant. I am especially sensitive to such issues, having suffered from chronic GERD for years, and 4-HO-MiPT has always been smooth sailing for me. It's interesting to see discussion of weak and/or contaminated batches, because the only time in my life I have ever received a significantly impure batch of a research chemical, it was -- you guessed it -- 4-HO-MiPT. But that was years ago. I wonder if this chemical is particularly difficult to properly synthesize?

It could be due to contaminants or that the substance had too basic/acid pH.

I do not know, many years ago I had a similar problem with a batch of Amphetamine sulfate that was very impure and I was several months with stomach pain and reflux.

I wonder if anything would have went differently if I would have dissolved it in for example orange juice or vodka ? I saw a trip report of a guy dissolving it also in water and thought to give it a go aswell. Worst mistake ever. Also when ingesting a substance in gelcap does it dissolve in stomach or some of it makes way into the intestines aswell ?

Thanks in advance ! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Since it's very likely this was heavily contaminated, if you had snorted it, you may have ended up with corrosive damage in your nasal passages.  I just want to keep repeating, I think the likelihood that pure 4-HO-MiPT caused this condition to you is incredibly unlikely, as you'd be the only report I've ever heard in like 20 years of this drug being available of any sort of corrosive damage caused.  However, Chinese labs produce who the fuck knows what with quality control, so could be literally anything in there.  Cwreful out there folks.  Test your drugs.  Ideally, send new batches to a lab to get 100% verification on the identity of the drug and the purity.  But at least get test kits.

This is one of my favourites. I've been experimenting with it recently. I would not recommend snorting any of these 4-sub-trypts. Take them orally for sure. I just got a snorting thing going on from doing that with dope so much in the past but really the onset is smoother orally. Snorting a high dose of 4-aco-dmt gave me some pretty serious tremors. 


4-ho-met at low doses is really similar to shrooms for me but there is something off about it. It has an oddly stimulating comedown but it's still a good drug.


4-aco-dmt was nothing like shrooms to me. More like shrooms x dmt sort of. Electric feeling, visuals were definitely not shroomlike. 


4-ho-mipt felt really shroomy but also clean and nausea free. Awakening like LSD where your eyes may as well be sewn open as you won't be able to shut anything out. Nice and stimulating, pleasant feeling in the body if you're feeling healthy at the time and hydrated and all that. That was my experience with this drug. It can be highly therapeutic. I'd be careful with dosing as even 10mg got me pretty lifted. It's euphoric after working through stuff, too. Really euphoric. I don't recall having a comedown or any aftereffects and plan on using it again soon. Got an eighth so what else am I gonna do.

Tried this for the first time yesterday. Overall it was kind of disappointing. My gf and I had 25 mg orally. I had a slight off feeling after 2 hours, she felt it a little bit and some visuals, nothing dramatic. After 2 hours i snorted 10mg. After 15 minutes I had a rush and a need to walk around out side and some anxiety. I felt it a little more. Had a good time walking around the neighborhood. Slight pulsing to things and a body feeling that reminded me of mdma. Still really weak. No cev or oev for me. Nothing like 4 aco dmt or 1p when I tried those. Its been about 2 months since I last did a psychedelic so i doubt tolerance. Maybe I got some real crappy stuff or it went bad.

It's entirely possible you got some really crappy stuff, it sounds way off, especially if you are affected pretty normally by other 4-sub-Ts.

I had a slight off feeling after 2 hours, she felt it a little bit and some visuals, nothing dramatic. After 2 hours i snorted 10mg. After 15 minutes I had a rush and a need to walk around out side and some anxiety. I felt it a little more. Had a good time walking around the neighborhood. Slight pulsing to things and a body feeling that reminded me of mdma. Still really weak. No cev or oev for me. Nothing like 4 aco dmt or 1p when I tried those. Its been about 2 months since I last did a psychedelic so i doubt tolerance. Maybe I got some real crappy stuff or it went bad.

I recently got some 4-HO-MIPT that at 25mg was similar to how you described so I think there's just some weak stuff going around.

Hi everyone! I've got some of this wonderful-sounding substance on its way to me, should have it in hand early next week with the goal of tripping next weekend. I'd like to sincerely thank everyone who lent their experiences to this thread, it really helped me decide how to dose for my first go and what to expect also. I'm experienced with psychedelics (and other substances) and this sounds like it checks off so many of the boxes in things I like about the psychedelic experience. I've got fumarate coming, and am planning to take a 20mg dose to start and feel it out from there.


If I may ask one question--do I need to keep this in the freezer? If so, what are the proper storage and thawing rules? I read earlier in this thread (pr possibly the first version) that people were keeping it in the freezer--I've never had to do that with anything before and don't want to spoil my stash. Please advise. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Thanks a lot! Been lurking for weeks, this forum is great.

I always keep my tryptamines in the freezer, because they degrade much more easily than phenethylamines (though the fumarate salts that are normally produced now seem rather stable).  I use amber vials inside a wooden box that has silica packets in it, in the freezer.  To remove, bring the vial out and let it sit at room temperature until it's warmed up, then open.  To re-store, just put it back in the freezer.

I tried keeping some 4-HO-MiPT in solution once upon a time and the solution turned brown within 2 days. I was really sad because it was my favorite RC. The same trick had worked with 2C-I for months with no problems. I posted this on another forum yesterday:

Thank you, I really appreciate you answering my question. I do want to ensure it doesn't spoil, so I will take that all under consideration. Is the box made of wood for a specific reason? And is there a particular number of silica packs I should use? I'm unfamiliar with the usage of them in this context.


Didn't get my delivery today, so can probably look forward to it on Monday or Tuesday then. Next weekend is going to be awesome. Does anyone have any experiences using this in a group setting (as in, everyone on the same thing)? I'm going to test this on my own first to gauge dosage and effect, but I have a group of friends I want to share with also. I know it'll be good, I'm just looking to hear stories. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

No particular reason, I just have a wooden box, probably best would be a locking box.  My friend has an aluminum metal lockbox.  And no, I just threw a few packs in there.


4-HO-MiPT is great for groups, as I find it pretty social and somewhat empathogenic.  It's probably the best choice for 4-substitutes tryptamine for group trips. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Just a consideration, maybe you should test the waters first with a low 10/12 mg dose. I've found my 20 mg doses particularly strong, which was fine for me alone but not ideal for socializing.

Thanks Goodwalt! I am planning the 20mg solely for my solo use--I want a strong trip to feel out the substance. :D For a group setting, I will go lighter for sure, probably 13-15 mg per person.

Hey. How did it go eventually? Was it enjoyable? And was the 20mg dose suffuciently fulfilling? Just interested and curious. I received 1 gram of this substance today. Im hoping it isnt the weaker version which is mentioned at the top of this page.   


I dont know what dose I will try first myself. 15mg minimum, but I expect 20mg. My first ever post here so a big hello to all the already dedicated members whose posts I have enjoyed reading and learning from.


Are many of you still enjoying this compound? How have your recent experiences been regarding batches and potency? 


It seems that 4-Ho-Mipt is less discussed across the board than most other populartryptamines. This surprises me a little- from what I have read about it Im surprised it isnt more sought after. Maybe not quite so available over recent years?

Maybe it's availability, because it's a fantastic material. Doesn't play well with me personally, but most everyone I know rates it as a tip top tryptamine if not their favorite RC psychedelic. It's not the deepest, but it's all but unmatched for hedonism

The high is supposedly fairly similar to 4-ACO-MiPT, correct? Seems like the MiPT family is very well regarded.

I'd say it's much more similar than it is different. A lot of people can't tell them apart

Sorry accidentally posted, I tried to edit but couldnt work it....


So- 100ug 1plsd, 3 days after mindblowing 200ug (following 6.5 year break), still yielded a pretty sufficient trip.  

Half dose, with a tolerance. I followed up 28 hours later with 300ug. I didnt think any less would be effective, but I was overwhelmed again with the intensity of the, which was almost instant within half an hour anyway.  

I was smacked out from it for 3-4 hours, then as I was settling in to the trip nicely, I made the mistake of taking an edible cannabis dose which I use daily for digestive assistance in the form of coconut oil.


The Edible effect completely submerged and killed the trip strangely and ruined the introspection and visual aspects of it which never returned although I did have the after Glow effect days afterwards for about a week.


But I did find the 1plsd to be very intense on the comeup, physically too. Very visual for me too. I am unwell due to long term Lyme Disease, and havent felt well enough to "embark" on any more acid voyages. I also acquired a little Ald-52, and Lsd 25 to have some fun comparing to each other when I am well enough.


But the Miprocin intrigued me. I wanted some variety for trip planning. The reported lack of depth, plus arguable shorter duration (a downside for some), is what appeals, because it sounds as though the experiences are still sufficiently psychedellic, full and in many cases spectacular, inspirational, life-changing and healing.


I also am very strongly drawn to MDMA for the sake of psychological therapy which I used extensively in the past recreationally in my foolish youth. But not having used MDMA since 2005, and after 35, 000 pills worth over 9 years- I incurred significant neurotransmitter disruption.


So I am a little apprehensive about exacerbating this any further but I do strongly feel that sensible and spaced out MDMA experiences could be extraordinarily beneficial to me in a therapeutic sense currently in life.

I also really liked and enjoyed MDMA. Absolutely zero anxiety with that compound for me unlike the LSD which I have a lot of anxiety about currently due to my health conditions and experiences in recent life.


So the MDMA like charactersistic of 4-Ho-Mipt, is yet another appeal.

There is no MDMA like characteristic to 4-HO-MiPT, completely different drugs, with a whole other feel to them, worlds apart.

Personally, I almost never have any anxiety on a psychedelic, but I'd think that there shouldn't be much less anxiety on most tryptamines than LSD.

Treat it with respect & I'm sure you'll love it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


I've only been able to try it once though, but I've got a lot in stock, just have to get around to taking it.

I found this and 4-HO-MET to be excellent psychedelics for an amazingly fun night with friends, although I find 4-HO-MET in se to be overhyped.

Thanks for your thoughts. But I have seen it said many times by different people, that they felt there was an MDMA like euphoria to the Miprocin. Quite a lot of different reports of it to, where people have specifically likened it to MDMA, noticeably more so than the other tryptamines.


Dont get me wrong, I wasnt pulled towards it on account of this reported aspect,,it just sounds like something I might like about it.


I have an extremely severe anxiety disorder as well as severe clinical depression, all largely due to illness and mutliple physical health conditions and injuries. It isnt so easy to trip when you are unwell and in great physical discomfort and mental unrest.


But ironically, it does help if I can get through it. The more I trip, the more relaxed I am in general. My first 3 trips 8 weeks ago-  were so difficult due to my condition.  I benefitted but dont want such a hard time next, so I have waited until I feel better first.  I actually feel a lot less anxious about the Miprocin, I except for the intense come up by the sounds of it.

I've read similar things, but I don't really agree. Of course some psychedelics are inherently more euphoric than others, but there is no guaranteed euphoria when it comes to tripping, certainly not MDMA like, although I've had 'better euphoria' than MDMA when tripping, some LSD trips for example (and DOC, that euphoria is unrivaled ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Actually, in my experience with the lighter tryptamines, the euphoric aspect mainly stems from the underlying humerous feeling, and the increased emotions too of course.

It's noticeably different than 'euphoria' you can get from empathogens.


But oh well.. enjoy man ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) don't want to ruin it for you

Thanks man I appreciate your insight. I have never joined any of these type of forums before, despite having been a psychedellic user (born for it really) until my Lyme Disease hit in 2005. Things have never been the same since Im allergic to practically everything.


There is a very high chance I will be very allergic to the Miprocin. I cant even take any vitamin pills/capsules/powders/herb supplements without severe adverse reactions.


There are only 2 types of herbal tea I can actually tolerate and I dislike them both. I cant even use toothpaste since 14 years ago, and virtually 100% of what most people eat, drink, consume, smoke, take etc...I could not even think abwout ingesting.  In that, at least one ingredient is consumed each time somebody consumes anything, which I react badly to.


The Lyme Disease really fucked my immune system and nervous system-that is precisely what it does. I always theorised that pure LSD should be well tolerated by me, physiacly and adverse reaction wise.

And I believe that is the case from my 3 1plsd trips. Coming from a lab, it was the first time I could be sure of purity. I was also assured that the blotter was pretty neutral besides the 1p itself.


They also told me that the eay they lay their trips now- they dont oxidise.

Not sure how true that is but what I took was very potent for the dose. I have dosed up to 1000ug L25 before when I was  more well. I handled my trips superbly, but am in a significantly worse all rpund condition now.


200ug of 1plsd hit me as hard and fast as virtually any come up ever.


I hope I can tolerate the Miprocin. Doses are still pretty low. And the substancd is at least lab grade purity. I can only try and see.


I have no idea how mushrooms would affect me. Im very allergic to suoermarket mushrooms- they make me feel WEIRD lol! 


Anyway, I could learn so so much from you guys and this lovely forum, as I have been doing already. Big thanks to all you guys for what you have contributed.

I rather enjoyed my first full experience with 4 ho mipt at 15 mg.

However I found the come up/first couple hours rather shakey physically... 

Otherwise a very pleasant stimulating tryptamine. Rather erotic. 


Would love to combo with 4 aco dmt to smooth it out. Maybe 15 miprocin and 20 4 aco dmt... Will report back

Ingested 20mg of this and about 40mg of 4-fma. Quite a bit of tolerance due to a soft hippy flip this weekend at a festival, so the effect is on the mild side. Got some stuff on my mind, so it's sort of a therapeutic trip. 


Barely any come-up anxiety, no nausea(it does make me nauseous at times) Still a very enjoyable experience. Strangely my pupils are of normal size even though I should be peaking right now.


Anyway, the effect this has on sound is incredible. Sound to visual synesthesia seems to always be included in the experience when I take this, which makes listening to music, playing an instrument(guitar/keyboard in my case) and singing extremely enjoyable. Notes have these static colors to them(like I've never seen) and produce these intricate rhythmic dances.  It makes me extremely creative musically.

SashaShiva, can you please move your discussion to a different thread. This stuff your posting doesn't provide any useful information about this substance and is kind of distracting.


But yeah, I love 4-HO-MiPT. Have taken it to 30mg. Really nice. Was pretty middle ground between 4-AcO-MET and 4-AcO-DMT for me. Pretty fun and weird and still that "Wow the world is amazing" vibe not too shallow, not too deep. I want to revisit this compund soon.

Did you use weed at all? I know it massively ramps up the effects of this compound.


My one and only trial so far at 10 mg was interesting. Higher dose is needed, but I don't think I would call it an underdose it was still a very worthwhile and useful experience at that level.  


It proved to be very relaxing and healing and relieving. 


I think 20 mg may be my go to next time as well, or maybe 22 mg.


I expect to use cannabis vaporization at some point and I my usually have plenty of cannabinoids in my system because I am a daily vaporist and I also am dependent on daily edible cannabis for digestive support.


Im sure my 10 mg 4-ho experience was made much fuller by my cannabis intake at the time.

Oh yes, I forgot about this I did experienced absolutely no anxiety on the come up quite the opposite one of the easiest mental come ups on a psychedelic I have experience and much easier for me then on the various forms of lysergamides, which I do have quite a great deal of anxiety about when it comes to taking and coming up, largely due to health conditions and personal complications.


The Miprocin though, my mind was completely at ease and comforted from the very off.

What I noticed particularly on my moderate 10mg dose I had music playing at a fairly low volume and I did definitely notice some unusual and peculiar distortions in the sound but particularly it was like the bases was massively enhanced out of proportion with the rest of the music, which in contrast still sounded pretty normal but that bass would have a really noticeable vibration as if my ears were hooked up to the bass more than the rest of the sound.


It was almost a little eerie and unsettling, and I expect that's on a higher dose music  could sound really quite bizarrely and unusually different to normal.


I look forward to finding out.

Well I've decided to trip on this one tommorow evening and I'm really excited. Haven't had this one in about seven years ago but back then id tripped on it probably 5-8 times not really sure. Only took it in a pretty modest dose range like 15-25mgs or so and I'll be doing the same thing this time.


Probably gonna take 16-18mgs at around 6pm and after like thirty minute mark im gonna start Ripping the Bubbler. So im VERY high on Cannabis, also will start sipping a 24oz Budweiser immidiately after i swallow the capsule. This stuff hits me really fast after taking it like alerts in 15mins or so if i recall. Alcohol smooths out my come-ups quite a bit and once i start fully tripping i could careless about beer and just smoke Pot during the trip.


Probably gonna watch a movie with my girlfriend and snuggle up. She will probably only drink and smoke weed. Once in awhile she will take a psychedelic with me but its pretty rare these days. It's fine because she is the most fun person to be around regardless. Deff gonna take it to the bedroom after the peak, this was a really erotic drug for me and made sex feel so amazing.

Really wanna try it mixed with 2C-C like you did at that festival Xorky, sounded like a great combo. But this time it will just be on it's own and maybe for the next one i will mix it up a bit with either that or Mescaline.  I bet the Euphoria from the latter mixed with 4-OH-MiPT would be mind blowing.


Probably trip on this tommorow and then with the combo and put it on the back burner afterwords. Really wanna conserve what i have and save some for next spring\summer. Wanna sample the AcO variation at some point for comparison sake, hopefully at somepoint.

If it's pretty much indistinguishable from 4-aco-mipt, it's seems guaranteed to be a great substance.

I find them pretty different, like most 4-ho/aco pairs. They all feel like different drugs to me. They do have a similar " flavor " and visual style but are different enough to not consider them equivalent at all. In that particular case I would certainly not. 4-aco-mipt has a much lighter headspace ime. 4-HO-mipt has much more potential to completely warp your mind.

Yeah, I'm actually one of the minority that doesn't like 4-HO-MiPT. I really want to--it's got great potential. Unfortunately for me, the mind warping is real. The tail end of the trip always goes sideways in a way that is manageable but tiresome (like hearing demented voices in my ears.) On the other had, 4-Ac)-MiPT is waaaaay lighter for me, and more electrical. No demented headspace or creepy voices either in my limited experience. The funny thing is, though, I don't like it either. I don't dislike it, per se, but it lacks the things about 4-HO-MiPT that made me want to like it. The primal energy, the empathogenesis, the raw eroticism, the intense feeling in the body. With its power attenuated, it feels like a thin, empty copy of the original. Given the pretty substantial differences between the 4-AcO and 4-HO subs, I feel like I should really give both a try for each base tryptamine, but who has the time for that?

I'd really liked this stuff alot in my 20's and had some beatiful and memorable trips. Even then it had a body load and it got me nauseous but I could work past it with Cannabis. Now when I took it this year I got very sick and sadly wont be able to take this one again. It's strange to me because I dont this from the other 4-subs for the most part at all. But I'm not saying it's bad just not for me but like you Pfaffed I wish it was became I love to read about all of your experiences. It sounds like one of the real gems for most of you.


Was thinking about trying a 1-2mg MicroDose and see how that works out maybe make a small 10mg Solution in Vodka to be able to weigh it out that low more accurately with Liquid Measurements.Maybe in a few months I'll  give that a whirl. Many years ago on a pretty high dose of this one I had one of the most powerful afterglow of my life of which a positive impact on my depression lasted months. Maybe in a very small amount I can avoid that Nausea but still utilize it's therapeutic effects. If I do end up going down that route I'll check back m.j in this thread and let you all know how it goes.

A few more trials with this one.

Usually in combo with 4 aco dmt... sometimes with a preload of dxm.

Both combos seem to reduce bodyload when compared to just this, 4 ho mipt (though tbf Ive only sampled it on its own 1x @ 15), alone.


~20mg 4 ho mipt + ~10mg 4 aco dmt made for a wonderful stroll in the woods and time with friends today

I had quite a disappointing experience with this compound the other night. It’s been quite some time since I’ve had a real tripped, so I figured 30 mg (1 1/2 green pellets) would do the trick. There was some mild texture shifting and increased visual acuity, but that was about it. I also felt mildly withdrawn which is strange because last time I used this substance it was extremely euphoric and visual. As the effects began to dissipate I consumed 3 10mg thc gummies and proceeded to have an hour long panic attack, but that was solely due to the cannabis. 


Perhaps it was a weak batch because 2 weeks ago I sampled 90 mics of al-lad and had a surprisingly  strong reaction.

It could be that your pellets were not properly dosed, too.  I always go for the pure substance rather than preparations of it, for this reason.

I find them similar, but very much distinct. I personally don't jive well with 4-HO-MiPT, which is a damn shame. It's got a lot of charm. Unfortunately, I get a lot of annoying body load from it and I get creepy, psychotic-feeling auditory hallucinations on the tail end. I don't get any of this from 4-AcO-MiPT. 4-AcO-MiPT feels lighter, more energetic, more electric, but shallow and not nearly as rich and satisfying. It definitely doesn't have the same potential to warp my mind as 4-HO-MiPT.

This is the most upstanding Typtamine IME.


My body has an hard time with Psylocibine Truffles, aMT en 5-meo-DIPT. And this one has none negative side effects at 20 mg.

Lovely visuals and combines nicely with LSD analogues.


Forgot to add 5-meo-DALT, worthless.

I have combined it with ald 52 at 200ug and 20mg of 4 ho mipt. It was a decent experience but it was nothing to write home about. I didn’t get much synergy. But I seemed to noticed the bodyload more (a shakey sort of euphoric energy I find 4 ho mipt has on its own, most notable as I push to higher doses of 4 ho mipt on its own).

As atypical, someone who's body can't stand Tryptamine's in general. And for whom Lysergic's seem more on the sedativ side of the spectrum. Love them!


No body load whatsoever have I experienced, not on LSD analogues nor on 4-ho-MIPT. The combo 150 mcg 1p-LSD and 20 mg 4-ho-MIPT a few hours in was perfect. ALD-52 disappeared of the map ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


But Shroom's or aMT and the bodyload is bothersome to the point that I will not take these substances ever again.


Maybe age related, I am 47 Tired of Crap.

Both at once? 


That could have made an difference. And 200 mcg ALD-52 would be to much for my liking. I would half it. 


300 mcg 1p-LSD no matter how nice the trip was, had me have a black out the 2 day's after. Learned bout my limit's the hardway, glad I don't operate heavy machinery.

No I dosed the 4 ho mipt about an hour in in hopes to align the peaks


200 ug of ald52 was rather modest for me in my previous ~5 trips at that dose

Personal chemistry! I didn't stack peaks or try to , it was at the plateau, but the Tryptamine was unexpectedly warm. ime I felt it on top, very nicely.


My pellet's of 4-ho-MIPT came in yesterday, they are asking me 'eat one, eat one'


i was like just woke up guys, patience.

On it's own its also very very pleasurable for a Psychedelic.


Lazy laying, blazing. Found some peace to put my mind at ease. 20mg doesn't produce visual's, though everything moves so slow and has that glow.

4-HO-MiPT + MXPr = unbelievably amazing combination. Highly recommend giving this a shot! Brings out the absolute best of both substances and the physical euphoria is out of this world. Never has a disso + psych combination been this beautiful and my doses weren't even high (18mg 4-HO-MiPT + 45mg MXPr, both taken orally 2 hours apart). MXPr's serotonergic activity synergized so well with 4-HO-MiPT's slight entactogenic effects. Took me by surprise how enjoyable this was. I feel completely refreshed today and my mood is significantly improved.

I'm glad someone else mentioned a dissociative plus 5-ho-mipt. 


 I did: 

-300mg DXM over 20 minutes to make sure I'm not even so much as a little naseated @ 190lb bw.  I find taking 300mg/20min keeps me from getting more than mildly nauseated even into a strong 3rd plateau.  It also makes it more trippy, visual, and peaceful and less of a high, stoned, pushy stimulating feeling in my experience after doing both ways to the 3rd plateau.  DXM/DXO conversion rate?  I took gel capsules from a pharmacy store.  

-2hr past dosing DXM took 10mg 4-ho-mipt oral.  2 hours to make sure any potential stomach issues from dxm wouldn't be there, but would probably do 1-1.5hr next time so I get to experience feeling both coming up at the same time.

-1hr later took 10mg more oral

-1hr later insufflated 10mg

-1.5hr later insufflated 5mg

-30min later insufflated 5mg more

-1.5hr later, take 500mg phenibut


I did this as my 2nd experience of 4-ho-mipt one week after dosing 20mg oral at once for a mild-moderate trip.  Not a social drug to me not b/c of paranoia or losing myself or anything but just b/c it makes me super spacey.  


I don't think I took enough DXM to alter and synergize the trip enough.  Surprisingly to me, it was additive as opposed to being more than the sum of its parts like acid and dxm.  It changed the headspace some as to make the experience a little more alien and it toned down the bodyload of the 4-ho-mipt and took away the normal aches and body tension I feel so that it wouldn't taint the trip but also took away a lot of the pleasant tactile sensations of 4-ho-mipt.  It also added a pushing and driving force to the trip but I'm betting that's because it was a low 2nd plateau and I was still experiencing stimulation form the 1st plateau that mostly goes away mid-high 2nd plateau.  I wanted the dxm so I could forget about my body and focus more on the headspace and hopefully increase visuals like when I combined with a low dose acid but visuals were not increased. 


Also unusually, I felt like a need, almost kind of a compulsion to redose.  I think that was the driving force of that dose of DXM.  The first redose was something I decided I would do after an hour if I didn't feel like I was where I wanted to be, but the insufflation was totally spur of the moment.  Not like me typically at all w/ psychadelics.  Like it was something I had to do as part of the 'journey' and 'learning' and the only way to reach the 'destination' whatever that is if there was one.  I think that was the interpretation of the DXM stimulation through the lens of the 4-ho-mipt.  Time will tell if there was actually anything learned and what to make of that.  


 I also wonder If I spread the 4-ho-mipt dose out too much for full effects.  Visuals were mild, some minor warping of flat surfaces and some objects beginning to alternate between getting smaller and bigger to a small extent.  Abstract paintings and trip art did neat things. Granted it takes a lot of anything for me to get even moderate visuals as I've seen people report on psychedelics.  It's not uncommon for me to take a dose of acid from the same batch that'll make a persons hand melt and I'm just kinda meh about the visuals.  Towards the end, I could tell the dxm wore off and I was getting tired so I ended with 500mg phenibut and then couldn't sleep till10 am.  DXM was dosed at 10pm.  


Here's some thoughts I had and I'd love your thoughts about them b/c I'm open to doing things differently:

-take a high 2nd plateau to a low 3rd plateau dose of dxm

-dose oral 15mg 4-ho-mipt 1.5hr after the last gelcap I take

-have a 2 5mg lines of 4-ho-mipt prepared beforehand and maybe or maybe not redose one or both lines If I'm not where I want to be within an hour after the initial 4-ho-mipt dose


That's a dxm dose that'll leave me with a hangover for most of the next day and make getting to sleep at a decent hour difficult and it'll be shitty sleep so I'll need to make sure I don't have much to do the next day.  I'll keep phenibut on hand in case things get intense but it takes for me 45-60min to start working and 1.5hr before max effects but just knowing it's about to be more much more easily managed will help during the time it takes for phenibut to start working.

You need to research your drugs, more [@abc1986](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/544974/).


It's basic and common knowledge that redosing psychedelics after 1.5-2hrs is a waste as instant tolerance sets in. You were still dosing more 4-ho-mipt at T+4hrs, which is a total waste.


Also, Phenibut takes 3+ hrs to fully kick in, which is again pretty common knowledge. It's not like a benzo that you can take and expect to be asleep in an hour from.

Not a total waste.  Not in my one experience doing it anyway.  After the last redoses the experience did get stronger.  I know about the very fast tolerance, but apparently from that experience I learned that while I may not be getting the most out of it, it will strengthen the trip in that moment.  Because I know about the fast tolerance, I also know better than to think that because I took 40mg 4-ho-mipt in one night I'm good to take that dose all at once.  


I have lots of experience with phenibut and have read about it and for me personally it starts kicking in faster than most people.  Go figure.  Again, 45-60min to start feeling it.  90min before max effects at therapeutic doses.  Neither benzos nor phenibut knock me out as in make me sleepy, but they help with with residual stimulation and racing thoughts.  If I want sleep, I'll take an old school allergy pill at the same time I start to feel its effects.

Lol, I did this once. After an acid trip with a comedown that just lingered on a on, I wanted sleep and had no benzos at hand. I ended up taking about 200 mg of Dimenhydrinate. Not exactly an anti-allergic, but at least also an anti-histaminic. Fell asleep shortly after.

I have some 4-ho-mipt on the way. How does it compare to Psilocybin and Metocin (4-ho-met)? I love mushrooms and enjoy Metocin. But, although Metocin produced spectacular visuals (almost like a mild DMT trip at times) I find the headspace too neutral and lacking. Great  mixer with other psychs and dissos though. From what I have read 4-ho-mipt has more true psychedelic potential, do you folks find this to be the case?


Also how does this one combine with dissociatives? I have seen a few glowing reports but what is the general consensus?


Any advice, recommendations or cautions on dosage, ROA, combos etc also appreciated. I know there is info out there (and I am reading it) but I like to hear the nice qualitative comments ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

For me 4-ho-mipt is pretty mild in the visuals even when I take it in high doses.  But can get really heavy in the mindfuck and introspection... uncomfortably so to me at times.  Which is why I have 4-ho-met on the way which I hope is just kinda more recreational and just fun.  


I wanna chat a little about my last trip a couple of nights ago.


3 days prior to this trip I had done a 9mg 5-meo-mipt "trip".  Trip in quotations because it's more of a trippy roll to me at that dose.  


So my tolerance was pretty high and I redosed multiple times 45-90 minutes after the initial dose.  So the doses are going to be stupid high looking w/out any context.  It was still a pretty strong trip but it wasn't nearly as strong as one might think if looking at dose alone.


Initial Dosing:  

-12mg 5-meo-mipt

-10mg 4-ho-mipt

Later:

-4mg 5-meo 60min  The redose took the 5-meo out of rolling mode and killed the possibility of a flip and added stimmy psychedelic body euphoria and power and made visuals brighter and shimmer more instead.

-multiple 10mg lines 4-ho railed 45min to 90min up to a total 60 more mg 4-ho-mipt


You might call this a waste of material but quite frankly I'm glad the 4-ho-mipt is gone.  It's not the chem I want or need in my life atm after this trip and am happy to retire it for a time, but I do think I made some insights and peace from this trip despite it's unpleasantness at the time.  Not as in a bad awful scary trip, just like kind of wishing I'd maybe just had a couple to few drinks and walked the dog instead...  But ultimately, I think it was for the better that I tripped.  I was tripping... but this trip helped ground me ironically I think.  


The first 90 minutes were really rolly thx to the 5-meo.  Strong tactile euphoria and a lot of stim.  I didn't have first alerts until as much as 30 minutes into it which is unusual and didn't really feel it hard until 45 minutes in.  Still not much trip by the that point.  


For much of the trip, I was listening to Tool and Puscifer songs watching music vids and watching videos of Maynard Keenan on Joe Rogan's podcast and his vids about his winery.  My thoughts took me to the rock star life which to me now doesn't at all seem that far removed from many normal middle class people's live.  At least it seem much far less removed than say that of someone living in poverty in a 3rd world country and some things in his life and experience became incredibly relatable.  


I was just kinda sitting there tripping balls thinking I hardly care that I'm tripping hard right now....  I listened to the song lateralus and some other powerful sounding trippy songs and I'm like sure I feel the music through my veins and the energy coursing through my body is intense and my mind is being blown by the lyrical content but I'm like... so what I don't even care.....  So I stopped doing the typical tripping stuff and just started watching and doing more normal stuff.  Despite my balance being thrown off my morphing breathing walls and every straight line bending and curving and seeing things not there in the corners of my eyes like a trash can looking like an alien for a split second for example, I just kinda walked around the house, played with my dogs, had a snack, a couple of drinks and hardly cared I was tripping or my brain was coming up with really weird thoughts and that things 'felt' super profound and weird.  


Like I just wanted to do basic stuff and just be grounded, not b/c I was losing touch or felt disturbed about my mind going crazy weird places but just because I could hardly care about that.  Sure, the paintings in the house were doing fantastic wonderful strange things and I could feel and breathe in the mood and visuals of these paintings... but I could hardly make myself care.  I wasn't like depressed or having feelings that life and everything was a cosmic joke or anything, I was just kinda 'meh... whatevs'.


So back to vids of Maynard Keenan and his winery.  Here is a guy who truly lived the rock star life, tripped crazy hard who knows how many times and had so much money and women and everything so many of us imagine would make us happy.  While I can't relate to that extent of course, being raised middle class white and all that kind of thing I would say my upbringing is privileged in many ways and that there is a disconnection between true values and what's 'sold' as valuable so I had a strong interest in what Maynard did with his life now.  And I watched videos about his winery and talking about being reconnected to Earth and nature and how we have become disconnected and kind of the false idols we chase instead of finding what actually means something and what's truly valuable.  


Also in his podcast with Joe Rogan about the song Lateralus, he talked about the Fibanachi(sp?) sequence and he was just talking about how it was almost a joke kind of thing.  Like it was just so utterly obvious to him and he was sticking his finger out at it and being like "so what?" and kept trying to move Joe Rogan to other things to talk about that might seem more mundane but were more important to Maynard in the interview.  Like his point in the making the song was to say "It's here!  So what!?".  At least that's how he felt in that particular podcast.  


I'm taking a break from the more mind-bending psychedelics to focus on grounding and what my core values are.  However, I do not regret this stint with 4-ho-mipt.  


I do look forward to combining a sub 8mg 5-meo-mipt with 10mg 4-ho-met whenever the met arrives!  I think it could be a fun recreational flip! :D  And I might just enjoy doing more normal stuff like I usually do on a night off than doing any trip prep or activities when I try it.  I just really don't want any deep headspace or mindfuck for now, I've had enough of that for a while.  I combined 5-meo-mipt and 4-ho-mipt like to this to make a flip before successfully.  


I also wanna try maybe 4-6mg of 5-meo-mipt with a cathinone whenever I can get my hands on one.  Dosing will start conservatively w/ the combo of course.

 Wow, I can’t believe how close this is to my experience with miprocin.


I also haven’t taken 4-HO-MiPT in almost 7 years.  I’ve tripped on it 9 times, with doses ranging from 14 mg at a concert to 25 mg at home and walking in nature.


Seems that 17-20 mg of the fumarate is my personal “sweet spot.”  I must have lucked out with the batch I received, it certainly doesn’t seem weak!

Over 20 mg and it seems like I’m at risk for a back-of-the-head headache, which is somewhat common after a psychedelic trip for me.


I haven’t tripped on anything except acid since 2014, and no acid since Bicycle Day last year.  


Back to my 17-20 mg “sweet spot.”  From this dose range I can expect pastel colored visual distortions which are quite heavy with tracers.  And the trip is quite jovial and recreational.  One of my favorite trips with it, I went with my wife to a cupcake shop and had a “full tea” lunch. We are in the US, and this is more of an English thing.  Felt like I was at the Alice in Wonderland tea party ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I find the residual stimulation last a long while

at least 10 hours before sleep.

Just tried this for my first time and I also was surprised at residuals. at hour 6 i was still buzzing and even at hour ten i was not completely baseline, though at that point cannabinoids had been introduced into my system. I suppose i was expecting more of a 4-ho-dipt trip but i felt like it was a less visual warmer psilcin that actually lasted a little bit longer than had I eaten mushrooms.

That sounds right to me. 4-HO-DiPT is kind of unique for me but if you still want something more alike it I would recommend trying another non-methyl tryptamine such as 4-HO-DET or 4-HO-DPT.

As for statement, I hate Psycybine containing shroom's and their truffle's.


4-HO-MIPT was an great improvement, but my recent experiment is with 4-HO-MET. They are equal, dosage wise 20 mg 4-HO-MET is about 20 mg 4-HO-MIPT. equal but different. Music appreciation beyond the roof


but with 4-HO-MET i some sort of experience a lessening on the visual appartement. But it does seem to be giving tracer's.


They are alike but different. A low dose combo might be interesting equal parts of both 10 mg. That would go great with any Lysergic's  but that is just me. I like that combo.

I can hardly find the time to trip anymore, but I came very close to dosing miprocin before a hike this Sunday. Decided on a 16 mg dosage, put batteries in my scale, got my jar out to warm up to room temp...came back in 15 minutes to realize it was the wrong jar! Decided not to trip which is just as well...ended up going on the hike with my daughters instead.  Little heathens are the reason I can’t come up with the time to trip LOL

I'm in the same boat, and I'm sure it's the case for a lot of people here. Kids are a trip anyway, even if not the trip we might want at the moment. If nothing else (and there is much else), they force me to examine my belief that I "need" to trip to be myself. Ouch. Those little heathens sure force me to look in the mirror from time to time (like every day).


Back on topic, I think I've read others mention that 4-aco-mipt (which is one of my favorite chemicals) is even more stimulatory than 4-ho-mipt, which is interesting because I don't find 4-aco-mipt to be excessively stimulatory. Then again, if I trip in the evening I'll almost always take a half-dose of a benzo before bed, so maybe that's why it hasn't bothered me...

I miss my little heathen's for over a year now. Somehow they bypassed the law (they being social workers/ mediator's/ Police. While the law is very clear: only a judge can separate kid's from there parent(s). And only in extreme cases like neglect ion, sexual abuse/ physical/ mental abuse.A n advocate confirmed this to me  the situation as it is. Its just plain wrong. 


But it is as it is and despite the damage they are doing to my kid's, As stated in the Rights of the Kid's which puts emphasis on contact with both parent's for their well being. For me its the grief of missing them that its causing me painful moment's. 


And why i have loads of time to trip. Not a very good reason, but psychedelics do seem to have healing powers as they helped me process the whole situation. On my own. As after many effort I gave up on finding proper help for an unproper situation. 


Back to the topic I find them all kinda sedating/ stoning. 4-HO-MIPT and MET. But sleep fine after LSD to. They seem very stress relieving to me. 


Its during my sober and former drinking period my sleep went to shit. Also caused by the Epilepsy I developed about a year ago, stress and Levetiracetam.

Curious about 4-ACO-DET to. On paper it seems more akin to stimulation. But it also mention's a body high. 


The same site doesn't mention these effect for 4-HO-MIPT.

It's easier to recommend than it is to explicitly describe and obviously every individual molecule even within the same group is still unique, but in my experience methyl tryptamines are more likely to have a bubbly euphoric energy, expansive thoughts, deep glowing neon colors, and a greater density of geometric imagery, while non-methyl tryptamines are more likely to feel altered but grounded, to have a more narcotic high, to have colors that are subtler and give off a more mysterious vibe, and to have a greater density of complex visionary hallucinations. A simple measure of comparison for me is that methyl tryptamines are more likely to be composed of the qualities that LSD has that it shares with psilocin while non-methyl tryptamines are more likely to be composed of the qualities that LSD has that it doesn't share with psilocin.

Crystal clear explanation. Im impressed.


When we talk about methylated, you mean at least one methyl in the nitrogen moiety, right? Like 5-meo-mipt. And non methylated would be like 5-meo-dalt, rigth?


And then, DMT would be like a double methylated beast, therefore its uniqueness? same for 5-meo-dmt and 4-ho-dmt, for example...


Super interesting ideas... I will meditate about that. Any other could expand on this SAR especulations?

I have a few different ideas related to this, but I'll try to keep it concise.


I've come to think that one aspect of tryptamine SAR actually is that you can approximate some of their effects by considering both tail substitutions separately in this same sort of way describe above and then simply adding them together to produce the final result. For reasons I'll get back to shortly, let's stick with 4-substituted tryptamines first of all. Even though psilocin, 4-HO-MET, 4-HO-MPT, and 4-HO-MiPT all produce somewhat similar headspaces and colorful geometric imagery for me, in general the headspace of psilocin is most purely psychedelic and the visuals are most densely geometric of them, and of course, psilocin is the most likely of all to have the kind of effects that LSD has that it shares with psilocin. If you take a step out to 4-HO-MET, for myself and seemingly a lot of people the experience is still relatively similar to psilocin overall, although I definitely do feel and have heard others describe that it's at least a little bit more LSD-like than psilocin is too, and for me at least, that has to do with the fact that its geometry is a bit less dense but more filled with realistic but cartoony visionary imagery than what I get from psilocin and its color scheme is just a little less natural and more alien, and it has a still deep but somewhat more lucid and straightforwardly rewarding headspace, which seems to be a commonly given reason for why it's so popular too.


Continuing to 4-HO-MPT, people take and talk about this one much less frequently than the former, but in my personal experience and agreeing with at least a significant number of the experiences of other people I've known to take it and discussed it with, the experience is still relatively psilocin-like especially at lower dosages, and its visuals are somewhat similar to 4-HO-MET except with not necessarily as bright or dense of colorful geometry, but still a decent amount of that although with a cooler color scheme, and often with a more satisfying amount of complex and still somewhat cartoony but for me at least a bit more 3D imagery, and at higher dosages the experience starts to become resoundingly LSD-like for me in its headspace, body high, and what the visions are doing, in some ways more superficially exactly than any other tryptamine, and the body high has actually been strong enough to bring me to orgasm before. Finally, with 4-HO-MiPT, which I personally consider to seem like it counts as a "bulkier" tryptamine in this relationship (meaning that the isopropyl counts as going beyond the propyl similarly to how propyl counts as going beyond the ethyl which is beyond methyl), the visuals are still very geometric and colorful in a somewhat psilocin-like way but are the darkest and least dense of all of these four for me, with a mysterious style I've multiple times described and seen described as "Gothic" or "alien" in nature, but the amount of still more cartoony visionary imagery can get quite high to the point that sometimes the geometry starts disappearing into a more panoramic realistic visionary scenery in a way that can definitely be directly compared to LSD for me, and the headspace can get deep at higher dosages but is particularly recreational and fun for me at lower dosages in a way that also feels rather LSD-like, particularly sexy and easy to handle for being something still potentially challenging like it is.


Before continuing, there's a relationship here which I personally feel is important to note. For several years I spent most of my free time thinking about practically nothing other than tryptamine SAR, and I became relatively confident of two different things: first, that even though lysergamides do have some distinctions from simpler tryptamines in general for me that change the way I think about them as drugs as a whole, at least an important aspect of the standard psychedelic effect of the lysergamides can be considered to fall within the same structure-activity relationships as these same aspects of the simpler tryptamines, and second, that within the realm of the general indole psychedelic SAR, there's something of note about the distinction between superficial comparisons and functional comparisons. What I mean to say is, it's true that I feel that an easier measurement to use is to think that methyls are more likely to produce the effects that LSD shares with psilocin and that non-methyls are (sequentially increasingly) more likely to produce the effects LSD doesn't share with psilocin, but I only use these benchmarks (or, maybe LSD specifically more so than psilocin) because it makes it easier for a wider audience to relate to and understand, but I still only consider them (and particularly LSD) to be just "another part of the puzzle" and to not represent the complete end points, and to share distinct relationships with the other indole psychedelics that can be separated into categories like superficial and functional. For example, take a look at the image below.


This image, as it is labeled, shows a progression starting at 4-HO-MPT, reducing to MPT, and then taking two steps to reach LSA and then LSD, through their intermediary agroclavine, which is a natural ergot alkaloid also found in sources like morning glory and Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds to a lesser extent than LSA which appears to have psychedelic-like effects in animal tests. I wanted to show this comparison specifically because, as I mentioned in my 4-substituted methyl tryptamine comparisons above, 4-HO-MPT is actually the one of them that seems the most superficially similar of all four of those to LSD to me, especially at higher dosages, even though 4-HO-MiPT, while less superficially similar to LSD, is arguably functionally closer to it in some notable ways, and this seems significant because as you can see in the above picture, you can actually reach the lysergamide structural base and LSD itself by beginning with MPT and creating a conformationally constrained analogue of it to then start further growing the tail beyond the end of the terminal carbon of the propyl with, but if you were to instead replace the propyl of the MPT base to make it an isopropyl and the MiPT base instead, then the structure would no longer be entirely contained within the lysergamide structural base or LSD. On the other hand, if you take a look at the following picture, you can see how the isopropyl, on 4-HO-MiPT, has a superficial relationship with the ethyl, on 4-HO-MET in both the two right images, because the ethyl can swing freely in either direction, while the isopropyl is locked into both.


To me, this seems like an important detail because even though, as I said before, the isopropyl seems to me to act functionally as a "bulkier" substitution than the propyl which is more so than the ethyl which is more so than the methyl, at the same time, I find the isopropyl tryptamines to generally seem to have some distinct superficial similarities to the ethyl tryptamines I can reasonably relate them to, and sometimes bleeding a little bit more into some functional overlaps too even though I find the "bulkiness" to seem a little more relevant overall. Seemingly correspondingly, like 4-HO-MiPT is in some ways functionally more alike LSD than 4-HO-MPT for me, I find 4-HO-MiPT often superficially more alike 4-HO-MET, and that actually combines with the greater LSD-like functionality quite nicely to make something both familiar and unique as well as quite fun and potentially also deep, and I'm not surprised that it's a rather popular one. In a return to my post from earlier, this is then part of why I suggested not just non-methyl tryptamines in general but specifically 4-HO-DET and 4-HO-DPT too as a potential 4-HO-DiPT-like experience, because, also in line with what I've been saying, I also generally find 4-HO-DiPT to feel functionally somewhat more alike 4-HO-DPT, but superficially more alike 4-HO-DET.


A final note I'll make about this here is that because LSD fits into the pattern and is not an endpoint, if you're willing to continue thinking about properties as "even more LSD-like than LSD" in a sense, or that is to say, like something that is more likely to produce a greater ratio of the effects that LSD doesn't share with psilocin to the ones that it does than even LSD does, then you can use that to extrapolate beyond the methyl tryptamines and, at least as it seems to me, understand more readily how something like 4-HO-DiPT can actually be particularly superficially distinct from LSD, because its two isopropyls make it about as different as the simple alkyl substitutions can get from the tryptamine base of LSD's lysergamide structural base, yet still specifically capitalize on the sort of effects that make LSD stand out from psilocin to a similar or even greater relative degree, because in terms of at least one aspect of their functionality that encapsulates that similarity, it's not about the superficial similarities that draw to together some of the other effects of more structurally similar molecules, but rather more just about the degree of molecular bulk on the tryptamine tail that seems to remove it from the effects of that most basic DMT structure in a somewhat generally relatable way, thus allowing things like LSD and 4-HO-DiPT to compare in that way despite representing two rather distinct trajectories of increasing tryptamine tail bulk. Another example of this with less distinct molecules that actually helped me to form this view is the relationship between 4-HO-MPT and 4-HO-DET; as I said before, the former I find quite superficially relatable to LSD and functionally rather similar at times too, while 4-HO-DET definitely can be functionally compared to LSD at times for me too and I've known others to agree with that, but superficially it is quite distinct from LSD for me, having a very unique style that is instead far more superficially relatable to other ethyl tryptamines that I've used, as well as ETH-LAD which of course follows the same structure-activity relationships, being relatable to EPT in the same way that LSD is to MPT.


As for DMT and 5-MeO-DMT, those are things I really attempted to add to my conception of the relationships more so later on because almost all of my early experimentation was done with 4-substituted tryptamines, but after I eventually started to gain more experience with base and 5-substituted tryptamines (although still not 5-MeO-DMT specifically, for the record), I expanded my ideas about the tryptamine SAR as a whole more thoroughly. There are some relatively common subclass differences for me, such as for instance pretty much all base tryptamines seem to share some of DMT's propensity to make me sit down and feel sort of hypnotized but surprisingly lucid for the experience in comparison to how the 4-substituted tryptamines seem more likely to give me more of an anxious energy to wander around and become increasingly disorganized during their peaks with, and 5-substituted tryptamines I have less experience with but so far they often seem kind of in between these two groups in this way, and all three groups have certain distinct superficial more broad differences from one another in terms of their visual effects and general positive or negative bodily feelings and such, but despite all of this, I have so far found them to seem like they are bound by similar relationships based on their tail structures as the corresponding 4-substituted tryptamines are. For example, while both DMT and DPT are strong enough to produce very powerful both geometric and visionary imagery for me, it's undeniable to me that DMT's style begins with extreme geometry of a brightly colored and more natural style which has the visions embedded within it, while DPT's style for me begins with the visions already running strong and intertwining the darkly shaded and mysterious, sometimes seductive and sometimes spooky colors and geometries into themselves, and the headspace and high feel maybe stronger and more lucid than but still relatable to the headspace and high of something like psilocin, in comparison at the least to DPT, which to me has felt almost blissfully calm and pleasantly dissociating. Similarly, MPT reminds me the most superficially of LSD of them all, while MiPT still seems like it might be a bit more functionally similar, and EPT reminds me the most superficially of ETH-LAD, although I feel so far like DPT may overlap more with its functionality too, though that's a relationship I still feel I need to explore more and look forward to doing so.

Oh, I forgot to get into it, and it would mostly be repeating similar information anyway except with less perspective for this particular subclass, but so far I found this to hold up with specific 5-substituted tryptamines I've used too - for instance, 5-MeO-MiPT and 5-MeO-DiPT can definitely both be related to psilocin and LSD in different ways, but for me, 5-MeO-MiPT more so to psilocin and 5-MeO-DiPT more so to LSD, with the 5-MeO-DiPT having a more intense narcotic euphoria, mysterious vibe, and visionary imagery compared to the 5-MeO-MiPT having a bit more of a familiar tryptamine psychedelic vibe with denser geometries and more natural color tones, although the colors themselves were actually kind of similar between 5-MeO-MiPT and 5-MeO-DiPT for me.

So Kaleida, do you think that non methyl 4-sub tryptamines (or 4-ho-mipt specifically) to be more similar to LSD thank to mushrooms?


I only have a handful of trips on mushroom and 4-aco-dmt, a few more (10) on miprocin, and about 60 on lsd. 


I do seem to find a lot of similarities with miprocin and acid. More in common than 4acodmt or mushrooms have with acid.


Miprocin kinda seems like “acid-lite” in broad terms. Similar effects but shorter lasting.


Having just dosed 17 mg after a 7 year break, I must say that 4-ho-mipt is a keeper

Personally, the way I use 4-HO-MiPT and find it to be at lower relative dosages, I do generally compare it more to LSD than to mushrooms, although if I take a high enough dosage of 4-HO-MiPT, the effect definitely does still become more recognizably shroomy in its manner of complexity and style, which to be fair can somewhat be said of LSD too, although superficially the 4-HO-MiPT is definitely still closer to mushrooms at that level than LSD is in some meaningful ways for me, but similarly also still more alike LSD at that level than mushrooms are; 4-HO-MiPT becomes very extreme for me at that level though and I very rarely attempt to push it into that range anymore. While not necessarily universal I've known quite a lot of people to see it this sort of way too, and you're not even the first person I've known of to use that nickname for it. It does still have notable differences such as as you mention the shorter duration, much more like mushrooms than LSD for me in that way most of the time, although I'm sure that's just because it gets absorbed and metabolized like the simple tryptamine it is comparably to psilocin and unlike the complex and conformationally constrained lysergamides like LSD, which would presumably be the same reason it compares more to psilocin in terms of qualities like required dosage, chemical taste, and so on than it does to LSD.


In the same vein, lysergamides specifically seem to have some distinct pharmacological properties from other tryptamines such as their well-characterized potent dopaminergic and adrenergic receptor activities and the more recently explored differences in structural interactions and their functional implications with the 5-HT2A receptor like how having a N,N-diethyl group on the lysergamide-specific tail nitrogen seems to pull a lid-like branch of the receptor closed over them and increase their ability to stay docked inside (at least, this has been shown for LSD and I don't see why it couldn't apply somewhat to the others as well, but that is admittedly a guess) and have distinct effects on signaling like through beta-arrestin, and I so far feel like this difference seems to show in their subjective effects as well because there are certain qualities to the lysergamide experiences that I feel I don't tend to find in any other type of psychedelic I've used, no matter how otherwise similar, and 4-HO-MiPT is no exception in that way. "Acid-lite" really is a decent way to look at it for me too because it's not going to give me everything that LSD is going to and it's not going to last as long, but it is still going to be similar and its differences are going to work for it rather than against it if I just accept it for what it is. By contrast, I generally don't take it thinking of it as something that's going to give me a particularly mushroom-like experience or hoping that it will, although I do always look forward to having at least some recognizably psilocin-like elements with it.


Though, while 4-HO-MiPT is the asymmetrical methyl tryptamine with the other substitution being the "most" non-methyl (an isopropyl being the bulkiest versus a methyl being the least bulky), it is still a methyl tryptamine due to the former substitution. So, basically what I was saying before was my first recommendation was to go totally non-methyl which progresses from psilocin which is 4-HO-DMT to 4-HO-DET and then 4-HO-DPT and/or (different structural directions but some linear functional increases) 4-HO-DiPT, but if you follow the same path on only one substitution, going from 4-HO-DMT to 4-HO-MET and then 4-HO-MPT and/or 4-HO-MiPT, the same sort of relationships hold true for me, but they're still only approximately half as relevant; which is to say, 4-HO-MET is the only first step from 4-HO-DMT, but then you could go to either 4-HO-MPT or 4-HO-MiPT but you could also go to 4-HO-DET, and from that ethyl rather than methyl symmetrical base, you could go from 4-HO-EPT and then 4-HO-EiPT (which I've unfortunately never used unlike the rest of these, but hypothetically, and I have used 5-MeO-EiPT for what it's worth) and these ethyl tryptamines would also follow the trend of becoming increasingly more like the qualities that LSD has that are distinct from psilocin in the same way the progression of methyls or symmetricals does, and same for the progression of 4-HO-DPT to 4-HO-PiPT (which I also haven't tried though it's more recently become available), and finally maxing out at 4-HO-DiPT. So, it's a complicated web that you can follow through many trajectories, though with these four simple alkyls at least it notably ends at 4-HO-DiPT being the most linearly bulky, and you could even get there going from 4-HO-MiPT to 4-HO-EiPT to 4-HO-PiPT to 4-HO-DiPT for example, so as much as 4-HO-MiPT can have the qualities that LSD has that stand out from psilocin, that can definitely get even heavier than that within this same structure-activity relationship grouping, although I can only speak from experience comparing it in that specific line to the endpoint, 4-HO-DiPT.


That being said, something that brings 4-HO-MiPT and LSD together and separates LSD from all of the others in that group is that they are both asymmetrical methyl tryptamine derivatives, and with MPTs being the ones that are superficially more alike LSD for me even while MiPTs are often functionally more alike it, those two structures (MPTs and MiPTs) are still pretty similar and 4-HO-MiPT and LSD are still not *that* distinct for me even superficially. Once you start to remove the methyl things can start to seem a lot less familiar and I generally find that the least bulky substitution on the molecule is a decent way to estimate particularly certain aesthetic aspects of the experience which are a lot easier to recognize for me than they are to describe, so for instance while 4-HO-MiPT may get a relatively more lysergamide-like vibe from its isopropyl while also feeling still like a methyl tryptamine aesthetic and thus comparing more to LSD, I would expect that 4-HO-EiPT, again without having actually had the opportunity to try it yet, might also gain a relatively more lysergamide-like vibe from its isopropyl while also feeling instead like an ethyl tryptamine aesthetic and thus possibly comparing more to ETH-LAD. Additionally, in the grand scheme of psychedelic tryptamine derivative tail bulkiness, 4-HO-MiPT and LSD don't seem to necessarily be all that far off from one another, but as I was saying before, LSD is not actually an endpoint and tryptamines can be even bulkier than LSD itself, so if, for example, 4-HO-MiPT is theoretically similar to LSD and it takes another three steps to get from 4-HO-MiPT to 4-HO-DiPT, then 4-HO-DiPT is theoretically much bulkier than LSD, and thus could be suspected to produce a notably higher ratio even of the effects that LSD doesn't share with psilocin to the effects that LSD does share with psilocin than even LSD does, and in my personal experience I feel that this seems like a reasonable perspective so far. Essentially it's sort of like if you could describe psilocin as having property A and LSD and 4-HO-MiPT as having property A + B while 4-HO-DiPT has property B, and on top of that psilocin, LSD, and 4-HO-MiPT are all methyl tryptamine derivatives while 4-HO-DiPT is not, so ultimately, what it amounts to is that 4-HO-DiPT and to varying other extents other entirely non-methyl tryptamines can actually be quite distinct from the traditionally used indole psychedelics in general, even though I would often say that they're more similar to LSD than psilocin nonetheless, but just in a way that can go even beyond LSD's difference from psilocin, but also the less bulky ones are still more noticeably similar to psilocin for me than the bulkier ones, like 4-HO-DET compared to 4-HO-DiPT, for example.


I hope that's clear enough. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I appreciate the discussion.  You’ve focused on whether or not the compound has a methyl, as a way to compare against 4-ho-dmt, but what if you had decided to differentiate them based on if they were symmetrical or not?  Do you think that division would not be as appropriate, based on your experience?

Well, it does seem to stand out whether they're symmetrical or asymmetrical to me, but that feels to me like it's primarily because of how it emphasizes the aesthetic of the substitution. I really have just found a lot of the tryptamine structure-activity relationships to seem rather simple when comparing my subjective experiences even though I expected it to be a little less easy to just compare and contrast when going in, and I really can't claim to know how much of it would have a nice scientific explanation and how much is just coincidence, but I really can say things like that the visuals of 4-HO-MET remind me of both the visuals of psilocin and 4-HO-DET and that the visuals of 4-HO-MPT remind me of both the visuals of psilocin and 4-HO-DPT and that the visuals of 4-HO-EPT remind me of both the visuals of 4-HO-DET and 4-HO-DPT, and so on. I really enjoyed seeing the different ways the styles would seem to mix and match, but at the same time it increasingly made it feel like when I would use things like psilocin, 4-HO-DET, and 4-HO-DPT themselves, the absence of the blend of two different styles and instead the extra emphasis on one core style really seemed to stand out. For example, myself and at least a number of people that I've talked to seem to think that psilocin and 4-AcO-DMT still have generally more dense and intricate geometric visuals than the other methyl 4-substituted tryptamines which get into a DMT-like area, and as I said before the methyl and ethyl tryptamine aesthetics are very different for me, but 4-HO-DET and 4-AcO-DET really exemplify the very distinct ethyl style to an intense and visionary degree that no other ethyl 4-substituted tryptamine does as completely, and I find ethyls as well as considering the difference between them and methyls to be fascinating, so it's a big deal to me to have both the symmetricals and asymmetricals to use and differentiate.


So yeah, I definitely think that's an important aspect of it too. I think there are a lot of different interesting relationships that come into play between them that all seem to contribute to the final effects in their own ways.


Here's something that I think provides some interesting perspective into the symmetrical versus asymmetrical situation. [This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4194234/) tested the efficacy of DMT, DET, DPT, DiPT, and MiPT at the 5-HT2A receptor, and it found that DMT had 83%, DET had 90%, DPT had 97%, and DiPT had 110%, so a pretty straightforward increase with increasing symmetrical bulk, but MiPT actually had 74%, even lower than DMT, so clearly something different is going on there. For comparison, [this study](https://edoc.unibas.ch/53326/1/20170117174852_587e4af45b658.pdf) did another test of intrinsic efficacy at the 5-HT2A receptor and found that DMT had 40% and DiPT had 101%, another large increase between them which is paralleled in psilocin having 16% and 4-HO-DiPT having 74%, and yet 4-HO-MET is right nearly all the way up there with it, with 72%. I always found that intriguing, so just thought I'd share it.

Fascinating stuff Kaleida. Would you mind clarifying what you mean by superficial vs functional resemblances?

Sure, it's a rather complex topic that's not always the easiest to describe in detail, although I tend to find it rather easier to identify certain key qualities of each.


For functional effects, this is what I'm mainly referring to when I describe the effects as being typically seemingly relatively more selective for the kinds of properties that LSD shares with psilocin with less bulky substitutions and for the kinds of properties it doesn't with more bulky substitutions, and it comes back to my earlier post in this thread where I first clarified why I made the recommendation I did: in my experience methyl tryptamines are more likely to have a bubbly euphoric energy, expansive thoughts, deep glowing neon colors, and a greater density of geometric imagery, while non-methyl tryptamines, to a sequentially increasing degree as the bulk of the non-methyl substitution increases, are more likely to feel altered but grounded, to have a more narcotic high, to have colors that are subtler and give off a more mysterious vibe, and to have a greater density of complex visionary hallucinations. Back in the day when I was still really starting to develop my thoughts about all of this, I tended to describe the less bulky substitutions as being more likely to produce "classical psychedelic" effects while the more bulky substitutions were more likely to produce "dissociative" or "dream-like" or even "delirious" effects, and I had some friends who agreed with me at the time, although I got suggestions for different terms to describe them too, such as using "narcotic" or "hypnotic" for the latter; I think it's really complex and doesn't compare directly to any one label, though I agree that all of those and more capture different elements of how I've felt about it over time. Essentially it's the question of, when I prepare to take and think about what I might get from a trip on any specific tryptamine derivative in this structure-activity relationship web, do I treat it more like it's going to be like a trip on mushrooms, or like a trip on LSD, or something that's different to a similar but even greater degree, such as DPT compared to DMT? How will it function, what will it make me feel like throughout and after the experience, how will it change my thought processes, will I be overwhelmed by external patterns or travel inward into realistic visions?


This is just an idea, don't quote me scientifically or anything of course, but one thought I've developed over time related to my experiences and apparent observations of this is that it sort of seems like maybe, DMT for whatever reason has its highly efficacious effects of the "classical psychedelic" variety as most people seem to agree it does, and it can also be dosed high enough to produce a profound "dissociative" effect which can be somewhat related to near-death experiences, which serotonin is sometimes suspected to be involved in (and this seems particularly likely at leasts when suffocation is the cause based on the research I can find), so perhaps what happens is that when the tryptamine tail bulk is increased in basically any way, certain serotonergic effects remain and maybe are even intensified - as shown in the studies above with increasing efficacy between DMT, DET, DPT, and DiPT in the standard signaling pathway they test, but only one of multiple - and that could be things like the near-death experience-like "dissociative" effects which may contribute to things like why DPT for example can be known for being particularly dissociative and delirious for some, but maybe at the same time that specific "classic psychedelic" effect actually depends on those tiny methyl substitutions for high potency and still remains to varying degrees but with increasingly less prominence compared to those "dissociative" effects as the bulk increases, even though again, as with something like DPT, you can also just take a high enough dosage with them to get really powerful "classical psychedelic" effects too. I think that's an important point to note too - since most indole psychedelics are seemingly incredibly physically safe over a wide range of dosages, at least in terms of not overdosing or having likely immediate health complications or anything, with most of them if you really want to you can probably dose high enough to encompass practically the full range of available indole psychedelic effects, but nonetheless, those effects will still exist in ratios to one another that are unique to each drug and reflect the same patterns of which effects do or don't appear much for them at lower dosages, so just something to consider about that too.


For superficial effects, what it seems to come down to for me is that, for whatever reason obviously not having any idea how this stuff really works, it really has appeared to me, consistently through years of experience, that psychedelics that have similar molecular structures to one another are relatively more likely to have aesthetic similarities in their hallucinations and their other more abstract alterations of consciousness and cognition particularly where they overlap with perception than are psychedelics that have relatively less similar molecular structures, and I want to stress this latter part too, because it's important to me to clarify that when I call them "superficial" effects I'm not trying to imply that they're unimportant or anything, because I think the way a psychedelic expresses and portrays its functional effects through its superficial effects can make quite the difference too, especially in a world where we have so many options and you can really be picky to find what truly works best for you. For a quick non-tryptamine example though, even though psychedelics in general with enough potency can generally get pretty colorful I tend to find it relatively easy to identify what the most consistently prominent color or restricted color range has been for me thus far with any given molecule and they really do seem to remain pretty consistent for me overall with each individual molecule, and within the world of 2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamines for instance, 2C-C, 2C-B, and 2C-I, all the halogenated simple phenethylamines I've tried, have very, very distinctly green visuals both dark and bright, while 2C-P is actually more deeply purple, and on the other hand DOF, DOC, and DOB all the halogenated amphetamines I've tried, have very powerful and deep but vibrant orange visuals for me, yet DOPR, again unlike them but instead alike 2C-P, had particularly very purple and also pink visuals! I don't really have an explanation other than pointing out that it just seems logically more likely than not giving that every psychedelic has unique visuals that more chemically similar psychedelics would more likely have more subjectively similar visuals and it anecdotally seems to pan out, and in my experience so far, this definitely seems to apply not just to these phenethylamines but to the tryptamine-lysergamide structure-activity relationships as well.


I really can't overstate the degree of superficial similarity that the MPTs have with LSD compared to other tryptamines for me, particularly when really pushed into the higher dosage range, although it's important to note that, as I was getting into with comparing the MPTs to the MiPTs before, even though the LSD-like qualities that the MPTs have are superficially closer to LSD itself for me than the LSD-like effects of the MiPTs are, the MPTs are still slightly further back than the MiPTs on the functionality scale from LSD and towards psilocin, and whereas I agreed above with the idea that 4-HO-MiPT could be in some ways thought of as an "acid-light" due to its functional and still relatively high superficial similarities, with 4-HO-MPT I've traditionally described it as being the tryptamine that is truly the most alike LSD both superficially and functionally except with caveat of also being blended with more of the superficial and functional qualities of psilocin simultaneously as opposed to getting those LSD-like qualities by themselves, so in other words it's sort of like a blend of properties of LSD and psilocin, and I eventually started describing MPT with the similar description of like a blend of properties of LSD and DMT for me. Again, superficial doesn't mean unimportant and these qualities make the MPTs truly memorable and special psychedelics for me, so it's something that I find very meaningful to consider in these relationships too, but it's definitely something that feels distinct from the aforementioned functional relationships to me, and I find acknowledging both theoretical relationships to seem to accurately describe my feelings and impressions and help guide my decisions to take things relatively successfully so far.


For example, 5-MeO-DiPT is quite superficially distinct from LSD for me overall, but functionally I've actually found it notably similar so far, and actually can point to a lot of trip reports that I found in my research of it where others said the exact same thing too, and this relationship seems believable to me given how bulky 5-MeO-DiPT is even though it having the two isopropyls seems to give it very distinct superficial effects from the methyl and lysergamide backbone of LSD, which for example involves 5-MeO-DiPT for me being heavily red (again in addition to many other colors) but also only developing subsequent to a bright white light and silvery glow similar to both 4-HO-DiPT and DiPT, and overall they all feel to me like they're sort of "ancient" and sometimes even "monstrous" in their stylistic nature like a sort of twisted equivalent to the ancient natural vibe I sometimes associated with things like DMT and mushrooms, while LSD for me tends to be heavily blue (and etc.) and to feel very modern, technological, and playful, and it's just a pretty different aesthetic vibe overall for different tryptamine derivatives, but nonetheless, both LSD and 5-MeO-DiPT have a very high prominence of cartoony human visuals with a sexual nature and spinning in Ferris wheel patterns alongside an otherwise relatively lower but still colorful and prominent array of geometric visuals and correspondingly with my above recommendations and how I usually expect the effects to be based on that kind of relationship, I also find both of them to be more "dissociative" and "narcotic" and "mysterious" and so on compared to psilocin, to a degree that is relatable to one another, and ultimately, I feel like I would consider LSD and 5-MeO-DiPT alongside each other as possible psychedelic options for a similar mood and desire for what I consider functional effects, but their superficial differences would definitely be a significant factor that comes into play for me in determining how I want the day to go and what sort of imprint I want the trip to leave on my the most at that time, because even if they are relatively functionally similar psychedelics for me overall, the psychedelic "vibe" will definitely change how I feel and think about some stuff overall, both directly and indirectly.


For me, one of the easiest ways to see the examples of superficial similarities is to compare tryptamine derivatives with the exact same tails, such as the aforementioned comparison between 5-MeO-DiPT, 4-HO-DiPT, and DiPT, although particularly the 4-substituted and base tryptamines, because interestingly, almost every 5-substituted tryptamine has had strongly red-orange visuals regardless of what other superficial qualities it had, the only exception so far being 5-MeO-EiPT, which just has had orange-yellow, and that can be related to how above 5-MeO-DiPT started white and silvery but then became primarily red with additional rainbow colors, because for me 4-HO-DiPT and DiPT also start white and silvery, although that tends to remain one of the more prominent aspects and blend somewhat with blues either lighter on the 4-HO-DiPT or darker on the DiPT. 4-HO-DPT and DPT for me both seem to have particularly purple colors, and also notably focus particularly on some of the theater mask-like visual imagery, and I've described them as having a sort of "shadowy" and "spooky" but also sometimes technological vibe overall. 4-HO-MPT and MPT for me, notably alike LSD, focus heavily on blues tending a little into greens and purples, and they have a similar neon and wireframe quality to their visuals and erotic cartoony aspect to their visions, and 4-HO-EPT and EPT for me, similarly to ETH-LAD, focus heavily on faded yellows with occasional shifts into darker colors like greens or oranges and patterns that can look like some sort of weird mechanical operations yet also so natural and ethereal that it's like they might be made of sunlight. Psilocin and DMT can actually be a little more diverse than some of the others tend to for me although they still tend to produce similar geometries and transformations and tend around the more natural green or yellow ranges for me (in addition to many other well-defined colors), and bufotenine (5-HO-DMT) still follows the pattern of being red-orange like other 5-substituted tryptamines for me despite also being superficially comparable to them in some ways that no other non-DMT-based tryptamines have been for me. 4-HO-MET and MET can be relatively compared to psilocin and DMT for me although I find them notably closer even, both being particularly yellow but also still mixed with a lot of other prominent neon colors like red, blue, and green that seem kind of technological. Somewhat amusingly though, despite 4-HO-MiPT and MiPT definitely sharing some qualities for me such as particularly crisp and ornate colorful geometric tapestries and a somewhat tryptamine-unusual level of detail on certain geometric aspects even though being subtler than others in a way I've sometimes compared to phenethylamines, 4-HO-MiPT for me is super dark blue while MiPT for me is super bright but deep red; sometimes life throws you curveballs, although that does give MiPT some similarity to 5-MeO-MiPT, which also shares some of those qualities with them for me and is also in that red-orange area.


It's early in the morning and some of those details are somewhat haphazardly given, I could definitely describe more about each if I tried but I just wanted to give a little bit of an example for each for me, but I hope that helps clarify it somewhat.

Kaleida, do you have a chemistry background or you just love psychedelics that much? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I think I discovered a new-to-me effect of 4-HO-MiPT the other day. Might be the first time (or strongest) I’ve experienced audio distortions.


It was hard to tell because 1) I was tripping 2) I was listening to vinyl for  basically the first time 3) on a likely 50 year old player that wobbles, so I wasn’t sure if the sound *was* actually distorted or if this was the type of effect I would expect from 4-HO-DiPT (only from what I’ve read)?


I’ve read a half dozen erowid reports on miprocin today, and like 4 of them mentioned audio effects - I have done a lot of reading on it in the past, but never noticed it until now.


Have you guys experienced audio distortions on 4-HOMiPT?  Is the effect similar or much stronger from 4-HO-DiPT? I thought iprocin was unique in this regard. 

Did you enjoy it or do you find it distracting/irritating/disconcerting?

Is it a downward pitch for you?

Just the latter. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I played Pokémon games through my high school chemistry class and basically felt like I was starting at nothing when I started researching psychedelics. When I started becoming obsessed with understanding drugs it was more so because I was shifting over from an interest in computer programming and saw each molecule as a distinct way to sort of hack my brain and learn how to tweak its functions in the directions of my choosing.

I've gotten this from 4-HO-MiPT, but only at 50 mg. The base DiPT is actually the one that is known for producing this effect selectively and particularly efficiently, I've gotten it from 4-HO-DiPT but only weakly for a moment at 30 mg (which is the highest I've gone with it so far). The effect on 4-HO-MiPT was stronger but the dosage was also higher, and it still wasn't really strong compared to DiPT, although it was comparable to it.


I'm pretty sure it's just a property of isopropyl tryptamines in general, thus why the most base dual isopropyl tryptamine is the most efficient at it, but the others can often do it somewhat too. 5-MeO-DiPT is supposedly more known for producing auditory distortions than 4-HO-DiPT too but I haven't had any with it yet, taking it up to 10 mg orally. I haven't gotten any with the other isopropyl 5-substituted tryptamines I've used either (5-MeO-MiPT and 5-MeO-EiPT) although I have gotten it from MiPT at 50 mg. Again it was not strong compared to DiPT, but it seemed to be the same kind of effect.

On 4-HO-MiPT I found it purely entertaining because I only noticed it after coming out of a really heavy peak spent in silence and I walked into the living room to hear my roommate watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and the first thing I heard was Buffy's voice shifted down and I burst out laughing. I don't find it to have much potential to be annoying when it's low intensity but on DiPT it can be a different story, sometimes I just want to enjoy its standard psychedelic effects that I really like and I can't because it really makes me want to listen to some music but it will all sound super wonky and disharmonious if I do, and not to mention the effect can be physically painful for me when strong enough creating this odd sensation and annoying ringing in my ears, although so far this has only happened with DiPT for me. It can be fascinating and enjoyable too if you're either new to it or do the right sorts of things like just listen to nature rather than try to enjoy music when it's obviously not going to happen. The last time I took it I ended up drinking alcohol at the end to get rid of the painful ringing but after that spent the trip laughing whenever I would be thrown off by the weird voices on TV that I kept forgetting were going to happen.

Yup.


I've known others to say this about 4-HO-MiPT too especially with higher dosages though not always; I think it's a relatively normal reaction but just not the most common effect of all probably because of how the non-DiPT isopropyl tryptamines all just seem to be relatively weaker in this way, and also more obviously psychedelic in a standard way at the same time than DiPT most of the time.

Ok yeah I definitely had confused 4-ho-DiPT with plain ol’ DiPT as far as being known for auditory effects.


All the miprocin reports I noticed (I read yours as well Kaleida - nice...and are you female? I didn’t know)...all the reports that mentioned auditory distortion from miprocin seemed to be down in pitch.  Would be interesting to know what it’s interacting with to produce that. Still a 5-HT2 receptor subtype or something else? Something specific to auditory neurons?


Here’s a doodle I did during a work call today.  An attempt to capture CEVs from my 17 mg miprocin this weekend.

MiPTdala:  (like mandala)

Great experience yesterday with 23mg+~750mg phenibut faa. Spent most of the trip walking around outside. Seems really versatile. Could see it being hedonistic but the therapeutic potential was what shined through for me. Quite down to earth material. Will explore again at a higher dose.


OEVs emphasized organic forms and earthen qualities, which is exactly what I noticed with 5-MeO-MiPT in a similar scenery last year. Wrote up some notes last night on my visual experiences with 4-sub-DMT/MET's back in 2014/15 to compare them with 4-HO-MiPT, but I need to develop them further by revisiting those compounds in a scenic setting and also exploring 4-HO-MiPT further.

[@Kaleida](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/377522/) Why is the isopropyl on 4-ho-mipt locked in place but the methyl and ethyl of 4-ho-met are free to rotate?

Can’t the isopropyl do the same rotation or is there some steric hindrance or something?

The isopropyl group is definitely able to rotate, tho who knows maybe it cant make a complete rotation due to being close to the OH group.


I actually tried this somewhat recently and I really enjoyed it, much more so than 4-ho-dipt. I found it to be actually most similar to 4-ho-met, though less visual. I took it at a drum n bass concert and was able to socialize, dance hard, or relax as I chose fit. What surprised me the most was the duration. It was much longer than 4-ho-dipt, and more resembled a psilo or even a 4-ho-met. After the 6 hr show, I drove home and I was definitely not baseline even by the time I made it home.


Would repeat

Would you say there is any advantage of using 4-ho-mipt over 4-ho-Met?  If -Met is more visual is -mipt more..anything?  From my reading is seems like 4-ho-Met is more recreational and less “deep”

Tried this a couple more times and I like it quite a lot. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


A couple weeks ago I went with 22mg and then ended up redosing 18mg @T+3:30. The first couple hours were more psychedelic and although it was cold outside, I walked down to a lake and sat down during the peak. By two hours in the headspace was mostly gone, and it transitioned into a much more recreational sort of state which the redose just extended. Felt a strong urge to connect with people and I reached out to my cousin and told him that I missed him and we ended up texting back and forth the rest of the night.


On New Years eve I decided to go with 25mg but it was much slower to hit me this time, probably because I had eaten not long before dosing. I decided to redose and @T+1:30 I took 15mg more. To speed up the onset I snorted the redose, which was quite unpleasant and felt like I had sand all in my nostrils. As the redose kicked in I hopped in the shower where I realized that I felt remarkably dissociated. My body was quite numb and for a bit it almost felt like more like a dissociative than a psychedelic. I got in bed and spent the night listening to music, and the visuals and headspace became quite strong, much stronger than my prior experiences with it. This experience also lasted much longer than my previous experiences with it and I did recently start taking omeprazole (CYP inhibitor), which is the only thing I can think that might have contributed.


On this most recent experience I noticed this unique effect where a matrix of vortices would develop across my visual field, dragging whatever I was looking at (e.g. text on my computer screen) into spiral-like sinks. I actually saw hints of this on my previous experience, but it was much more prominent in the most recent one, so it seems like it might be a 4-HO-MiPT visual signature, for myself at least.


While my last experience was quite enjoyable overall, I would say it was less recreational than the previous two. Those first two trips on it were psychedelic enough for the first couple hours, and then they transitioned into a quite hedonistic state which definitely made me understand what [@Pfafffed](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/369391/) mentioned, something along the lines of "4-HO-MiPT sometimes just leaves you stoned."


I haven't really tripped on any other 4-sub-tryps since 2014/15, and the experiences I had on 4-x-MET/DMT during that time were much more disorienting, visual, and threatening to the ego than anything I've gotten from 4-HO-MiPT. I'm hesitant to say 4-HO-MiPT is less psychedelic though because my worldview has changed significantly since then, which believe probably does impact the experience. Plus those were among my first psychedelic experiences so I was probably more sensitive to the effects as well. Still, I'm quite keen to revisit those substances and see if they still will affect me as strongly. I'd also like to grab some others as well (4-x-DPT/EPT in particular), as I feel like the experiences I've had with 4-HO-MiPT and 5-MeO-MiPT over the past year or so has really begun to open my eyes to the richness of tryptamines.

I had a very intense, life-changing trip from about 30mg of 4-HO-MiPT a bit over a year ago. I ended up living other imaginary people's lives amongst other things. Really changed the way I see the world.


I found the sound alternation more annoying than DiPT, primarily because of how hard I was tripping and the fact that it only altered certain sounds instead of shifting the pitch of everything I heard like DiPT did. It took me months to be able to hear my phone ding without it sometimes sounding slightly off-pitch.


EDIT: Here is something that I wrote while coming down. I came to the conclusion that "Everyone who exists should get everything they need to continue existing."

And now I have the notebook and I have the pen. I can write my own destiny. I can love her because we both deserve to be happy and most other people aren't important enough for my life to be worth the time I spend thinking about them. And that's okay. I don't have to feel guilty about that. I don't have to justify that. It's okay to put myself first. For my existence to be about me and the people I care about. Not existing to serve other people.

4-HO-MiPT causes pitch shift just like DiPT, have you all noticed this? What's interesting I didn't have this effect on MiPT (without 4-HO). When the trip started to fade away I noticed how songs I know started to sound completely different. This was exactly the same effect I had on DiPT.

This sounds like a very atypical reaction....this is one of mine and my friends absolute favorite Tryptamines and I've probably tried at mostly oral doses around 50-60mg probably over 50 tines personally and many many more by close friends of mine and I've never experienced and sound altering effects nor has anyone else ever reported any such effect.....the only strange side effect that seems also atypical is I've noticed that a few female friends and my GF have reported urethritis from this from being reported to being incredibly uncomfortable to extremely pleasurable as it sort produced a sort of "edging orgasm" like effect.

I've heard of people experiencing this, but I don't think it's common. I know people firsthand that have taken miprocin over one hundred times without experiencing any auditory distortions.

I've experienced DiPT-like auditory distortions on both 4-HO-MiPT and MiPT, as well as 4-HO-DiPT. They are most definitely the same kind of effect, it's very easy to recognize when you're familiar with it, but they've been much weaker than DiPT in this way for me so far. Curiously, I haven't experienced them yet on 5-MeO-DiPT (or 5-MeO-MiPT, for what it's worth).

I don't know if I believe urethritis is really the cause but I've experienced this "edging orgasm" on 4-HO-MiPT too. Extremely intense and I've had it kick in as literally the first effect within like ten minutes of dosing. It's not the only psychedelic that's done that for me though, AL-LAD was the best/worst in that way, I've never taken two hits since because the stimulation was such a shock.

I've tried DiPT, 5-MeO-MiPT, and 4-HO-MiPT. I also found 5-MeO-MiPT to lack DiPT's auditory effects over multiple trips around the ~10mg oral range. 


I found 4-HO-MiPT to have similar but distinct -and far less universal- auditory effects at 30mg oral. While DiPT alters the pitch universally, 4-HO-MiPT had a far milder effect and did not seem to alter the pitch of human voices. It did significantly alter things like music and phone notification/ringing tones, but when I called my friend near the peak of the trip his voice sounded relatively normal.

That's funny, as voices were one of the main things that stood out to me on 4-HO-MiPT when I got this effect, although that was on 50 mg. The moment I instantly realized it was going on was when I walked out of my bedroom where I had been peaking in silence and my roommate was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and I immediately heard Buffy say something that came out lower pitch than normal and started laughing my ass off.


The fact that you mention phone sounds though is what really tells me you know what you're talking about. It's funny how memorable the little things like that are just because they are so unlike anything else, even other types of auditory distortions more typical to psychedelics.

It took months to be able to hear the ringing tone (when I called someone) the same after that trip. I remembered it specifically because I called up a friend (who offered to be my standby tripsitter) to talk to me and help get me out of a thought loop during the peak, and also called my gf at the time a couple times during the trip.

[@Neuroborean](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/539707/) If you ever go far enough out your brain will explain it to you itself. Try not to get too lost in what the entities say because you'll never be able to prove or disprove it. But basically we're in a simulation and part of an experiment and being punished and playing a game and the punchline in a cosmic joke and also it's all just in your head all at once. And also you're the messiah but also the antichrist and being used by everyone in the entire world but also just some regular asshole who can't get his shit together also all at once. You'll get used to it.

but in anycase, the last part, well, I would like to be in you head to be completely sure of what do you mean, but I kinda agree. Dualism is part of the cosmic joke, too many people want to surpass that while living the human life, I think that's cheating.


Entities are not beings I like, I don't think they are well-intentioned, much likely the opposite, at least some of them. Those fabergé eggs are creepy as fuck.

I wouldn't recommend simply taking them at their word but I think it's important to remember the long-recognized trickster archetype as well. Sometimes a weirdly good way to arrive at the truth is to get fed up with entertaining a lie.

I mean, you know high I've taken it but still, I know for sure I wouldn't be able to handle high doses of dpt, dmt, 5-meo-amt, etc.  So if you've handled those chems well, which I know I wouldn't be able to just based on their effects profile, miprocin just isn't that...inherently intense?

Uhmmm...

well, I need to warn you that you shouldn't "understimate" 4-ho-mipt cause it can be very very powerful and it can do things that you may not expect at all, at least it has happent that way to me.

Is not  like I had so many trips on it but every one of them was different and had a different vibe, and sometimes even a different body high (which can change your temper a lot).

I'll tell you a couple of things that happened to me.


The last one that scared me was the first time I took a psychedelic after having my first (and only) breakthrough with DMT. Maybe that had some influence as the dmt trip, while not a bad trip, did have a huge impact on me and I had some very strange and not very positive experiences afterwards. The ho-mipt trip was 4 months later. (In a proper thread I'll tell what happent to me after the dmt bt cause it's pretty complex and strange)


What happened was that in a moment of the trip something began to change in my mind, both the body high and the DMT headspace were installed, in a very strange and surprising way, at that moment I began to see a kind of black and red dome, with figures that reminded hexagons but more complex and mobile and they began to vibrate around me, so that it seemed that they wanted to surround me and put me inside the dome.

At that moment I remembered an instant of the dmt breakthrough, but pay attention to this...! it was not exactly a "memory" but it was something like an ominous feeling, of abduction to a part of the dmt trip that I did not remember until then.

You will tell me that if I didn't remember it as I know it was from then, well, they are things that one feels clearly. I don't think it was deja vu because the complexity was such and the visuals and sensations so equal to dmt that it had to be a memory of it, because I've never had a ho-mipt trip with that kind of visual.


In other words, it is as if the 4-ho-mipt had made me communicate with the space of the dmt for an instant and that space wanted me to access there, something of the breakthrough that I had forgotten. However, the feeling was ominous, dark and overwhelming, I had to make a very quick decision, put on very specific music and began to perform a kind of dance, to the sound of the music to break that feeling and the appearance of that kind of dimensional abduction . Fortunately it worked and I had a great trip.


On another occasion I was on a similar dose (+40mg) and I began to look at myself in the mirror, it came out mechanically, perhaps due to a childish impulse, to put on a "monster" face, well, shortly after doing that, not only did I change my face in the mirror (normal) but I noticed an unpleasant sensation, like having something coming out of me, on both sides and I saw black-blue wings, not pretty, coming out of me, and the worst thing was not the visual aspect in the mirror, but that I felt exactly what was seen in the mirror, that some kind of "spirit" was literally replacing or "eating" me. I had to run out of there, sit down at the piano and start playing, after a while, the feeling disappeared and a fractal visual appeared in conjunction with the music I played.


With this I do not mean that 4-ho-mipt is a dangerous substance or nightmarish (for example I do not want to try DPT and for DMT I have so much respect currently so I have not vaporized it again), what I mean is that it has a real entheogenic potential, and you can "take surprises"that may not always be positive. In any case I've never had a "bad trip" with ho-mipt but I've never really had a total "bad trip" with any substance, just nightmarish or overwhelming moments.

I've taken many many high doses of psychedelics and 4-ho-mipt is one of my absolute favorites... I've also studied and practiced with many extremely divergent occult groups over the decades and I've purposefully attempted contact with many entities that most would consider pure evil.

I've also had quite a few "bad trips" prior to exploring The Left Hand Path in the occult world. Navigating through these bad trips in my youth helped me to understand that all these things you experience in a trip is arguably simply yourself viewing aspects of yourself that you've repressed or did not know were within you to begin with.

Many , many , many people people speak of goal of attaining true balance but do not understand what "true balance" actually requires which is "being able to stand with one foot in the light and the other in the darkness".

This is the time to realky reflect on what you experienced on such a profound trip and try to understand what was trying to be conveyed to you .

Psychedelics tend to cause areas of your brain or at least conciousness to communicate with each other thst otherwise cannot by shutting down barriers within the mind.

I feel it's important at least for myself to view seemingly external entities as very likely aspects of yourself and be ever vigilant in your inner skeptic.

The human mind is very capable of experiencing sensations that feel.very much like real reality under specific conditions.

Even physics do not actually describe the real world ...but how we're able to perceive and experience the real world.

Also, I'm very curious what dose of 4-ho-mipt you took???

When I dose high I dose around 40 or more, sometimes close to 60, 50-55mg. 

I'm sure that it has some "individual reflections" aspects (or dimensions) of this fact, I mean, pretty sure. My inner skeptic doesn't lead me to a definite conclusion of what the heck that is, I mean, I think by myself that those events could be "just my mind" but my inner skeptic also tells me, "and it could be also something else". I think just for the fact that we were born in a materialistic world then we tend to think more about ego-ego-ego stuff, even if that ego has different screens and higher selfs and all that, but in anycase, I don't close my conclusion on that. Working on that could be interesting and possibly fruitful but it can also be risky in a way I wouldn't like. I mean, at the end of the day you ask yourself in every act "who I would like to be?" what I want of myself? 

How you understand that "balance"? because I guess you should have a proper definition if you have a proper guide for reaching it.

What was eventually the point of trying to contact those entities?

I'm actually pretty impressed thst dosing around 50mg caused such a profound experience but everyone is quite different when it comes to dosing drugs.

I believe there were pressed green tablets of these made by famous Dutch lab that were 20mg each and I'd usually take 3 which was a deep trip but I've never experienced a breakthrough experience on a substituted tryptamine. Only vaping DMT or DPT (which I feel is actually MUCH more spiritual in nature than even DMT) or more so with holing from dissociatives.

My reasoning for purposefully attempting contact with such entities or forces was for several reasons....some were requirements for attaining specific grades in certain occult orders. Some were for training and practicing visualization and pathworking. Some were through simply trying to meditate and randomly seeing and experiencing extremely disturbing and negative images and beings.

Some were an attempt to understand the nature and importance of real world actual evil.

Certainly,  this is a dangerous path that not everyone survives or even makes it through with their sanity...which is where the inner skeptic cones into play.

As Mr Crowley once stated :


> In this book it is spoken of the Sephiroth and the Paths; of Spirits and Conjurations; of Gods, Spheres, Planes, and many other things which may or may not exist. It is immaterial whether these exist or not. By doing certain things certain results will follow; students are most earnestly warned against attributing objective reality or philosophic validity to any of them.

For me balance is being able to understand the world from multiple viewpoints and specifically attempting to understand the things in life that seem so inherently un-understandable like why evil exists and why it's so vitally neccessary for everything else to work ans most importantly to never stray to far towards the fringes of any belief system.

Remember we would have no word or understanding of the daylight until we experienced the first nightfall or shadow.

All things that have an opposite are defined by its opposite and depends upon it for mutual survival.

Couldn't reply till now, been in a move to an island, so it was quite busy..


I normally don't get so strong effects from tryptamines, I'm very sensitive to lysergamides so I normally don't take them (never tried a high dose of lsd, I kinda did with hbwr which I consider much more spiritual and entheogenic). I consider myself a hard-head for tryptamines but perhaps I'm not compared to other people, I don't usually have strong visuals but sometimes something changes in me, I think I'm easily self-suggestable so to speak. 

Maybe what I saw was not 100% that, so other person would have interpreted in a different way, not sure, I'm pretty sure about the feelings, so I think that communicates more than the visuals itself, most times.


I understand what you say about the dualistic principles of the world, I mostly consider the world as some kind of theater on which dualistic principles are the 75% of what's going on but is quite likely that, at the end of it, there's some higher principle that eliminates that dualistic "fight". The thing is that I don't agree with indian mystics (advaita vedanta and so on, even with buddhism) that we should AIM for escaping dualism, finding oneness with the non-dualistic force that soak evertything.

 I mean, I know that's for sure good for a lot of reasons, but I consider that it's actually some deep ego trick to avoid the real nature of being human, which is so deeply engrained in dualistic principles. Is probably good to remember and experience, from time to time, that you can participate and you are that non-dualistic nature AS WELL AS being part of the dualistic world, but not like.. avoiding fully living our entire nature, which in a way I think those "yogis" want, just for the same (IMO) weak reason: to not suffer. 

I don't think the central aim of  being human should be to find the way to not suffering anymore.  Surely is great to find that but, to focus all your spiritual work for that? come on... maybe is because I don't get it. I would "buy" whatever else.


About your experiences with entities and the occult: 

I wasn't sure if taking psychedelics from time to time was or wasn't playing with the occult, right now I have less doubts, I think it has a big part of it and it's something that, actually, I'm not very proud of. It's not that I regret it or consider it to have been in error either, I still see a lot of positive and constructive things, that I feel a kinship with, with psychedelics. What is the problem? Well, the first time I had a breakthrough with dmt I came to a place that I didn't feel "safe", rather it felt like a place where I was NOT invited and where I had absolutely no control, rather I felt that incredible forces were surrounding me and that I was a complete sucker under their control.


the truth is that the experience was incredible (I consumed maybe too much because in a momentary madness I took a spoon and poured in the dab a good amount, possibly more than 60mg when I had already vaporized another 50 before in the first toke)... I left there not believing what had happened, it seemed so beautiful and surprising as impossible. Still I felt at some point that those "beings" wanted something from me and I refused, at one point they gave me a "hyperspace kick" and took me out of hyperspace for a few seconds, giving me a communication: your life sucks and you are doing it very wrong. It honestly seemed like an attack to me, a kind of revenge for not playing their game. Then I came back and the trip was mind-blowing.


The problem was not during the trip, but the following weeks and months where during dreams, usually in periods of stress or a few days after taking some psychedelic or empathogen, I suffered (and still suffer) psychic attacks of entities, sometimes together with sleep paralysis, but not always. 

These attacks have been of various types, feeling that a dark, deadly energy is getting into my heart, feeling that I am being electrified (with a very real pain) and getting up shaking and with twitching muscles, feeling that a vortex similar to dmt but dark tries to swallow me, feeling that there are entities freezing me in my sleep and noticing that my astral body moves but not my body....


Anyway, this kind of experiences have convinced me that I should be very careful with psychedelics in high doses and that they have a lot to do with the occult.

While I have always felt an intellectual and somewhat spiritual curiosity towards the occult, today I find it quite worrying, given who are the major players in this field, the elites, and also given that these same elites tend to take their rituals and their "magick" too far in a way that I find completely repulsive. I understand that "from the inside" it is clearer the nature of this evil, but I would say that this evil can play with you or with me, so that you could end up being a pawn of such beings (the entities or the elites). 

Probably those elites (some of them very into the O.T.O. afaik) are actually pawns of the dark entities, and not the other way around. Imagine you or me, the amount of real "control" we can have over something like that... (I understand that you will consider that more than not learning about it, but ok).

For things like that I prefer to be away from that world

Well put about the asian religions! They get a lot right that we have missed out on in the christian world, but their focus on "enlightenment" as a goal rather than a means to an end is a weakness and a characteristic pitfall of that mode of thinking. Westernerns and the world in general should strive for nurturing the eastern acknowledgement of spirituality and existential awe without the apotheosis of abstraction. Buddhism in particular still has a lot to teach since it is an expert discipline in the spiritual realm, much like one can learn a craft from a master without necessarily aspiring to master that same craft. People have different ideas of the highest goal, but can still benefit from each other. One may be in the position to be right about the overall goal, witholding it from someone in plainsight, exploiting his narrow-minded expertise in a sub-discipline he perhaps fatally considers paramount, and ultimately enjoy a beneficial exchange. Here again is the world as a theater, a play, a game. Deception and competition collaborate with peaceful rule-bound conduct to form progress or unfolding.


(I hope i'm not subconsciously quoting Alan Watts or something, fuck my ass)

I really don't know more than the surface of them, I still want to study them, as well as so many other things. I think is not fair to put aside the fact that the idea of karma and (in India) social castes are into that kind of thought. For me the facts, the real efforts is what makes alive something. If you are enlightened and you stay there in your cave or wherever, just waiting for followers to show them your path or them to buy your book... what kind of enlightment is that? Is kinda ironic that normally they talk about being one with God and so on, some kind of "the ego doesn't exists", then they try to keep away "desires" and "attachment" so then, everything  changes but only thing that remains is the God-like consciousness.. Otherwise you'll be affected by the ohhh so bad...*suffering.*..! Maybe I'm exaggerating, but it's not far from being real, at least in a lot of western followers of those paths.


and then? for me that's just another way of avoiding being real, some kind of immanent transcendence instead of the typical otherworld promise of external transcendence. At least with the external transcendence normally is a way of *doing* to reach there. There's a way of looking at that and it's saying that's basically just being a slave of whoever ideas/morals but I don think that both in indianndmonotheistic cultures agree that the morals are not something that are told by anyone, primarily, but are more like finding our true nature, so you can reach naturally, by the intelect, to the same good behaviours as those that just simply obey, or at least it should be equal, like a natural law. I think that is kinda ironic that if enlightment were real, those who get there would prefer to stay quiet and basically do the less the better.. I find it intriguing, or just that: just another form of escapism, through "absolute consciousness".


Having said that, I believe that both worlds can and should take advantage of and learn from each other and that they can offer teachings of a spiritual nature that are mostly complementary. In any case, I see many very "enlightened" people who avoid a conflict at the minimum, or behave in a childish way when something is beyond their "expectation" or who, after taking a course on x, start another course as soon as they can about something even more "illuminating". For the record, I am not making fun of these people, each one has their own way of growing up in the world and its rhythms, presumably we all live in a form of self-deception, at one level or another, but well, the marketing of the spirit is one of the most painful to see.

It's a misunderstanding that psychedelics have to do with the occult...they are just both ultimately techniques that lead to the opening of portals with consciousness. 

They are both just tools and are neutral until it's used in a helpful or malicious manner at the direction of someone's will.

It's your belief in everything thst makes everything happen and 99% of everything within the occult is just an elaborate rouse to make you believe in a specific reality with fervor and faith.

Ceremonial Magick is just an elaborate ritual DRAMA .all the impressive robes and magickal implements and temple set up and shouting of incorrect Hebrew at the wall is meant to impress you and belive in it because there is very much a social expectation that whsts happening is real by all of the participants.

I used to be close to some people in Ordo Templi Orientis and have studied Thelema and much Crowley's A:.A:. System and I personally don't think tye OTO is a malicious order....and I've sought out groups thst I felt could potentially kill me or expect me to kill others or pursue similar acts of extreme danger (none if tgst ever happened thankfully) but a lot of what happens in the occult world is simply meant to test you and de-program you and re-program you unless you can see through whsts actually happening in which case you'll be either promoted or kicked out of the order.

I've felt I've learned all I could from tye right and left hand path abd follow my own now with a very deep understanding the world and why everything is the way it is and this I would consider at least a form of real enlightenment.

There are so many forms of Buddhism and nearly all if them recognize that the DESIRE to reach enlightened is in itself driven from the ego.

It's very common in eastern religions to be told once you've reached a certain grade of understanding that "everything we taught you up to this point is bullshit and is simply meant to bring into a state of understanding where you can now face the truth...and then it repeats over and over again util you finally can see that it's all bullshit. All of it.

It's your belief that is the fuel.

I really like Zazen Soto Zen Buddhism becsuse it reveals this to you at the beginning.

It's entirely focused on real world practices and not in desire just doing for the sake of doing it and what results follow are secondary. 

This has been  my entire approach to studying all of this stuff throughout my life to test them and myself without every giving into anything.

Many many spirtual experiences need to be uncomfortable or even terrifying inmho . Its mistake to think that enlightenment doesn't require incredibly difficult and even painful experiences.  

The idea is use those experiences to understand tye deeper nature of yourself and others and the forces that push this world in every direction.

I wonder what night have happened if instead of showing fear to those entities you banished your fear and showed a degree of Dominion over them...possibly they might have treated you differently or maybe they were trying to tell you that you in fact were living your life wrong and needed a spiritual kick in the butt...we all do from time to time.

yep, I like that too, but finally I think everything is so "culturally driven" cause, in a way, I think that "stance" regarding enlightment is more like a stance regarding life, that is very asiatic, (and I appreciate that of them, because it brings some specific type of discipline). It reminds me that "chop wood, carry water" saying about enlightment.

Of course, that's the thing about it, I know that those "demons" or whatever the heck that torture me from time to time in dreams (today I had a sleep paralysis but it was "normal") are also there to teach me and to make me more conscient, probably the same goes with the DMT dome and all that beings there. One just measure where it's going and how far one want to go in. In my case, I do indulge in dreams cause is what is what fascinates me the most.


 However, knowing that I might play things like divination and things like that, I'd rather not touch those things. For me, lucid dreams are in general a sufficiently fascinating and mysterious world, mainly because I do not share the idea of psychologists/psychoanalysts about the subconscious, I do not even fully share the Jungian idea of the collective subconscious, although it seems more interesting to me.

You talk about "Dominion" but feeling and instant electroshock that engulfs you brutally is completely incapacitating, to the point of feeling **only **that, let alone thinking about trying to fight back, which of course I would have tried, I am not usually afraid of what hurts me, rather I feel anger or rage, which are not very positive emotions either, there is always talk of "vibrating high" but when they are electrocuting you or similar, the last thing that comes out of my soul is love or compassion.


About the Drama and so on, Nietzsche elaborates this in an interesting way when he talks about fantasy, the poetic/metaphorical role of the mind and senses and the dyonisiac rites. Is probably not very different than that, but finally whatever kind of "realness" it has, I still think those realities are more than egregores, but that's just my opinion/intuition. Don't know man, not sure about the real character of O.T.O., probably it depends a lot on personal perspectives as well as who do you find in your path, maybe the ones at the top are not how you would imagine, nor how I imagine them to be. Are you talking maybe of some crazy people of the ONA, perhaps? those seem completely nuts, but I'm sure there's some unknown groups that are much worse..

Gotta sleep now. ; )

One of my absolute favorite Philosopher's is Robert Anton Wilson and he was very close the the then head of O:.T:.O:.

Grady McMurty and RAW I doubt strongly would have associated with anyone even remotely sinister.

The danger from occult imho besides real physical dangers of putting youself in situations that groups like O9A would have you do also arise from simply harshly questioning your own deeply cherished world views and past traumas and phobias.

Crowley arguably finally went completely nuts attempting to summon his Holy Guardian Angel while utilizing the right hand path G:.D:. System.

In my personal experience a lot of what the public thinks goes on does not truthfully reflect what actually occurs unless in extreme circumstances within groups thst I've dealt with connected to O9A .

Alot of their infamy is propaganda and they love that other occult groups even other left hand path groups fear them and they use that to their advantage....they want the type of people who would still approach them knowing they may very well suffer mortally for doing so....those types of people are extremely rare. Especially today.

And yes, certainly they are many more even more seemingly psychotic occult groups out there than even T:.O:.B:.

For me....I needed to test my limits to know who I truly am and just who I think I am.

All of this is to KNOW THYSELF.

And after all of this I can say with much certainty that I am NOT a sinister or truly evil person exactly because where my real limits are and like you said...at the end of the day we must ask ourselves why are we here abd what are we really doing?

Evil will always exist because it's weaved into the fabric of our world and is absolutely essential for other neccessary things to function. It is one of the most powerful forces driving all of evolution.

But do we as humans need to add to this natural force? Only very rarely and in exceedingly rare and specific circumstances.

These days I'm far more interested in quantum mechanics and being as compassionate as possible.

This is what learning about the nature of real evil has led me to.

I cannot say most would end up where I have.

I understand what you're saying. Buddhism certainly has its own awareness of that irony of the desire to be free from desire. However, they still have a respected social class and spiritual function that is to renounce all worldly pursuits for the spiritual, or the abstract, or the liberation from desire. I think we have the opportunity to consider this behavior an error, even if buddhism itself has some kind of recognition of the same problem to a degree.

About the entity encounters and spiritual shock sensations, i think they are often reminders of our potential and the distance between that potential and our current identity/situation. This can be very painful, very meaningful, very real throughout the whole body. I have had it occur mostly in nightmares. I have had extremely deep, lifelike and horrifying encounters, but i still can't find a reason to believe in these entities as actual real beings beyond the dark machinations of my own psyche.


Psychedelics allow us to deal with all that in a controlled, purposeful, steady manner if we want. Or opening the floodgates completely, at the risk of a living nightmare. That nightmare can also be brought under control, or Dominion like mr Trippington said. Or perhaps rather, one can learn to face it and stand up to it and come out stronger.

I don't really know if you're getting how real it was, I think there's absolutely no point of feeling really electrocuted, not like imagining being electrocuted, but feeling that I was going to die within those encounters and not only that, but having muscle twitches for more than 15 minutes after any of those experiences, and electric feelings after 5 minutes after waking up.

How can you jump off that reality to the mental paradigm of "distance between a potential and current identity"? I mean, I don't see any  proper relation there, honestly, it's too abstract and I was feeling well during those times, with myself.

 I know that this has happened to me during very specific times that I reckon nowadays as being moments on which my spiritual barrier or astral body, weakens, for several reasons, it's in fact quite easy to see that those events are not exactly brought up by purely personal or spiritual unbalances but something related with the body-soul connection. If you got weak physically you are more prone to infections that are physical parasites, if your astral body got weaker due to substances, stress or lack of sleep, you're more prone to spiritual parasites attacks. That's a simple hypothesis that I'm quite sure about nowadays, I know a lot of people don't like/buy this hypothesis but I'm quite sure about it, as an experience.  Surely there's different types of hypothesis for that but for me that's what makes more sense, it wouldn't do in the past for me, since I didn't believe in such things, I do now.

I understand that your experience may have been so strong that it was not possible to dismiss or handle as a "reminder of the distance" or anything rationally beneficial or insightful beyond excruciating pain. It was overbearingly real, i get this. And i also respect your idea about the astral plane. However, i maintain my belief that despite being so overwhelming and sometimes seemingly unconnected to personal mental health, these experience are still best interpreted in the way i have arrived at. I mean, i don't think what you're saying logically excludes my explanation.


Anyway, thanks for sharing. It is a very interesting topic.


These horrifying experience are an expression of strength in you, i want to say.

I'm not denying your points in any way, in general, I'm just saying that I think there's some specific event, so to speak, that was my dmt breakthrough which has weakened my "astral barrier" or whatever technical esoteric name you want to call it, and since then I must be very careful with my body, in order not to be attacked or affected by those "things", whatever it is.

I DON'T feel worse in terms of mental health, I used and abused substances much much worse than nowadays, including cathinones and shit like that, more than 2 years ago, I've been as stressed out as nowadays, and probably much worse, during those cathinone times for example. 

but... it didn't happen then, it happens now. I consider that it has something to do with my current stance on religion and spirituality, if you're directed to nowhere or to a bad place those beings won't bother you, you're doing exactly how they want you to do. If you're directing yourself to somewhere but you have opened the gates to their influence, then things can change. That's how I agree with the "strenght" phrase of yours.

It is fascinating the way we align despite contradictory theories.


To me what you're saying can be explained in my "secular" framework: It is hard and painful to really pay attention to one's own development rather than succumbing to whatever easy role life and our social context may throw at us. It is work, and it takes effort. A deep effort, a lonely pursuit, completely exposed to existential faith. The pain could come from that, just like it could come from external entities.

I don't know if you know this Wittgenstein quote:

Another constant in his work, I believe, is Wittgenstein’s conception of God. As he states in the *Tractatus*, **God does not reveal himself in the world **– that is to say He does not exist in it – and this idea is not revoked.


The author in the article (IMO) doesn't really get what Wittgenstein says here. The real meaning of this is: whatever happens in the world can be "explained" by science in one way or another,

for example: if there's some kind of demon invocation or something like that, and it can be replicated in one way or another, it could be described as a natural event, then it's not super-natural, *nothing is super-natural as it happens in the world and can be described.* That's the actual fact, but then, science doesn't explain existence itself, and it cannot, because *science doesn't explain anything, it only describes*. So God or the supernatural is always beyond science because it's focus is not about something that can be described, but felt. Science is the way of looking with  accuracy to control the events. The type of "explanation" that seeks in the supernatural is not a description of the natural, even if everything were "explained" by science, the religious mystery would still exist, as Wittgenstein also talks about in the Tractatus.

by the way, I used 4-ho-mipt again with a friend who seemed to desperately needed it... she was quite desperate since her mother died months ago,

I knew it wasn't a perfect moment to ingest 30mg of 4-ho-mipt but I couldn't leave her alone..

so I joined her!


It was an amazing trip, in an incredible landscape, a black volcanic  beach close to a red volcano (not exaggerating at all, you can google montaña bermeja (lanzarote))

I will do a post with details to sum up my impressions with 4-ho-mipt since I think it has some very specific traits that are not very well known or at least, not commented enough

The trip was super visual at the end of the trip, after more than 2.5 hours, which is a bit weird, but I think one of the traits of 4-ho-mipt is that is SUPER set/setting dependent, that's why is very organic, compared to the "forced" or synthetic display of ho-met...

For me 4-ho-mipt is like a mixture of worlds, it wants to create a catharsis, but not on one side, but mixing the two sides of the coin, the fake dualisms, it's pretty awesome when it works,

it also make you feel things you don't want to, well, all psychedelics do that but my experience tells me that ho-mipt does that a lot, in a very sudden and brutal way, but always "knowing" where your limits are.

Is becoming more and more my favourite substance.


Edit: a funny thing during the trip is that it again reminded me DMT for a moment and then I thought for myself (and told my friend): "Wow.. I don't know how the heck I thought more than once about having another DMT breakthrough experience.. now that I remember that, I don't want to at all!!"

it's kinda the ho-mipt putting me into headspace of being able to remember the extreme psychedelic experience that the breakthrough was, and it reminds me eerie and creepy things, a dark power I don't feel like living again.

This quite honestly sounds like my ideal entheogenic experience...

This is what I'm aiming for when I want a truly spiritual experience....I personally feel that experiencing entity or force of such alien magnitude should be terrifying on some level.

Consider what Bible accurate descriptions of Angels are actually described....they aren't angelic white people with blond hair and beautiful white wings whatsoever...

I feel any sort of beings or seemigly supernatural forces that could possibly exist outside of our normal perceptions would and should seem so otherworldly that terror something you might expect to experience on at least some level.

Most of my greatest entheogenic experiences have been very much in line with this.

DMT breakthrough, maybe my english is not the best...

yes, it was pretty eeire and creepy, not a thing a want to live again, but I mostly remember it as it really was during a psychedelic headspace moment, not during normal life, then I don't really remember it properly. 

I don't know if it makes sense to you, but that's what happens.

This is why I stopped 4-ho-mipt.   The experience seemed too dark and eerie, at least a couple or few times.    


I prefer better headspace.   Not saying it'll effect you like this.   Could possibly be my DNA and this doesn't mesh as well as some can.

Just tried 4 ho mipt for the first time. No tolerance (I took 2fdck last night, no cross tolerance stuff there Right?). I took a 20mg LL pill, recently purchased.  After 2 hours I was a bit disappointed by the weakness of the trip and I retook 10mg, knowing that it probably wouldn’t work at that point.  The whole thing was insanely erotic, the details of which I’ll spare you but basically 4 hours of sex alone and then with my (sober) gal.  I think it skewed that way because I was particularly horny to begin with. At the peak I was overcome with similar sensations I get from 4-x-met, sorts of waves of euphoria.  someone in this thread said it feels rolly like mdma, and I see what they mean, even if it isn’t at all the same.  I had some nice audio hallucinations, again like 4 x met, where I imagine crazy music that sounds very real, as well as had audio distortion.  I had disappointingly few oev/cevs.  4.5 hours in I was pretty much sober.


Overall I had the best drug night in a while (last night playing music in a party on 2fdck was good to, I’ll admit). However I think the drug itself wasn’t ideal at this dosage, or it’s underdosed. Or maybe it’s because I was underslept? I have some powder 4 aco mipt so I will be able to properly dose at some point and compare it dosage wise.

I had a similar experience last week... Recently purchased a 20mg LL pill, I took it on an empty stomach. It hit me FAST and the come up was pretty visual. I thought the visuals would only get better. So, feeling pretty lucid, I was about to go for a walk in the forest. However, when I went outside, the visuals became very subtle/were almost completely gone, not even 2 hours after ingestion. (At this point I added a bunch of weed and had an enjoyable, mildly psychedelic evening - music was especially immersive)


A few months ago I took a little over half of a 20mg 4HO-MET pill, which had wayy stronger effects for me, parts of the world still swirling like 4.5 hours later. So I was a little disappointed with my first 4HO-MIPT experience. Better to weigh it out myself next time.

I much prefer 4-ho-mipt to met, but it been a while. getting 100mg of mipt and a g of dmt. Went through last of dmt cartridge

the other day when i took 150mg mda and some 3/ho-pcp. I fucking love dmt. My cat looked like it was a changing tapestry and my girlfriend came through the room and sorts of looked like a 2-d cutout out from a pop up  picture. I remember i couldn't stop hugging my girl and laughing as it wore off. Can't wait for Mipt and Dmt Yee!

What do you guys prefer mixing miprocin with? Its short timespan has led me to dose it alongside DOM so that as the miprocin fades, the DOM really starts to kick in. I've yet to mix it with LSD but I'm looking forward to the experience.


Mushrooms are nice but 4-AcO-DMT made me feel like I'd taken cursed ayahuasca for some reason. Has anybody ever mixed the two? (The two meaning Psilacetin and Miprocin).

took around 26 mg of this the other night, what a nice substance. The thing it reminded most of was Mipla. Very erotic and not much in way of visuals, but still psychedelic, in a hard to explain way.  I have weighed out quite a few dmt doses and 5-meo-dmt and thought this stuff was much heavier, like i was like no way that is 25 mg, i re weighed it, and even used to counter weight thing. That's why you never eyeball these mg doses

Anyway I liked it much more than 4-ho-met, which had more visuals but was nothing special. There are so many tryptamines I want to try, I plan to grab some Mipt and 4-aco-mipt for the stash too.

I have 4-ho-mipt fumarate,

how much should I dose?

Is the dosage on psychonautwikia for hcl or can I follow it?

It's not clear on the wiki what the salt is or if its even freebase. Regardless, the fumarate should be less potent than the HCL. I have the fumarate and I like 20mg level personally. But it was quite strong at that level. Also for the folks saying it has a short duration? I felt it for 8 hours easily.

thanks for the answer!

I have read about people claiming to have tripped for around 20 hours on this substance(!!!) the difference in effects and duration that I read online is mindblowing thats why I came here to ask, perhaps the dose and route of administration greatly affect the perceived effects... ![🤔](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f914.png)

I'm thinking about using somewhere between 20-30mg, do you think its ok for the first time? i'm somewhat experienced with psychedelics, starting now with rcs...

I always err on the side of caution when trying a brand new psychedelic, especially with ones that have such a diverse range of effects.

Twenty hours?!!  I don't think I've read any reports like that.  That's wild!  For me this one is fast.  I experience it to be shorter than mushrooms.  I don't recall specifically how long it lasted, but I think it was around 3-5 hours as opposed to the 4-6 or so for mushrooms.  It seems to lose its peak strength a lot sooner than mushrooms but then effect linger at a low level for a good while after the drop.


I tend to be very conservative in my starting dose recommendations because I've seen highly experienced trippers get overwhelmed on a first trip with a substance they were unfamiliar with.  There was a guy I knew who took 12 mg 2C-E to as a first time dose by my advice, even though he requested a strong experience.  For a typical tripper, 12 mg would be pretty moderate, while many hard-heads would not feel much from it at all.  Well he got completely smashed and completely regretted starting that high.  He later came to appreciate 2C-E at a "powerful but controllable" dose of 8 mg.  After witnessing that, I recommend only 8 mg 2C-E to first timers, or 10 mg if highly experienced.


So with this in mind, I think 12 mg 4-HO-MiPT fumerate is probably a good first dose for a highly experienced tripper.  It will probably be modest or even weak, but that might be better than being overwhelmed for 20 hours (?) if one turns out to be highly sensitive.  For its cousin 4-Aco-MiPT, I'd suggest 14 mg as a good starting point for experienced trippers.  That's what I did my first time, and even though it was somewhat modest in intensity, it was actually a beautiful trip, hinting at Shulgin (++++) in some ways.  Also, 4-Aco-MiPT for me seems even faster than 4-HO-MiPT.  On that trip, I experienced significant body energy and psychedelic tremor after only 5 minutes, and by 20 minutes, I was fully tripping.  Sadly, considering the breathtaking beauty of the trip, it dropped rapidly after the first 90 minutes, and I felt mostly down already only two after after taking it.

How would you compare 20mg of 4-HO-MiPT with 20mg of 4-HO-MET?


20mg of 4-HO-MET didn’t do that much for me….

Maybe equipotent? That said, I've pushed 4-***AcO***-MET to 40mg, but have never felt I needed to push 4-HO-MiPT much past 20mg. I think that's more about the character than the potency, though.

Curious….


20mg of 4-HO-MET felt little more potent than 20mg of 4-HO-MiPT to me…slightly. But it didn’t do much for me,  ext time I’ll try 30mg 4-HO-MiPT

I haven't read through the entire thread yet so apologies if this has been discussed before, but does anyone experience pitch shifting effects from Miprocin? I've never taken DiPT but it's exactly like people describe those effects. Everything gets pitched down at least a whole step. I actually find it somewhat annoying because the first 2-3 times I took Miprocin I don't experience it, and it just felt like very euphoric mushroom trips for the most part.

The only other time I've heard anyone mention this was in a Hamilton Morris podcast where he talks to an austrian PCE chemist, who, I think, experienced this with straight MiPT, not 4-HO-MiPT, but I'm not sure which he said it was.

Interestingly, it happened only after I IV'd Miprocin for the first time and now it happens every time, and also persits way longer than the trip lasts, like well into the following morning.

Yep, I’ve gotten this from both 4-HO-MiPT and MiPT. In neither case is it anywhere near as strong as in DiPT, but it’s definitely the same kind of distortions. I sympathize with you because while it’s an intriguing novelty and even objectively quite interesting, it’s the main thing I don’t like about DiPT when it comes to actually using it as a psychedelic trip. The effect actually makes my ears hurt and causes an annoying ringing alongside other audio distortions even at not too extreme levels of effect. Luckily though it doesn’t just readily recur for me on the MiPTs, I’ve only had it once on each both with a higher dosage.


How long has it been since the first time? Maybe it can become sensitized? If it hasn’t been long I’d try some time off.

It's been about 6 months since I first took 4-ho-mipt. I haven't used it much in that time qnd the first time I experienced the pitch shifting phenomena was just a week ago. It was only a threshold dose IV'd just to see what it's like and how I'd handle it. A day after I took an oral dose of about 20mg give or take a few mg. And that's when I noticed it. At first I wasn't even sure but song after song it became more clear. I took it twice since then, which is admittedly a bit much and a bit premature to say anything happens every time.

I had just IV'd 25mg again and while the audio distortions are still present, this time they seem to fluctuate more in a wave like fashion but it definitely doesn't go away. Very odd. Never had anything like that happen on a trip. And if DiPT is even more intense than MiPT or Miprocin in regards to the auditory distortions then I have no interest in ever trying it. I'm glad enough I finally get some minor visuals again after years of somehow barely getting any visuals.

I absolutely adore 4-HO-MiPT.


I take it a couple of times a year. Most recently I took 30 mg (fumarate, dissolved in water, at 85kg on an empty stomach) and after an unusually fast (~10-15-minute) onset with a splash of nervousness, I settled into a warm, erotic and gently energetic space in which music sounded incredible (dj'd live through speakers in a four-channel setup at a small improvised outdoor gathering with a fire) and I felt compelled to dance. CEVs were dark, consisting of worms with sharp teeth, twisted vines, and mysterious nooks and crannies in a caved landscape. Gorgeous, and wholly non-threatening in the context of the fuzzy, relaxed body feels and eroticism. Some of this imaginarium was likely coaxed out by the dark ambient music playing, with its smattering of croaks and gargles and slithering synths, but I do find this substance to have a dark edge, which I personally find interesting---it has a depth to it that I haven't found with 4-sub MET or DET but also a warmer feel than the similarly deep 4-AcO-DMT. I feel completely socially relaxed and chatty with it, much more than on LSD or phenethylamines.


The whole experience is over in a hurry (for me; I see that others such as Didgital have much longer trips with it), which is a shame, and I am typically close to baseline after only a couple of hours. Since the come-up is so fast and somewhat anxiogenic because of its abruptness, I'm wondering if I might kill two birds with one stone by staggering doses over the course of the first 45 minutes to hour to reach a higher total dose and hopefully extend the experience while smoothening out the come-up and maintaining a similar peak level. To be experimented with.


I usually have a beautiful afterglow the next day.


All in all, just lovely stuff---probably my favourite tryptamine, and indeed drug full stop given that tryptamines are my favourite class (OK, it's tied with MDMA).

That sounds like an absolutely amazing experience. I'm happy to hear that you had good time ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) It does have a damn near perfect blend of depth, humor and pleasantness for a psychedelic. I will use psychedelics to ease my depression when I feel like. If I've been in a fairly mild depression for a while and know that I'd benefit from a psychedelic hitting the ole serotonin receptors, I'll typically reach for something less abrasive, such as 4-HO-MET or 2C-B. Something that'll break up the mundane of the day to day but most likely won't be leading to deep and difficult introspection. If I've been deeply depressed, especially if suicidal ideation is involved; then I'm more likely to reach for something that will lead to a more turbulent and introspective headspace such as 4-HO-MIPT or Mushrooms. The depression leads to a desperation and feeling of necessity that makes the anxiety of knowing that I'll like be experiencing some challenging moments in the coming hours much easier to confront. That is whats so great and beautiful about those psychedelics. It's also why they work so damn well for depression. They completely challenge my regular way of thinking and my regular way of thinking is what leads me to being depressed. 4-ACO-DMT scares me a little bit. It's got a seriousness ingrained into it's character. I've had worthwhile experiences with it before in the past but the bulk of my experiences with it were when I was in my late teens. The last couple of times that I've consumed it, it has been well into the peak of a 4-HO-MIPT experience. Just 6mg or so of 4-ACO-DMT used to extend the duration has both times instantly changed the character of the trip. The happy, almost carefree but still deep headspace of the Miprocin is taken over to the more serious and almost dark character of the 4-ACO-DMT.


4-HO-MIPT produces the same come up anxiety for me. Every single time I get that "Oh shit, what did I do to myself?" feeling but luckily it ends as quickly as it arrives. It always surprises me how a psychedelic that causes that sort of anxiety rolls into one of the most joyous and happy to be in the moment experiences. I've never once had a bad time with it. I don't think I've ever pushed the dose over 18mg as even 14mg gets me to a +++. I'll have to try a higher dose sometime


My friend one time bought these pressed pills that were a mix of 4-HO-MIPT and MDMA. I wish I remembered the dosages because when those kicked in I felt some of the best that I have ever felt. Pure, unadulterated joy.


I think if I had to choose I'd say that 4-HO-MIPT is my favorite tryptamine as well. I have been taking a liking to 4-HO-MET more and more for its gentle headspace and basically no anxiety. Its definitely the psychedelic that I've been using the most often as of late. 4-HO-MIPT is a much richer experience I'd say.

I've pushed it up towards 50-60mg before, and it never gained any "serious" or profound feelings and maintained miprocin's typical joviality. Pushing psilacetin above 30mg turns me into a fucking savage though, an unexaggerated "I would eat a home intruder right now" type of savage. Mip has this positive atmosphere about it that's super unique among drugs in general in my experience, though I'm also dying to hear about how the 150mg experience was.


I have mixed 40mg of miprocin, 25mg of DOM, 25mg of 2C-B (all railed as one huge line of "party powder"), and an unknown though enormous amount of smoked 3-MeO-PCP dippers once, and it was one of the most intense and profound experiences of my life. If you want a trip report written up on it just lmk and I'll get one posted over in the TR forum.

I've never taken DiPT but it's exactly like people describe those effects. Everything gets pitched down at least a whole step. I actually find it somewhat annoying because the first 2-3 times I took Miprocin I don't experience it, and it just felt like very euphoric mushroom trips for the most part.

I've never IV'd mip but I've used it a ton of times, as well as N.N-DiPT. I didn't experience, any severe pitch shifting on N.N-DiPT outside of a slight introduction of what I would describe as a former professional audio engineer as an excitement of overtones that did not follow the harmonic series, yet maintained a somewhat "metallic" quality that reminded me of having maybe an effects send at maybe 5-10% wetness through an old school Boss MT-2 distortion pedal. This was a technique I used to use to get a terrible sounding metallicly distorted version of a sound that I could then bandpass filter specific ranges out of to send back to the main mix.


Mip however felt a lot more like using a formant shifter, it reminded me heavily of the VST plug-in LittleAlterBoy by SoundToys. If I had this on 5-10% wetness with both the formant all the way up but the pitch only 20-40% up, it creates this uniquely distorted sort of "Alvin & The Chipmunks" sounding effect.


It also took 5-10 trips initially with mip before any audio effects were noticeable, though they started once I mixed it with LSD and sinicuichi. LSD and sinicuichi (or just sinicuichi on its own) are the most intense audio distortion inducers I've ever used, personally.

Since then, have you consistently gotten auditory distortions from 4-HO-MiPT or has it only happened during some trips, and if so, do you find it is dose or ROA dependant? I'm probably going to use 4-HO-MiPT again for the first time tonight since I made the post you quoted, probably orally this time, or perhaps plugged, and I'm hoping the auditory effects won't occur, since I find them somewhat annoying, as stated in my initial post

It usually only occurs if I'm dosing over 35 or so mg, which for most people is quite a bit of miprocin. I tend to trip hard though, a few nights ago I took 4mg of DOC, 2.25mg of DOB and **250mg of 2C-B HBr**. I've never had a bad trip, don't think I can personally. Normal low doses still work just fine with me too, just keep in mind my personal physical responses, as everybody varies subjectively. I've only administered mip orally and intranasally, and I don't find there to be a huge difference in the two other than come-up time.


The audio effects aren't completely consistent until I reach ~25mg, but past that there's almost a guarantee of some sort of audio distortions, sometimes they vary heavily in character though compared to the ones I described.

4-ho-mipt is like the MDMA of tryptamines, its fantastic stuff. Tryptamines  like mushrooms or 4-aco-dmt do nothing for me in the sexy department, but this chemical is amazing. Only downside is it makes me sweat like crazy, there is a heatwave here and i don't have AC. I really like this one though. I think it would be a great first time psychedelic. I think did around 20 mg, i will go higher next time, I don't remember how much I did last time

I think it's a fascinating psychedelic to be sure, and definitely a sexy one. I don't get along super well with it, but everyone I know that's tried it seems to love it. It's definitely quite sexy.

The first time I did it with ex gf , at the time, had sex on the come up.  The next day she did it, and licked her a lot . Other than that, ive did it alone, in the house to self, out on nature with brother hiking a couple times, and I could see some less mdma ish psychedelic , ive also cried really hard on it to the point I almost didnt catch my breath and became overwhelmely super sad, that could have been where I was in life, that was eight plus years ago, when did it solo with noone in house.


Ime, I prefer 4-aco-dmt, as the visuals seemed different , Im talkign about visual with eyes closed as well, when I do an intense trip, I close my eyes, put on different kinds of music, lay head back on a recliner and let it show all the bad things ive done, and have them come up.  4-aco-dmt hit much more intense, although it was subq, 4-ho-mipt was always oral and sub q works faster, more potent


 I seemed to get more therapy benefit from 4-aco-dmt and that is what I was looking for. Dont like to do this much. The time before I did this beginning of august , it was April 2024 since last did a sub 4 typtamine and 25-30 mgs oral didnt do much, yes same batch, for ex gf and I. We smoked a lot of weed as well and I was hungry and kept eating. I did the same thing on lsd the next night. Massive amounts of high thc cannabis. Its okay once in a while I guess if youd like, but not often and dont recommend it with psychedelics, to each their own, for me I seem to enjoy it solo more than mixed with cannabis
