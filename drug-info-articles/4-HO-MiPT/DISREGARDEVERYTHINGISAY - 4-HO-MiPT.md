**4-HO-MiPT** (**miprocin**, **4-hydroxy-*****N*****-methyl-*****N*****-isopropyltryptamine**, or **hats**) is an synthetic compound and a lesser-known psychedelic tryptamine. It is thought to be a serotonergic psychedelic, similar to 4-AcO-DMT, LSD and DMT. Its molecular structure and pharmacological effects resemble those of the tryptamine psilocin, which is the primary psychoactive chemical in magic mushrooms.

This substance is relatively uncommon and has only a short history of human use. It was presumably first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin. Its synthesis is described in his book *TiHKAL* along with reports by people who had ingested the compound. Shulgin’s trials and other anecdotal information suggest that 4-HO-MiPT is similar in activity to psilocin.

In terms of its chemistry, 4-HO-MiPT is the 4-hydroxyl analog of the substituted tryptamine known as MiPT (*N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine*) as well as the isopropyl homolog and structural analog of 4-HO-DMT (*Psilocin*).

In terms of its pharmacology, 4-HO-MiPT’s psychedelic effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptor as a partial agonist. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

The effects listed below are based upon the [subjective effects index](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index) and personal experiences of [PsychonautWiki](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) contributors. The listed effects will rarely if ever occur all at once but heavier dosages will increase the chances and are more likely to induce a full range of effects.

**Physical Effects:**

- [Spontaneous tactile sensations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Spontaneous_tactile_sensations) - The “body high” of 4-HO-MiPT can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft and all-encompassing tingling sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- [Sedation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Sedation) - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, 4-HO-MiPT is considered by most to be relaxing, stoning and mildly sedating. This sense of sedation is often accompanied by compulsive yawning.
- [Runny nose](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Runny_nose)
- [Watery eyes](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Watery_eyes)

**Cognitive Effects:**

The cognitive effects of 4-HO-MiPT are described by many as extremely relaxing, profound and stoning in style when compared to other commonly used psychedelics such as LSD or 2C-B which tend to be energetic and stimulating. It contains a large number of typical and unique psychedelic cognitive effects.

The most prominent of these typical effects generally include:

- [Enhancement of current mind state](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Enhancement_of_current_mind_state)
- [Connectivity of thought](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Connectivity_of_thought)
- [Feelings of fascination, importance and awe](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Feelings_of_fascination,_importance_and_awe)
- [Time distortion](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Time_distortion)
- [Outrospection](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Outrospection)
- [Deja-Vu](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Deja-Vu)
- [Removal of cultural filter](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Removal_of_cultural_filter)
- [Feelings of predeterminism](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Feelings_of_predeterminism)
- [Conceptual thinking](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Conceptual_thinking)
- [Direct communication with the subconsious](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Direct_communication_with_the_subconscious)
- [Ego suppression, loss and death](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Ego_suppression,_loss_and_death)
- [Feelings of interdependent opposites](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Feelings_of_interdependent_opposites)
- [Delusions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Delusions)
- [States of unity and interconnectedness](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_States_of_unity_and_interconnectedness)
- [Enhancement and suppression cycles](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Enhancement_and_suppression_cycles) - This can be described as constant waves of extremely stimulated and profound thinking which are spontaneously surpassed in a cyclic fashion by waves of general thought suppression and mental intoxication. These two states seem to switch between each other in a consistent loop once every 20 - 60 minutes.

**Visual effects:**

*Enhancements*

4-HO-MiPT presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally includes:

- [Increased visual acuity](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Increased_visual_acuity)
- [Enhancement of colour](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Enhancement_of_colour)
- [Enhanced pattern recognition](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Enhanced_pattern_recognition)

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, effects experienced are detailed below:

- **[Drifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting)** *([Melting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting#Melting), [Flowing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting#Flowing), [Breathing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting#morphing))* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, realistic, slow and smooth in motion and static in appearance.
- **[Tracers](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics#Tracers)**
- **[After images](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics#After_images)**
- **[Texture repetition](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics#Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Colour shifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics#Colour_shifting)**
- **[Scenery slicing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics#Scenery_Slicing)**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of Psilocin, Ayahuasca and 2C-E than LSD or 2C-B. It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, organic in style, structured in organization, brightly lit and multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, soft in edges, large in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, rounded in corners, unimmersive in depth and consistent in intensity. The visuals have a very “natural” feel to them and at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of [Level 8B](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) visual geometry over [Level 8A](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A).

*Hallucinatory States*

4-HO-MiPT and its various other forms produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. These effects generally include:

- [Transformations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Transformations)
- [Internal hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations) ([Autonomous entities](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Autonomous_entities), [Settings, sceneries, and landscapes](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes), [Alterations in perspective](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Alterations_in_perspective) and [Scenarios and plots](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Scenarios_and_plots)) - This effect is very consistent in dark environments at appropriately high dosages. They can be comprehensively described through their [variations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, [geometry](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry)-based in style and almost exclusively of a religious, spiritual, mystical, science fiction or transcendental nature in their overall theme.

**Auditory Effects:**

The auditory effects of 4-HO-MiPT are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- [Enhancements](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_effects:_Enhancements)
- [Distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_effects:_Distortions)
- [Hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_effects:_Hallucinations)

**Physical Health Effects, Potential Addiction and Tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational 4-HO-MiPT use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 4-HO-MiPT is a research chemical with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried 4-HO-MiPT within the psychonaut community suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

There is no current data for the LD50 of 4-HO-MiPT, but it is thought to be high.

4-HO-MiPT does not seem to be physically addictive and many users experience a self-regulating quality. There seems to be a tolerance build up when used consecutively multiple days in a row which requires one to double their dosage each time to achieve the same effects.

**Legal issues:**

- **Sweden:** Sveriges riksdags health ministry Statens folkhälsoinstitut classified 4-HO-MiPT as a “health hazard” under the act Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor (translated Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) as of November 1, 2005, making it illegal to sell or possess.[[1]](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-MiPT#cite_note-1)
- **United Kingdom:** The substance could be considered illegal in the UK under the Misuse of Drugs Act of 1971.
- **United States:** 4-HO-MiPT is an unscheduled drug in the United States. However, it is an analog of psilocin, which could lead to prosecution under the Federal Analog Act.

**Conclusion:**

4-HO-MiPT induces a generic yet worthwhile tryptamine experience which can be described as almost indistinguishable from that of psilocybin mushrooms and 4-AcO-DMT. It also has the same dosage range to that of 4-AcO-DMT and I would recommend this substance to anybody who is interested in experiencing psychedelia.
