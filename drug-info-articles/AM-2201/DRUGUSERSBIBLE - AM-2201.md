## Subjective Experience

Like spice, the brand name Black Mamba was eventually to be misappropriated to
become a generic name for all sorts of materials infused with a strong cannabinoid or
combinations of strong cannabinoids. Originally, however, it appeared in a green and
black glossy packet, infused with just AM-2201.

It was a monster.

In 2014 I posted the following on an Internet forum, as a response to a member who
had articulated his own terrible story with the same compound:

```
I had a very similar experience with this chemical, which I bought as an
incense blend from a head shop. I tested it twice, optimistically and foolishly
assuming that the first bad hit was a fluke.
```

```
I felt the sort of anxiety that is possible via certain cannabis strains; but
multiplied by a factor of 100. It was almost overwhelming: acute fear and
intense paranoia are good words to describe it.
```
```
After this second lesson, I flushed the rest of the bag. I still struggle to explain
how it took two trips to the abyss to do this.
```
```
The other cannabinoid that freaked me out was 5F-AKB48, which was also
smoked courtesy of a head-shop procured blend. After the nightmare with that
one, that was it: no more synthetic cannabinoids, ever.
```
```
The sheer terror I endured with these two is hard to articulate, and I didn't
even consume them in vast quantities.
```
On each occasion, the intensity of the dread eventually subsided, and the experience
plateaued into a more regular cannabinoid-type state. Each had been a +++ on the
Shulgin scale and an absolutely horrendous ride.

I shudder to think about what may have occurred had all this unfolded in a public
place, rather than in the sanctuary of my home.

Note that I have in fact held true to my forum comment above: I have not sampled an
artificial cannabinoid since that particular day.

```
This was one of the cannabinoids which was central to the surge of addiction
amongst the homeless in British cities circa 2017
```
