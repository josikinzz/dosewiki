DESCRIPTION #
 
Aniracetam is a nootropic, developed by Roche Pharmaceutical, which acts on the central nervous system (CNS). It has a reputation for increasing intellectual activity, improving immune function, increasing resistance to infection, and generating feelings of health and well-being, particularly in the elderly. Effects may be noticed after 60 days of use, becoming more pronounced after 4 months.
