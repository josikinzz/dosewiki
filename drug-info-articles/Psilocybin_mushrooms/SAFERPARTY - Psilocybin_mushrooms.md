## Effects
Low doses have a stimulating and strengthening effect. Medium doses have a mild hallucinogenic effect and stimulate the imagination. High doses have a strong hallucinogenic effect, very psychedelic; the environment is often perceived as dreamlike; visionary immersion in strange worlds, deep insights into oneself and a feeling of strong connection with nature.

## Dosage
Average dosages of dried* mushrooms:
Pointed cone bald: light 0.5-0.8 g, medium to strong 1.0-max. 2 g
Hawaiian: light 0.3-0.5 g, medium to strong 0.5-max. 1 g
Mexican: light 0.5-1.5 g, medium to strong 1.5-max. 5 g
*for fresh mushrooms approx. ten times this amount.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
The pupils dilate, pulse and blood pressure change, increase in body temperature (sweating), breathing difficulties and palpitations may occur. Occasionally, nausea may occur. Balance disorders, an altered sense of space-time, confusion and anxiety are also possible; panic attacks may occur in the case of stimulus overload.
The use of psilocybin can trigger latent (hidden) mental disorders.
When picking mushrooms in nature, there is a risk of confusion due to deadly doppelgangers!

## Safer Use
- Consume mushrooms only in good mental and physical condition (set).
- Do not consume mushrooms alone, but with someone you trust.
- Pay attention to the setting. A stress-free environment is important, preferably in nature. Mushrooms are not party drugs!
- Consume mushrooms only after a light meal; it is best to eat very little for 6 to 8 hours to avoid nausea and other unpleasant side effects. Chew mushrooms well!
- Use dried mushrooms if possible; wash raw mushrooms well before eating.
- In delicate moments during the trip: let yourself go, try not to fight the effect of the mushrooms.
- Avoid mixed consumption, never consume mushrooms together with alcohol or medication!
- Avoid roads and other "dangerous" places, your orientation may be disturbed.
- In case of panic attacks or horror trips: see General Information under Emergency.
- After the trip, allow yourself plenty of rest and recovery, at least the day after, to be able to process the experience.
