## Subjective Experience

Famously discovered by Albert Hoffman in 1938, the recreational use of LSD
exploded in the 1960’s. It was central to the counterculture revolution, having a
profound influence which spanned far beyond art and music, and eventually touched
most facets of society.

Its value in the fields of psychiatry and psychology as an agent to alleviate human
misery was quickly established. Countless studies emerged as research flourished,
particularly across the United States.

This all came to an abrupt end, courtesy of Richard Milhous Nixon and the war on
drugs. Indeed, LSD was made an initial and prime target. Research was
unceremoniously halted, thousands were imprisoned and psychedelic study and
exploration was driven underground.

My own experience with LSD unfolded during the folly of youth. I managed to
acquire two blotters, and consumed one of them on a clear warm Sunday afternoon. I
remained indoors waiting for something to happen.

After an indeterminate period of time I deemed that the blotter must have been a
dud, and I swallowed the second. Within perhaps ten minutes a trip started to
materialise. My immediate reaction was to panic: what if this was the first blotter
taking effect?

Fortunately, after being informed that I was an idiot, I was reassured by my less than
impressed sitter, and I calmed down considerably.

My recollections are somewhat vague, but a fascination with various shapes, patterns
and materials was memorable. I also recall that there was some horn present at one
point. More radical was my experience when I was eventually taken on an evening
walk.

The perspective was something akin to the dollhouse effect, in which the exterior
appeared to be so tranquil that I perceived it as part of a giant interior. I noticed
chimneys, telegraph poles, and items not normally on my conscious visible radar.
The sky appeared as a ceiling, almost touchable, and was totally non-threatening.

I felt no nausea or negativity at all. It was a pleasant experience, albeit a gentle one.

This was my first foray into the realms of psychedelia and it would leave a long term
impression, although not as a result of any form of trauma or extreme stimulation. It
was profound: the temporary shift in perception was to have a permanent and
positive influence on my worldview.

Now, many years later, I can align elements of this trip with more recent
experimentation with 1p-LSD and other lysergamides. That intimate relationship
with the outdoors and nature, the wonderment of the visuals, the delicate excitation
of the other senses, the aura of the headspace: all ebb and flow to differing degrees
between each experience.

As LSD is almost indistinguishable from 1p-LSD, I have attempted to more fully
document the trip experience itself within the entry for the latter. Needless to say, I
hope to have many more encounters in the future.

another psychedelic would look on that experience, especially the first
one, as a major life-changing event.” ~ Ralph Metzner

BLOTTER ART
LSD tabs are usually decorated by what has become known as blotter art. This can
sometimes be extremely complex in nature, and indeed, entire collections exist,
which have even been exhibited in galleries and museums.

The above sheet, which consists of 1200 individual blotters, was produced for
promotional purposes in 2019. It presents the front cover of the second edition of
this book, but alas, doesn’t contain any LSD.
