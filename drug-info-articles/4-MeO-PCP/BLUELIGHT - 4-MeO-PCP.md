Welcome to the Big & dandy 4-MeO-PCP Thread!


*Picture and fancy summary to come*


[previous thread](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/391328)


So any new opinions of the drug and not potential presence of poisonous precursor paranoia? (Just asking, not saying don't talk about the PCC thing, it remains a relevant concern)

I got a lot of early onset unrest in my 4-MeO-PCP experimentation, which I lacked in MXE, almost skin crawling and definitely uncomfortable.  Further experimentation is planned though.


As to the toxic PCC cyanide intermediate, I think we can put that to bed.


As I said right before the topic was closed:

3-MeO-PCP and 4-MeO-PCP are often made in the way that can leave the toxic cyanide intermediate, there is however another route which is very attractive and does not leave any of the toxic cyanide compound.


3-MeO-PCE is unlikely to contain the toxic cyanide compound as its synthesis is usually performed via another, more efficient and safe route


Methoxetamine and Ketamine will not contain the toxic cyanide compound as its synthesis is completely different and wont work in a way that leaves such an intermediate.


I love to talk chemistry and I hate to talk in nontransparent absolutes, but given the rules on no synth talk this is the best I can do.

If anyone has any questions about it that I can answer without breaking rules, by all means do ask. 


To put personal concerns to bed, there is a simple reagent you can prepare and use to test for cyanide presence:


Take 0.1gr steel wool and dissolve in 5ml concentrated hydrochloric acid. This prepares a test reagent for cyanide. Then dissolve 0.1gr of your to be tested arylcyclohexylamine in there.  Wait a few minutes. If an intense dark blue color appears (prussian blue) your sample contained a PCC like contaminant or similar cyanide contaminant. Under no circumstances should attempts be made to recover the drug, leave the tap running and pour the liquid with the stream into the sink to dispose, avoiding to breathe the air near the tube. This will put personal concerns about PCC like contamination to bed.


Mods, I sincerely hope that this is within the rules.  Its a procedure to test a drug for contamination, a drug test for harm reduction, not a synthesis. If its not acceptable I apologize, I put it in an easily removable paragraph and will abstain from submitting such content in the future.

Yeah great idea! ^ Iron dissolves in HCl to give a solution of Fe2+, then cyanide ions form a complex with the Fe2+ giving iron ferrocyanide. Some of this is oxidised (by air?) to ferricyanide (Fe3+) and [Prussian Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_ferrocyanide#Properties) precipitates.

Yes it's oxidized by oxygen. If I remember correctly the reaction needs elevated temperature and some time to occur (speaking of free cyanide detection in qualitative analysis). Shaking and stirring could help to get oxygen into the solution.


Is the cyanide easily cleaved from PCC under this conditions (conc. HCl)? Does cyanide, or rather HCN form these iron-complexes in strongly acidic solution and high chloride concentration? I doubt the latter. Addition of a base may be needed.


Thanks a lot! It's really a very nice idea, but a few controlled assays should be performed before relying solely on this test.

Perhaps someone owning a PCC contaminated sample (as batches have been tested for PCC with GC/MS, IRC) and having the resources could try it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hmmm....cyanides are carbon-nitrogen triple bond anions....nitriles are c-nitrogen triple bonds attached to organic molecules. Cyanides are considerably more dangerous than nitriles.

I'd award a prize for that home-made reagent test post if we did such things. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Thanks very much! But does it work? I think my product is impure so when I get a chance I will perform this test and report my findings. If I'm not mistaken PCC at least partially metabolizes into some cyanide so can this process be imitated in vitro so that presence of PCC will not remain hidden but can actually be indicated by CN- generation?

Or can anyone who works at a lab try this with acetonitrile or another nitrile?


Despite the concerns about toxic impurities, discussion I seem to have sprouted myself or at least helped with... I think the thread is supposed to be about the drug itself and the promises it may have or where it may fall short. For that reason I would rather see a thread title covering the nature of the drug if you don't mind me disputing the current name. (changed, I guess it doesn't characterize it - makes sense since I don't know how it feels yet... because of the doubts about the quality).


I wouldn't mind some summarized descriptions of how this one fits into the family of arylcyclohexylamines, would anyone care to venture characterizing it? Not everyone is as concise about their use of words but I have found that some people's descriptions of some drugs are so spot-on that they become very helpful for people to consider it and take it into account (for example when deciding if it's worth trying or not).


Impurity discussion remains encouraged as well, so carry on about all of it!

^Yeah that's fine, I was kind of referring to [this post](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/454099-The-Big-amp-Dandy-3-MeO-PCP-Thread?p=10504833&viewfull=1#post10504833) with the first part of the title, and it somewhat addresses your curiosity over the nature of the drug.

I suggest any preliminary tests should be performed on confirmed PCC-containing batches, for generally the stability of nitriles is variable. Acetonitrile won't release cyanide or HCN under normal conditions (but it is toxic nonetheless). I'd think that PCC, being kind of a formal HCN adduct of an iminium, does eliminate HCN. The questions are: under which conditions? ([apparently](http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/pcp.pcc.analysis.html) it decomposes with HCN release while being analysed with TLC and both gas and liquid chromatography) And how could this be achieved conveniently with minimal resources?

Heating in the mentioned Fe/HCl solution could gas any HCN out of solution before any significant amount of hexacyanoferrates is produced (I still doubt these complexes are even formed under these conditions). With an alkaline solution we might run into solubility issues. Perhaps a little bit more sophisticated procedure is needed (like heating acidic solution for a certain time interval, then add a base and heat some more, then let stand until enough iron is oxidized; and hope to *not produce false negatives*, which is the reason why I suggest establishing that this works *reliably*).

I think it'll probably work like Asante said, according to wiki - 'Iron(II) sulfate is added to a solution suspected of containing cyanide ... The resulting mixture is acidified with mineral acid. The formation of Prussian blue is a positive result for cyanide.'


If PCC breaks down on activated silica, but not after pre-treatment with the basic eluent, I guess it'll decompose in conc. HCl. I wonder if this could be a way to get rid of it too, let it stand for a few days in acid then basify and filter or extract (more) pure PCP.

AFAIK the majorly contaminated batch was going around in 2010, don't know if it's even a problem any more, or that anyone would know that theirs contains appreciable amounts of PCC w/o proper testing.

No it is not true *technically*.

However **impurities** in improperly made PCP or certain derivatives made following the same type of synthesis ("recipe") can contain cyanide. Whether it is released as hydrogen cyanide into the air or not only matters if you smoke it, because of second-hand smoking.

And there is hydrogen cyanide releasing chemicals in normal cigarettes as well. It's about the quantity, that can be worrying. For PCP impurities the quantity depends on exactly how impure it is, and what the impurity is. There can be non-toxic impurities in it instead.

I have played around with this drug a bit thought I could throw in my non-technical opinion sorry if things have already been covered elsewhere.


For the high, it is very diverse in my experience, I have had proper body loads similar to K and MXE, full on visual trips, recently I watched the new alice in wonderland and for over 30 mins of it I will say it was the best film I have ever watched. I was actually in the film participating in events in a way that was truly astounding. I dont know if its similar to AM-2201 in the way that it doesn't target particular receptors or something, because I have had such a range of highs from it.


Taking it orally makes sense looking at the cyanide related posts now, it really was uncomfortable to digest for over a week afterwards, maybe it would of been good if I had thrown up, I was getting some intense kidney pains from its digestion and was a little worried for a while the damage was permanent or still being caused.


Snorting is my main method of experimenting, I haven't tried smoking it because I tested it on the edge of a spoon burning it with a lighter and the powder took a long time to start turning brown. Also I am a bit wary of smoking chemicals since I am never sure when it could have a chemical reaction and turn into something deadly.


Hope that helps someone got all the pieces together in my head anyway ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

I guess this stuff degrades pretty quickly.  I made gelcaps of 4-meo-pcp about 6 months ago.  Prior to today, the last time I ingested them was in March, [they put me on another planet](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/391328-The-Big-amp-Dandy-4-MeO-PCP-Thread?p=10568312&viewfull=1#post10568312) at about 175mg.  Today I started off at 175mg, it felt good coming on but wasn't as strong as I expected, so I took another 65mg, waited, still not as strong as expected and took another 65mg.  That was a half hour ago, and here I am typing away after ingesting close to 300mg.  I should be rolling around on the bed, not typing coherent english.

OK you got your wish mr "I don't want to type english coherently."  I did *another* full 175mg dose again after I posted that.  This adds up to almost 500mg over the course of the day. I briefly found myself in some kind of a psycotic/delusional state at one point, crawling on the floor to dial 911, thankfully I woke up from that before making the call.


It was definitely the most dissociated state that I've ever been in.  I'm not sure how to describe it, but at times I felt like I was caught up in time-feedback loop where I would keep asking and answering the same questions, and doing the same things over and over.


Not that it wasn't enjoyable, I brought out the blinking christmas lights (the kitties really liked that), and there were some good hallucinations of colors/shapes/forms/ that only a PCP derived drug could do.


I think I took 4mg etizolam when I started getting too delusional, and 1.5mg lorazapam when I wanted to go to sleep.  I'm now awake after sleeping ~7 hours, though clearly still under the influence of one drug or another.  Let's see if I can match up my symptoms to the drugs I took:


Walking around like a normal person still isn't possible, I blame that on the 4-MeO-PCP

Yeah my motor control is pretty fucked, still clinging to walls and stuff, that's the 4-MeO-PCP

I'm also having trouble focusing my eyes on things, I'll blame that on the benzos.


My breakfast this morning was a (very strong) pot brownie, a [Pepperidge Farm](http://www.pepperidgefarm.com/ProductDetail.aspx?catID=767) turnover, 5 grams of White Vein Kalimantan.  I am having the most beautiful and intricate CEVs. I also hallucinated the air conditioner saying "cinammon" when I linked the pepperidge farm url. This is quite enjoyable.


I can just watch movies by closing my eyes, if I don't like what I'm seeing I'll just open them and close them and a new scene will appear.  I can hear auditory hallucinations via the air conditioner.  If I don't like I'm hearing I can look at the air conditioner and it will go away.  I'm definitely not sober but I'm OK enough to walk to the computer and type this in a reasonable amount of time.  Yay 4-meo-pcp


Here I am still going strong.  My heart rate is really high (120 bpm) so I just took an etizolam.  I'm forcing myself to eat some rice and beans since I haven't eaten anything since breakfast.  I'm going to lye in bed to watch some CEVs.  Does anybody have any advice on getting my heart rate down?


Come on guys, help me out with any harm reduction help you can give me.  do benzos help lower heart rate or not?  based on how much I took,, 500mg, when do you think I will be back to baseline

I've taken up to 4 days to feel baseline after dosing that one in the past, after tolerance or whatever started building up more like 24 hours for return of motor coordination on normal doses. Actually your current experience reminds me almost exactly of one of mine, where it wasn't working right per dose and I ended up just taking several times more than usual (except I ended up vomiting bile and regular vomit all over the place and feeling completely horrible and near-unable to move for like 10 hours straight...).


IME GABAergics can make whatever dissociation you're still experiencing more intense, but for heart rate, I'd take a therapeutic dose of a benzo (or BZD-like drug, like etizolam) to help, if you feel you need it.

Hahaha I ended up falling asleep after asking about my heart rate.  I bet it wasn't the etizolam that put me to sleep (though I'm sure it helped), but the half dozen pot brownies I ate over the course of the day to enhance my CEVs.  Now I'm up, and the CEVs are gone.  Hahah oh well guess I'm sober again.  What a ride!

Dissociative dream-visions are pretty fun, and I found this substance pretty good in that category, given its lucidity. Have you tried watching cinema while on it? It's my favorite movie watching drug (throw in a cannabinoid while you're at it).

I tried 85mg sniffed last night. I found the experience far too intense, it was like MXE but with more of a fuzzy/visually trippy feeling that kept gradually building up over time. I didn't even recognise anything in my house. For some weird weird reason I started writing suicide notes. Next time I'll probably have 50mg snorted. I don't know how the hell people are taking 200mg lines.  


I feel really shitty this morning.


4-meo-pcp iS EVIL NASTY HORRIBLE STUFF!!! I've lost all the notes. Help!!!


......I found them in the bin, and I'm glad I just threw the rest of 4-meo-pcp down the toilet. It's like MXE's horrible and viscous cousin.

This one is not bad, and the recent batches seem very potent. I prefer this material 10 times over 3-MeO-PCP, as it seem impossible to hole on as opposed to 4-meo.

Still, MXE is quite a bit better, and ofcourse K, but K is annoyingly short acting in my opinion.

Cheers

I've tried it at 130mg orally. Quite a nice high. I was never overwhelmed, but smoking some weed gave me a great buzz for at least 12 hours. Felt like ~30ish of MXE sublingual.

Somewhere in the haze of the weekend I managed to send a capsule to be tested to ecstasydata.org.  I was worried I packaged it wrong or wrote a wrong or unreadable address, but apparently it did manage to get through.  Remember that I made this capsule 6 months ago, and it's been sitting in a plastic baggie in summer heat and humidity:


[http://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=2581](http://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=2581)


I guess this means that there really have been uncontaminated batches of 4-MeO-PCP sold.  FYI, I can't tell you where to find this batch, so don't bother PMing me.

I want to explain further why it's not worth PMing me.  Mods, I don't think this counts as "sourcing" because I'm not telling anyone where they can buy this batch or any other batch of 4-MeO-PCP.  I bought this batch from a website beginning in "buzz" and ending in "wholesale" sometime between November 2011 and February 2012.  This website was shut down months ago, and even if they reopened, it would almost certainly not be selling the same batch of 4-MeO-PCP.  Another reason not to PM me, I'm going to take the advice I've seen often on these boards, and take a long break from hard drugs, so I probably won't be logging in again anytime soon.


But if you feel this goes over the line mods, please feel free to delete this post.  You guys have a great community and I don't think I'd be able to make as intelligent decisions about my consumption without everything I've read here.

A search turned up 

[this TR](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/501589-4-meo-PCP-(IM-injection)-New-Experience-Better-than-Ketamine), but otherwise just get a handle on the potency of the compound, adjust your dose, then IM as you normally do.

Hello Bluelight. Just got a gram of this compound from a german vendor with a good rating on SoS. In mail the owner claimed the purity to be at 98.5% which sounded promising. After insufflating around 45-60 mg (I'm one of those retarded eyeballers) no effects are present. It's tasteless, white and and looks like pretty much like MXE. The previous 4-MeO-PCP I've used have been off-white / brown in color and stung like nothing I ever insufflated before. Could it be a different salt? Anyone else recieved batches with this appearance that didn't fuck your nasal cavities? On another hand I've also ingested 3 x Etizolam and yesterday perhaps 13 of them which may expalin why I'm not buzzing yet, but I've got a rather high tolerance. Thanks in advance.


EDIT: It's also pretty much tasteless. Like literally tastes nothing at all. Weird.

EDIT2:For now, I will blame the BZD. I remember killing MXE highs with the same particular benzos (Etizolam). Now this MXE is a PCE derivative (or maybe more similar to K - not going to debate on this), but I don't think that matters because most arylcyclohexylamines seems to have similar pharmacological action (unless theres some major changes like theinorings or hydroxygroups added). I will wait approx 12 hours and then try again. Wish me luck ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png).

EDIT3: According to the vendor. The CAS of his Methoxydine is 2201-35-6. Indicating it is the freebase? Which may explain why it didn't solve well (at all) in water even when heated. Is there any easy way into turning 4-MeO-PCP into HCl salt? Thanks in advance guys!.

EDIT4: Aquire some isopropylalcohol and it still doesn't dissolve in it. Help me you knowledgeable chemists , whats wrong?

It's probably not 4-MeO. If it doesn't dissolve in water or alcohol it's probably something inorganic, eg. chalk.

It did dissolve, and then finally when the alcohol had evaporated it was a thick white brick in the blow (chalk? pcp?). Anyways it's froma well known vendor on SoS. If this turns out to be faked I want to 1/10 him with good reasons. Sadly I have no SoS account. I'll be back with more information regarding this substance.

I will be in possesion of this chemical shortly. I am a big fan of ketamine, methoxetamine, and nitrous so I think i'd love this stuff too. I know it is gonna be the good stuff and not that contaminated garbage. How would you compare heavy doses of 4-meo-pcp to heavy ket and mxe doses.  Does it completely knock out your motor function like ketamine or is it a more fuctional trip like mxe. Even on strong mxe doses on mxe I am still functional enough to do shit like ride my bike.

Does it completely knock out your motor function like ketamine or is it a more fuctional trip like mxe. Even on strong mxe doses on mxe I am still functional enough to do shit like ride my bike.

The hallucinations are zonky, like with most dissociatives, and can be somewhat annoying. I've never had a bad trip on any dissociative (at least no bad in the "psychadelic mushrooms sense")). Your motor function will be fucked (like on MXE) but you're fully able to run in front of trucks on the highway if you're so inclined. A bike ride? Sure, no problem.

Depends on how much you take, but IME high doses impaired motor function way more than MXE did, it was more like DXM in that department. I don't know if that's the normative reaction though.

i guys,


i recently aquired some 4-meo-pcp. the odor of this slightly off-white powder is so strong, that even the vendor double packed this into a alu-sealed airtight bag. it totally smells like burnt electronics. i tested around 10mg up the nose but the odor and burn make it almost impossible to get to doses like 150mg as stated on erowid.


anyone have insights here???

you could add oral doses too, like 50mg every hour or so

if you want to titrate the dose, then get an oral syringe, dissolve your material in lukewarm water and squirt it up your ass, in little steps, with some time between the squirts. this will be excactly the same like you would have planned nasal and propably way less painful. RA really is a good ROA, and way too often overlooked.

ok thanks bagseed. i will try to ramp up with plugging then. ramping oral in small steps is too time consuming to evaluate actual dosage levels and sweet spots imho.


what would you suggest a good plugged dose (with hole like dissociation) of the HCl so i can split it in 3-4 iterations?

tbh, i have no experience with plugged 4-meo-pcp (and the only dissociative i've tried is ketamine), so for dosage questions, you should wait for other people with experience to reply. but i've read numerous times that plugging is a good ROA for that kind of drugs, so i'd thought i suggest it in the name of harm reduction ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png).


the only thing i can say for sure is that plugging is more potent than snorting or oral with most drugs, so maybe go easy. but if you titrate the dose it should be okay.


greets!

harm reduction would be oral then, since your 1st pass metabolism is there to protect you from all sorts of stuff and your stomach acid buffers a bit. but well, i'm used to guinea pigging so i'll try ramping plugged doses of 30mg once i have enough time and report

What would be better to  plug it with; an enema bottle or an oral syringe? Do you think 200mgs would be a good starting dose? I have handled my self fine on the many heavy doses of mxe and k I have done.

Not to sound like a complete fool, but this post alone makes me think that I would enjoy 4-meo-pcp more than MXE. I really like extreme dissociation and i was never able to achieve the extreme dissociated state of K or DXM with MXE. Maybe 4-meo-pcp is my ticket.

40mg plugged produce at most a very slight confusion and some burny stinging in the bunghole but nothing else so far. i'll ramp another 50mg in and see how it goes. aparently this is cross tolerant to MXE, and speaking of, has anyone combined those 2 so far?


EDIT: another 60mg plugged. dissociation kicking in, vision gets a bit "crossed" but not as bad as MXEchameleoneyes, face gets warm, lips are numb, but it's still all manageable light and easygoing. probably need another 50mg to finally hit 150mg and see where it leads.. looking for the hole in the hole. hello irony!


EDIT2: im at 170mg plugged total and am still able to walk upright and talk like a human. if this would be MXE or K i would be in outter space already... not sure if the stuff is pure and real.. it's definitly HCl tho. i might try another 30mg just to fill the gap to 200 but i cannot imagine to hole on this atm.

Why would you think it's not pure? You've barely ingested any yet. Ketamine is about 2x the potency of this stuff, and 85mg would be a light dose of ketamine.

i dunno ... i plugged till 200mg but i was still feeling "in the middle of something".. definitly not "there" yet. and reading upon others dosages with 80 beeing "uber evil nasty" i did not shoot over the roof. stopped at 200mg .. felt like a mild k tingle or one bump of mxe. sleep is painful after this one unless other dissociactives i always have no trouble sleeping even during comedown, but here.. not a chance. there's some wild stimulation going on, i was raving around the house all night cleaning shit and had intense urge to DO stuff but just could not find an acceptable work for me state. a 5000 piece puzzle might have done the trick.

i need hundreds of mg's(above 200 for sure) of this one for fx. from what i have read most people are like that with it and yes as with all dissociatives there is crosstolerance


ps. 

ok so today i decided to check the nasal roa of my hcl, snorted 15mgs and god this hurts more than 2cp and powdered yopo together 

now it is a mystery for me too how its possible to be so many nasal reports, but maybe we got it from the same sorce who knows... 

however anybody trying the nasal roa is best to start from very low like 1mg to see if you have the painful batch..

What would be a good concintration to make the solution for plugging. The got this nice sized dropper/squirter thing were you squeeze the top. I think It will work good. They had some oral syringes but either they were too small or the tips didn't look good for plugging. 


I am contimplating if I should dose today.

my HCL is very good soluble in water 80mg where easily soluble in 1ml so i guess 200mg will easy fit into 2ml. i did it with a 2ml subcoutanous syringe without needle. but the syringe is only about 5mm thick so i can just pop the whole syringe in until the end and press the button. works like a charm

Ok, this is gonna sound like an odd question.


I've been holding on to this for some time, in part due to my reservations of purity, it was I believe the first batch to enter the UK possibly up to 2 years ago following a prolonged period of uncertainty. I have no idea if its HCl or freebase. The texture is crystalline and seems to be quite abrasive on the nose, not particularly well absorbed.


Now given all the bad stories of PCC contamination and my rediculously high dissiciative tolerance (i easily get through 100mg 3-MeO-PCP in a night) I'm considering chucking it, although throwing drugs goes against many things that I stand for.


One more thing, it has a kind of pink-ness about it, originally these were more clear omn some crystsls than other, since I've crushed it, the pink has become unifor)m.


Any ideas from anyone who knows about these things, and any advice (apart from throw it down the toilet)? The little bit hurt my nose a fair amount without showin clears signd of water solubilty, so I'm thinking about vaporising/smoking instead, which should be easy if its freebase.


Any advice on smoking it, i gave up cigarettes 9 months ago so don't suggest putting it in a spliff! What about vaping it? I ain't interested in needles or plugging either. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Do not do it, that's my advice. I experimented with vaporization numerous times, it's a crap ROA for this drug, and quite uncomfortable. I usually just went with oral (then a nasal booster if needed, after dissociation numbed my sinuses somewhat). Though given the ungodly amount of 3-meo-pcp you use, your tolerance may be such that this drug is a waste.

I've found this chemical very underwhelming. I've tried doses between 75-150mg orally and each experience has been relatively boring. There's definitely some mild euphoria and dissociation going on, but it is subtle, and I eventually end up feeling very drowsy, which is an uncommon reaction with dissociatives for me personally. I tried it at 125mg last night and it gave me restless leg syndrome for a few hours until I eventually went to sleep. Would I achieve better results from insufflation or rectal administration? I am not keen on either as those ROAs have provided more manic, paranoid experiences for me with other dissociatives, but if that is the best way to experience it, I'm certainly open to try it.

i dont understand this compound either. i recently was up to 250mg rectally and only had a slight dissociation. considering the insane dose, something is either wrong with the material or the compound itself, or the route (even tho everyone agrees rectal to be the best route)


i gave up on this.

**I.M. 4MeO PCP**


How do you about doing a I.M. & also what sort of dose range are you looking at for 4MeO PCP?


have been doing said chemical for about 8 months quite a bit & has got to the point where I am doing around 1500mg in 4/5 days.


any info would be great, thanks in advance

You need clean product (if not; micron filter!), sterile water/bacteriostatic water, clean needle, alcohol swab.  You want to prepare the drug, wipe down a generous patch of skin on top of your thigh in the middle of it, and to put the needle at least 1/2" inch into the thigh, then to slowly push it in.  You'll want some sterile cotton to blot the site in case any leaks out/blood comes out.

I have done speed & heroin loads I.V.


I take it from that the risk of something going wrong with I.M. is far higher than I.V.?


I have no idea what a micron filter is, shooting speed or heroin I have used bits of filter from a Cigarette & cooked up on various things from cans of coke to stuff I prefer not to mention on here tbh.


Sounds way to much hassle tbh.

Might just need more, especially if you have a dissociative tolerance, people were plugging 200-300mg at a tim iirc from the old thread and considered that the standard for dosing. 150mg might have worked pretty well with what I had when I was messing with it a couple years back, but that had PCC in it. 


Actually, even then, 75mg or so was a nasal booster for me...my oral doses were 4 or 5 times that (eyeballed, tolerance catches up quick enough though).

Even if we had a standard dosage for this, your tolerance would probably render it moot.

A smart person I see.


I speak Norwegian (bokmål) & love Burzum so it was only logical to have that as my location.


just saw that link, I have no idea where to begin to get that stuff so I will pass but thanks anyway.


anyone done it I.V. as I have seen 3 reports of I.V. up to 70mg but only basic info on effects

So, after three separate trials of oral doses of 4-MeO-PCP produced subpar results, I decided to try insufflating ~90mg last night. I don't know if it's the product I have or just the chemical in general, but it was a pretty awful result. I felt a burning sensation right after I snorted which lasted about three hours, coupled with a completely clogged right nostril, which eventually started to drip for over twelve hours after initial ingestion. I did get a more noticeable buzz insufflating the drug as opposed to taking it orally (effects were felt within ~5 minutes), but still, it feels nothing like MXE or 3-MeO-PCP for me - very "dirty", overly sedating and disjointed (which might sound obvious for a dissociative, but it was not in a good way). This could be batch-dependent or maybe I just don't react well to it, but as of now, it seems pointless to continue further research with this chemical.

I'm sure most of you have seen this floating around in other threads, but I wanted to put it in here to highlight the uniqueness of this compound:

I believe it is unique in that it binds to all those different receptor sites.


I just received 250mg of this compound.  I want to try it but will have to wait until I am off this Tramadol that I am taking for arthritis pain.  That chart above shows that it binds to SERT and NET so I am guessing this one would not mix well with Tramadol.

Very good call there! Tramadol chemistry is wicked on it's own, best don't mix it with anything that you're not 100% familiar with. Wouldn't wanna end up with excess serotonergic activity, can be really unpleasant (plus very bad for brain).


Why has it been so quiet around this substance? It sounds like a gem from all I've heard. Anyway, did an allergy test. 1h later 240mg of the freebase went up my stinker, suspended in some buffered tap water. Come-up seems very slow, t+19min and nothing worth mentioning, but feel a very ketaminesque state creeping up. Definitely feels closer to K than to PCP so far. (Very experienced with both PCP and Ketamine, limited exp with DXM and MXE.) Bring it on! 

edit: At t+30min im still coming up... if it wasnt building up much slower than k, id have trouble telling the two apart. either the comeup drags on for a considerable amount of time or 240mg wont allow me to break through. hoping for the former to ring true. i gotta say my body feels amazing though, i dare say this is the most euphoric dissociative ive run across... just hope i will be unable to see this monitor in a bit lol.


edit 2: Seems like the 240 didnt cut it. At t+4h I don't have to shut 1 eye anymore in order to avoid double vision. It basically feels like a much slower, more euphoric version of Ketamine to me, but I can't tell if I really would have holed on a higher dosage. I hear 240mg of the freebase is a lot when administered rectally. My next trial would be somewhere between 400mg and 500mg. I also should add that I got the same itchy scalp I get on DXM 3h into the experience. 50mg Diphenhydramine took care of it.

Yeah man that's what I thought. HCl isn't that easily available over here though. I put it into some 20% acetic acid, but it still didn't dissolve. Added some sodium carbonate so the acid wouldn't burn my ass away, pretty hasty experiment and probably not very clever. pH must've been around 8-8.5 if I remember correctly, don't quote me on that, I was very anxious to blast off lol.

Anyway, I wrote a trip report:

[http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/...rectal-very-experienced-A-wonderful-substance](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/670781-4-Meo-PCP-Freebase-240mg-rectal-very-experienced-A-wonderful-substance)!


One week later, just 2 minutes ago actually, I administered another 500mg rectally. Waiting for that to kick in and got another 3x166mg prepared in syringes as boosters. I'm pretty confident I'll get to where I want to be this time, but might use those shots to extend the experience's duration. Chances are I'll just about have enough after 5h of what hopefully will be a hole. I have a feeling I will enjoy this a lot more than Ketamine, IF it allows me to hole that is. I've been looking for a ketamine alternative with longer duration ever since I've come to know the drug.


Again, no urge to defecate after about 5-10min, which is great. Intensely burning asshole though. Wish I had some HCl... :/


Btw, with the similarity this bears to ketamine, the high dosages kinda make sense, especially considering it shows relevant affinity to at least 4 other binding sites. I think the relatively low impact this stuff had on the scene could partially be due to that circumstance. Price goes up per dosage which would make it less popular and people tend to be careful to administer such high amounts of relatively novel chemicals, so most probably haven't gotten an idea for what is possible, especially when they're used to the relatively dull place MXE takes them and simply don't have any idea what the type of complete sensory deprivation that ketamine can induce would do to them.


And in reply to your request: I'll make sure to post an exp report about this one, despite the last one not having received a single reply lol.


Edit: Btw I experienced a considerable amount of what felt like a histaminergic reaction, very closely resembling the itch/scalp burns I get on DXM, bout 2-3h into the experience. Used 50mg Diphenhydramine in advance this time to prevent that from happening.


Further edits: 

-Over 25mins in, definitely notice increased perspiration and central stimulation, but no dissociation as of yet.

-40mins in, same story. No dissociation, but clearly stimulated lol.

-Dissociation starting at t+1h

-maybe the weeewaaa starts here...total 666mg plugged. Take-Off! Here we go.

Going well, added some propylenglycol, administered rectally. 1050mg now altogether...


ass alive


Rectally administered 1050mg during this session, which took me to a dirty version of the k hole. Nothing to write home about. Had to bump up the antihistamines and took 400mg Ibuprofen case it felt like a headache was coming my way. Not too impressed tbh, I'll close the book on this one. Would rather IM 200mg racemic ketamine HCl or smoke some dust. Too taxing. Would probably be pretty cool in combination with psychedelics or empathogens in a festival setting, not for me though. Still better than MXE.

^I found the hole too taxing too on this one, only did it proper once (with by far the largest single dose I've used on the drug), but it was pretty awesome. You might have superior results if you just did it in one go instead of redosing (I often redosed with the drug, but that was just with typical moderate-severe ataxia doses).

Well that dosing regimen axiom usually rings true, especially for dissociatives. I plugged 500mg in the first go during this second 1050mg session though and I don't think I'd want to try more than that as the initial dose. I just traded some of my dmt for the stuff locally and am not gonna order any of it from online suppliers. Definitely a lot better than MXE, but won't replace the occasional k-hole I treat myself with. The comedown just sticks around for much longer than I desire. Curious to see if I'm able to sleep tonight, after having had 50mg of Quetiapine XR just now. Don't think that'll work out too well tbh.


May I ask what your sweet spot was, dosage wise?


Edit: Went to sleep fine bout 12h in after 50mg Quetiapine XR.

I'd love to indulge in some IM 4-MeO-PCP but, umm.. is it common that when the HCl is dissolved in liquid it looks like there's an "oily" layer in it? Another member describes similar appearance here: [http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/...njection)-New-Experience-Better-than-Ketamine](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/501589-4-meo-PCP-%28IM-injection%29-New-Experience-Better-than-Ketamine)


What's the deal? I dissolved 25mg in 1ml saline solution, filtered twice with Sterifilt filters and it left a beige/brown coloring on the membrane of both filters (the liquid itself had a clear appearance).

Sure you don't have the freebase? It'd make sense in that case.

PCP freebase = Uncharged pcp molecule

PCP salt = Protonated molecule + negative ion (e.g. PCP+ Cl-)

Since water is polar (strongly electronegative oxygens on both ends of the molecule), very polar substance will dissolve a lot better in it than molecules with little polarity. The freebase is uncharged and not very polar at all in the case of phencyclidine and still not that much more polar with the methoxy attached. Therefore it won't dissolve very well in water at all.


It should crystallize back out when the water starts to cool down. I personally just used an emulsion for rectal administration, hot water worked for that (shake thoroughly and maybe add some surfactant first to improve absorption). It'd probably be easier to convert the freebase to the chloride salt with HCl (which isn't easily available here). Definitely wouldn't want to inject an emulsion though...


You might have actually filtered out impurities, but for all I know it could also be some of the 4-Meo-PCP itself lol.

Pretty sure it's HCl.. or at least not freebase. It did dissolve very easily, just that there was this weird oily shade in it. 


I also have freebase 4-MeO-PCP but haven't touched that for a while, don't know how it would react. The freebase is kind of chunky crystals and less potent by weight. HCl is off-white or beige powder and at the time of purchase this material was explicitly stated to be HCl by the vendor. I tried it orally couple of times and it seemed to be quite potent, although I don't have the notes of the exact doses with me right now.


Oh, and actually a sample of this particular batch has been analysed by ecstasydata here, if it's any help: [http://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=2446](http://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=2446)


Although I'm a total noob in the field of chemistry and didn't understand much of it, I got the chance to read a further analysis of this, and there was a speculation that the unknown 10% impurity might be something produced in the process of heating the sample for the analysis, so the batch might actually be more than 84% pure. I think I still have the complete text stored somewhere so if anyone is interested I could perhaps pm it or something?

And yes, I did inject the weird oily 4-MeO-PCP into my thigh ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif) There was a lingering mild pain in the muscle for a couple of hours, which I didn't experience when injecting the less nasty 3-MeO, but damn it felt nice when 4-MeO-PCP came on, even on such a low dose.

Tried around 100mg last night in 2 50mg lines fairly close together (perhaps a bit less). I hadn't looked into this before but it was offered and knowing the potency and effect was similar to ketamine, and also that a few others in the group had already tried it I was a bit less cautious than I would normally be before taking a new chem.


The come up was a bit longer than k, and although I could lay down in drift, I could also chose to stay awake and be mobile unlike k (which was good since we had a bit of a walk).


The effects were manageable and I was expecting the duration to be similar to K but instead it lasted 3-5 hours. It was a highly charged social gathering and a bit strange as in my group of friends there were 2 of us on 4-MeO-PCP, one on 2C-B and another on Mephadrone so not easy to stay on the same wavelength throughout the night.


To generalize after one experience I would say this substance has maybe 60-75% of the feeling of k while also being reminiscent of DXM but with greater motor control and a longer duration than MXE. I really felt this compound gave me a lot of insight into the complex social dynamics that were happening during the night (tight-knit dance crowd) and gave me very much to ponder about my own life etc. MXE can also provide similar insights but this seemed more gentle, sober-headed and practical. I was also fairly emotionally detached, not so much in a carefree way but rather not really caring about "social games" and the like.  In some ways although I was very high, felt I had a better understanding of all the non-verbal signals/cues around me though some of this could be attributed to the noopept I had taken earlier.


After getting home (t+4) and smoking cannabis the effects became very strong again and while cannabis really potentiates dissociatives for me it's generally uncomfortable but I feel its important to explore to get the rule range of effects.  Etizolam smoothed things out and led to sleep and without it I think I would have been up for quite a while longer in a state more closely resembling a "classic" psychedelic.


I woke up with a slight headache, feeling a little out of it though that could be the etizolam. Also really slightly depressed but I think that has to do with the insights from the experience I still need to process.


Overall I think this is a very worthwhile compound with unique things to offer along side ketamine, MXE, 3-MeO-PCP etc.

I had this sent to me by accident. I guess it is abuseable if you like dissocatives? I got one gram and I like 3-meo-pcp so I how do I use this effectively? Does it need to be injected or can I just snort it like 3-meo-pcp? How much less potent is it by weight?

It is allot less potent than 3meo-pcp so I wouldn't recommend snorting it. Iv'e only done it plugged and oral. I'd recommend plugging it.

The risks of IVing this are not worth it compared to the same effects rectally.  


I feel like these compounds are dark, the time loops of behavior that you get stuck in are sickening in retrospect. At least the straight PCP analogues-There is a reason humankind has a hate for PCP,it is evil, puts people in extremely creepy/terrifying states . You don't want schizophrenia. 


I remember somewhat stating these compounds are like making a bargain with the devil . The waters of schizophrenia are just that. Be careful. 


**A very important tip is that sublingual Noopept will sober oneself just about INSTANTLY from dissociatives,tested with these with no harmful effects noted.** I kept it around mainly to bring oneself back in case of emergencies. A 10 dollar investment is worth is to have the peace of mind of not HAVING to be stuck in a hole. Anyone else used Noopept with success with this, in this way?

That goes for dissociatives in general IME...but yeah, I can relate.

If they're using a connoisseur drug like this, I can't imagine a user finding the hole a problematic place to be (especially given the amount you have to take to get there. It's expensive stuff.), but I can see people wanting to mitigate the long duration.


Oh, and no I have not tried the nootropic + dissociative thing myself, but I have heard some success stories. Not with 4-MeO-PCP in particular though, iirc.

What are you talking about, man?! PCP is awesome. And it won't make a healthy mind schizophrenic. Of course your use shouldn't go overboard, but other drugs are just as problematic for people in terms of mental health.

4-meo-pcp is best done rectally. I ate a big meal this afternoon then took a shit.  Nice and clean.


I happen to have sterile water, but anyway it's AMAZING how well 4-meo-pcp dissolves in water.  300+ mg can dissolve into less than 1ml.  All you need is a 1ml oral syringe and some lube (go read "guides to plugging" somewhere else).


I'm in hour 9 or so now.  Spent a fair amount of it with my (non-drug-user) girlfriend.  Feeling like this is one of the better drug experiences of my life.  But FUCK it's freezing rain outside.  It's supposed to be snow!  Do you know how glorious it would be if it were snow?

In retrospect (and after further consultations w/ my gf), 300mg was too much.  I don't really remember the 1st couple hours, I guess I was lying on the floor unable to communicate or get up.  Next time will be 150 - 200 mgs.


I think I have a different batch than you guys though, mine's pure white, dissolves in water with no residue at all.  This is sterile water though.


The reason I wouldn't hole on this is that it just lasts way too long, and the more you dose the longer it lasts.  You'd have to take so much that (in my experience) you'll be hearing voices/music coming from white noise for a day or two afterwards.  I've slept about an hour in the 34 hours since I dosed.  20mg diazepam and a beer in last hour, still not really sleepy.

Thanks, very interesting I have a small 330 mg sample IIRC but I'll be sure to take that report into account. Can you describe the effects? In a storytelling manner would be great but a quick comparison based elaboration would also be appreciated.


I have a pretty serious dissociative tolerance so it's hard to know what can be expected...

I couldn't hole on this one at all. 1000mg rectal was not really much stronger than half that amount and just didn't get me where I wanted to be. Had no tolerance. Might've had the impure batch with the PCC. I ended up watching Southland all day lol. Really enjoyed the feel of this one, but wasn't able to break through on it. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

I've done a ton of MXE, none of it the "good" original stuff (mine's the yellowish later stuff), but, nonetheless, I've developed a nearly complete tolerance of MXE.  In the early days, I had very significant disassociation, but not anymore.  Now I can rectal whatever amount, even after months without using, and never get more than a teeny bit tipsy;  except, the larger the dosage the longer I won't be able to sleep.  


FWIW, my brain may be "built differently" than other disassoc users.  I have been extraordinarily, extremely disassociated, but I don't think I've ever "holed" like other users.  From what I understand, "holing" means that you go into your own wolrd, and mostly just hallucinate.  That's not what it's like for me.  I seem to get in various "loops" when I'm extremely disassociated, but still am more or less in the same place.  Not that there's not extreme distortions (and nice hallucinations), but it doesn't seem to be what other people describe.


With ketamine, if I go several weeks without it, I can get pretty fucking disassoc if I snort a lot at first.  But my tolerance builds really quickly.  If I'm going through the same batch for a few days, by the end of it I'll just be "drunk" off of a good 300mg of quality stuff.  FYI, this is snorting only, I won't consider IM/IV of anything.


WRT my recent rectal admin of 4-meo-pcp.  I KNOW it's the same stuff as earlier experiences.  Unfortunately a mod really mangled an earlier oral 4-meo-pcp experience I had earlier in this thread (wasn't that many posts, and the timeline would've been clearer, sorry bluelight mods, you fucked up).  So I'll do my best to describe my experience this time as best I can, wish mods hadn't fucked up my earlier experience though.


One thing about my rectal administration:  I already said I won't consider IM/IV.  I have a lot of recent experience doing opiates rectally, so I may be "better at it" than the average user.  It's anecdotal, but I think I've noticed much stronger responses when my butt's "clean" and I give the solution a good 10 - 20 min to seep into my colon in the prone position.


Anyway...

It really hit me hard.  20 minutes after administration, I went to tell my gf that I would be listening to music and let me know if I was playing it too loud, but I realized I was slurring the fuck out of my words.  She came to talk not long later (I hadn't clicked "play" on th music yet), and I was reallllly slurring, knowing it was going to be much stronger than she had seen previously (she's laughed at how fucked up I've gotten on ketamine), so I told her to be aware I was going to be really fucked up that night on a disassoc.


And then I don't remember.  My gf said she heard a "thud" like I had fallen down.  I have a scab on one elbow and bruise on the other (at least I was smart enough to not land on my wrists).


I do remember her appearing in front of me.  But it's just a memory of a dream.  I remember her being nice, that's about it.  She said I would respond to her questions, but not in a way that she could understand (a couple words, too slurred to make out).  I couldn't get up.  Estimate this lasted 1/2 hour to 2 hours.


gf spent a lot of time with me which really made me happy.  Lots of conversation, though she tells me it was frustrating for her (short answers, slurred speech).  We agreed to watch some episodes of The Walking Dead (downloaded to my file server).


But I couldn't figure out how to connect to the file share (though I've done it 1,000,000 times).  I think I spent an hour before I figured it out.


After (and maybe during) that, I remember everything fairly clearly.  We watched two episodes, I talked to her about them after I was sober, I think I remember them as well as any other episode.  Remember her making a joke about the characters wanting a threesome in one scene (and me calmly explaining to her that it was really funny though I was too disassoc to immediately laugh), remember making a joke about a bad male character doing 4-meo-pcp (which she didn't like), I don't think there's anything significant that I missed, unlike the on-the-floor part, which I don't really remember at all.  I remember explaining 4-meo-pcp to her, explaining to her that it was more like ketamine than pcp, that it lasted 10 hours.  She really didn't like how unbalanced I was.  I tried to explain to her that I was self-aware about my lack of balance, and would cling to the railings walking up/down the stairs, but she didn't believe me.  Took me a while to convince her to get me a beer (only threat I had was that I was going to walk down the stairs to get it myself).


Much more lucid by 5 hours or so after administration.  I started talking on IRC/bluelight 8 or 9 hours after administration.  You can look at my earlier posts to see that I was not "out of it" anymore.  I had tons of energy.  Just listened to music, smoked pot, and drank beer.  There was supposed to be a blizzard that night (which is why I dosed myself), but it was all freezing rain, so I had to stay inside.  I really enjoyed myself though.


Still tons of energy 16 hours after administration.  Went outside and scraped/shovelled the ice around the sidewalk for a good couple hours (WATCH OUT COPS THATS THE PCP ENERGY).  Smoked a big joint after all that effort, I guess 22 hours after dose?


Oh boy when I went inside and laid down I was hallucinating like crazy.  The pot had to have made a difference.  Closing my eyes was a kaleidoscope, almost unsettlingly so, couldn't stay laid down.  But I was OK a half hour or so after smoking the joint, slept for about an hour.


Woke up hungry, went downstairs to eat, talked to gf for hours about politics, racism, drugs, everything and anything important (she did like this conversation, unlike earlier ones where I couldn't communicate well).  Eventually couldn't stay upright anymore.


Not much else to say.  The 20mg diazepam and a beer came shortly later.  I did end up falling asleep an hour and a half or so after that.  Have had a couple good nights' sleep since then, about to get another one. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yeah it's hard to hole with it, only time I managed it was when I eyeballed 4x my normal dose out of frustration with the lack of dissociation I was getting (given tolerance). It was amazing, but after vomiting all that bile, and later regular vomit, and being near-catatonic feeling like death for a good eight hours, I never attempted it again (still, it was totally worth it.. This was oral though.

Been years since I last done it, but I can give it a try. First of all, you're gonna use your whole sample at once unless you're IVing or IMing (in which case I can't help you). Um, whereas DXM and MXE tended toward round, fuzzy and chaotic, 4-MeO-PCP is angular, lucid and organized. It promotes lots of nostalgia/wistfulness (given the proper triggers, at least), IME, and is the best movie watching dissociative I have encountered. It has a certain warmness to it, or numbness, I think given your plentiful experience with K, you should be expecting something of that mixed in with the attributes of the longer acting dissociatives you have tried.

Be careful with impure 4-MeO-PCP, if it's just cut that is one thing but if there are synthesis impurities they can be toxic in this case. Also remember to try and avoid batch or source discussion, I know you like to be helpful and point things out but just a reminder..


I am curious about this stuff and have a small sample to try. Seems like it is less of a black hole hazard compared to diphenidine. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

^Yea I had 3-meo-pcp from what probably is the same vendor he is buying 4-meo-pcp from and it retained about 10% of it's potency I think (I only ever tried 10mg before I threw the whole gram away). I'm not putting 10% of active substance and 90% of potentially toxic waste into my body. There has to be some kind of limit to the madness.

Spacemonkey5000: If I remember correctly, come-up can be quite long. I recently acquired this new batch as well, and when I'm going to try it, I'm going to set aside a whole day for it. As far as I remember, there was quite a lot of brain fog going on the day after administration compared to MXE, so there's some hangover, but I also felt a clear afterglow, almost to the extent you do on DXM (except that the trip in itself is quite enjoyable, compared to how at least I feel on DXM). Good luck with your fredagsexperiment!

recently there have been rumors that people are selling this as K, would they get away with that or are the two qualitatively different enough?


I would think that I haven't gotten any of this because all K has made me quite nauseas if I swallow any of it, and some people are taking 4-meo-pcp orally.


that being said I did have a few different types of k over the years and some of it was kind of hard to hole on and I could imagine it being 4-meo.


I've had a nice variety of holes from K, some at as low as 100mg insufflated which I can't say the same about MXE

4-MeO-PCP has a duration and especially tail end that is about 5-10 times as long so I'm gonna go with no. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

However with ignorant people there is probably no limit, as a young teen I used to smoke the tops of cannabis leaves instead of the flowerbud tops since I had never heard of flowerbud tops.


Also, interesting that K is more scarce and apparently expensive cause 4-MeO-PCP normally isn't that cheap AFAIK. Then again I saw that 3-MeO-PCP prices took a nosedive at one of my vendors so maybe someone did some serious cooking...

Would 4-MeO-PCP show up as a false positive for PCP or Ketamine on a standard hospital urine drug test? For how long can we assume it would be detectable? (in my case it doesn't matter if a lab analysis shows it to not be something illegal). 


Solipsis: 3-MeO-PCP is almost way too inexpensive nowadays - at least in comparison to how dangerous that drug can be (or how easily people get reckless with it). 4-MeO-PCP prices are still rather high over here, and it hasn't really been available at all for 1-2 years locally.

Ahh. Four Meo.


I only get over it every other year or so, it seems. Has definitely been missed. Always better than being coked manic (three MeO). Much dreamy. Much serene. I love it !


Me and a friend has been at approx 600 mg this evening. Everyones feeling fine yet. This was my first dissociative again since November and wohoo, as I'm writing this,

>DOING< it... Wether it means starting companies or planning routes, everthing checks out so easily. MANIC.


Good energy I'm Home (L).

Same here, it showed up locally at a decent price. Going to get 5 grams as soon as I feel the urge to dive into the dissociative realm again.


Anyone got any information on the duration of this compound? Something tells me it might be even more hideous than 3-meo. Is it something you have to set a whole weekend aside for?

Duration is about 10 hours + there is some cognitive fogginess/afterglow which spills over to the day after. It's much more enjoyable than its 3-substituted cousin, though.

IME, that's the way to go. Monkey's right about the redosing too, it's tempting to start Friday evening, take some more Saturday, then devote Sunday to recovery. Don't try that right off the bat, of course.

I had an amazing experience with this and multiple substances. I had somewhere between 150-250 mgs dissolved in a shot glass I found but never used until the moment of rediscovery. I recently also got a free gram sample with some MXE so I decided to occasionally toss some in with it. Made for some amazingly weird but great wonky times. The come up was so strange.......

How many of you experience nausea and at what dosages? Would meclizine help? Or dimenhydrinate work? What doses for each then, i can get 25mg meclizine tablets and 20mg dimenhydrinate gum.

I haven't tried any disasociatives, i was thinking of starting with around 15mg, wait 45-60m, maybe do cut a 15mg line in half.

I just want a light experience to get a little feel for it. Are low doses nice for walking in nature?

Say you're at a botanical garden.

I really wanted to love this one. For the first 8-12 hours or so everything was perfect, if slightly underwhelming. My dosing schedule was something like 20mg - 50mg - 100mg - 200mg orally every two hours over six hours. I was really enjoying the effects profile. It reminded me a lot of DXM, but more clear-headed. Things were just starting to get interesting visually with open-eye geometric patterning when the effects started to fade.


A histamine itch had been building gradually throughout the experience (I've never gotten this with DXM or other dissociatives), then suddenly intensified when the primary effects began to subside. I took 50mg of benadryl and shortly after decided to head to bed, when I noticed a pretty severe restless legs feeling (I don't usually suffer from RLS). It got so bad that I had to get out of bed and decided to take 1mg of etizolam.


Even after the etizolam the restless feeling continued to intensify. It spread throughout my whole body. I was wiggling around so much that I couldn't follow the television. I took another 1mg of etizolam and poured a beer. In between large swigs of beer I was pacing the apartment, hopping around and shaking my arms and legs non-stop, on the verge of screaming with frustration. Finally, by the time I finished the beer I was sedated enough that sleep was possible.


After that experience I got rid of the rest of my gram, but lately I've been considering giving it another run. I'm wondering if taking benadryl beforehand would completely avoid the itchiness, but I've also read that antihistamines can trigger RLS symptoms. The itch I can deal with, but the RLS-all-over was completely unbearable. I'm thinking that I just need to give up on the stuff, but maybe someone else out there has some advice for me. Has anyone else experienced the same side effects and found a way to overcome them?

That restless-all-over feeling is precisely the feeling I get when I withdraw from opiates.  Horrible, horrible feeling.  I've always gotten RLS but the restless body is unbearable.

^I've used downers to improve the 4-MeO-PCP experience, never the other way around. However, if you're going for pedestrian doses, I think it would suit your purposes quite well. At least, in my experience, booze and GBL were always more interesting during the afterglow.


Actually, as a rule of thumb, GABAergics and NMDA antagonists play well together. YMMV, for instance, I seem to be the only one who thinks getting drunk on higher doses of MXE or DXM is a good idea. Or that combining anticholinergics with booze can be worthwhile....yeah, take everything I say with a grain of salt.

4-MeO-PCP and downers potentiate each other, right? Just wanted to ask and not do anything stupid.

I think I remember reading they do, but I'm not sure, so I figured I'd ask just to be on the safe side.

You should watch out when mixing 4-meo-pcp with downers. I did OD on heroin the day after a heavy 4-meo-pcp experience.

took a 20mg line of this on 100mg mxe and put a laser through my brain..

intense perfect perception, adrenaline and confidence, that turned into a too long, achey headache run in.. 

not sure if was just dehydrated..


ive gone through this stuff before but its been a while and dont remember it giving this much of a kick as it did


also i will never snort this again, unless i can make a solution. nor i.v. i.m. as it prob burns just as much but i do put just about everything in my butt


also last well into the next day 24 hours now.. afterglow and/or metabolites?


---


after another go and with tolerance its just an other dissociate and to me all act the same if you will it,

yes the profiles of these drugs vary from manic to sedating or lacking in creativity, spirituality and depth

but combined with the right things like daily vitamins it all stacks swell


my go to remains **methoxetamine **- the variations in mixtures and batches

make an already encompassing drug class, have an even deeper hole spectrum to pursue

So, this is my first post and it is about a technical point in question. I would hope that most of you would view any idea presented to you with some degree of skepticism, and especially any which may have a serious impact on your long term mental and physical health. What prompted me to register and post here today is the PCC question. This post is then about chemistry but is not intended to be instructive in terms of performing the chemistry. If you need said instruction, you probably have no business performing the reaction anyways.


With any chemical entity structure is everything and arriving at the correct structure is the art of chemistry, in a nutshell. With these compounds (PCP-like and ketamine-like substances) what we are looking at is a couple of ring structures bound together by carbon-carbon bonds. There is a rather famous reaction which is generally used to accomplish this and a type of compound called a nitrile is a way of accomplishing this. If you do look at the methods for creating these compounds, you will see that nitriles are employed for ketamine as well. While the other compound that the ketamine nitrile is bound to is different. At this point ketamine, MXE (which is effectively ketamine with a methoxy rather than a chlorine, which is in a different ring position than in ketamine, and an ethyl rather than a methyl group,) and the substituted PCP compounds (or the parent compound itself) are all rather similar. That is they are a substituted ring with a cyanide group. Now which ring has this nitrile group is different with the PCP compounds vs the ketamine-like ones, but this type of compound is there. It is this intermediate which is the problematic contaminate. Whether the nitrile from the ketamine-like substances is (as) toxic may or may not have ever been investigated. In chemistry there is a thing called Le Chatelier's principle which is basically a way of examining chemical equilibrium, ie when does the reaction stop? In this case anything less than 100% of the nitrile (PCC) reacting is a bad thing. To make sure that this happens, an excess of the other agent must be used.  This turns into a cost/profit issue for the lab making it in the 1st place. The other issue is that the reaction in question is highly sensitive towards water. This may also contribute to some issues. Now the rest of the reaction for PCP compounds vs ketamine compounds is different in a few aspects. There is a chance that some of the steps might convert the nitrile into something else that is more easily removed from the final product.  Without analysis though, that is conjecture.  Also the nitrile for the PCP compounds is formed from different compounds than what go into ketamine or MXE. At least used to, most of the ketamine was diverted from legitimate sources. Vs the "god knows who actually made this" factor associated with grey market compounds. In terms of toxicity, from the 76' Shulgin paper mentioned in the Big and Dandy 4-MEO-PCP thread, and available on Erowid, it sounds like a large amount of the negative effects traditionally attributed to PCP may have actually come from the PCC impurity. In the aforementioned research paper, it goes on to say that about 20% of the PCP analysed by govt forensic labs contained this impurity. Also, from the description of the side effects, it seems safe to say that there is more going on than just free cyanide being generated. Look at the descriptions of both if you don't believe me. In fact take Levar's advice and don't take my word for any of this. Do your own homework. 


A few years ago, I got to see a presentation of Dr. David Nichols. He was presenting on how structures at the 2,5 position on a phenethylamine predicted biological activity. I asked him how structure might also predict toxicity regarding the very substances in question. He said that structure alone would not elucidate this. After the presentation I asked him what would predict toxicity. He said that toxicity was a fairly unique effect, that a certain series of biochemical events had to be followed for it to occur and that only a systems approach could begin to reveal this. Think about how the 2 carbon and 3 carbon phenethylamines with 2,5 substitutions and a 4 substitution follow similar behavior, ie DOB and 2C-B are both potent psychedelics and most of the 2C-x's and DOx's following similar patterns with the DOx's being more potent gram:gram. Well then look at the fact that the NBOME substitution renders the DOx's inactive while the 2C-x's become much more potent. It seems odd from a structural standpoint, but that simply goes to show that structure really does dictate everything. Just look at how methamphetamine is a potent psychostimulant when that 3rd carbon tilts one way and a decongestant when it tilts the other way. 


In short, PCC is there because it is a common building block and it shows up in the final product because of sloppy chemistry. PCC's toxicity is no small matter, data suggests that you become more sensitive to it over time, and if it is a problem with the quantity of material consumed for an active dose of PCP-classic, it is absolutely a problem with the exponentially higher doses consumed with the substance in question. 


I hope that I have kept this on the informative side of things and haven't crossed any lines by making it seem instructive. I love dissociatives, but I also love my brain. After reading the majority of the 31 pages of the BD 4-MEO thread plus this one, I just felt like this was warranted.

It was the first RC disso available, sort of miss it now.

The nordic seller died in a famous way, do allergie test kids.

It was a time where I was a keta beginer, but keta was not available here in raves, only in Italy and UK.

The only dissos in rave here was N2O, ether was available, but not used, thanks cause it dont go well with fire and that bunch of pot smokers :D

They said later "keta killed the tekno scene", it may be true, I dunno.

Back to topic !


It was very long lasting, very anesthetic, sort of hole ..., very cold and clinical, almost unpleasant.

I took it 2 times, didn't finished the bag as it was so fare away from the pleasant ketamine.

So now that my main goal is managing disso craving without mania, I sort of miss it.

May be if I took it now I could like it, I dont know.

What I remember is that is was not safe at all : 

when I just imagine kids driving there cars 2h after taking 4meoPCP, it gives me shivers.

my 2cents
