[original post:]


I'd like to hear some experiences from those who have tried yopo (anadenanthera colubrina). I ran across it on Erowid, but there weren't very may experience reports there.

I read that it hurts when you snort it, and you're supposed to mix it with lime (basifying?) to get full effects if you do it that way.

**Insufflated:** 3 seeds toasted and pulverized; severe pain of the nasal mucous membrane; effects where nihl other than my body flushing my nose out with snot.


**Smoked:** 1-2 seeds yeiled a body-load high that made me feel like I was swimming at the bottom of a 10-foot pool -- very heavy and somewhat uncomfortable, and lasting 5-15 minutes; the volitile oils in the seeds make for a fowl-tasting smoke with a somewhat nutty flavor.


**Yopo-huasca:** Interesting, electrical bodyload -- feels like you're charged with static electricity; this with 7 seeds & 3tbsps of syrian rue, as well as 7g MHRB.

jaymie: Sounds very interesting, almost like my Salvia experiences where I experienced intense fear, three times, which was disturbing, especially since I had no rational explanation for the fear, as I realized what I first thought I was afraid of was not possible. I guess I should continue experimenting to attempt to figure this out.

Cool, I'm glad it helped you out. Yeah, yopo is definitely worth further exploration. That was the only time I'd taken it, but I hope to someday try it out again.

As far as i know, salvia works on the kappa-opiod recepter, and as far as I know, opiod receptors have to deal with endorfine, which is greatly involved in pain. So maybe you're hitting the center that translates pain into a fear to be able to do something about it, also pain (heavy pain, especially on long term) gets a psychedelic. (in my own experience, pain is a very good, but also possible dangerous psychedelic, for those interesting in other things then chemicals![:X](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/mad.gif) 


Maybe that can be an explanation for the experienced nonsense-fear?

This is an interesting idea, although I have never had "psychedelic pain". The closest experience I could relate to might be fever and deleriem, which I remember changed the perception of my room, as I lay sick in bed. I remember the room looked larger than I understood it to be.

I remember having fevers when I was younger where I talked to imaginary people.  It was exactly how people describe Beladonna/datura/Dimenhydrinate to be.  I have never attempted to ingest any of those substances(except for reccomened doses of dimenhydrinate, but I used it for it's intended use)  From reading the reorts on these substances, I am sure that I will never touch them!  

Sorry to change the subject from Yopo(which I do want to try) but the last post reminded me of this!

I bought some yopo almost a year ago. I toasted and pulverized it. After that I tried a little to explore what I bought. I mixed it with baking soda and took a couple of sniffs. I think it were 2 seeds. I had a mild trip, so the next time I will involve more seeds. 


I also smoked 1 or 2 seeds. I had an intenser feeling then the yopo insulflation, but also this wasn't that strong. 


These efforts were only to inaugurate and test to know what I bought and knowing where I was dealing with. I definitely going to try yopo in the future, but I will start low again and word my way up, because it is a long time ago when I tried it.  


 I know that limestone will be better then baking soda. But it would be nice if someone has more tips, would be a lot easier to do it, I hope. I said this, because I already explored that it is hard to ingest.

Heh, I always used to laugh about, uh 


"duuude these communion wafers will FUCK YOU UP if you eat enough of 'em"


Seems like this would be a hard substance not to take seriously.  Those stories of native folk smearing green visionary snot all over their faces as it drips out made an impression on me a while ago... there are people even more serious than I out there!

Dude, it`s a good thing to do for the people that use it spiritually, but I don`t think it`s really a "fun" drug.


I tried snorting it with and without the base, it hurts as hell, and clogs up your nose, which then starts to form all kind of nasty little balls of crushed yopo. I didn`t experience much except a light buzz. I tried smoking a little bit, it tasted bad, but not truly disgusting, didn`t do anything for me(were only 3 seeds though).


It felt like it might be a hardcore trip at higher dosages, but I don`t like maoi`s, and I didn`t like the effects at lower dosages. So I have about 30-40 seeds left, which I am not going to use at all. I might try ayahuasca in the near future, I`ll have to prepare myself for it first(mentally, I hate being hit harder than I expected, but sometimes it`s nice). Maybe I`ll try smoking a few seeds on the comedown of ayahuasca, and if that doesn`t work, I`ll mix in some salvia with that too. That way I`ll have tried a whole lot of sacred sacraments in one night. Although I don`t intend to use it entirely spiritually, I also don`t intend to use it recreationally. --More like an in between, expect nothing but sheer force kinda thing.

Its actually mostly NOT the seeds which are used I was led to understand... it is the seed pods. The seeds contain mostly Bufotenine and the pods contain DMT/5-meo-DMT and Bufo.


I have smoked seeds and it gave me bad pressure in my head and chest pains... which I think is fairly common with bufotenine. 


However my ex-partners mum and a friend came home one time drunk and mistook my bowl of toasted A.colubrina seeds for a bowl of pot (yes absolutely blotto drunk)... so they decided to get stuck in to it... 

The next morning the mother said "Id change dealers if I were you, we had five cones each of that stuff in your bowl and it didn't do anything!"


She didnt experience anything at all...

isn't 5-MeO-DMT the same as bufotenine?

I'm pretty sure about this in fact....

I think it's a snuff that contains 5-MEO-DMT and should be very painfully snorted or blown up the nose by someone else.


I'ld look into these which is similar but can be taken orally aswell due to beta-carbolines (MOAI) in it.

I dreamed I did yopo seeds once a few months back.... peeled off the outer shell from 5 seeds and then ground the stuff inside with a morter & pestle.


It's meant to be snorted I think but I smoked it. There was quite a bit of body load but the trip was very DMT-like, just a bit milder. It  lasted about 45 minutes... lots of closed-eye imagery, going through a strange luminous tunnel/maze thingy.... but not particularly insightful.


I still have some seeds left (imaginary, 'cos I don't really do drugs) so I might try 7 or 8 sometime.

hmm...if you just grind the stuff inside up, is that snortable as well as smokeable?


i've never snorted anything besides pepto-bismol

(some lame girls talked me into doing this...blah, it didn't do anything tho, experience was completely neutral in every way)


but i'd imagine snorting isn't too pleasant?

^ Hi Leg,


I've heard that snorting is quite painful, but I haven't tried it that way. I also recall reading that some people like to mix the ground-up seeds with a bit of baking soda (dunno the ratio) to improve absorbtion. Traditionally it was mixed with some kind of lime or shell for the same reasons.


Hee hee.... pepto-bismol. My first ever line was a big fat line of coffee creamer. I was informed that it was coke. Was not impressed with the effects and wondered why everyone was laughing at me!

**Nasty ingredients**


The main problem with yopo seeds is that they have an appreciable amount of bufotenine (5-hydroxyDMT), which is the metabolic precursor of 5-methoxyDMT in the plant. And the main problem with bufotenine is that it's not a psychedelic; it's actually more of a poison from the reports that I've read.


Unless you want to extract the alkaloids then separate the bufotenine from the 5-methoxyDMT, either smoking or shoving the ground seed up your nose, is going to put bufotenine into your body, and will make you ill.


For plant sources, you're better off with resin from Virola spp., or some of the Phalaris grass spp. (although some of the Phalaris grasses do contain bufotenine as well) as your natural source of 5-methoxyDMT, with a little bit plain ol' DMT alongside it (or other minor tryptamine alkaloids).

LOL neo1

sounds like straight outta that cheech & chong movie haha

(where that girl sniffs baking soda at the party, thinking it's coke)


hmm, that bufotenine thing sounds kinda nasty...

i'll have to do some more research, i guess


is it dangerous?

or just...make you "ill" ?

i dunno what you really mean by that


i just took a low dose of morning glory seeds today

and i felt "ill" basically

but it was a good kind of ill

if that makes any sense

very relaxing...like...it forced me to be relaxed, if that makes any sense

like...an amplification of normal life

(i guess that's what psychedelics kinda are, anyhow, maybe...but i'm getting way offtopic, sorry)

Or is it?  I don't take a position, as I have no idea either one.  I've read all the negativity surrounding bufotenine as well.  Then J. Ott did this research with bufotenine...

Great read.  No reason to assume this research is not valid.  I will point out that Ott also claimed 5-MeO-DMT was orally active at 35mg.  I know many who have tried to duplicate his findings, and found it inactive orally.

**4 and 5 hydroxytryptamines**


All the tryptamine derivitives with a hydroxy group in the 5 position are capable of mimicing serotonin in the peripheral nervous system, that's why bufotenine is more of a poison than 5-methoxyDMT. As such, you end up with temp. blood pressure and gut problems. It most probably does have psychoactive effects, but at that dose, it's most probably a hideous body load.

4-Hydroxy DMT (psilocin) doesn't fit the peripheral receptors, so you don't get the poisoned feeling.

I read the article you posted a link for, and I can see something that makes me slightly uneasy with the thouroughness of Ott's methods. He states that the main alkalois of yopo seeds is bufotenine, but every other article I've looked at cites 5-methoxy DMT as the main alkaloid, so that any extract made would be predominantly 5-methoxyDMT, with some bufotenine. Had there been a stage of chromatographic separation of the alkaloids, I'd have been much more believing of the results, as his tests appear to be with the combined alkaloid extract (he allows solvent to evaporate, so it's not a true fractional recrystallization, so no guarentee of purity) I don't think it's anything like proof that bufotenine is the hallucinogen under test.

Hi FastandBulbous,


Yeah I recently read that article too, but noted this bit:


> Identity and purity of isolated bufotenine were verified by mass-spectral analysis and thin-layer chromatographic comparison with an authentic sample in several solvent systems.

So maybe it was bufotenine, if he'd verified it by spectral analysis?


However, I have also read elsewhere that 5-meo-DMT is the predominant componant in yopo. Maybe Ott lives in a different universe!

I got a chance to try this last night as it goes. One of my friends' Dads had ordered some of the seeds from an online vendor and prepared a snuff using edible lime powder. I checked the vendor's site today, and they sell two different types of seeds, one containing predominantly n-n-DMT along with 5-MeO-DMT and Bufotenine and the other containing mostly 5-MeO-DMT but also n-n-DMT and Bufotenine. I'm not sure which one I had; I'm thinking possibly the one with mostly 5-MeO-DMT as I didn't get any visuals. Then again I only tried a low dose, a small pinch up each nostril. 


It wasn't as painful as I expected, no worse than anything else I've snorted. But of course this was just small pinches compared to lines with the other stuff, so I'm sure a higher dose of Yopo could hurt quite considerably.


As for the effects; I came up within about 10 minutes and felt the distinctive tryptamine warmth throughout the body. It reminded me of a low dose of mushrooms, but with the clear-headedness of LSAs. The effects continued for about 30-45 minutes but I could still feel the "tail" of the trip after 1 hour.


Although obviously quite a low dose, I could see the potential for some interesting experiences, and I'd be very interested in exploring this preparation further if/when I get the chance.


I could post this as a trip report if anyone thinks it's worth it... There wasn't really a great deal to tell with it being such a low dose, so I'd probably struggle to expand on what I've already written.

**A bit different**


Neo1 


All that really says is that when it was run through a mass spectrometer, there was a peak at the same place as one fron a pure bufotenine sample, and that there was a spot on the chromatograph in the same place that bufotenine would produce a spot. So all it's confirming is that there was bufotenine in the sample. You notice that there's nothing about a quantitive assay on the plant extract (wonder why?). Possibly because bufotenine wouldn't come out as the major component.


Also, to paraphrase Jim Royle (The Royle Family - BBC Sitcom);


5-MethoxyDMT orally active at 25mg, my arse

i suppose it is similar to what would be snorting grounded coffee

This whole thing about weather 5-MeO-DMT is active or not orally without MAOI...


Well, i'm sure lots of us have a good amount (just a gram can be a lifetime supply, well if your not using it all the time i guess), I don't see why we just don't try it ourselves, and eat 35mg or so.  If it doesn't do anything maybe eat 50mg.


Also, depending on what we've eaten, there are many things that could possibly "tie up" some of the MAO, like, taking some amphetamine for example.  


Lots of things are very slight MAO inhibitors.  I would think if someone was sitting on a mound of DMT enough to last ...well, i'll just say, a lot of DMT to play with.  All i've read is its not active up to 1g orally.  But, if its getting eaten up by MAO, then, i suppose DMT is a slight MAO inhibitor also, just because it would be tieing up the MAO's somewhat, so if you ate like 10 grams...maybe it would work, i mean i'd think SOME certain big dose of DMT would eventually start to saturate the MAO enzymes. 


Hell maybe i'll eat 40mg 5-meo-dmt myself soon just to see what happens ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**Eat it**


I think what yaesutom is intending is to saturate all the gut MAO so that some can sneak past and actually get into the bloodstream. In that sense, swallowing 10g might (and this is only theoretical) produce plasma levels comparable to those produced by taking an average dose with a MAOI.


It may work, but it's bloody wasteful (unless you live in the amazon basin).


Amphetamine and the like might help, but as it can only achieve a fraction of the inhibition of harmaline at comparable concentrations, I don't think it would be much help

to snort yopo you are supposed to mix it with calcium hydroxide in order for it to be efficiently absorbed through the mucous membrane (i think), i have got some of the seeds but i broke them up with the outer shell on (too stoned to realise maybe taking their outer case would make it easier), been meaning to try them; however, the amazonian snorting technique looks pretty painful, some of them pass out afterwards.

**Anandathaera Columbrina AKA Yopo**


I have a few queries regarding Yopo, the tropical hallucinogenic snuff.


I'm getting 200 viable seeds, I am going to grow some, and smoke some, try the traditional insufflation with burnt lime, and try extracting the alkaloids within the seeds to be insufflated and smoked, although I am wary of the effects of bufotenine, said to be at a high content in these seeds.


They contain quite a large amount of bufotenine, and 5-MeO-DMT, with a slightly smaller amount of DMT itself.


Has anyone had much experience with Yopo? what about a sort of Yopohuasca with MAOI's such as harmine/harmaline, or moboclemide.


How sensitive is bufotenine to extraction? what about solubilities in various solvents for bofotenine/DMT/5-MeO-DMT? as I could perhaps seperate the three and try them seperately, 3 drugs for the prive of one so to speak :D

I've tried smoking it and snorthing the snuff.

However I can't seem to get significant effects from smoking it and the smoke is quite harsh on the lungs. The most I get is a few headspins and a similar body load as the snuff but more mild and more short lived.

The snuff however feels a lot more effective and although quite painful to snort the effects are far more desirable. I feel a sense of relaxation and sort of like an electrical charge throughout my body. I become quite euphoric and begin experiencing altered thought patterns and mild hallucinations, such as change in depth perception and colours becoming brighter and changing into other colours, such as black to blue and grey concrete to purple. 

I have yet to try an extraction or orally but the snuff is quite enjoyable, however the pain is somewhat discouraging.


When I try it I usually smoke 2 seeds (if im going to smoke it ) or i'll snort 4 seeds after I've heated them to pop, grinded them and mixed them into a snuff. However 4 seeds is quite hard to do, often feel short at the 2 seeds mark as my eyes and nose were so wet it was almost impossible to tell what I was doing without that searing pain... YUCK!


Oh well, its quite an enjoyable experience, mild but enjoyable, the body load feels fairly strong and almost toxic, depth perception and seeing things like a river forming in a concrete path seem like the most common types of visuals. Anyway, hope I helped

> Coarse-ground powder of 125g of seeds of A. colubrina var. Cebil was stirred twice for eight hours in 500 ml of 96% ethanol 1% tartaric acid, the combined filtrates concentrated to 150 ml and diluted with 200 ml water in a separatory-funnel, causing precipitation of considerable fat. The pH was adjusted to 3-4 with concentrated hydrochloric acid, and the solution defatted by shaking six times with chloroform, which was set aside. The defatted extract was basified to pH 8-9 with ammonium hydroxide, then again extracted eight times with 200 ml chloroform; the combined chloroform extracts were concentrated to a foamy, yellowish oil that dissolved completely in 50 ml hot ethyl acetate, then concentrated to 15 ml and refrigerated overnight. In the morning there were a brace of minuscule rosettes of dark-brownish crystals growing at the base of the flask, which was alternated between periods under refrigeration and standing unstoppered at room temperature during 48 hours, leading to the formation of large masses (some greater than 1cm) of dark-brownish, prismatic crystals. The mother-liquor was decanted and the crystalline mass rinsed with cold ethyl acetate dried over magnesium sulfate, then dried under reduced pressure to yield 4.1 g of large, free-flowing, sparkling brownish crystals. These were twice recrystallized from dry ethyl acetate, yielding 3.87 g of off-white bufotenine free-base crystals (3. 10%), m.p. 125-126° C. Despite loss of chromophores on recrystallizations, the melting point remained 124-126°. Six reports of isolated bufotenine free-base, from Amanita citrina (Schaef.) Gray (Agaricaceae) (Wieland & Motzel 1953) and Anadenanthera species (Rendón 1984; lacobucci & Rdveda 1964; Pachter, Zacharias & Ribeiro 1959; Alvares Pereira 1957; Stromberg 1954-yields reported were from 0.94-7.4% for A. peregrina to 0.5-2.1 % for A. colubrina), disclosed two crystalline isoforms from ethyl acetate, one melting from [123-]124-126[-129]° C, the other 146-147[-150]° C. Two reports of synthetic material disclosed a third isoform, with melting points of 138-140° C (Stoll et al. 1955); and again 146-147° C (Speeter & Anthony 1954). In all cases involving the lower-melting-point isoforms, repeated purification did not alter the melting point, although Iacobucci and Rdveda (1964), upon seeding a recrystallization-solution of their lower melting point isoform (123-124° C) with crystals having m.p. 146-147° C, got only crystals of the latter type, which operation was not reversible. By manipulating conditions of recrystallization from ethyl acetate, I was able to generate crystals melting at 145-147° C, and confirmed Iacobucci and RtIveda's observation. DMT free-base from hexane likewise exists as at least three isoforms, melting points from 44-74° C having been reported, and Fish, Johnson and Horning (1956) replicated the irreversible transformation of a lower-melting-point isoform (47-49° C) into a higher-melting-point isoform (71-73° C). Identity and purity of isolated bufotenine were verified by mass-spectral analysis and thin-layer chromatographic comparison with an authentic sample in several solvent systems.

hehe i know where those came from...


There's a few common preps online for yopo seeds.


It's mostly jusr heating up a frying pan and heating the beans until the pop open.


Then you take them off, let em cool off and grind up the inner seed part, mix it with about 20% baking soda and snort it.


If you do a search you can find better methods, that was just an overveiw or something.

Depending on their content, these seeds are probably not orally active without a MAO inhibitor.  I've read various texts that suggest DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, and bufotenine (in varying concentrations and ratios depending on source) are present.  DMT has no oral activity, and the oral activity of 5-MeO-DMT and bufotenine remain suspect.  One could us an MAOI to "activate" the oral activity of these molecules, but 5-MeO-DMT has been known to have toxic side-effects when consumed orally with MAOIs, and the pharmacology of bufotenine in conjunction with MAOIs is a big mystery.  I would do a lot of research before attempting such a venture.

^^^ I'd be very afraid to mix Yopo with a MAOi. It seems like most sources agree that at least it is higher on 5-MeO-DMT and Bufotenin than DMT, both of which sound like they'd be uncomfortable with a MAOi.


I would recommend you grind the seeds, make a water extraction, and inject that rectally with a needle-less syringe. At least thats what I will do when I have access to Yopo.

Use alcohol to extract the alkaloids, then evaporate off the alcohol to put the alkaloids on some smoking material. That way you'll get the short sharp shock that is DMT/5-methoxyDMT


As for how much, work on the amounts others have suggested

I have some yopo plants growing here at home, very interesting species! The leaves close up at night and open in the morning ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


iv'e been using yopo for quite some time now and find the best method to be the following:


use the seeds (not the beans) though the beans will work, they are less potent.


put the seeds on a cookie sheet and put them in the oven on low. The pods will pop open. once they have all popped (it sounds really neat when they do!) peel the remaining shells off, you should now have some brownish/yellow seeds with no shiny shell to them. Grind them up using a mortar and pestal if you have one. if not, a screwdriver handle and a bowl will work, it just takes a long time. you should now have a finely crushed brown powder ready to be smoked.


here's the kicker, you HAVE to use either a torch lighter or a propane torch ! Since yopo burns at a high temperature , you need as hot a source of flame as possible. i wasted a whole bag of seeds using a bic lighter , it just doesn't work at all without the extra heat. 


If you have a water pipe or even better, a very large bong, use it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) trust me , your lungs will thank you later!!! 


take as long and slow tokes as you can and hold it in for at least 10 seconds, but aim for 30.


If you can get some marijuana, use it as a freebase underneath the yopo powder. I had INCREDIBLE results using this very method. Beings actaully appeared out of the walls and talked to me. The craziest part is that it actually was real at the moment, but very relaxing and intense at the same time. Other times i would feel incredibly heay and everything was very detailed and vibrant. time seems to slow on yopo trips, it feels similar in many ways to smoking dmt crystals, but MUCH MUCH less intense.


i don't know why there are posts about feeling poisened. i have smoked it over 50 times and feel great after half an hour. Maybe burning it at a higher temperature and filtering the smoke through a large amount of water gets rid of alot of the unwanted substances.


I would definatly use yopo over Salvia any day, at the Salvia i have smoked.


Just remember that a Yopo trip can become extremely intense sometimes, you should always have someone with you. If you have a bad trip, remind yourself that you will be back to ground zero in less than 30 minutes. The intense part of the trip seems to last only 10 minutes at most for me.


I think i may just have some good seeds, i'll have to see what these plants produce once they mature. They grow VERY slowly. about 3 inches in 6 months.


Iv'e snorted the powder before as well with no effects at all except the horrible pain in my nose. What i have heard is that if you can aquire some limestone and mix it with the yopo powder, the world will dissapear for half an hour and you can have a very spiritual experience. The natives would use quite large amounts though, enough to completly fill your nasal cavity. i think i will stick to smoking the seeds.


anyone else tryed the same smoking method descibed above?

i'm curious to see if others have had the same sort of experience.

i know all my friends did! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

As a manner of fact, funny you should ask that, because I have, I planted them just yesterday, I boiled some water, and poured it on the pots of soil, I am using pot-noodle pots as I don't wish to spend anything buying plant pots at the moment, they work well with drainage holes poked in the sides at the bottom.


I germinated them, by shaving a little of the brown side coat off to expose the seeds to water, then soaked them in preboiled water, for about 6 hours, then, the seed coats mostly shed of their own accord, once placed in kitchen roll kept sodden with preboiled water.


The reason I preboiled all the water, is I have read that Anadenanthaera seeds are somewhat susceptible to mold, so I took some precautionary methods, the seeds germinated after one day of being kept wet in the paper, and gained perhaps a 3/4cm shoot, so have been planted in a mixture of compost and ordinary garden soil to help retain water when added.


After two days from germination, I now have 5 plants, with 1.5cm shoots poking up from the soil, as they were planted very shallowly.


Now...well, I guess I am winging it really, I don't have a clue how to care for them at the moment, the book "growing the hallucinogens" came up a blank, so I am researching the subject online.

1st time insuflated I saw something that looked like a person when I closed my eyes! the dress it was wearing was gorgous, It was standing in front of my eyelids in hyper crisp reality, it seemed like a perfect bend between an angel and a demon, but it seemed to have technological/futuristic or magic qualities. The intense burning of the nose brought me back down to earth pretty quick and the set was pretty dumb(some on was playing half life two in an other room on full volume on a stereo) so after a bit the sounds of the game brought me back.

another time i did it in a park and leter got into a van with others non tripping, well this one girl who was on a suicide tuesday from rolling was going on and on about her past two days, pretty boring for everyone else, And I began to see fire demons playing around in front of my closed eyes. Another time I took some in a quiet dark room, sitting thinking about childbirth and genetics for some reason and for a moment I thought there where 4 or 5 small figures running by my bed side, well, they dissapeared. I thought they looked like elves with big heads.

I then did a small bit later in the day time on a long lunch break from work, Did not notice anything except it left a lasting energy and smell/taste that I am not sure has left me yet.

I quite regularly use yopo in lower doses, as a stimulant, using the seed, with 1/3 Ca(OH)2, insufflated, as a stimulant, my seeds seem to be really potent, as maybe 1/3 of a seed roughly, is enough to give a strong body-buzz and electric sensations down the spine, legs and body.


I have to be in court tomorrow, early, have a damn good guess at what will be keeping me awake tonight![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

How was it?  Energetic rush?  Was there a lot of mental activity (different thoughts) or were you just focused?  What was the onset like?  Do you think this could be a useful tool at higher dose?

i doubt you have yopo, most seeds sold as Anadenanthera peregrina are actually A. columbria. unless you collected them yourself from a mature tree thats probably what you have.


you dont need an maoi unless orally ingesting it as the pathways it takes in your body are different.

the rush was definitely on the 5-meo tip,psycologically speaking I remained an earthling but definite clor enhancement,tracers and the usual sally weirdness.I only used 1 and a half of the seed and a modest amount of leaf so I will definitely double that tomorrow night and maybe use it a moment or two after sniffing 1 seed but the potential useage as a tool is w/out a doubt worth exploration...I recommend it! No signs of toxicity or side effects either![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

**world tree**


ive been working with a shaman in bolivia with the vilca snuff for a number of years now. and i have done alot of research includeing a good conversation with Ott on the subject and manuel Torres.

its really not the DMT thats nasaly active because it isnt. 5meodmt is but nndmt isnt.when you smoke the seeds you dont get much from them, its the same as snuffing them with out any limes staone paste you get a head rush and it hurts and thats about it. besides a mild stoneing effect. when mixed with the lime stone paste they sell at asian markets for betel chews and cooking. its mind blowing when you snuff it. the closest thing that it could be compaired to is free baseing nndmt. its unreal how powerfull it is. and its really the bufotine that is effecting you not the dmt or the 5meodmt its the bufotine. so says Ott.

a typical method which has been passed around the internet which i came up with is mixing a pea sized amount of lime stone paste to 4 toasted seeds which have been ground to a very fine powder. and snuff. it helps to shuck the seeds of thier shells before you pullverize them. yopo as most call it or vilca as we call it in bolivia is alot like a short 2 hour ayahuasca session just very fast with all the wonderfull side effects and visions rushed into a 2 to 1 1/2 hours. you can get alot of work done in a short time. 

unless your prety dedicated to a shamanic practice i wouldnt recomend yopo actualy. it will kick your ass and i mean hard. ive seen people completely loose thier minds on this stuff on a regular basis fighting for control and trying to deal with the pain of insulflation. 

the lime stone is essential it makes the alkaliods absorbable in the mucous membrane. some people do have some ucces doing this sublingualy with some bakeing soda or lime stone. but i dont think its worth it.

once you have seen what you can see with snuffing it with lime stone its hard to evn hold the experince up t anything else. its hard core, very primal. but visulay some of the most amazing tings ive ever seen. spirits come and work with you you can see them as soon as it kicks in. pretty wonderfull medicine.

good info,i've gone the snuff route minus the lime(I read in Staffords writing as well that it wasn't necessary to make the alkoloids active,but you can't believe everything you read)and it was no doubt on the same page as free base 5-MEO in intensity just longer lasting for me at least.The rush I experienced last night was no placebo or misunderstood salvia experience,it was clearly active to a degree,not like the snuff but FAR less painful.So the n,n dmt in the seeds are inactive with either method of ingestion?Will an MAOI help push things along?

A well respected friend with a talent for removing DMT from mimosa bark has used DMT with success as a snuff.  I don't think it is accurate to say DMT is not active via insufflation.

it is active nasally, but there is not enough in a few seeds to be really felt

Yeah...its the bufotenin for sure. There is too little of anything else in any Anadenathera seeds to be active in any of the snuffs. That's been proven many times in recent years. Its an old myth that the effects are from DMT or 5-MeO-DMT. They just don't contain enough of them to have any effects.


I know that free base bufotenin is VERY NICE, similar to DMT when used as a snuff or sublingually. However, I've found calcium bufotenate to be better. This is what's in the snuff, NOT free base bufotenin. It checked it out. Because bufotenin is a weak acid, when you mix bufotenin with water and a strong base like calcium oxide or calcium hydroxide, it can only form a calcium salt, NOT a free base compound! He's supposed to be a chemist. He should know that. Ott missed the boat and studied the wrong thing! Free base bufotenin isn't in any snuff!![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) I hope Ott tries calcium bufotenate and does a report on it. I'd like to see his reaction.![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) He'll be AMAZED.![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) Pure calcium bufotenate is absolutely awesome...much better than DMT.![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

**Yopo!**


So I made an order from an enthobotanical site the other day.  I have 26 grams of yopo seeds coming.   I've always been interested in Yopo seeds and they sound intriguing.  I read about the snuff mixture which requires edible lime, baking soda and a dab of water.  The problem is that I took that to be optional, only for taste and comfort.  After reading some more, it turns out that it is needed in order for your body to properly take in the DMT.  


So I guess my questions are:


1.)  Is it really absolutely necessary to have edible lime/baking soda?

2.)  If it is necessary,  what store would carry such a thing as edible lime?

3.)  If it's hard to find, what else might I be able to substitute, in order for it to get properly absorbed?

4.)  Aside from an extraction is there any other way to administer yopo seeds?


Comments and input from anyone who has experimented with Yopo seeds is greatly appreciated.

It is probably necessary to use the edible lime. You can get it at chinese food stores or online. You can smoke the yopo seeds I've done it before. You have to do a bunch in a bong. mildly interesting effects and weird headache. You may be able to eat an MAOI and then eat the yopo seeds to make some crazy yopohuasca thing. Keep in mind they call the snuff the claws of the jaguar for a reason! I believe snorting that stuff burns like fucking hell. Good luck!

haha thank you.  So it is pretty hard to smoke then, eh?   And yes, I am expecting some serious claws in my nose.  Should be interesting, I don't know what I am going to do with all these seeds....


What the hell is edible lime used for anyhow?  Why is it called lime?  I assume that an actual lime would be useless in this situation?

Im assuming i wont get in trouble for linking you to this because edible lime isn't a drug.

 All i know is that it is sold at the chinese food market down the street and I figure its used in cooking.

The traditional preperation (sans toasted shells of course) is the best method I have tried. DONT smoke the seeds, unless you enjoy struggling to breathe. Dont expect an experience along the lines of 5-meo-dmt or n,n dmt. The effects have a definite tryptamine feel, but the side effects are the most pronounced I have ever felt from a drug. I found no difference in the effects of A. columbrina or A. perigrina.

Dont get taken in by the calcium bufotenate shit either...


I believe the lime is used to increase bioavailability through mucus membranes.

Edible lime is about all just Ca(OH)2, calcium hydroxide.  So you could get reagent grade calcium hydroxide for not much more.  I believe I payed like 12-15$ for 500g.  I believe edible lime is used for pickling and is some times called pickling lime.


Also, i tried to do a calcium bufotenate extraction following this procedure.  [http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=64707](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=64707)  I wasn't left with a pure extract but it definitely had a distinct tryptamine smell to it.  Ott said something like 8mgs of bufotenin was fully active smoked.  I somed upwards of 20mgs with very minimal effects.


If I were to do it again, I would do an extraction more similar an Acacia extraction, with defats and a freeze precipitation.  I doubt I will though, considering how easy a mimosa extraction is.  The really tempting thing about yopo and cebil seeds is the high concentration of bufotenin, but it's very variable depending on source it seems.

I would be careful with bufotenine and its extracts as my impression from reading the experience reports in TIHKAL is that it's somewhat toxic.


That said, I have no personal experience with it, so carry on fellow astronauts...

Here is shuglin speaking in reference to the source of the experience reports a little further down the commentary on bufotenin.


"Here were a collection of 14 schizophrenic patients, experimental cattle is the analogy that comes to mind, into which the researching physicians injected their drug. Listen to the account of one lady, following a rapid intravenous injection of bufotenine. "There was intense salivation. She could easily have drowned in her own saliva, and she had to be turned on her side. The pulse rate rose slightly during the period extending from the end of the injection until some 10 minutes later, but without much change in blood pressure. Responsiveness returned in about 23 minutes, at which time the patient was entirely lucid and, in response to a query related to a preinjection suggestion, spoke of a long repressed memory from the age of three years, when she came into the bathroom and saw her mother dying of a uterine hemorrhage. This was told without affect and had no therapeutic consequences." HOLY COW! A schizophrenic victim volunteers a long-repressed memory of her mother's traumatic death. And with the state of the healing art in the mental hospitals of that time, two physicians effectively ignore what today would be considered a dramatic break-through in therapy. Another of their trials was acknowledged as being nearly fatal, requiring artificial respiration as intervention. This is research in the healing art of medicine?"

bufotenine is not really that active... Yopo its self is a disgusting thing if you do it Via IM methods... I had some about a year ago and let me tell you, it was like sticking baking soda and peanut butter up my nose with a bunch of Daves insanity hot sauce so that i could see like the threshold patterns from a DMT trip... Id stick to extraction of mimosa and aya if i want to experience DMT or DMT analogs... i mean seriously... even smoking bufo toad puss is a lot better, and i find that activity repulsive.  I guess the one good thing about Yopo was that i could get to sleep instantly when it wore off... but then i can do that with DMT and 5-meo...  Soooooo.......

calcium carbonate = limestone, also in eggshells

calcium hydroxide = hydrated lime (pickling lime)

calcium sulphate = gypsum

**Yopo?**


i have wanted to try a different form of DMT besides Aya for awhile now, I am unable to get DMT from any of my psychedelic friends and i am too lazy to really search for a good RC vendor online. i know of an herbal site though were i can get yopo. i have bought other stuff from the company before and they shipped hellafast (considering it came from A-dam) i trust and appreciate doin business with them so i dunno how much i wanna try and find a website that may or maynot be legit and besides from what i have been able to find, yopo is much cheaper ( i realize it wont last like pure DMT, or 5 meo dmt would be but i am only lookin for one use or so)


So my question to the BL'ers out there is: what are your thoughts on yopo?

is it nice like pure DMT or 5meoDMT ?(obviously it isnt going to be as good as the pure shit) but would a comparison of oxycodone to pod tea be apt? ( i realize oxycodone comes from thebaine and not morphine or codiene so please dont tell me my analogy cant be correct) 


so what does everyone think about Yopo? waste of money or nice enjoyable natural trip?

Its psychedelic, but its not exactly enjoyable. 5-ho-dmt is the main active constutient in yopo as well as cohoba. I did a bunch of trials with both A. columbrina and A. perigrina and found very little difference effects wise. The biggest issue is the indescribable pain upon insullation of the snuff, and then there is also the inevitable purge that accompanies both, and finally the very heavy body load. There still worth trying though, but not in a fun sense...

It's not worth the amount of limestone, salty popcorn sented powder you have to sniff. Its not just a couple lines. Try twenty, and it stings worse than anything else, like ten times as bad as e. The trip made me vomit and my whole vision went blood red. I passed out, then woke up disappointed. Do yourself a favor and just get DMT, or just pass the whole idea.

**That Old Time Religion**


I've been studying the effects of *Anadenanthera colubrina*, in both smoke & snuff form, on & off over a span of 3 years. At first, the idea of introducing all that chemical vegetation into the narines of the explorer was not  very appealing & the specimen was shelved. Until, reading through the Anadenanthera chapter in A. Hofmann & R. E. Schultes' "Plants of the Gods" , where it is stated that the Mashco (doesn't sound right, but something similar) of Argentina smoke the toasted seeds. Enter the shabang. A bed of ash. Some seeds (4) toasted, popped & crushed up. The toking is easy enough but the heavy charge felt in the gut & thighs can be unpleasant. This is where the practitioner should keep on toking - certainly not stop because of feeling weird - until those 3 or 4 seeds have gone. At the 8 minute mark - a constant - & with eyes closed, the visions will begin. Out of the nothingness under observation will arise a tentacular, lashing stream of psychedelia, which will undergo dominant colour changes as it intensifies. Although it can get quite wild, it can be quelled by a simple opening of the eyes (not recommended). Sticking with these "in the face" visions will pay off. After 40 or 50 minutes the things (Hekula spirits? Their messengers?) which have been coming at you will retreat & slow down. Follow them & there will be vast caverns where encounters are likely to take place. A non hostile but giant stick insect has been reported, as have shadowy, elven creatures (tall ones). After 70 to 80 minutes the whole thing goes gray & fades out.

The snuff thing was finally examined & discarded due to the prevailing nausea that wasn't overly appreciated in the lab.

If the effects  roughly described above are caused by Bufotenine - & I suspect that is so - then it's fine & dandy with me. Smoked yopo is a rewarding experience & one that a searcher can oft return to. Its influence may reach into one's dreaming.....

I would never even think of testing other chemicals along with these seeds : that is just plain asking for it... & I shall say no more.    ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

That looks like an extremely pain full experience. One guy took it though and it blew all up his face and eye haha

Yes yopo does work.

Pretty intensly,Ive tried it on many occasions straight and half tanked on grog ive had 2 1 gram lines up each nostril and it only takes 5 minutes for the nauesia and bad body feelings to kick in and make me puke,more so when drinking grog ,not so bad on an empty stomache.

It does make you feel really shit nauesaious and puke but the end results are great,only had CEV of red Patterns.

An old lady that sits to the right of me making sure all is o.k.,got told she is my totem.Use some relaxing music to add to the efects makes a big diff.%)

Yopo/cebil is best extracted and smoked imo. Great visuals, but not a lot of content and occasionally a heavy bodyload. I hear it's deeper when insufflated, but that sounds painful and unpleasant

Heat 5 beans till it pops. Then shell, continue heating untill bean is dry and brittle. Then crush and grind. Add equal part baking soda a little water and mix into a paste. Keep mixing for 5 min. Then back to the heat. It will fluff a little just knock it down and stir a little. Continue in low heat till past is dry and you can pulverize it again. Divide into 5 rows. I used 1/5th of the mix in suffocated. 6 min in and I'm feeling it, burns like hell but was a good ride. I must have Shaman blood. Because I just did a little research and all the answers were given to me. No pain no gain. From procurement to trip 1 week and 20 bucks. Well worth it.

I gotta say if you like bufotenin, smoking the extract-enhanced leaf never hurt at all.
