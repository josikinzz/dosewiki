5-MeO-EiPT is a tryptamine drug that appears to have psychedelic effects. Little is known about the substance, there are nearly no experience reports for it, and the drug hasn’t really been studied.

From what is known about the drug, it may have lighter mental effects than other psychedelics. It has been made illegal in Japan and it was detected in at least one “designer drug” product in Japan in the late 2000s.

Given the lack of information about 5-MeO-EiPT, it should be taken infrequently, at the lowest possible dose, and without combinations.

5-MeO-EiPT, also known as 5-methoxy-N-ethyl-N-isopropyltryptamine, is a psychedelic drug of the tryptamine family which has been sold online as a designer drug.

## Use and effects

5-MeO-EiPT was not included or mentioned in Alexander Shulgin's book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved). When subsequently asked about 5-MeO-EiPT, Shulgin said that he never got around to making or exploring it and that its dose, duration, and effects were unknown. In any case, 5-MeO-EiPT has been used as a novel recreational designer drug.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

5-MeO-EiPT acts as a potent full agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. It also shows high affinity for the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor and interacts very weakly with the serotonin transporter (SERT). The drug produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents. However, it produces a rather weak head-twitch response, suggesting that it might have reduced hallucinogenic effects relative to other psychedelic tryptamines or might be non-hallucinogenic. The serotonin 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 augmented the head-twitch response induced by 5-MeO-EiPT in rodents. The drug also produces hypothermia and hypolocomotion in rodents.

## Chemistry

### Analogues

Analogues of 5-MeO-EiPT include ethylisopropyltryptamine (EiPT), 4-HO-EiPT (eiprocin), 5-MeO-DMT, 5-MeO-DET, 5-MeO-DPT, 5-MeO-DiPT, 5-MeO-DALT, 5-MeO-MET, 5-MeO-MPT, 5-MeO-MiPT, 5-MeO-EPT, 5-MeO-PiPT, and 5-MeO-iPALT (ASR-3001), among others.

## History

5-MeO-EiPT was first described by Alexander Shulgin by 2002.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

5-MeO-EiPT is illegal in Japan.
5-MeO-EiPT is illegal in Italy.
Sweden's public health agency suggested classifying 5-MeO-EiPT as a hazardous substance, on May 15, 2019.
